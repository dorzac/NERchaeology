ABSTRACT

The Goodin site (41GM410) is located within the proposed Twin Oaks Landfill site in
Grimes County, Texas and is a mid-1800s log cabin site that will be destroyed when
landfill construction begins. The site was determined to be potentially eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and excavation was the only way to
mitigate the loss of this unique pre-Civil War farmstead. The property was owned by
Warren Goodin from 1848 to 1877. The one-room log cabin had a serpentine-shaped
stone walkway that led to the stone door stoop. The base to a stone chimney surrounded a
poorly preserved hearth surface and rock fall indicated that the chimney might have been
six to eight feet tall. The sheet midden surrounding the cabin covered an estimated 1080
square meters based on the artifacts from the sixty six 50 cm square units used to define
the scatter limits. The midden was barely 20 cm thick in most areas and had been
disturbed by rodents and other animals. A major trash accumulation was found just
southwest of the house and covered an area of approximately twenty square meters. After
excavation ceased, areas surrounding the house were mechanically stripped to bedrock or
to subsoil but the only feature found was a pile of rocks. Artifacts from excavation
included a large number of square-cut nails, a few wire nails, a side of the swell from a
pistol powder flask, a Union general service uniform button, a broken French chert
gunflint from a pistol, blue transferware, and blue feather-edge plate rims. The artifact
assemblage indicates primary occupation of the site in the 1850s and this coincides with
Goodin’s ownership of the property. A small sample of the artifacts indicates that the site
area may have been visited in the late 1800s but no major occupation is occurred. The
Goodin site is a significant farmstead which is the oldest excavated historic log cabin site
in Grimes County and it represents a rural farmstead at which the residents were largely
self sufficient and led a Spartan life which is characteristic for yeoman farmers in the
lower Navasota River valley.

INTRODUCTION
The Goodin site (41GM410) was recorded in 2002 during the course of an archaeological
survey of the proposed Twin Oaks Landfill site (Skinner and Plumb 2002) which is
located in west central Grimes County, Texas. The landfill site is included in a 609-acre
tract that is owned by the Brazos Valley Solid Waste Management Agency (BVSWMA)
of College Station, Texas. BVSWMA is a joint venture of the cities of College Station
and Bryan and as such is a public entity. The landfill site is located in the uplands
approximately 1.9 miles [3.1 km] east of the State Highway 30 [SH 30] crossing of the
Navasota River.
Site 41GM410 is an historic residential site that was first recognized as an attractive
setting on a knoll overlooking Alum Creek where it was expected a prehistoric site would
be found. An untraveled dirt road and a rusted out 1956 Pontiac station wagon body were
on the west side of the knoll. No clear evidence of house foundation stones was noted and
only a few undiagnostic nineteenth century artifacts were found on the slightly eroded
bedrock surface on the north slope of the knoll. An apparent chimney base of shaped
sandstone rocks was exposed on the surface but no chimney rock fall was apparent.
Shovel testing uncovered a few square-cut nails and a Granite Ware pot was found
nearby. Based on this information, the site was tentatively dated to about AD 1870 and
was interpreted as being the location of a log cabin.
In order to determine the site significance, testing and metal detecting were carried out at
the site in May 2007 (Craver and Skinner 2007). Limestone and sandstone blocks
uncovered in the test pits confirmed the presence of a hearth and of fallen chimney rock.
In addition, a serpentine-shaped rock\ walkway and a stone stoop were found on the north
side of the house and these unusual features heightened the potential significance of the
cabin. Furthermore, testing demonstrated the presence of a variety of artifacts which
indicated that occupation was probably earlier and may have been as early as the 1850s.
An interesting artifact found was a Union general service uniform button that indicated
that the cabin had been occupied during the period when Mr. Warren Goodin owned the
property. Based on these findings, AR Consultants recommended that the site was
potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and that it
should be excavated since it would be destroyed during construction of the landfill. The
Texas Historical Commission concurred with our conclusions and excavation of the site
was carried out in April and May 2008. This investigation was carried out to mitigate the
loss of a historic cultural resource that is rare and may be unique in Grimes County.
Despite extensive investigations in conjunction with the Gibbons Creek Lignite Mine, no
site as old and as well preserved as this one is was located or investigated.

This study is appropriate for state and federal permitting for an application for the
creation of a solid waste landfill site. In addition, the Texas Antiquities Code applies
since BVSWMA is a public entity. This report has been prepared for review by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission as part of their Section 106
review process. The relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974,
as amended (PL-93-291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the natural and
cultural environmental resources of the area. The research design and methodology and
then the results of the field excavation follow. A section which offers recommendations
concludes the body of the report. A list of references cited follows. The approximate site
location is shown on the graphics in this report and additional location information has
been provided to the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory and BVSWMA.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located in the Post Oak Savannah of Coastal Texas (Diamond, Riskind
and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). The topography of the area is mostly rolling uplands
dissected by numerous generally small and intermittent tributaries which ultimately flow
into Alum Creek on the north or Dinner Creek to the south and then empty into the
Navasota River. The post oak savannah encompasses the landfill site. Virtually all of the
area is covered with a sandy mantle which ranges in thickness from a few centimeters to
more than two meters. In most areas, the sandy mantle is less than a meter thick.
The Eocene-age Wellborn Formation which underlies the entire landfill tract (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1974) consists of sandstone and clay, and ranges up to 150+ feet in
thickness. The sandstone is composed of medium-grained quartz and is indurated and can
be massive and forms ledges in some places. Throughout the rest of the formation,
sandstone lenses are present along with clay and lignite. Gravel deposits are present on
top of the bedrock formation and probably correspond to Nordt’s (1983) fifth terrace. The
high gravels are fluviatile deposits dated to the Pleistocene. No Pleistocene sediments are
mapped in the landfill site by the Bureau of Economic Geology.
Shiro loamy fine sand underlies site 41GM410 and was formed from tuffaceous
sandstone bedrock and has a pedon similar to Burlewash. The A and E-horizons are the
same thickness and extend to twelve inches. Both are pinkish gray in color and have no
structure. The Bt1-horizon is yellowish red clay that has faint light brownish gray
mottles. The underlying Bt2 and 3 horizons are light gray clay that has a coarse and
subangular blocky structure. Sandstone bedrock is typically encountered below 31 inches.
All the drainages in the area, excluding Alum Creek, are mapped as intermittent
tributaries of Panther Creek. However, in June 2008 Alum Creek was dry where the
access road crosses the creek between SH 30 and the Goodin site. No evidence of reliable
year-round springs was found but seasonal springs were apparent when the study began.

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Grimes County is included within the Southeastern Region of Texas (Moore 1989).
Paleoclimatic research in the region has revealed a long, probably punctuated, warming
and/or drying trend over the last 10,000 years. The overall results of this climatic trend
was a decrease in trees, except for the oaks, and an increase in grasses and herbaceous
plants. Palynological data from bogs in the Post Oak Savannah have been interpreted as
showing that the present-day, oak-savannah vegetation regime was probably established
about 3,000 years ago (Thoms 1997). Based on historic accounts and archaeological data,
deer and wild root foods probably provided the bulk of the Native American diet
throughout the years of occupation, although bison were probably a regular supplement
to the diet when available.
Numerous prehistoric and historic Native American groups are known to have occupied
this area, but the archaeology of these indigenous peoples is virtually unknown. The area
was first settled by Europeans under the authority of Mexico in 1834 and was part of one
of the original Republic of Texas counties. Farming was the major means of support in
the nineteenth century. A more definitive description of the culture history of the area and
of previous investigations in adjacent Brazos County is contained in “Prehistoric and
Historic Occupation in Central Brazos County (Dering and Mason 2001). For Grimes
County, the reader is referred to the numerous references by Robert Rogers (1992, 1993,
1995) and others involved with investigations at the Gibbons Steam Electric Station and
Mine. These sources provide a comprehensive review of these subjects.
The earliest inhabitants of the area that were recorded historically were the Bedai Indians.
They first appeared in the records of the Spanish explorers after 1691 and they also
traded with the French in the late 18th century. Disease reduced their population to less
than 100 in the early 19th century and records of their existence eventually disappeared by
the mid-19th century. The Tonkowa Indians were also in the area at the time the white
man settled in the county. The Tonkowa lived peacefully with the white man and may
have been helpful in reducing the number of raids on the white man by the Apache and
Comanche Indians. The last, fatal Indian raid in the county occurred in 1841. In 1854, the
U. S. established forces to curtail Indian raids and oust the Indians from Texas. This
ultimately resulted in only six Indians being recorded in the 1860 U.S. Census for Grimes
County (Jackson 2001).
Spanish explorers recorded coming through the area in 1767 and 1788 touring the
Spanish frontier and searching for better routes between San Antonio and other sites in
what was to become Texas and Louisiana (Jackson 2001).
Stephen F. Austin began the first Anglo settlement near the confluence of the Brazos and
Colorado Rivers in 1821. Andrew Millican settled in the area now known as Grimes
County along Holland Creek. By 1824, seven of Austin’s “Old Three Hundred” had

claimed land in Grimes County. By 1836 and the Texas Revolution, 64 settlers had laid
claim to land in the area. Jared E. Groce in Austin’s Colony planted the first cotton in
Texas in 1822 and established the first cotton gin in 1825 near Hempstead in neighboring
Waller County (Jackson 2001).
In 1830, Grimes County was incorporated into the new Viesca District and in 1835
became a part of the newly organized Washington Municipality. The first post office
established in Grimes County was at the Fanthorp Inn in Anderson. Between March and
April 1836, many of Grimes County’s settlers fled eastward joining other settlers in the
“Runaway Scrape” to avoid the advancing Mexican Army. The Republic of Texas was
subsequently established and the area was quickly re-occupied after the Battle of San
Jacinto. The Republic of Texas organized Montgomery County in 1837 (Jackson 2001)
and the area that is now Grimes County was a part of it.
The Congress of the Republic of Texas voted for annexation to the United States on July
4, 1845, and the U. S. Congress admitted The Republic of Texas to the United States of
America as the 28th State. A petition signed by local residents was submitted to the First
State Legislature requesting that Grimes County be established. The petition was
accepted and the county was established on April 6, 1846. Anderson had been recently
plated at the center of the county and was designated the county seat. Other counties that
were later carved out of Grimes County included Madison from the northern portion in
1853 and Waller from the southern portion in 1873 (Jackson 2001).
“Old South” plantation agriculture was practiced during the years following statehood
and the Civil War as most of the settlers were from the deep south and previously many
owned slaves. The 1850 Census showed a county population of 4,008: 2,326 white, 1,680
black slaves, and 2 free blacks. Cotton and corn were the crops under cultivation and
2,202 bales of cotton were produced that year. Large herds of cattle, hogs and sheep
along with 231 mules and 1,193 oxen (a ratio of less than 20%) were also reported. Less
than 20% of the land was reported to be farmland. This would indicate that the land was
still being broken for cultivation. By 1860, the Census showed a county population of
10,320 with 52.9% being black. However, the ratio of oxen to mules had dropped to 40%
and more than half of the county was reported as farmland. Cotton and corn were still the
most significant crops with 18,303 bales of cotton produced. There were 39,000 head of
cattle, a total that would not be achieved again for 80 years. Sheep were at an all-time
high of 18,000 head (Jackson 2001).
Spas were located in Kellum Springs and at Piedmont Springs in 1850. Piedmont Springs
built an opulent 100-room hotel in 1860 to accommodate the guests frequenting the spa.
The first railroad (the Houston & Texas Central) arrived in Navasota in September 1859
(GCHC 1982). However, with the turmoil of the approaching Civil War, prosperity was
halted in Grimes County for several years. A vote was held in February 1861 to
determine if Texas should secede from the Union. The vote was 907 to 9 in favor of
Secession and hundreds of Grimes County volunteers joined Confederate forces (GCHC
1982).

The Civil War brought changes to many cities and counties in the South. An ammunition
factory was built for the war effort in 1861 near Anderson. The war brought the first
telegraph lines to the county through Navasota for use by the Confederate Government
and the railroad in 1862. In 1863, General Magruder established his headquarters in the
Piedmont Springs Hotel. The population of blacks in the county had grown to 7,005 by
1864 due to black refugees seeking protection from Northern aggression. The elegant
ballroom of the Piedmont Springs Hotel was converted for use as a hospital in 1865.
Additionally, after the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, disgruntled confederate
veterans raided a cotton and munitions warehouse in Navasota, which resulted in an
explosion and fire that nearly destroyed the entire downtown commercial district.
Although the war was over, trials and tribulations did not cease. Most landowners and
farmers in the South lost great sums of money after the war. Grimes County landowners
were no exception as no farm regained the 1860 values for fifty years. Epidemics of
cholera and yellow fever killed hundreds of county residents in 1866 and 1867, and
Federal troops were garrisoned in Millican, Brazos County over Brazos, Grimes, and
other surrounding counties to control the lawlessness. Not all was bad, however. In June
1866, The Freedman’s Bureau established educational institutions for blacks in Anderson
and Navasota. The 1870 Census reported a county population of 13,218. Sixty percent of
the county residents were black and many had been refugees that stayed in the county
after the war (GCHC 1982).
Cattle and livestock population in the decade between 1870 and 1880 was half of that in
1860, but by 1890 had exceeded the 1860 number. Cattle for beef and milk production
have been an important part of the Grimes County economy since the mid-19th century.
From 1890 through 1940, the cattle population was fairly stable at around 40,000 head.
The peak of cattle population was reached in 1969 with 79,094 head. By 1987, the cattle
population was just over 50,000 head. In 1982, there were 650 dairy farms in the county
and the cattle and dairy industries accounted for 93% of the county’s agricultural income.
By the 1970’s, cattle had all but replaced the cotton industry in Grimes County. Hog and
sheep production has remained fairly constant since the 1920’s.
Cotton production in 1900 yielded 30,809 bales. The 1926 agricultural figures showed
90,000 acres in cultivation and a cotton yield of 31,000 bales (GCHC 1982). By 1930,
there was a record 81,937 acres in cotton production alone. Cotton gins were located
throughout the county with a high of 25 gins reported in the 1920’s (GCHC 1982). By
1940, the acreage had been reduced by 53% to 38,726 acres with a yield of only 16,031
bales, slightly more than half of the 1900 figure. The county’s most important crop since
the decline in cotton production is corn (Jackson 2001).
The primary industry in the county during the 1800’s was agriculture. Lumbering has
been a part of the county’s economy since the mid-19th century as forty percent of Grimes
County is covered in forests. Sawmills have been in the county since that time and much
of the timber production since the Civil war has been cordwood. Sawmills are second
only to the cotton gin in industrial development in Grimes County (Jackson 2001).

Previous Investigations
There has been numerous cultural resource investigations at the Gibbons Creek Lignite
Mine (GCLM) located in central Grimes County. The initial two investigations conducted
at GCLM were done by Texas A&M University Anthropology Research Laboratory
(Bond 1977; Fletcher 1979). Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EH&A) has conducted
numerous investigations since the initial survey of the lignite mines. In 1990 a report was
produced that highlighted a cultural resources survey of lands within the Gibbons Creek
mine. The survey produced 111 previously unrecorded sites and 18 recorded sites were
revisited (Rogers 1990:42). Of the 111 newly recorded sites 40 are historic and 4 are
multi-component sites. Only two historic sites, 41GM229 and 41GM266 were deemed
eligible for the National Register. Some of the more pertinent sites are discussed below.
Site 41GM229 is a frame school house that stands in a pasture south of a county road in
rural Grimes County (Rogers 1990:80). According to local informants the school house
was built in 1927 and was replaced after it had burned shortly after being constructed.
Site 41GM266 is the Little Flock Baptist Church. The site is a small vernacular church
that is north of a paved county road in the Piedmont community (Rogers 1990:98).
According to a cornerstone the church was constructed in 1906 and remains an important
landmark in this part of Piedmont.
In January of 1989 EH&A recorded a historic house site (41GM171) located 3.5
kilometers southeast of Carlos, Texas within the GCLM (Rogers and Foster 1994:10-28).
The site was discovered within an improved pasture on an interfluve summit. Extensive
shovel testing, eight 1x2 m test units and scraping using a backhoe were used to
investigate the site. No structures were present during survey or were discovered in
testing, but over 500 artifacts were recovered and dated between 1880 and 1900.
In February 1989 EH&A recorded site 41GM182 a deteriorated one-story vernacular
dwelling. Site 41GM182 was built in 1900 and was originally a log structure with later
addition of a modern siding (Rogers 1992:28). It was extensively modified during the
1960’s and abandoned in 1969. The site was not considered for National Register of
Historic Places. A second historic site, 41GM202 was also recorded by EH&A in 1989
(Rogers 1992:36). The site was located when artifacts were observed in a rubble pile in a
pasture setting. The house site was determined to be a twentieth century tenant farm. The
structure was destroyed after WWII.
Site 41GM155 (Peters Cabin) is a previously recorded double-pen log dwelling with an
enclosed dog-trot plan (Rogers et al 1993:40). The site sits atop a hill overlooking a
tributary of Peach Creek. The structure is constructed of cedar logs with square notching.
An exterior chimney once extended from the east side of the dwelling but is no longer
present. The site dates to the nineteenth century and is one of few examples in this region
of a log house with a dog trot plan. An exact date of construction was not determined but
archival research suggests that it was built either between 1841 and 1845 or 1853 and
1857 (Rogers et al. 1993:131).

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY

Archaeological site 41GM410 is an unusual site in Grimes County because it represents
an apparently briefly occupied residence that has been dated in the 1850s. Despite more
than a decade of archaeology done in conjunction with the development of the Gibbons
Creek Lake and Lignite Mine, no site dated to this time period was recorded and found to
be in a state of preservation that warranted excavation. The location of the site in a rural
setting where the residents were subsistence farmers that may have grown some cotton or
marketable grains makes the site a good representative of a poorly known time period and
way of life. Therefore, the Texas Historical Commission recognized the potential
significance of the site and has deemed it eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. However, since it is located
within the footprint of the Twin Oaks Landfill site, the THC recognized that the site can
not be effectively preserved in place and that excavation was the only way to record the
significance of the site.
The following is the Scope of Work that was reviewed and approved by the Texas
Historical Commission.
The results of historic archival research indicate that the property on which site
41GM410 is located changed ownership in 1877. It had been owned by the same family
(Warren Goodin) from 1848 to 1877 and was sold to the Stuckey Family in 1877 and
they held it until 1901. The results of site recording (Skinner and Neely 2002) and then
testing (Craver and Skinner 2007) conducted in May 2007 indicate that the site
occupation occurred during this fifty four year period in the second half of the nineteenth
century and no archaeological or archival evidence was found that the house was present
and used in the 1900s. Consequently, it was reasonable to confine research questions to
the second half of the nineteenth century. Testing further indicated that a single room
house of logs or cut wood with a rock chimney was present and that the house is probably
defined by footing stones as well as the chimney, an entry stoop, and a serpentine
walkway that led to the stoop. Given these factors, the following questions were
developed for use in guiding excavation.
Question 1.
Is the spatial organization of the late mid-nineteenth century farmstead
similar to contemporaneous farmsteads in the region? Is it different than
the spatial arrangements of turn-of-the century farmsteads in the region?
Are these similarities, or differences, linked to the social and/or economic
position of the site 41GM410 residents or to other factors such as
economic activities or cultural traditions?
This question is based on research conducted at Richland Creek Reservoir (Moir and
Jurney 1987) that examined how temporal, spatial, economic, and ethnic characteristics

of the farmsteads are reflected in sheet trash deposits and standing architecture. We had
no standing architecture at this site but archaeological data needed to address questions
involving the physical structure of the farmstead included features such as a house
foundation, well, cistern, privies, cellar, trash deposits, outbuildings, and others that can
be confidently dated.
Features which could not be dated or assigned a specific function(s) were not useful in
pursuing this research question. In terms of historical evidence, it was important to
identify, to some degree, the social or economic character of the site’s occupants, and to
link the structural elements within the site to these occupants. Likewise it was necessary
to determine the arrangement of the residential structure and compare it to
contemporaneous structures in Central and North Texas (Jordan 1978), specifically at
Richland Chambers (Jurney 1987a), and to other contemporary folk structures.
Question 2.
Is the consumer behavior of the households occupying this mid-nineteenth
century farm similar to contemporaneous owner-occupied households
within the region? Is this behavior similar to owner-occupied households
dating to the turn of the century? Did the occupants of site 41GM410
practice a consumer behavior that is different from contemporaneous and
later non-owner occupied households in this region?

In Volume 5 of the Richland Creek report the authors present specific findings associated
with material culture of excavated farmsteads. For example, Moir’s analysis of ceramic
assemblages showed that the rural households preferred inexpensive, plain tablewares
during the mid- to late-nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century, semi-decorated
ceramics were more popular. Ceramic sets did not appear until the 1890s, first among
landowners and then, by 1910, among all household types. In terms of ethnic groups,
Moir (1987:120) found no differences in the ceramic assemblages of black and white
households. A similar pattern was found at Joe Pool Lake but the site information at
Richland Chambers Lake is more comparable, i.e., apparently more rural than Joe Pool,
and were more closely contemporaneous (Jurney 1987b), with the following sites dating
between 1850-1900 and also including sites of similar sizes [noted by an asterisk]:
41NV102 (1877-1897), 41NV145 (1859-late 1870s), 41NV235 (1855-1905), 41NV254
East* (1870s-1885), 41NV254 West* (late 1870s-mid-1880s), and 41NV305 (late 1870searly twentieth century), 41NV306* (late 1870s-late 1890s).
Addressing Research Question 2 involved taking these observations, and those for other
material classes and comparing them to the assemblage from site 41GM410. In order to
make these comparisons, assemblages needed to be tightly dated and this appears to be
the case at 41GM410.

Question 3.
Was the consumer behavior of the household(s) occupying site 41GM410
similar or different from contemporaneous urban households such as in El
Paso (Staski 1984) and Sacramento (Praetzellis and Praetzellis 1990a and
b)? Differences have been observed in the consumer behavior of
nineteenth century urban versus rural households in the eastern United
States (Klein 1991). Do these differences in consumer behavior also occur
in the Texas Gulf Coast?
Only by comparing consumer behavior of rural households to contemporaneous urban
households was it be possible to confidently identify the presence and maintenance of
traditional rural life ways. Without such comparisons, it was not possible to determine
that the pattern of consumer behavior identified at rural farmsteads was either a pattern
special to rural regions of the country, or was simply a reflection of a national pattern of
consumer behavior that has no real urban or rural distinction.
Question 4.
To what extent did the residents of site 41GM410 that occupied this
farmstead purchase and use goods that were being mass marketed
throughout the United States during the mid-nineteenth century?
This question examines the material assemblage of this farmstead in the context of (a) a
Victorian material culture that existed in the nineteenth century and (b) the mass
marketing of goods in the late nineteenth century. Addressing this question involves the
comparison of the artifact assemblages from the farmstead with the range and types of
assemblages that were available in local stores and in merchandise catalogs.
Methodology
At the beginning of excavation, the grid system was re-established from the datum
installed during testing. A metal detector was used to locate additional buried metal
objects. Metal detecting was more refined than previously done during testing because
testing showed that nails and some other ferrous objects were common but that only large
pieces were discovered. Nails and other identifiable metal objects were collected. All
metal was mapped and related to the materials found during testing and to the grid system
which was overlaid on a one meter contour map.
The apparent house block which is estimated to cover an area 9x11 m (Figure 1) and
extends a meter in all directions from the projected house boundaries was marked off and
the fill from the excavated units was manually removed while leaving stone slabs in place
and restoring the area to the exposed conditions at the end of the testing. The backfill was
disposed of out of the site area. The house block was sampled using 1 m squares
excavated in 10 cm levels. All fill was screened through ¼” mesh hardware cloth. A 5
liter soil sample was collected from select units and levels and washed through 1/8”

screen to recover macrobotanical remains. House block excavation was carried out after
the sheet trash testing has been completed.
Sheet trash testing was carried out using 50 cm square units located in the corner of each
4 m square in the grid system. Each unit was excavated in 20 cm levels due to the
shallow depth of the sheet midden and screened through ¼” mesh hardware cloth. This
served to define the core area of the site and the fringe areas as well. Based on the surface
exposure of bedrock to the north of the walkway and the short distance to the large oak
trees east of the house, it was anticipated that the core area was likely to be less than 1000
m square as indicated for the smaller sites at Richland Chambers Lake. Furthermore, the
apparent short period of occupation is likely to have generated a smaller core and fringe
area than in the longer or intensively occupied sites such as 41NV145 which is
comparable to our site.
Artifact analysis was designed to answer the questions above as well as thoroughly
describing the recovered assemblage. Maps showing the intra-site patterning present have
been developed and are used in the analysis.
Public Involvement

We proposed a two pronged approach to informing the public about our findings at the
site. We planned to invite students from the Anthropology Department at TAMU to visit
the site during the excavation but this was not accomplished. Secondly, BVSWMA wants
to have an archaeological display constructed and placed in their on-site office in order to
show the public what they have done as part of planning for the landfill as well as to
show just what significant information has been recovered archaeologically. Thirdly, we
are now planning to develop a program for the site to be considered for inclusion by
Texas Beyond History.

RESULTS
Introduction

Testing of site 41GM410 which is located on a knoll overlooking the Alum Creek
floodplain (Figure 2) had confirmed the presence of a hearth that faced north and was
surrounded by rock fall from the chimney that once stood in the center of the south wall
of a cabin. A serpentine-shaped sidewalk of flat rocks on the north side of the house
ended at a stone stoop that was opposite the mouth of the hearth. It appeared that the
rocks that flanked the stoop might represent the underlying house foundation. A thin
sheet midden containing mid-1800s artifacts was present inside and outside the presumed
house limits. The history of the tract ownership is presented below and this is followed by
the findings from excavation and scraping of the site.

Historic Land Use

The archival history of the property was researched by going to the Grimes County
Courthouse in Anderson, Texas. The courthouse itself was constructed in 1893 and
withstood two fires which damaged some of the records. The county records are now
housed in a small three room structure a block from the courthouse. The deed/title
records were well maintained, easily followed, and are discussed below. However the tax
assessment records prior to the mid-1900s were in poor condition with pages burned,
missing and scattered. Only the 1897 and 1898 tax assessment records were found to be
clearly readable. Probate message records from the late 1800’s and early 1900’s were
checked to see if there were any comments made of a house on the property.
Unfortunately there was no census information found to be in the archive, but the 1850
and 1860 census information for Grimes County is available online.
Deed/Title records
The site of the proposed land fill is comprised of 29 tracts of land that are located within
three Grimes County surveys: The George W. Seaton Survey, A 409, The J. T. Robinson
Survey, A 390, and The G. A. Mason Survey, A 342. The majority of the 29 tracts were
most recently owned by Mr. Harold Trant, who acquired the land from his father’s estate.
He was awarded 35 tracts of land totaling approximately 471 acres in a partition suit that
divided his father’s land holdings (GCDR 1991). The majority of the 471 acres are
located in Grimes County and the tracts of particular interest are located in the J. T.
Robinson Survey, A 390 (GCDR 1991). Some of the tracts have been leased by members
of the Trant family since the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Trant 2002). Much of that
land was used for cotton production during that time (Trant 2002) and there was a cotton
gin on the property in the late 1800’s (Trant 2002; GCHC 1982), which was likely owned
by Phillip Trant (GCHC 1982). The land has been primarily used for cattle production
since the 1920’s, but the land has also been leased for petroleum production and
transmission since the 1970’s (Trant 2002).
The tract within the site that is of particular archaeological interest is a 20-acre tract that
was most recently owned by Colby S. Muth (GCDR 1994). The history of this tract
began when Joseph T. Robinson originally surveyed the 4,428-acre land grant in 1839
(GCDR 1839) and The Republic of Texas conveyed the land to Francis Zellner that same
year. On July 24, 1846, Francis Zellner sold 500 acres of the land to George Patillo
(GCDR 1846/1901). It is within this 500-acre tract that the Muth 20-acre tract is located.
Patillo sold this 500-acre tract to Warren Goodin in 1848 (GCDR 1848). Goodin may
have lived on the land and farmed it, or had family members or workers living on it and
farming it during the 29 years that he owned it (Trant 2002). Goodin sold 100 acres of the
land to Pru Stuckey in 1877 (GCDR 1877). The Stuckey family owned the land for nearly
24 years and may have also lived on the land and farmed it during that time (Trant 2002).
Stuckey’s descendant’s sold the property to James G. McDonald in 1901 (GCDR 1901).
The McDonald’s owned the land for nearly 40 years and they may have also lived on the

15

land and farmed it during that time (Trant 2002). McDonald’s descendants sold forty
acres to R. P. Trant in 1940 (GCDR 1940). Trant used the property for cattle production
(Trant 2002). Twenty of the 40 acres were sold to Fryxell in 1987 (GCDR 1987). The
property was used for cattle production at this time as well (Trant 2002). The 20 acretract was sold in 1994 to Muth (GCDR 1994) who used it for cattle production.
Tax Assessment/Probate messages/Census
The tax assessment records were in poor condition as mentioned above. The 1897 records
showed that a member of the Stuckey family owned 98 acres and a value was assessed
for the land (GCTR 1897). Unfortunately the records for the next year (1898) had no
mention of the Stuckey family and it is believed that a portion of this record is missing or
damaged according to the county clerk. With no other land values to compare, the tax
assessment records are not useful in this case. The county clerk suggested that the
Probate message records might have information over structures on the land that was left
after someone died. So these records were checked by searching for any member of the
Stuckey, Goodin or McDonald families. Several messages were found with regard to
James McDonald and L.M. Stuckey but there was no mention of a house in either
message.
The county clerk could not locate any Census information dating from the mid- to late
1800’s to the early 1900’s but suggested that some of this information might be online.
The access genealogy website has the 1850 Census for Grimes County which has Pru
Stuckey listed as a 15 year old Male that was born in Mississippi along with his two
brothers 29 year old Robert and 12 year old Tad Stuckey (Census 1850). Mahaly
Stuckey, a 33 year old woman is presumed to be Pru’s mother and Daniel Stuckey, a 50
year old farmer is presumed to be his father. Pru would have been 42 years of age when
he bought the 100 acres from Goodin in 1877 (Census 1850).
Additional Sources

An article was discovered that documents the many descendants of Christopher Chaney,
Texas Patriot. In this article Christopher Chaney’s youngest daughter Ellen married Pru
Stuckey, the son of Daniel Stuckey in 1855 (Ports Nd). This confirms what the 1850
census suggests that Pru was the son of Daniel Stuckey. Pru later served as a private in
Captain George Freeman’s Cavalry Company, Pedernales Home Guard, 31st Brigade of
Texas Militia in 1861 (Ports Nd). On March 19, 1862, Pru joined the Confederacy as a
private in Company C, 16th Texas Infantry. The Infantry first saw combat in northeastern
Louisiana in 1863. Pru was captured at Pleasant Hill in 1864 and exchanged at Blair’s
Landing later that year. Pru disbanded in late 1865 and returned to Grimes County. It was
during or soon after the war that Pru divorced his wife Ellen and was finalized in 1871
(Ports Nd). Based upon the deed records Pru Stuckey purchased 100 acres of the land
where this historic residential site is located in 1877 from Warren Goodin and lived and
farmed it until the early 1900’s (GCDR 1877).

Very little information is available with regard to the use of the property where the site is
located but Ryan Hammons of Texas A&M University provided a series of aerial
photographs dated since 1958. These graphics provide information about roads, pipelines,
and landuse over the past fifty years and raise questions about how the property was used
in the past. The following discussion hinges primarily on the 1958 aerial photograph
(Figure 3), the Soil Survey of Grimes County, Texas (Greenwade 1996), and historic
county overviews.

Figure 3.

1958 aerial photograph of the landfill site showing the site location and the
rectangular-shaped cleared area surrounding it. The cleared area may have
been cleared in the mid-1800s and the brush regularly kept down since
that time. Courtesy of Ryan Hammons at Texas A&M University.

As shown on Figure 3, the area north of Alum Creek and primarily west of the SH30
access road had apparently been cleared of trees sometime prior to 1958 although at the
time of the photograph the area was no longer being farmed or the field plowed or brush
hogged. No evidence is apparent that the area had been terraced. Soils in this oncefarmed area include Robco loamy fine sand and Tabor fine sandy loam which are
moderately well suited to corn, peanuts, cotton, small grains, and truck crops (Greenwade
1996:62, 68). This area, or part of it, could have been cleared in the 1800s and farmed up

to the time of the Great Depression but Harold Trant (2002) indicated that it and all the
property he owned or leased in the landfill site was used for rangeland since World War
II. This land north of the creek would have been easily accessed from the site by way of
the low water crossing that shows as an eroded area [white] at a bend in the creek where
the access road from the highway appears to terminate. Of more interest to the Goodin
site is the roughly rectangular-shaped seventeen acre tract of land that includes the site
and extends to Alum Creek on the north as well as to the south toward the ridge between
the Alum Creek and Dinner Creek watersheds. This area includes Boonville fine sandy
loam and Shiro loamy fine sand between the site and the creek but these are not soils that
are ideal for farming the basic crops of the mid-1800s according to the soil survey.
However, this small area has until recently been kept clear of invading brush and even
today stands out from the surrounding tree-covered bottomland, slopes and ridge top and
it is close to the house. Consequently, it is our opinion that all or part of this cleared area
could have been cleared for use as a family garden and would probably have been fenced
then regularly plowed and planted with vegetables and fruits that were then consumed
immediately or were stored for later use. It is difficult to imagine that Goodin had a large
garden but Burlewash fine sandy loam that surrounds the house site and covers the ridge
to the south is poorly suited to farming due to the hazard of erosion and the low
availability of water.
While this information does not prove that this rural residential site was indeed Warren
Goodin’s residence, it does present a viable argument for Goodin being the builder of the
structure and his family being the occupants in the mid-1800s.

Excavation
The definition of the sheet midden at the Goodin site was done using 50 cm squares
placed at four meter intervals. Excavation (Figure 4) revealed that the sandy loam had
been and continues to be churned by rodents, some of which attempted to backfill units
while they were being dug or immediately after they had been dug. In addition, fire ant
residences are scattered throughout the site deposit and wild hogs, which are common in
the area, may have disturbed the site deposit in the past as their nightly presence was
observed in our backdirt piles during the investigation. No visible vertically or
horizontally separated stratigraphic sediments were found in the test squares and field
analysis of artifacts demonstrated that square nails were found throughout the midden
deposit and wire nails were very rare and that in most cases the midden deposit was no
more than twenty cm thick. No organic staining of the sheet midden or of the artifact
concentrations was recognized. For the purpose of the following analysis of the internal
arrangement of the sheet midden, the artifact samples from one or two 20 cm levels in
each unit have been treated as being from a single provenience and are combined into
eight categories: cut nails, wire nails, glass, ceramics, bone, metal, button, and gun flint.
A total of 66 squares were excavated (Figure 4) in order to define the limits of the sheet
midden and to pinpoint artifact concentrations. Based on the combined artifact pattern
uncovered in the units, the sheet midden covered an area that was approximately 36 m

north-south and 30 m east-west with the chimney base being located just northwest of
center. As shown in Figure 5, one major artifact concentration is located on the west and
southwest of the structure and three concentrations coincide with three test units situated
east of the house. The major concentration ranged from 21 to 60 artifacts in a test square
while the three smaller concentrations coincided with individual squares and contained
23, 26, and 32 artifacts (Figure 5). Additional information about the types and
distribution of the 50 cm test unit artifacts is contained in Table 1. Further provenience
information is included in Appendix A which is at the end of this report.

At a lower level of analysis, square-cut nails and glass present complementary
concentrations while a few metal, ceramic, chert, and bone artifacts were found
consistently throughout the sheet midden but did not present distinct concentrations. Cut
nails and nail fragments were concentrated in four units northwest of the structure and in
three units southwest of the structure (Figure 6). This latter unit had the most pronounced
nail concentrations. A single unit with ten cut nails was found east of the structure in the
vicinity of a large stone that might have been a grave marker but the nails were found

were too large to have been used in a casket. A total of eleven wire nails and wire nail
fragments were found scattered in the units and are noted as black squares on Figure 6.
Although wire nails were included in the two large nail concentrations they are not
clearly associated with the square-cut nails and are considered to represent more recent,
i.e. late 1800s/early 1900s occupation or use of the remaining structure or of the site area.

Figure 6.

Cut nails and nail fragment concentrations outlined in black. Locations of
wire nails are indicated by darkened squares.

The major glass concentration was located southwest of the structure and included ten or
more artifacts in five units (Figure 7). This corresponds to the southwest nail
concentration but is half as dense. Two concentrations in the north central part of the
sampled area have only ten or eleven pieces of glass per unit. The fourth concentration
was located in the southeast part of the site and is defined in only three units and has a
density of 17.0 pieces per unit which is similar to the largest concentration. If units
containing ten or eleven pieces were removed from the calculations, there would only be
two concentrations and the larger one would have a density of 18 pieces per unit.

Glass concentrations outlined in black as indicated by 10 or more pieces of
glass within a unit. The sheet midden boundary is also defined.

The artifacts recovered from the test squares demonstrated that the deposit was fairly thin
and that the sheet midden covered a relatively small area of about a thousand square
meters. Likewise, the number of artifacts expected to be encountered in the test units
would be low and that significant and large extra mural features were unlikely to be
encountered. The relatively large numbers of square-cut nails, of hand-turned snuff bottle
necks along with flintlock pistol artifacts and blue feather-edge pottery indicated the
major occupation to have been in the 1850s and not in the 1870s as previously concluded
in our previous reports (Skinner and Plumb 2002:36; Craver and Skinner 2007:40)
Excavation of the house area was done using 1x1 m squares and has incorporated
information gathered during the earlier testing. This resulted in the excavation of 23 units
located within the projected house limits along with 21 units placed outside (Figure 8) in
order to sample the sheet midden and to define such things as the chimney fall, the
serpentine walkway (Figures 9 and 10), and to search for a possible grave.

1x1 grid layout for excavating the house area with the A/A’ soil profile
and the corresponding grid numbers.

Sandstone bedrock was found to be present at shallow depths throughout the site area and
was on the surface north of the house. The bedrock surface was very irregular and the
rock was soft, unconsolidated, and not tabular. This was certainly not the source for the
rock used in the walkway, stoop, or chimney. Sandy loam was primarily resting on top of
it but in some areas, particularly to the south, the rock dipped steeply and thick layer of
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay was below the sandy loam. The sandy clay had
eroded away in other areas within the site limits. Artifacts were found in the sandy loam
which ranged from a centimeter thick to more than 30 cm thick but were primarily
confined to the upper 20 cm where that much fill was present.
Excavation failed to find any conclusive evidence of a rock foundation or of footing
stones that would have allowed the definition of the east or west walls or of the north or
south walls associated with the stone stoop and the hearth/chimney base. In addition,
several units in the northwest part of the house were systematically probed with a steel
rod at 10 cm intervals looking for buried stones but none were uncovered. Likewise, no
evidence of a roof drip line was noted so the limits were not defined that way. At the end
of this process, the lateral extent of the structure was not clearly defined.

The stone stoop was a roughly square sandstone slab that measured 50 by 35 cm. The flat
surfaces of the rock were rounded and it was not apparent whether the slab had been
quarried and shaped or if it had been found in its present shape.

The serpentine walkway stretches from the lower right hand side of the
picture to the stone stoop that is right of the sign board. Other exposed
rocks extend to the east from the stoop. View is to the west.

The sandstone rocks in the serpentine walkway had been laid on the ground so as to
present a flat but not flagstone flat surface and no evidence was noted that they had been
intentionally shaped nor had they been tightly pieced together to make a contiguous rock
surface.
Several rocks were found in the area just east of the doorway (as seen in Figures 9 and
10) and a complete Wisconsin Glass Co. beer bottle with a hand-turned neck was found
under several of the rocks.
Shaped sandstone rocks were used to create the chimney (Figure 11) which was in the
estimated center of the south wall. Not all of the rocks had been shaped but those used in
the lower three courses of the chimney walls had been squared off to present adjoining
flat surfaces. The chimney hearth stones were irregular in shape but were oriented so they
presented a flat hearth floor (Figure 12). No evidence was noted of mortar between the
wall rocks but it is likely that it was once present.

Rocks in the collapsed chimney fall were irregular in shape and provided no evidence of
having been shaped. The chimney fall is thickest on the west side of the chimney base
where it extends about three meters. To the north, east, and south the fall is less dense and
extends one to two meters from the chimney base (Figure 13). It is possible that larger
shaped rocks had been present and that these smaller rocks had been mortared in to fill
spaces between the larger rocks which had subsequently been scavenged from the site.
This possibility is likely since the present rock fall did not appear to have been sufficient
to have served to raise a chimney to the height of eight or more feet. Many of these
smaller rocks, which averaged less than 10 cubic cm in size, had a blackened/burned
surface that was evidence of having been on the inner surface of the chimney.

Pontiac station wagon body is in the upper center of the picture.

Artifacts recovered from the one meter square units in both the testing and excavation do
not provide any definitive patterning within the site (Figure 14). The high artifact count
(n=227) in unit 119E, 121N supports the conclusion based on the 50 cm squares that a
distinct trash accumulation was located southwest of the house within the limits of the
sheet midden. The lower counts (n=17 and 15) in the two units (129E, 131N and 129E,
128N) on the east side of the estimated house limits was probably due to the shallow
depth to bedrock. The lower counts in the units where the serpentine walkway was
discovered is due in part to our having excavated these units only deep enough to expose
the upper surface of the sandstone slabs. The rest of the number counts within the one
meter square units vary to a great degree and show no definitive pattern.

Artifact totals from each of the 1x1 m units.

In order to determine if a wooden or an earthen floor had been present, a profile across
the site was prepared (Figure 15). It had been expected that if a wooden floor was
present, artifacts, such as buttons, shards of glass, and coins would have fallen below the
floor and been preserved in place unless the floor had been replaced. If an earthen floor
was present, artifacts should be small enough to have gone unnoticed by the cabin
occupants. Additionally an earthen floor would be very compacted from being under
almost constant pressure from foot traffic. Assuming the floor was swept, there should be
almost no artifacts.

The soil profile bisected the cabin from outside the hearth to the stoop on the north. The
profiling focused on determining if a compacted lens was present. Close examination of
the profile found a square nail, labeled in Figure 15 as #1 and crockery sherd, labeled as
#2. These two artifacts were at the same level and their presence and depth may indicate
that they rested on the same surface. Examination of the soil in and around the two
artifacts was not able to discern a color difference or lens that could be attributed to an
earthen floor. Soil color was identical with a dark brown (7.5YR3/2) fine sandy loam
above, next to, and below the artifacts. Seven centimeters below both artifacts there was a
textural change to a very slightly clayey fine sandy loam. Yet, no discernable color
change occurred at these depths.
The absence of a lens would imply a wooden floor. However, the crockery sherd was two
and half inches long by one quarter inch thick. An artifact that size might not fall through
a crack in a wooden floor.
The lack of a discernable lens and small enough artifacts to have fallen through floor
cracks do not rule out either an earthen or wooden floor at this site. It is possible there
was an earthen floor at this site and occupation was not long enough geologically to have
been manifested as any type of feature. The size of the crockery sherd also does not rule
out the presence of a wood floor. Due to the scant evidence at this site the question of
floor type cannot be answered at this time.
A large unmarked stone that measured 39 cm in length by 29 cm wide and is 26 cm thick
was noted about 13.8 m east southeast of the chimney. The stone had a smooth surface
that was unmarked but the rock had the look of a fieldstone used as a traditional
unmarked grave headstone (Jordan 1982:43-47). Consequently, two test units were
excavated to the east and west of the stone to determine if a grave shaft might be present.
Artifacts were found scattered in the fill but the bottom of the unit was found to be sterile
clay that was in place and had not been disturbed. No evidence of a grave was found.
During the course of excavation, a five liter sample of matrix was collected from every
unit and level. A sample from within the house limits and from the center of the major
trash concentration was water screened and no evidence of culturally significant plant
remains was recovered although grass roots were abundant. Because of the extensive
bioturbation caused primarily by rodents and the lack of contexts where plant remains
were likely to be preserved, the remaining soil samples were screened through 1/8” mesh
screens and the cultural materials collected. This exercise demonstrated that the use of ¼”
mesh screens had provided a representative sample; consequently, the materials from the
finer screening were combined with the larger sample.
After excavation had been completed and no extramural features had been uncovered, it
was agreed that the area of the midden be scraped to bedrock or subsoil for the purpose of
discovering excavations that extended below the relatively shallow midden deposit
(Figure 16). Scraping was done using a John Deere 310SG loader/backhoe with a six foot
wide blade and a John Deere tractor which removed thin lifts of sandy loam. East of the
trees and primarily north of the area where a grave had been suspected, the backhoe was

used to uncover the deeper sediments but no graves or grave shafts were revealed. A
project supervisor followed the equipment and inspected the scraped surface for artifacts,
disturbances, and pit fill. No pits were uncovered and the only feature found during
scraping was a rock concentration that is shown as Figure 17. The purpose of the rock
pile was not determined and no artifacts other than the rocks were found so its date of
construction was not be determined.

Artifact Analysis
A total of 3402 historic artifacts were recovered during testing and excavation of site
41GM410. Materials recovered included nails, ceramics, window/bottle/chimney glass,
bullets/shotgun shells, a gun flint, a powder flask, various buttons, two marbles,
numerous metal objects and bone (Table 2). The artifact assemblage is discussed below.

Nail Analysis
Nails recovered from 41GM410 were first separated into one of three groups, square-cut,
wire and nail fragments. Nails with a distinguishable head and tip were counted as either
square-cut or wire, all others were considered fragments. The whole nails from
excavation were then analyzed to determine how many were bent versus straight and how
many were annealed. Annealed nails are those that have been heated to high temperatures
which in turn prevents as much corrosion on the nail (Young 2008).

A total of 1,579 nails were recovered from 41GM410. The assemblage consists of 525
square-cut nails (33.3%), 40 wire nails (2.5%) and 1,014 nail fragments (64.2%) [most of
which are from cut nails]. The majority of the square-cut nails are 4, 6, 7 and 9 penny
nails (Table 3). At John Ward’s Ranch in southern Arizona, the authors concluded
(Fontana and Greenleaf 1962) that the presence of less than twenty percent wire nails
indicated construction around the 1880’s -1890’s. John Ward’s Ranch does not provide
dates as early as 41GM410 and the wire nail count at the site is much less than twenty
percent. The 1880’s date range presented by Fontana and Greenleaf is amplified by
Nelson (1968) and discussed by Richner (1992:41) and others (Gillio et al. 1980). This
date was further refined by Walker (1980:352) who presents a date prior to 1888 when
less than 20% wire nails are present. Jurney (1987:90 and Figure 6-2) indicates that these
dates are not old enough for Richland Creek sites and should be five to fifteen years
older. Site 41GM410 provides evidence that the 1870’s chronology for a less than 20%
wire nail count within the nail assemblage does not fit this site. The datable artifacts
recovered from 41GM410 suggest an occupation during the 1850’s.
The nail rain from the site consists primarily of 6-9 penny nails which measure 2 inches
(5.1 cm) to 2.95 inches (7.5 cm) in length as shown on Jurney’s conversion chart
(1987:84). Nails this size were used primarily for holding wall board and wall battens on
a structure. They would not have been used as shake roofing nails (Jurney 1987:83).
Based on the Richland Creek study, it is most likely that the structure at site 41GM410
was a log structure and may have had a covered wood roof rather than a shake shingle
roof. Even though the amount of wire nails is minimal, the existence of wire nails
suggests some possible remodeling or additions in the late nineteenth or early twentieth
century.

The original analysis of the nail assemblage from the testing phase did not include
classifying nails as bent/straight or annealed. A more detailed analysis was done on the
nail assemblage from the excavation that classified the nails as bent or straight and also
included how many were annealed. The total of whole square-cut and wire nails from
excavation is 398 and 13% (n=51) of those were bent. According to Bill Young of
Corsicana (2008) this relatively high percentage of bent nails suggests that the nails were
probably pulled while removing the existing roof and replacing it or due to a frame
addition. The percent of annealed nails within this same assemblage was 20.3% (n=81)
which suggests that the house may have burned at some time (Young 2008).
The complete nail assemblage from the site suggests that 41GM410 was probably a log
structure that had a frame addition and a covered wood roof. The cabin was remodeled
during the later part of the nineteenth century and it is possible that the roof was replaced.
Site 41GM410 was at one point burned due to the amount of annealed nails recovered. It
is possible that the cabin was burned in order to collect the unbroken nails. When
attempting to pull square-cut nails, they tend to break easier due to their lack of a pointed
tip and square shaft (Clark 2008). It becomes easier to collect whole nails after the logs
have been burned than by pulling each nail.
Ceramic Analysis
A total of 489 ceramic sherds were recovered from 41GM410. No complete or even a
quarter of ceramic vessel was recovered. The ceramics were separated into four
categories. The first is whitewares, which consists of ironstone and a variety of white fine
earthenware. Next is stoneware and then porcelain. The final category is earthenware,
which consists of coarse earthenware. The ceramic assemblage consisted of (n=375)
76.6% of whiteware, (n=87) 17.8% stoneware, (n=14) 2.8% porcelain and (n=13) 2.7%
earthenware. Both the whiteware and stoneware types are typically dated from the mid________________________________________________________________________

18th into the 19th century (Potter, Pantermuehl and Fox 2006; Rosenberg and Kvietok
1981). The stoneware sherds have two different glazes, the first a grey salt glaze and the
second a brown salt glaze to the interior and exterior of the sherds.
During testing only two decorated sherds were found, the first being a small rim sherd
with a blue transferware design that probably dates between 1850-1880, and the second
was a stoneware body piece that has an incised mark “T(?)XA…” on the exterior,
presumed to be “TEXAS”. Excavation recovered a total of 28 pieces of decorated
ceramics. Of the eleven maker’s marks, none were identifiable due to their small size of
the decorated pieces. A total of 10 pieces of blue transferware were recovered from the
site. Of the ten pieces only 2 were identifiable; the first piece has a Columbia pattern
which is believed to have been produced by William Adams & Sons, ca 1842-1858
(Blake and Freeman 1998:48). The second piece is another blue transferware with a
Canova pattern which was produced by Thomas Mayer, ca 1826-1838 (Pollen et al. 1996
23-24).
Two rim fragments of whiteware have blue feather-edge decoration (Figure 18). This
decoration consists of painted bands around the plate rim. The feather-edge decoration
was used on various vessels but is most commonly found on plates (Price 1979:17-18).
The blue feather-edge decoration was most popular between 1820-1870 (Roberson
1972:207). According to an illustrated guide for ceramics (Potter, Pantermuehl and Fox
2006) the blue edged ware decoration has an age range from 1780 to 1850. It is apparent
that there is some controversy over the proper dating for feather-edge decoration due to
the many variations and colors, not to mention that it is found at historic sites that postdate these time ranges. Regardless it can be stated with confidence that the two blue
feather-edge ceramic fragments have a mid-nineteenth century date. These pieces were
probably from two separate plates based upon the slight difference in the feather-edge
design thickness and that the two pieces came from different locations. One was
recovered from a 50 cm square unit (Unit 16) at a depth of 20-40 cmbs. The second came
from test unit (126E, 129N) roughly 10 meters northwest of Unit 16 at a depth of 10-20
cmbs.

Three small fragments from two clay pipes were recovered. Two of the fragments are
yellowish-brown ribbed bowl fragments that fit together. Both are lipped and have
interior and exterior slip. One of the fragments measures 0.614 inches (15.6 mm) wide,
0.717 inches (18.2 mm) long and 0.165 inches (4.2 mm) thick. The other piece is 1.02
inches (26.0 mm) wide, 0.570 inches (14.5 mm) long and 0.157 inches (4.0 mm) thick.
Both pieces have triangle design at the top of the lip and the ribs slope around the
triangle. The third fragment is composed of darker clay and does not appear to fit with
the other two fragments. It also has a triangular design and measure .559 inches (14.2
mm) long, 0.590 inches (15.0 mm) wide and 0.079 inches (2.0 mm) thick. A stem from a
pipe was also recovered from excavation. The stem measures 0.409 inches (10.4 mm)
wide, is 0.732 inches (18.6 mm) long and 0.209 inches (5.3 mm) thick up to the lip which
is 0.299 inches (7.6 mm) thick. The stem is believed to be composed of a synthetic
material that might have been a kind of hard rubber (Green 2008). The pipe stem appears
to have teeth marks imprinted into the stem.
There were a total of 156 diagnostic rim and base sherds, 6 pieces from handles and 1
spout fragment within the ceramic assemblage. The vessel types that may have been
present would have been stoneware storage jars, crocks, jugs and bottles. The diagnostic
sherds of whiteware appear to have been cups, saucers, bowls, milk pans and plates.
Within the assemblage there were a couple of narrow porcelain rim sherds which may
have been from a small bottle. The entire assemblage presents primarily utilitarian wares,
which is expected from a residential site, especially a mid-1800’s rural family setting.
Glass Analysis
A total of 1040 pieces of glass were recovered from the testing and excavation. Using
Randall Moir’s model for distinguishing between flat/window glass and vessel/bottle
glass, the assemblage produced 998 pieces of bottle glass, 11 pieces of window glass and
31 pieces of chimney glass. The eleven window glass pieces had thicknesses of 0.114
inches (2.9 mm), 0.106 inches (2.7 mm), 0.087 inches (2.22 mm), 0.059 inches (1.51
mm), 0.055 inches (1.39 mm) and 0.051 inches (1.3 mm). According to Moir’s predictive
model for dating lower to middle class rural dwellings, the 2.9 and 2.7 mm thick pieces
would date from 1920 to 1980+ (Moir 1988:271).
The glass measuring 1.5 mm in thickness dates to 1840 while the 1.3 mm piece dates to
the 1830’s. The later two have relative dates comparable to the general dates taken from
the site. When analyzing some of the thicker pieces of window glass it became apparent
that they could have been bottle glass. The pieces were smaller than 0.79 inches (20 mm)
in length and were flat with a slight greenish hue, which fits Moir’s model for flat glass.
But the dates do not match with anything excavated at the site. The previous owner of the
land, Harold Trant was quoted saying that he had no recollection that evidence of a house
was ever present nor that his father told him that a house had once been present (Skinner
and Plumb 2002:30). So it seems unlikely that the glass found in excavation was from the
middle to late 1900’s. Bottle glass fragments and a complete beer bottle with identifiable
maker’s marks demonstrate a time frame in the late 1800’s suggesting a second later
occupation.

The glass assemblage consists of aqua, amber, black/dark olive, brown, light green,
violet, blue, milk glass and clear colored glass. The amount of each of these colors in the
assemblage is shown on Table 4. The colors are important in that some can be used for
dating purposes. The violet colored glass indicates a strong manganese content that was
used to decolorize the glass and was used primarily during the late nineteenth century and
early twentieth century. Manganese was replaced by selenium to decolorize glass around
the 1920’s which is identified by its amber color. Black/dark olive glass was primarily
used for wine and champagne bottles between 1850 and 1890. Brown glass used for
bottles became popular in the mid- to late 1800’s. The assemblage shows an abundance
of brown, amber and clear glass colors including 31 pieces of clear chimney glass, which
suggest a general mid- to late 1800’s time frame.

The glass assemblage contained snuff, wine, medicine bottle fragments, a hand-turned
clear bottle neck and lip fragment along with one complete brown beer bottle. The
fragments that are datable demonstrate a general occupation in the late 1800’s into the
early 1900’s. A total of 20 brown colored snuff bottle base and rim fragments with handturned necks were recovered. Ten rim fragments and ten base fragments with no maker’s
marks or dots comprise the 20 snuff bottle fragments. The wine bottle fragments were
dark olive in color and included a rim and a base. Whether the wine bottle neck was hand
turned or not could not be determined since the fragment was too small based on
Kendrick’s illustrations based on mold seams (1966:48). The medicine bottles were
round and rectangular in shape and some of them have maker’s marks. One rectangular
base fragment has “…UIS MO.” on the underside that is interpreted as St Louis, Missouri
which is probably the area of production. A second medicine bottle base fragment has a
capitol P with a line underneath it giving the appearance of a cattle brand. This maker’s
mark could not be accurately identified. A third clear round medicine bottle has the base
and a section of its side still intact. The base was marked with “C L G Co”, or the CarrLowrey Glass Co. from Baltimore. This bottle was manufactured beginning in 1889 and
continues to the present originally only for druggist and perfumes (Toulouse 1971:134).
A clear vessel/bottle glass fragment with the maker’s mark “…LEM. B. HA…” visible in
a circular pattern was recovered; however its use was unknown. The complete brown

beer bottle measures 9.5 inches (24.13 cm) tall and 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) wide with a hand
turned neck with the makers mark “WIS. G. CO. MILW.” This dates the bottle to 18821886 by the Wisconsin Glass Co. based out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Skinner 1967:111112; Toulouse 1971:541-42). When washing the bottle two small long bones and some
metal fragments were discovered within the bottle. The long bones are from a small
mammal and the metal fragments were unidentifiable.
Bullets/shotgun shells and gunflint Analysis
A total of 9 shotgun shells were recovered from the site. Two shotgun shells from testing
and three from excavation were identifiable with the letters “U.M.C. Co” written across
the top and “CLUB” or “NEW CLUB” across the bottom. The remaining 4 shells were
too corroded to make out any marks. The number 12 was written across the center of
three shells identifying them as 12-gauge shells made by Union Metallic Cartridge
Company. The other two shells had the number 10 across the middle and are Union
Metallic Cartridge Company 10-gauge shells. The Union Metallic Cartridge Company
was organized in 1867 and merged with Remington Arms Company in 1910 as
Remington-UMC (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962: 80; Remington 2007). Thus these shells
were manufactured between 1867 and 1910.
Ten cartridges were recovered from excavation at the site. Of the ten cartridges, four have
discernable rim markings. These four cartridges have “REM – UMC 30-30” etched into
the rim making them .30 caliber, 30 grain loaded center fire Remington Arms Co. bullet
casings (Spangler 2007). The 30-30 cartridge was first marketed in early 1895 for the
Winchester Model 1894 lever-action rifle (Barnes and Skinner 2003). The 30-30 was
popular for hunting deer. These cartridges came later, after the Union Metallic Cartridge
Company of Bridgeport and Remington Arms Company combined in 1912 to become
Remington U.M.C (Remington 2008). So these cartridges were manufactured after 1912.
A lead bullet was recovered from excavation but was smashed too heavily to be
identified. A single buckshot was also recovered from excavation and according to Jay
Blaine (2008) was typical for the pre-Civil War era. A two-ring bullet recovered from
testing has been flattened with one side of the bullet have two distinguishable rings
encircling the bottom half. The opposite side of the bullet is indistinguishable. This bullet
is believed to be a .54 caliber carbine two ring bullet. This type of bullet would have been
used during the Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century.
A gun flint was recovered from excavation (Figure 19). The gun flint measures 0.79
inches (20.1 mm) in length, 0.76 inches (19.4 mm) wide and is 0.22 inches (5.6 mm)
thick which suggests that this gunflint was used in a pistol and not a rifle. The gunflint is
a honey colored French flint and appears to have been broken during use (Blaine 2008). It
is a conventional gunflint that was produced from a prepared blade. These conventional
gunflints were introduced in the late 1600’s but did not displace the spall gunflint until
around 1750 (Blaine 1967:83).

Powder Flask Analysis
The front decorated portion or swell of a pistol powder flask was discovered in unit 40
within the first 20 cm. This metallic portion of a powder flask measures 2.24 inches (5.69
cm) wide and 2.41 inches (6.12 cm) in length. The top edge is broken off and there is a
small 0.13 inch hole in the metal just above the decoration. The decoration is what is
called “shell and bush” but more specifically the spreading leaf pattern found on the flask
is just simply referred to as the bush flask (Riling 1953: 286). In an illustration found in
the James Dixon & Sons’ “Sporting Tackle” catalog issued in July 1883 on page 16; what
is termed a double flute powder flask (Figure 20a) appears to be the same design on the
powder flask found at the site (Figure 20b). It is presumed that these are the same and so
the powder flask from the site is a James Dixon & Sons’ double fluted powder flask. This
is based upon the decorative design, as a lot of markers marks were found on the tops and
not on the decorative designs on the flask itself (Blaine 2008).
James Dixon & Sons’ was a metal manufacturing firm started by James Dixon in 1804 in
Sheffield, England. The company was not listed in the 1828 Sheffield directory as
making powder flasks, and first appears as a maker of powder flasks in 1845. But Riling
states “from the present firm “that it may be assumed that flasks were first produced
between 1829 and 1833…” (Riling 1953: 107). According to several letters sent to James
from his son in New York, the Dixon firm was doing business in America in the mid to
late 1830’s (Riling 1953: 107).

Button Analysis
Testing recovered four buttons and excavation recovered an additional 8 buttons. The
first button recovered from testing is a mother-of-pearl shell button (Figure 21c). The
button is 0.74 inches (18.8 mm) in diameter and 0.129 inches (3.3 mm) thick. The four
holes in the center of the button appear uniform, suggesting that the button was machinemade. Machine-made shell buttons were introduced in Birmingham around the mid________________________________________________________________________

nineteenth century (Epstein 1990:60). The second button is a small glaze covered
porcelain button (Figure 21b). This button was hand-made based upon the dimpling
around the center holes on the back side. The dimpling occurred when the button was
held while covering its surface with a glaze. The button is 0.39 inches (10 mm) in
diameter and 0.090 inches (2.3 mm) thick. Porcelain buttons were made from the
eighteenth century to the present and eighteenth century porcelain buttons are scarce. A
much wider variety of these buttons were produced during the mid-nineteenth century
(Epstein 1990:50). A shoe button was recovered from the testing phase at the site. The
shoe button (Figure 21a) is 0.39 inches (10 mm) thick and has a small metal loop on the
back. The shoe button was typically sewed on leather and fabric top shoes for fastenings
(Luscomb 1992:183).

Figure 21.

button, c. shell button, d. handmade black button, e. black glass button, f.
bone button.

The fourth button recovered from testing the site is a brass Union Eagle button (Figure
22). The button is 0.736 inches (18.7 mm) in diameter and 0.200 inches (5.1 mm) thick.
The front of the button shows an eagle with a shield in the center of the eagle. The back
of the button has “Extra Quality” written with “Extra” across the top and “Quality” across
the bottom with three stars separating the two words on either side. The trademark is
common and does not specify the manufacturer, so a specific date for the button could
not be determined (Albert 1976:40-41). However, the button is a Civil War/Indian War
era general service button. A similar button was found at the Camp Ford site in Smith
County, Texas. The button has the same eagle design with “Extra/Quality” written across
the back (Thoms 2000:141). The only difference between the one recovered from
41GM410 and the one from Camp Ford is that two stars separate the words as opposed to
three stars.
Excavation produced 8 more buttons. Six of the eight are porcelain buttons similar to the
one recovered from testing. Although these six vary in size, they all have dimpling
around the four holes on the back side suggesting these were also hand-made. A black
glass button with a 6 point star molded design on the front was recovered (Figure 21e).
The button measures 0.54 inches (13.7 mm) in diameter and is 0.153 inches (3.9 mm)

thick. Although the back of the button has been broken off it appears that the button had a
loop shank. A loop shank is a round or flat metal wire that was bent so that both ends
would be inserted in the back of the button (Luscomb 1992:127). Glass buttons began to
appear in the 1840’s but included many forms and types of glass. The endless varieties
make it hard to date any particular glass button (Epstein 1990:45).

Figure 22.

The Union Eagle button.

A portion of a bone button was discovered during excavation (Figure 21f).
Approximately half of the button is intact and measures 0.65 inches (16.6 mm) in
diameter and is 0.098 inches (2.5 mm) thick. Unfortunately the center holes were broken
in such a way that it is hard to determine if the holes were uniform or not making it
difficult to determine if this button was machine made or not. Bone buttons have been
made mostly from the mid to late nineteenth century and were typically utilitarian, used
for such things as underwear and trousers (Luscomb 1992:25).
The final button recovered from the excavation is a small black button measuring 0.56
inches (14.1 mm) in diameter and 0.149 inches (3.8 mm) in thickness (Figure 21d). The
material in which the button is made of is presumed to be a hard rubber (Green 2008).
The interesting thing about this particular button is that it has two holes on the domed
side and one hole on the flat side. It appears as though the button holes were hand-made
based upon the lack of uniformity. There are several specks on the flat surface of what
appears to be a red paint or glaze that once covered the button.

Marbles and Bead
A wooden bead was recovered from testing (Figure 23a). The bead has been split with
roughly 60% of the bead still intact. The bead is 0.41 inches (10.4 mm) in diameter and
has a 0.098 inches (2.5 mm) wide hole running through it. The outside appears to have

been painted or had some sort of glazing. It appears to be larger than those typically used
for jewelry and its function is unclear. Two ceramic marbles were also recovered from
the site. The first marble (Figure 23b) recovered from
testing is .72 inches (18.2 mm) in diameter and
doesn’t appear to have been painted or if it had been
the paint has worn away. The second marble
measures .89 inches (22.7 mm) in diameter and does
not appear to have been painted. Clay marbles were
manufactured mainly in the last part of the nineteenth
century and into the early part of the twentieth
century (Baumann 1987:28; Zapata 1997:108).

Miscellaneous Metal
A total of 38 miscellaneous metal pieces were recovered from the testing, excavation, and
scraping. Metal items that are discussed in other sections and not included here include
square and wire nails, shotgun shells, bullets and a partial powder flask.
The testing phase employed the use of a White Promaster 6000 metal detector supplied
by Sonny Wheeler and located eleven miscellaneous metal pieces. Metal detection was
conducted on five meter transects sweeping the ground from south to north. Individual
anomalies were then excavated and when artifacts were located they were mapped,
collected, the location flagged and the depth recorded. All of the artifacts were excavated
from between 5 and 23 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).
Identifiable metal objects recovered from the site during the testing phase included a
Dutch-oven lid, an axe head, two hoe heads and a mule shoe. Various pieces of
unidentifiable oxidized metal were also recovered. A complete Dutch oven-lid was
recovered; however the top of the lid was too corroded to make out the manufacture’s
marking. The head of a western style felling axe was recovered (Barlow 2003:27) and it
appears to have been manufactures after 1877 (Sloane 2002). Two different heads to a
hoe were also recovered during metal detection. The first hoe head has a round hole for
the wooden handle. The end of the blade has rusted away leaving only a small portion of
it intact. The second head is much larger and has a long spike where the wooden handle
was attached. The blade is significantly larger than the other hoe, but both are presumed
to be common garden hoes. The mule shoe measures 5.09 inches (129.4 mm) long, 3.92
inches (99.6 mm) wide and 0.53 inches (13.5 mm) thick with a weight of 360.1 grams.
Excavation recovered 15 miscellaneous metal pieces from 1x1 meter units. The
identifiable pieces included a fish hook, tin can lid, a fork and spoon (Figure 24), two
harmonica pieces, a buckle and a bell-shaped piece. An 11/0 sized fish hook, based on the
Barlows 2008 catalog, was the only fishing implement recovered. The size of the hook
implies that it was probably used to fish for catfish in the nearby Navasota River. One of
three kitchen-related items recovered was a tin can lid with the exposed hole where the
food would have been inserted before sealing the can (Rosenberg and Kvietok ND: 74).

The remaining two kitchen related items are a fork and spoon recovered in different 1x1
units. The three-prong fork is 3.5 inches (88.9 mm) long with half of one the prongs
missing and no handle, presumably the fork had a wooden handle. The spoon is in two
pieces with the head separated from the handle but they fit together. The head is 1.5
inches (38.1 mm) wide and 1.89 inches (48.2 mm) in length, while the handle is 4.79
inches (121.9 mm) long. The two harmonica plates belonging to one or two harmonicas
were discovered in separate units. Both are 0.88 inches (22.35 mm) wide and one is 1.94
inches (49.3 mm) long while the other is 2 inches (50.8 mm) long. A small buckle
measuring 1.22 inches (30.98 mm) wide and 1.36 inches (34.54 mm) long was recovered
less than ten cm below the surface. The final metal artifact recovered was a bell shaped
piece, measuring 1.76 inches (44.7 mm) in length and 0.14 inches (3.68 mm) thick with a
small rounded pin on the back side. The front of this bell shaped piece has no markings or
etchings into the metal; it is presumed that this is a decorative piece.

The scraping of the site exposed eleven miscellaneous metal artifacts, five were
identifiable the others were not. The first of the identifiable artifacts were two mule shoes
of slightly different sizes. The first one measures 5.02 inches (127.4 mm) long, 4.614
inches (117.2 mm) wide, 0.41 inches (10.3 mm) thick and weighs 307.7 grams. The
second mule shoe measures 4.89 inches (124.4 mm) long, 4.68 inches (118.9 mm) thick,
0.32 inches (8.1 mm) thick and weighs 190.4 grams. A plow head was recovered and was
identified as belonging to a Single Tree Moldboard by Bill Young (2008). The overall
length is 9.36 inches (237.8 mm) and it has a width of 7.92 inches (201.3 mm) at the top

and 4.33 inches (110 mm) at the bottom. The thickness is 0.44 inches (11.2 mm) and the
plow head weighs 610 grams. A large metal pin was recovered during scraping. The pin
is square and measures 5.77 inches (146.7 mm) long, 0.74 inches (18.8 mm) wide and
0.68 inches (17.3 mm) thick. Finally a knife (Figure 24) was recovered which completes
the kitchen set found during excavation, the knife measures 4.24 inches (107.8 mm) long,
0.99 inches (25.3 mm) wide at the blade, 0.67 inches (17.2 mm) wide at the handle and
0.11 inches (2.9 mm) thick.
Faunal Analysis
The vertebrate faunal remains totaled 204 pieces. A more detailed report can be found in
Appendix B. The remains were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. All
faunal material was collected and bagged separately by provenience. The condition of the
remains varied from weathered to good condition.
Medium Mammal elements were the most abundant faunal remains found at the site and
totaled (n=129, 63.23%) consisting of one hundred eleven long bone shaft fragments. The
remaining medium mammal elements consisted of a partial humerus shaft, one zygomatic
process fragment, five skull fragments, seven occipital fragments, one parietal crest
fragment, two mastoid process fragments, and six rib fragments. Faunal remains of pig
(Sus scrofa) was the second highest count totaling (n=35, 17.15%) including tooth
fragments, two partial mandibles, and long bone elements. No skull, rib or vertebra
elements were identified to this species. Small Mammal elements totaled (n=10, 4.90%)
and Large Mammal elements totaled (n=8, 3.92%) with four long bone shaft fragments
being the most prevalent, one occipital bone fragment, two molar fragments, and one
scapula fragment.
Other faunal remains recovered from the site include Cottontail (Sylvilagus sp) elements
totaling (n=5, 2.45%), Map Turtle (Graptemys sp) elements totaling (n=1, 0.49%), turtle
(Testudine) elements identified totaled (n=3, 1.47%), fish (Osteichthyes) totaled (n=1,
0.49%), Rat Snake (Elaphe obsolete lindheimer) totaled (n=2, 0.98%), armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus) totaled (n=3, 1.47%), Baird’s Pocket Gopher (Geomys
breviceps Baird) elements identified to this species totaled (n=1, 0.49%), Cow/Bison
(Bos or Bison) totaled (n=1, 0.49%), and Medium Bird (chicken size) totaling (n=5,
2.45%).
Of the ten species identified in the assemblage, pig was the only identified domestic
animal. Medium mammal and pig have the most identified elements at one hundred sixty
four (80.39%) pieces. With no identified deer elements noted this may suggest that the
elements identified as medium mammal are pig but could not be identified to that species.
These elements show signs of butchering and of burning that suggest these animals may
have been butchered on a cold day in the fall or winter of the year during hog killing
time.
Even though only one element was identified as having carnivore damage, the spiral and
block fractures may have not been just from the result of the butchering process but also

caused by the inhabitants’ dogs or wild animals after the refuse was thrown out and by
trampling of larger animals such as cows or horses. The burned skull and long bone
elements indicate that meat was cooked with the bones attached or that the bones were
simply thrown into the fire for disposal.
The large mammal elements may have come from either cow or bison and the medium
bird elements may have been from domesticated chickens or wild birds of similar size.
Cottontails, turtles, and fish may have also been consumed by the inhabitants of the cabin
along with the domestic animals. The snake and gopher remains excavated were probably
due to natural death and the armadillo did not inhabit this area in the mid 1800’s.

CONCLUSIONS
A rural farmstead where the Warren Goodin family lived in the 1850s was a one room
log cabin. The setting is 4.8 miles west of the crossroads community of Carlos which was
not established until 1907 and 9.9 miles north of Piedmont Springs which was a spa and
associated one hundred room hotel before the Civil War began but was converted into a
hospital during the war. The Navasota River is 2.3 miles to the west. The only
contemporaneous log cabin site recorded during the nearby Gibbons Creek Lake and
Lignite Mine survey is the Peters Cabin which is a double-pen structure with a dog trot
between the pens. The cabin appears to have had twice the interior space of the Goodin
cabin. A chimney was in the center of the east wall but it is no longer present. Initially the
cabin was supplied with water from a rock-lined well but in the 1870s a cistern was built
for water storage. Like Goodin, the Peters Cabin is also situated on a knoll overlooking a
drainage. Both farmstead locations are in rural Grimes County.
The nail assemblage suggests that the structure was a log cabin that had a frame addition
and a wood covered roof. The high percentage of cut nails and low count of wire nails
suggests occupation during the 1850’s. The ceramic assemblage presents primarily
utilitarian wares which are expected at a rural residence. Two pieces of blue transferware
and blue feather-edge whiteware dated to the mid-nineteenth century. Brown, and clear
glass makes up 66% of the total glass assemblage. Brown bottle glass became popular
during the mid to late 1800’s. Numerous hand-turned snuff bottle necks were recovered
and date to the second half of the nineteenth century. A complete beer bottle
manufactured by the Wisconsin Glass Company was made between 1882 to 1886.
Several bullet cartridges and shotgun shells recovered from the excavation dated to from
1867 to 1910. A .54 caliber carbine two ring bullet was recovered during metal detection
and dates to the mid-nineteenth century. A French gunflint from a flintlock pistol was
recovered but a date is hard to determine except that flintlock guns were largely replaced
by the end of the Civil War. Along with the gunflint, a portion of a double flute pistol
powder flask used with a flintlock pistol was recovered. The same type of pistol powder
flask is shown in a July 1883 issue of the James Dixon & Sons “Sporting Tackle”
catalog.
Several miscellaneous items were recovered from the site. Several buttons, including a
black glass and Union Eagle button were recovered. Black glass buttons began to appear
in the 1840’s and the Union Eagle button is dated to the Civil War/ Indian War era. A
couple of clay marbles were recovered that date to the last part of the nineteenth century
and early into the twentieth century. A western style felling axe that was recovered from
the site was manufactured after 1877.
Based on the 1850 and 1860 Censuses, cotton and corn were the primary crops raised in
the county. Large herds of cattle, hogs, and sheep were maintained and were consumed
by the residents. Mules and oxen were the primary draft animals present. Much of the

land had not yet been broken for cultivation. The cleared area just north of the Goodin
site probably served as farmland where corn and cotton were grown and where a family
garden was maintained in order to provide vegetables and fruit for immediate
consumption, for dehydration, and possibly for canning even though the glass fragments
did not show a significant number of bottling jars and canning was not a common
housewife activity in the 1850s (Toulouse 1977:108-111). Unfortunately, no evidence of
these crops was recovered during excavation but the presence of mule shoes and part of a
single moldboard plow are no doubt tied to farming on the property.
The house appears to have been a single pen log cabin that was entered from the north
side after accessing the stoop and door via the serpentine walkway. Although it is not
unusual to have walkways in 1900s rural farmsteads, this is the only recorded evidence of
such a feature in this area at such an early time. The rock chimney and associated hearth
were in the center of the south wall opposite the only door. A sturdy rock chimney base
appears to have been sufficient to have supported a rock chimney to a height above the
roof but the rock found in the chimney fall was not sufficient to have made a roof high
chimney and some of the rock may have been robbed, making the site even less visible
when first recorded. It is also possible that a partial cat chimney served as the upper part
of the chimney (Coleman and Guendling 2000:36-38; Touchstone 1987). It is also
interesting to note that the hearth did not present a smooth burned rock or clay surface
while many cabins of this period had intricately prepared hearths (Skinner 1998:Figure
4).
The apparent absence of a rock foundation is unusual in that most cabins with wooden
floors are elevated and leveled above the ground in order to slow log degradation and
also to allow for cooling by winds/air flowing easily under the structure. Structural
elevation is frequently done with rocks as at the Coho Smith site in Parker County
(Whorton and Skinner 1995:18) but was also done using trunk sections from cypress,
bois d’arc, or oak trees (Jordan 1978:32-33). This may be an indication that the floor was
on the ground but this has not been conclusively demonstrated. Although no logs remain,
it is likely that the corners were joined with half-dovetail notches which Jordan
(1978:Table 4-6) says are most common in the 1850s. The cabin may have looked like
the single pen cabin at The Shores in Navarro County (Skinner and Craver 2008:Figures
4-10) which was recently tree-ring dated to 1852. Based on the small number of early
window glass fragments, it is likely that only a single window was present. The squarecut nails in the sheet midden and inside the structure were probably used to attach vertical
slats to the log walls over which boards, cloth, or wall paper may have been placed.
The family was apparently largely self sufficient and either did not have access to a wide
variety of commercially manufactured goods or did not have the funds to purchase items
that were in the general store or available from traveling merchants. Certainly metal
items, particularly nails were purchased but apparently were salvaged for reuse despite
the common breakage associated with the extraction of square cut nails from wood or
logs. Most of the metal artifacts are attributed to the house construction, farming or
hunting/protection, and to food generating activities in the form of a large barbed hook
that may have been used to fish for catfish. The fancier buttons may have been on the

wife’s clothing but the most abundant artifact generally contributed to women are the
snuff bottle fragments. The marbles may be attributed to children but could have
belonged to the adults.
The absence of metal cans and canning jars is considered typical in this rural setting in
the mid-1800s but if we read between the lines, the Goodin family must have been
subsistence farmers who raised or grew most of their own food. They probably had a
family garden where they grew food for immediate consumption or dried or smoked
whatever possible to allow them to be able to sustain themselves over the winter. They
certainly consumed pork on a regular basis but no good evidence of cow or poultry
consumption was found nor was anything present that demonstrates that the Goodins
were living off the land by hunting or trapping and the only evidence of fishing was a
large metal fishhook.
With the major occupation occurring during the 1850s, the list of sites with comparable
age and artifact assemblages decreased substantially. In Grimes County, The Peters
Cabin site (41GM155) dates to the early 1840s or the mid 1850s based on archival
research (Rogers et al 1993:131), thus making it comparable to the Goodin site based on
relative close proximity, setting, and time. The Peters Cabin is 9,400 meters to the east
and sits atop a ridge overlooking Peach Creek (Rogers et al 1993:39) which is similar to
the setting of the Goodin site, which rests on a knoll above Alum Creek. Other than time
frame and setting the two sites are very different. The Peters Cabin has a mortared bellshaped cistern associated with the structure as well as a privy, neither of which were
found at the Goodin site. The structures were also very different, with the Peters Cabin
being a square notched double-pen log dwelling with an enclosed dogtrot plan and the
Goodin site being a one-pen structure with a rock chimney on the south wall. Only
shovel testing was conducted at the Peters Cabin and artifacts like ceramics, glass, and
miscellaneous metal were located but not described in the report.
Of the testing and excavations done in the Richland Creek Archaeological Project, three
sites are contemporary with the Goodin site. The Baker Farmstead (41NV145), the
Burleson Plantation (41NV235), and site 41NV386, which was not tested until 2008 by
AR Consultants. 41NV386 now called the Log Cabin at The Shores, was probably moved
to its current location in the late 1800s but dendrochronology dates cutting of the cabin
logs to the 1850s. Artifacts recovered from the excavation date it to post-1880s (Skinner
and Craver 2008:26) supporting the idea that it was moved to that location. The structure
consists of half-dovetail notched logs creating a one-pen cabin, with an opening on all
four walls and a mud cat chimney on the west wall (Skinner & Craver 2008:26). None of
artifacts recovered from this site date as early as some of the artifacts from Goodin, so a
meaningful comparison is not possible.
The research design section of this report spells out several questions to be answered as
part of this study. Compared to the site types at Richland Creek, the Goodin site is much
smaller than the few contemporary like the Baker Farmstead (41NV145) and the
Burleson Plantation (41NV235). The artifact assemblages of these sites are similar, with
square-cut nails, ceramics, bottle glass, and miscellaneous items like buttons, marbles,

harmonica fragments, and tobacco pipe fragments being present. The artifact assemblages
closer to the turn of the century are differences, since the later artifacts are largely absent
at Goodin. The early artifact assemblages may resemble each other because of the close
proximity in time and their rural nature, but they differ because there is an obvious
difference in the socioeconomic position of these residents. The residents of the Baker
Farmstead and the Burleson Plantation were white households and had larger structures,
more land, and the Burleson Plantation definitely had slaves living there. The two
households at Richland Creek had double-pen structures each with a chimney as well as
brick-lined cisterns and even a well, none of these were discovered at Goodin. The
consumer behavior of the residents at the Goodin and at the Richland Creek project is
comparable. Moir’s analysis of ceramic assemblages shows that rural households
preferred inexpensive, plain tablewares during the mid-nineteenth century, with higher
artifact counts of whiteware and ironstone compared to other types (Moir 1987:120).
This is exactly the case at the Goodin site, where 75% of the ceramics were whiteware
and ironstone, with only a couple of pieces of transferwares, earthenwares, and porcelain.
The Burleson Plantation was excavated and documented in a similar fashion to the
Goodin site. In total, 201 50 cm square units were excavated on an 8m grid to define the
sheet midden (Moir 1987:121). Moir states that the sheet midden from the Burelson
Plantation provides some important distinctions as related to upper socioeconomic status,
in that it was nearly twice the size of any other sheet middens recorded and associated
with the smaller landowner or tenant farmer (Moir 1987:123). This sheet midden is
nearly six times larger than the one at the Goodin site, and this most likely due to the fact
that they are in two different economic status groups. Moir goes on to say that the
Burleson Plantation had the largest percentage of architectural artifacts composing nearly
¾ of the artifact assemblage, whereas fewer than half the artifacts from Goodin are
architectural. This site is a good contrast to Goodin, since they represent two different
socioeconomic classes within the similar setting and time frame.
The most comparable site with the Goodin site, in relation to artifact assemblages is the
Baker Farmstead. While the methodology for data collection between the two is similar,
the Baker Farmstead was a larger facility and the 50 cm square units were laid out on a
much tighter grid than at Goodin. In total, 272 of these units were laid out on a 4 meter
grid and then an additional 282 units were laid out on a 2 meter grid in the site center
(Moir 1987:108), giving them a very larger and denser artifact count. The sheet midden at
this site was three times larger than at Goodin. The artifact assemblages from the Baker
Farmstead are similar in a few ways to the Goodin artifacts, but a comparison of
assemblage totals is futile. Not only are these two sites similar in age, but are closer in
economic status than the Burleson Plantation. The Baker Farmstead was a larger and
longer occupied site than was Goodin, but similar artifacts were recovered from both
excavations. Moir reports an architectural artifact assemblage that was roughly half of the
entire assemblage, which is the same case at Goodin, other than that the assemblages are
not very comparable due to the longer occupation and dense testing. However, similar
artifacts were recovered from both in respect to gun cartridges and shells, as well as
tobacco pipe fragments, harmonica fragments, and eating utensils (Moir 1987:112).

Given these commonalities in the types of artifacts, it shows that these people were from
similar economic standing and lived in comparable ways.
As an example of a rural cabin, the structure differs with regard to the location of the
door, the hearth, and the front of the residence. The estimated size of the structure
compares favorably too many of the single-pen cabins that have been recorded in Texas.
However, many cabins have their doorway facing a transportation route in such a way
that the prevailing winds are not able to flow in the door and continue directly across the
hearth and up the chimney (Jordan 1978:109). Typically the chimney was at the end of
the roof line and the door was in the center of one of the long walls. At Goodin, the door
was not in the west end so it was out of the prevailing east-west wind pattern but the door
was opposite the hearth and this may have made for a smoky atmosphere inside the house
as well as for the rapid consumption of fuel. The access road from the north must have
ended on the north side of the cabin so the door was logically in that wall. However, the
chimney was built opposite the door and not in the east end of the structure so it appears
that the roof line must have been oriented north-south rather than east-west and this is an
unusual pattern even if the cabin was a square pen. Equally interesting is the presence of
the serpentine stone walkway which is rare in cabins because most cabins had a roofed
front porch which this cabin must not have had.
Excavation of the Goodin site has added a new facet to our understanding of a rural
Upland South farming family which has been referred to in Southern Arkansas as
yeoman farmers (Coleman and Guendling 2000:30). Yeoman farmers were essentially
self-sufficient and must have emphasized production of corn and pork although it is
difficult to understand why the Goodins did not utilize the wild resources of the land in a
significant way or why they did not ride horses or eat beef. They lived in an isolated
setting near the western edge of the South and at good distances from shopping centers
and their life seem to have been little affected by national political or economic events.
They do not appear to have lived here after the end of the Civil War. In the future,
surveys should focus on locating sites that date to this early statehood period as at present
we have a very shallow understanding of their way of life on the peripheries of Texas.

Faunal Analysis for 41GM410
Art Tawater

The vertebrate faunal remains from 41GM410 a mid 1800’s log cabin site in Grimes
County, Texas totaled (n=204). The remains were identified to the lowest taxonomic
level possible. All faunal material was collected and bagged separately by provenience.
The condition of the remains varied from weathered to good condition.
The remains were analyzed using the comparative collection of the author and
comparative publications by Sobolik and Steele (1996), Sisson and Grossman (1953), and
Davis and Schmidly (1994). Data recorded included unit designation, provenience,
taphonomic identification, element, portion of element, cultural modification, carnivore
and rodent modification, type of fracture, and length of measurable long bone and long
bone shaft fragments in millimeters, see (Table 1).
Pig (Sus scrofa) elements totaled (n=35, 17.15%) with twenty eight of these elements
being molar or molar fragments, canine tooth fragments, premolar and premolar
fragments, and incisor and incisor fragments. Two partial mandibles with molars in place
were used in aging these animals. Mandible 1 with m1, m2, and m3 in place was aged at
between 18-20 months. M1 and m2 were fully erupted with m3 just erupting above the
socket. Mandible 2 with m2 and m3 in place with both heavily worn down to the top of
the socket and the m3 showing caries could only be aged to an older adult.
Long bone elements totaled six and included two tarsal bones, two partial right tibias, one
partial left humerus with three cut marks on the shaft, one left ulna with four chop marks
on the side of the trochlear notch probably made while separating the radius and ulna
from the humerus during the butchering process. This element also had five cut marks on
the caudal edge of the shaft probably made while skinning out the animal. No skull, rib or
vertebra elements were identified to this species. One right tibia and the left humerus
were both spirally fractured and the tibia also had rodent gnawing on the shaft. Carnivore
damage was noted on one right tibia and none showed signs of burning. The MNI of two
for this species is based on the two partial mandibles with molars attached and the two
partial right tibias.
Cottontail (Sylvilagus sp) elements totaled (n=5, 2.45%)) with one left femur, one left
calcaneus, one right pelvis, one radius, and one distal tibia fragment. No cut marks,
burning, carnivore or rodent damage was noted on these elements.
Map Turtle (Graptemys sp) elements totaled (n=1, 0.49%) with a partial left illia the only
element identified to this species. No burning or modification was noted on this element.
Turtle (Testudine) elements identified totaled (n=3, 1.47%) with one plastron fragment,
one proximal end of a coracoid, and one unidentified long bone shaft fragment.

Fish (osteichthyes) totaled (n=1, 0.49%) and was represented by one vertebra.
Rat Snake (Elaphe obsolete lindheimer) totaled (n=2, 0.98%) with two vertebra identified
to this species.
Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus) totaled (n=3, 1.47%) and is represented by
two bone plate fragments and one small pelvis. The pelvis was from either a neonatal or
newborn individual. The common occurrence of this species developed largely since
1900 and records do show their occurrence in Grimes County at this early date (Davis
and Schmidly 1996).
Baird’s Pocket Gopher (Geomys breviceps Baird) elements identified to this species
totaled (n=1, 0.49%) and consisted of one left femur.
Cow/Bison (Bos or Bison) totaled (n=1, 0.49%) and was represented by one tibial tarsal
bone.
Medium Bird (chicken size) these remains totaled (n=5, 2.45%) and consisted of
elements that were identified as two long bone shaft fragments, two partial scapulas and
one femur with both the proximal and distal ends modified by gnawing. The size of these
fragments suggests that they may have come from a domesticated chicken or a wild bird
of that size. No burning was noted on these elements.
Small Mammal elements totaled (n=10, 4.90%) long bone shaft fragments that were
identified to this category with only one spiral fracture noted. These elements were rabbit
size and may be from this species but identification to a lower taxon was not possible due
to the fragmentary nature of these elements.
Medium Mammal elements totaled (n=129, 63.23%) and consisted of one hundred eleven
long bone shaft fragments with twenty six of these elements having spiral fractures, two
with block fractures, two flakes, nine were burned to a charred state, two were rodent
gnawed, one with two chop marks, and one had three cut marks.
The remaining medium mammal elements consisted of a partial humerus shaft with a
spiral fracture, one zygomatic process fragment that was burned to a charred state, five
skull fragments, seven occipital fragments, one parietal crest fragment, two mastoid
process fragments, and six rib fragments.
Large Mammal elements totaled (n=8, 3.92%) with four long bone shaft fragments being
the most prevalent, one occipital bone fragment, two molar fragments, and one scapula
fragment.
The vertebrate faunal remains excavated from 41GM410 totaled two hundred and four
elements. Of the ten species identified in the assemblage pig was the only identified
domestic animal. Medium mammal and pig have the most identified elements at one
hundred sixty four (80.39%) combined in the assemblage. With no identified deer

elements noted this may suggest that the elements identified as medium mammal are pig
but could not be identified to that species. These elements show signs of butchering and
of burning that suggest these animals may have been butchered historically on a cold day
in the fall or winter of the year during hog killing time.
Even though only one element was identified as having carnivore damage the spiral and
block fractures may have not been just from the result of the butchering process but also
caused by the inhabitants dogs or wild animals after the refuse was thrown out and by
trampling of larger animals such as cows or horses. The burned skull and long bone
elements indicate that meat was cooked with the bones attached or that the bones were
simply thrown into the fire for disposal.
The large mammal elements may have come from either cow or bison and the medium
bird elements may have been from domestic chickens or wild birds of similar size.
Cottontails, turtles, and fish may have also been consumed by the inhabitants of the cabin
along with the domestic animals. The snake and gopher remains excavated were probably
due to natural death and the armadillo did not inhabit this area in the mid 1800’s.
