MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
As a prerequisite for application for a permit to surface mine
lignite deposits in an 15,326 acre tract, the Cummins Creek Prospect,
the Lower Colorado River Authority sponsored an intensive cultural
resource survey by the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of
Texas at Austin. The prospect lies on the upland divide between the
Brazos and Colorado rivers and encompasses portions of two minor
drainage systems tributary to the Colorado - Rabbs and Cummins creeks.
The study area lies wholly within Fayette County, south-southeast of
the town of Ledbetter, and is bordered on the northwest by the Lee
County line.
The central portion of the prospect, an area of approximately
6,100 acres is designated as the primary mining zone: 7,200 acres of
buffer zone will contain auxiliary facilities.
An additional 1,870
acres of southwestern end of the prospect is considered as the
extended buffer zone.
Access to 2,037 acres was not obtained,
reducing the areal coverage to 13,288 acres. The unsurveyed blocks
will be included in the next phase of culural resource study in the
Prospect.
Previous archeological work in the immediate vicinity of the
prospect has resulted in the description of the area as a transitional
zone between East, Central and Coastal Texas cultures. A summary of
known site locations and their physiographic zones was compiled as a
settlement model to be tested by this survey. It was expected that in
an upland area such as the Prospect, prehistoric settlement would
concentrate along the minor drainages.
The scarcity of permanent
water,
coupled with
generally
infertile soils, were factors
contributing to the late colonization of the area, largely by German
immigrants.
Although two early roads, the Goacher and Wilbarger
traces, had been laid out through the prospect in the 1830 1 s, actual
settlement was delayed until the 1850 1 s. Based on the model set forth
by Jordan (1966) for nearby Austin and Waller counties, it was assumed
that
the new immigrants would quickly adopt established Anglo
practices, losing their ethnicity at an early date.
The intensive survey was conducted between April 12 and October
21, 1982 under the field supervision of Bruce A. Nightengale and
Leland C.
Bement.
Historic research was conducted by Jack M.
Jackson.
The prehistoric research design was compiled by David G.
Robinson.
All aspects of the study were generally under
the
superv1s1on of the project director, Solveig A. Turpin, and the
principal investigator, David S. Dibble. Two hundred ninety-one days
were expended on the field work; analyses and report preparation were
accomplished by Bruce A. Nightengale and Jack M.
Jackson, assisted
by the TAS editorial staff and the project director, during the period
from October 21, 1982 to February 20, 1983.

Field survey was accomplished by pedestrian transect coverage.
All exposures such as cutbanks, gullies, gravel quarries, and road
beds were emphasized; limited subsurface probes were dug at all
prehistoric sites to determine the depth and extent of cultural
deposits and to assess their context. All standing structures over 50
years old were recorded as historic sites; structural sketches were
made of each building. Archival research was conducted to determine
the builders and subsequent occupants of historic sites and to assess
the basis of the economy.
All sites were recorded on standard
University of Texas survey forms and later transferred to State of
Texas Archeological Site Data forms, photographed, and plotted on
three sets of maps. Artifact collection was limited to items of value
in determining site function or age. All documentation is curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas
at Austin.
Fifty six prehistoric and 34 historic sites were recorded in the
13,288 acres available for survey. Prehistoric site distribution was
striking in the preference for creekside habitation. Only five sites
were recorded on the more remote uplands and even these were on the
fringes of minor tributaries.
Based on survey data, three hypotheses were derived and form the
basis for recommendations for further testing at 20 prehistoric sites.
It is proposed that 1) the differential resource potentials of the two
drainage basins resulted in encampments of longer duration along the
pooled or spring-fed waters of the Rabbs system.
Conversely, the
lithic
resources
of
the Cummins system would have attracted
prehistoric groups to the less reliable streams for procurement of raw
materials.
Comparison
of
site
characteristics
and artifact
assemblages from a representative sample from three physiographic
zones is recommended as a test of Hypothesis I.
A second proposition assumes that if the motivation
for
prehistoric site preference, the distribution of natural resources,
was a constant through time, then the settlement pattern would also be
constant.
The acquisition of temporally diagnostic artifacts by
subsurface testing is essential to the evaluation of Hypothesis II.
The work of previous researchers in the region has resulted in
the third hypothesis presented as a rationale for site testing. Seen
as a transitional zone between East, Central and Coastal Texas
cultures, the Prospect sites may contribute to the delineation of
spheres or times of influence by, or interaction with, adjacent
peoples.
The four cemeteries within the Prospect were accorded Â·historic
site status because they contain the graves of early settlers and
unique
headstones.
Seven
historic
sites
merit
additional
investigation to determine if they meet criteria for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places and to assemble a record of early
German
influence on building practices.
A folk architectural
consultant should assess the standing structures at the John Moss
ii

homestead (41FY284).
These cabins are probably of National Register
quality but further archival research, subsurface archeological
testing, and photogrammetric recording are necessary to determine such
eligibility. Two log structures on the Albers property (41F272) may
have served as the home and school of an early German teacher.
Subsurface testing is recommended to determine the original use of
these early buildings. Three structures, the Wendler house (41FY280),
the Wehrmeister homestead (41FY294), and the Bernhausen-Koopman house
(41FY297) are examples of folk architecture which should be further
recorded and researched. The Drawe house (41FY300) was included as an
historic structure with potentially significant architecture but
house
has negated
subsequent sale and relocation of the
recommendations for its future treatment. Many structures in the town
of Ledbetter are of sufficient age, design, and condition to warrant
their inclusion in and designation as a Historic District.

Abstract

From July 12 through October 21, 1982, the Texas Archeological
Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted an intensive
survey of the cultural resources of the Cummins Creek Prospect,
Fayette County, Texas for the Lower Colorado River Authority. This
15,326 acre tract is under consideration for lignite surface m1n1ng.
The Prospect lies on the upland divide between the Brazos and Colorado
rivers and incorporates two minor creek systems
the Rabbs and
Cummins drainage basins.
A model of prehistoric settlement derived
from previous work in Fayette County was tested by this survey.
Hypotheses concerning the adaptation of German settlers to Anglo
patterns of agricultural and domestic life provided the basis for the
historic research design. Pedestrian survey of over 13,000 acres of
accessible land resulted in the recording of 56 prehistoric and 34
historic
sites.
Generally,
data
acquired confirmed expected
prehistoric and historic settlement patterns.
The distribution of
prehistoric occupations was striking in the preference for creekside
habitation; only five sites were found on upland intefluves.
Except
for some anomalies in house construction, historic sites conform to
the expectation that German immigrants quickly adopted established
Anglo techniques of building, settlement dispersal, and agricultural
practices.
Seven historic sites merit additional archival
and
architectural study.
One of these, 41FY284, an early log cabin,
probably meets criteria for National Register of Historic Places
nomination.
Twenty
prehistoric sites hold some potential for
resolving hypotheses generated from survey data and previous research.
Testing hypotheses were formulated from observed differences in
artifact assemblages and natural resource distribution between the two
minor drainage systems in the Prospect and from the concept of the
Prospect region as a transitional zone between East, Central and
Coastal Texas cultures.

INTRODUCTION
In compliance with prov1s1ons of the State Surface Mining Act,
prerequisite to application for lignite surface mining, the Lower
Colorado River Authority sponsored an intensive survey of the cultural
resources of the Cummins Creek Prospect, an area of approximately
1).
Conducted by the
15,326 acres in Fayette County, Texas (Fig.
Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, the
survey was designed to comply with the National Historic Preservation
Act
of
1966 and its regulations (36CFR800) and the National
Environmental Policy Act and its related regulations (50CFR4) as
implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency. This cultural
resource assessment conforms to criteria and guidelines set forth by
the Texas Historical Commission for Phase II intensive survey and
recommendations offered by the Council of Texas Archeologists.
The study area encompasses over 15,000 acres of the upland divide
between the Brazos and Colorado rivers and included portions of two
minor drainage systems, Rabbs and Cummins creeks.
A settlement
pattern model derived from previous work in the area and tested in
this survey, suggested prehistoric occupations would center on these
minor drainways.
The scarcity of permanent water and the generally
infertile soils led to late colonization of the area by largely German
immigrants.
The historic research design postulated that these
settlers quickly adopted the established Anglo agricultural practices,
losing ethnic individuality.
Additionally, emphasis was placed on
tracing the routes of two early roads known to traverse the project
area.
Access to some 2,000 acres of the Prospect, not leased by the
LCRA, was denied, reducing the areal coverage to just over 13,000
acres. Development of the proposed lignite mine will directly affect
6,100 acres designated as the primary mining zone. A 7,200 acre
buffer zone will contain auxiliary facilities.

2

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
LOCATION
The LCRA's prospective lignite m1n1ng area is just south of the
town of Ledbetter in the northern corner of Fayette County. The
Lee/Fayette county line is northwest of the Prospect and
the
Washington/Fayette line is to the north. The Prospect is irregularly
shaped but, in general, Highway 290 is the northern boundary, the Lee
County line the western, and County Road 111 the eastern. Specified
property lines mark the southern border.
GEOLOGY
The study area is on the West Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1935).
This plain is made up of geologic formations of Cretaceous age in the
northwest and Pleistocene formations in the southeast which run in
generally northeast-southwest bands paralleling the coast. Three
formations and two gravel deposits are evident in the study area
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). The Late Eocene Manning Formation
contains clay, sandstone and petrified wood.
Outcroppings of this
formation between Jones and Owl creeks (Rabbs Creek Basin) make up
approximately five percent of the study area. The Whitsett Formation,
formed during the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene, is of sandstone with
quantities of petrified wood. It outcrops in another five percent of
the area, along the southeast side of Jones Creek from approximately
County Road 134 to the southwest limit of the Prospect. The Catahoula
Formation is a Miocene sandstone formation making up about five
percent of the area along the northwest part of FM 1245 at the
confluence of Flat and Cummins creeks, and a small pocket along the
north side of Cummins east of FM 1291.
In the majority of the study area, these three formations are
overlain by Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits extending south and
west of Highway 290. These deposits have been identified as Uvalde
gravels (Byrd 1971), lag deposits which rest on formations of varying
age and are believed to be redeposited Tertiary materials from the
Ogallala Formation of the Llano Estacado (Byrd 1971:5). Lithic
material associated with the Uvalde gravel varies throughout central
Texas but is basically composed of pebble-to-cobble-sized quartz,
quartzite, chert, jasper, granite and silicified wood.
The most
abundant lithic materials in the study area are cobbles of quartzite
and chert which were a ready supply of raw materials for stone tools
throughout prehistory. Commercial exploitation of these same gravels
in the twentieth century has destroyed some of the prehistoric record.
HYDROLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY
the

The study area is in the uplands of the Colorado River Basin on
southern crest and slopes of the interfluvial divide between the

CUMMINS CREEK

3

Brazos River Basin to the northeast and the Colorado River Basin to
the southwest.
Cummins Creek runs through the norteast part of the
study area. Rabbs Creek is not actually within the Prospect Â·but is
fed by two deeply-cut west-flowing tributaries, Owl and Jones creeks,
which begin in the southern part of the Prospect. At the time of the
survey, Jones Creek held an adequate supply of pooled water and,
according to local informants, was historically a good spring-fed
water supply during dry spells.
Cummins Creek is fed by numerous
intermittent tributaries but the major portion of flow enters from the
northwest and west. The named tributaries that are the headwaters of
CumminsÂ·Creek include, from northwest to southeast, West Fork, Pin Oak
and Turkey creeks. Alexander Branch, named for Amos Alexander whose
grave is on the north bank, flows into Pin Oak Creek.
On the
northeast are Mile Branch and Violet and Flat creeks. Cummins Creek
is an intermittent stream; it was pooled at the beginning of field
work but flowed during the later part of the survey, after the Fall
rains began.
In order to retard overbank flooding along Cummins Creek, the
Soil Conservation Service has dammed three drainages: West Fork, at
the county line; Mile Branch and Violet Creek, at their confluence;
and Turkey Creek, just west of its juncture with Cummins Creek.
The Gulf Coast aquifer,Â· formed partially in the Catahoula
sandstone, is the primary one for the western section of Fayette
County (Brune 1975).
Reliable water sources greatly influenced
prehistoric occupation of this area and also affected early historic
settlement.
CLIMATE AND VEGETATION
Interdependent aspects of climate and
vegetation
in
the
prehistoric environment have been studied in Central Texas through the
pollen analyses of three peat bogs in Gonzales and Lee counties, and
one archeological site in Travis County (Bryant 1969). Briefly, the
results of these studies indicated a decline in woodland vegetation
from mixed deciduous during the full glacial period through parkland
vegetation in the late glacial to the present savannah of oak,
This decline in woodland communities is a

result of the trend from moist to drier climate.
The highest rainfall in Fayette County occurs in April through
June and September; the average maximum is September's 4.53 in (Dallas
Morning News 1980-81). The driest months are January, March, July and
August with the minimum average moisture (1.94 in) received in March.
The average annual temperature ranges from a maximum of 96 degrees F
in July to a minimum of 42 degrees F in January.
Present vegetation in Fayette County consists of an overstory of
post oak, blackjack oak and hickory, and an understory of little
bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, purpletop, and long-spike silver
bluestem (Gould 1973:
3), a group Gould terms Post Oak Savannah.
Geographically, this savannah extends from the Texas- Oklahoma border

in the northeast to Bexar and Wilson counties in the southwest,
between the Pineywoods of East Texas, the Gulf Prairie and marshes to
the southeast, and the Blackland Prairie to the northwest.
FAUNA
The mammalian array in Fayette County includes the opposum, least
shrew, badger, red fox, striped skunk, ringtail, raccoon, gray fox,
coyote, bobcat, fox squirrel, plains pocket gopher, various mice and
rats, and white tail deer (Davis 1978). During the field work, the
crew sighted white tail deer, pocket gophers, cottontails, water
snakes, water moccasins, common king snakes, turkey vultures, black
vultures, various hawks and one caracara.
SOILS
The following brief descriptions of the soil types in the project
area are as mapped and described by the Soil Conservation Service
(1978-81). The most extensive are the Falba, Tremona, and Arol (Table
1).
These soils are similar in that they are incohesive, sandy and
poorly drained. Only about 245 acres of the more than 15,000 in the
project area are considered prime farmland.
This lack of highly
productive soil accounts, in large part, for the rather late historic
settlement of the area.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Fayette County lies within a transitional zone between east,
coastal, and central Texas cultures, with the latter providing the
predominant influence.
Evidence for this
melange
comes
from
comparison of projectile point types and pottery collected during
archeological surface surveys and, in some cases, subsurface testing.
A thoughtful and succinct explanation of the tricultural influence and
archeological background for Fayette County can be found in Skelton
(1977:13-16).
Since Skelton wrote his excellent regional and local background,
new data has come to light which reinforces the concept of an
interactive region. Hall (1981) found good examples of differing
cultural influences at Allens Creek in Austin County. Intensive
excavations took place at three prehistoric sites and testing at
twelve.
All
were located on a bluff overlooking the Brazos
floodplain. Two of the sites, 41AU36 and 41AU37, were stratified
deposits containing burials and occupational debris. Components of
41AU36 date to the Middle Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric; 41AU37 had Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric components. The third intensively excavated site is a

burial-associated goods, quantities of burials and
occupational
debris, Hall has suggested that an eastern influenced, import-export
sphere prevailed during the Late Archaic and declined during the
Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric, or from about 400 to 800
A.O. (Hall 1981:308). A variable associated with this interaction
was a marked increase in population size during the Late Archaic
followed by decline in the Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods.
Artifact assemblages suggest influences from central,
coastal, and East Texas, and from further east, during the Middle
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric.
Since Skelton's (1977) report, a number of surveys have been

Power Plant, were transmission line surveys conducted by TAS for the
LCRA (Brown and Kenmotsu 1980; Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980; Robinson
1982). The first, Kenmotsu and Freeman (1980), a transmission line
survey through Bastrop, Caldwell and Fayette Counties, located 37
prehistoric sites and 21 historic localities.
Twenty-four of the
prehistoric and 17 of the historic sites were in Fayette County and
the majority lie south of the Colorado River.
Brown and Kenmotsu
(1980) reported on test excavations conducted at three prehistoric
sites and one historic site. Two of the prehistoric and the one
historic site are located in Fayette County. Robinson's (1982) survey
of the proposed Fayette to Salem transmission line identified only two
sites but resulted in the compilation of prehistoric settlement
pattern data used in the research design for Cummins Creek.
Another

CUMMINS CREEK

7

transmission line survey (Laurens, Guy, and Prewitt 1979) for the
Fayette Electric Cooperative recorded 20 new sites and re-evaluated
seven previously recorded sites.
Some speculation about the transitional nature of this region has
been presented by various researchers. Skelton (1977:123) does not
rule out local adaptation by an intermediate cultural group in the
area but largely supports the idea of groups influenced by diffusion
of stylistic ideas from peripheral cultural groups.
Fullem (1977)
examined and compared dart point types found at the Black Hopper Site
(41FY25) with points found at various places in Texas.
Archaic dart
points from that site were compared with such classic types as
Bulverde, Wells, and Godley and were found to possess distinct
morphological attributes. Fullem suggests that the variation in
" ... Archaic projectile points from the
Black
Hopper site illustrates the mixture of artifacts
and traits that would be expected from an exchange
among the three coterminous cultural areas
central, east and coastal." (Fullem 1977:29).
The mechanisms which result in the observed point varieties are a
focus of the recommendations for further testing of sites in the
Cummins Creek Prospect.
Skelton (1977:118) also suggests that because of the abundance of
chert cobbles in the upland area along Cedar Creek, groups from
different geographic areas may have exploited these resources. Eighty
percent of the present study area is overlain by Quaternary fluviatile
terrace deposits of gravels containing large quantities of chert and
quartzite; two percent more is overlain by the Manning Formation which
contains quantities of workable petrified wood.
These deposits,
readily available along the banks of Cummins Creek, could have made
this a very desirable lithic procurement area. Located on the divide
between the Brazos and Colorado River basins, the Prospect would have
been easily accessible to groups from both basins, as well as from the
northwest and southeast.
Peterson (1965:54) questioned if the pottery found at 41BU1
(Erwin Bridge Site) was made locally or traded in from the coast.
Prewitt (1982:218) makes a good case for either direct contact with
the coast or extensive trade during the San Marcos Phase (2600-2250
BP) at Loeve-Fox Site (41WM230). His argument is based on a conch
columela bead associated with a cremated burial and a marginella bead
found in association with a hearth.
Prewitt uses the technology
involved in the manufacture of the conch bead as an argument in favor
of an extensive trade network with the coast.
This interpretation
suggests that the transitional zone was traversed by movement of goods
to and from the coast, movement of people to and from the coast, or
the use of the transitional zone as a tri-cultural interactive sphere.
These speculations form the basis for hypotheses derived from the
results of this survey.
and provide the rationale for the limited
testing program presented in the Recommendations section.

Though the study area is one of cultural heterogeneity, that of
Central Texas is the dominant influence. Therefore, the following
chronology will be used in understanding temporal placement of
artifacts and subsequent cultural change.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (prior to 10,000 to 8,000 BP)
The evidence for this, the earliest known cultural period in
Texas prehistory, is based in Central Texas on surface finds and
excavatedÂ·material. Buried cultural deposits associated with this
period have been unearthed by the Levi Rockshelter on the Pedernales
River (Alexander 1963), the Loeve Site (Eddy 1973; Prewitt 1982),
Tombstone Bluff on the San Gabriel River (Prewitt 1974a, 1982), and
41BX52 on the outskirts of San Antonio (Henderson 1980).
Stone tool
types known to be assignable to the Paleoindian occuaption of the
region are Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Angostura
and Golondrina lanceolate points.
Direct stratigraphic associations for the traditionally accepted
subsistence of Paleoindian groups, that of dependence on now-extinct
Pleistocene megafauna, is lacking in Central Texas.
It is assumed
that here their economy depended upon hunting and gathering, a mode of
existence which was retained until the time of contact with the first
Europeans.
ARCHAIC PERIOD (8,500 to 1,250 BP)
The Archaic hunters and gatherers of Central Texas were highly
dependent on variable environmental factors - the availability of
water, game and edible vegetation. Tool kits included contracting and
expanding stem dart points, food processing tools such as manes and
metates, and various auxilliary implements. Based on the changes that
took place within the tool kit and other cultural markers, such as the
increase and decrease of burned rock middens, a cultural construct
containing eleven chronological phases for the Central Texas area has
been proposed by Prewitt (1981). This chronology combines and expands
on earlier syntheses (Prewitt 1974a, 1974b, 1982; Weir 1976a, 1976b)
and earlier studies (Jelks 1951; Johnson 1967; Kelley 1947a, 1947b;
Suhm, Kreiger, and Jelks 1954) and adds new phases to accomodate
previous
various changes.
These eleven phases
correspond to
chronologies as follows:

Early Archaic

This chronology is considered by Prewitt to be a base for the
expansion of ideas and as new archeological data appear the chronology
is subject to revision.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (1250 to 200 BP)
This period, referred to by Prewitt (1981) as the Nee-archaic
stage in Central Texas, is one of gradual change. This became
apparent with the replacement of the atlatl and dart by the bow and
arrow.
Pottery made its appearance during the later part of this
period and, in parts of Texas, although not readily documented in
Central
Texas,
incipient agriculture
emerged.
Certain time
diagnostics are used to delineate subdivisions within the period, the
Granbury and Scallorn arrow points characterize the Austin Focus
(1250-650 BP) and the Perdiz and Clifton arrow points, along with the
bone-tempered Leon Plain pottery, characterize the Toyah Focus (650 200 BP). These are the foci of the Central Texas Aspect (Suhm,
Krieger and Jelks 1954) and phases of the Neoarchaic (Prewitt 1981).
Prewitt (1981:68,74) has proposed that the appearance of cemeteries
during the Neoarchaic is a chronological delineator for this period in
Central Texas.
HISTORIC PERIOD
The beginning of this period is marked in Texas by the first
European contact - the journey of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca across
Texas ca. 1528. This initial contact was followed by French and
Spanish traders and explorers when the study area was part of a larger
region occupied by autonomous bands of hunters and gatherers known as
the Tonkawa (Newcomb 1961). These bands coalesced in the 19th century
to form the Tonkawa Tribe. Honea (1961:11) found that local tradition
marked Yegua Creek (18 km north of the study area) as the boundary
between the Waco Tribe to the north and the Tonkawa to the south.
Later encroachments by incoming Comanches and the advancing waves of
settlers reduced the Tonkawa to only a memory.

METHODS AND TECHNIQUES
Prior to the inception of the field work, Texas Archeological
Resarch Laboratory (TARL) site files and appropriate USGS topographic
maps for Fayette County were examined for: 1) physiographic location
and kind.s of sites in the county, and 2) the locations of any
prehistoric or historic sites recorded in the study area. Information
from these records was compiled for a site settlement model for the
county (see Research Design, p. 14) but no sites had been recorded
The State Historical Commission's
within the project boundaries.
National Register of Historic Places files were also examined to
determine if known sites might be endangered by mining activities. No
nominations to that register were located in the project area or on
the periphery. One historic marker commemorating the Goacher Trace is
located on FM 1291 and Cummins Creek. This is discussed in greater
detail in the Historic Background section (p. 40).
The study area encompasses 15,326 acres. The numerous landowners
contacted for permission to survey their property.
From
were
information supplied by the LCRA Land Office, contact was initiated by
telephone and letter from the TAS offices in Austin. Where access was
granted, landowners were notified by the field crew just prior to
entry onto their land. Areas where access was denied are delineated
in Figure 1. In many cases, landowner's homes were recorded as
historic
sites
following
guidelines
for
standing structures
established by the State Historical Commission. In conjunction with
site recording, local and individual family histories were also
compiled from information supplied by landowners and local residents.
Maps of the study area, supplied by the sponsor and TAS, included
a 111 : 1000 1 1andowner tract map, 111 : 1000 1 aerials, and USGS 7. 511
topographic quadrangles. In addition, 1940 and 1950 United States
Department of Agriculture aerial photos of the study area were helpful
in determining land use and settlement over the past 43 years.
Prior
to walking the land, all maps were examined for the locations of
tracts and for the most efficient survey routes.
Survey technique
varied with the terrain.
The most generally used procedure was to
take bearings on fencelines, align the crew perpendicular to the
fenceline at 30 m intervals, and then walk the length and width of the
property. Each surveyor walked a zig-zag pattern to increase the area
scanned.
Along drainages, surveyors walked parallel to the creek on
each side in order to observe the cut banks and terraces.
Ground
visibility was limited in some areas by dense cedar brakes and
greenbriar, and by dense ground cover of leaf litter and grasses in
improved pasture (Fig. 2).
At prehistoric sites, shovel probes were dug wherever possible in
order to ascertain the extent and depth of subsurface cultural
deposits and to assess the nature of the soils. The contents of each

probe were screened through 1/411 mesh screen, recorded by level, and
probe locations plotted on the site map with bearing and distance
measured to a relocatable datum. Structural drawings were made at
historic sites in lieu of shovel probes.
Artifact collection was kept to a minimum. Only those that were
functionally or temporally diagnostic were collected. The density and
distribution of non-diagnostic material was simply noted on the forms.
Descriptions of the collected artifacts are based on comparisons with
established types as discussed in Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1982), Suhm
and JelksÂ· (1962) and Weir (1976a) and with similar types reported from
sites within the region (Fullem 1977; Hall 1981; Honea 1961; Skelton
1977).
Standard measurements were taken on each projectile point.
These include:
CL) length of the point from base to tip (length of those points
with missing tips is estimated
(W)
width measured at shoulder
(T)
maximum thickness
(ST) stem length
_(BW) width of the base
Descriptions and metrics of the collected artifacts, if any, are
presented following the descriptions of the sites from which they came
in the Sites Recommended for Testing section.
All sites were plotted on all three maps (topographic, aerial and
tract).
All were recorded on University of Texas site survey forms,
mapped and photographed.
In the lab, all relevant data
were
transferred to Texas Historical Commission site forms. Sites were
assigned permanent site numbers in the trinomial numbering system,
i.e. 41 =Texas, FY= Fayette County, 1 =series number of site found
within the county. Thus, for example, 41FY232 is the two hundred
thirty second site recorded in Fayette County, Texas.
Historic Methodology
Our research into the specific history of the survey area was
accomplished using a combination of ~adastral maps, tax archive data,
land title abstracts and deed records in the Fayette County court
house.
A complete ownership history of every site was not
constructed. Where early settlement was established through land and
tax records the personal histories were fleshed out with data from the
manuscript U.S. Census for 1860 and 1870. The farms that were in
operation in the study area were all located in the Agricultural
Schedules of the 1860 census to establish certain data sets required
by the research design. In addition to these primary sources a number
of secondary works relating to the history of the German element in
Texas and to the history of Fayette County were consulted for
information relating directly to the survey area.
These works are
cited in the text and listed in the bibliography. As always, Webb 1 s
Handbook of Texas was used extensively as a general reference and
research tool. Additional biographical details were obtained through
correspondence with descendents of the original settlers.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Based on the previous archeological work in Fayette County, a
summary of prehistoric site distribution across physiographic zones
was compiled by David G. Robinson of TAS for use as a regional
research design.
The following excerpt describes the model of
prehistoric settlement tested by this intensive survey.
Â·A site typology was constructed by examination of the
TARL site files, and the site types were plotted on a table
according to their distribution across the physiographic
zones of Fayette County. The result is a table showing the
major components of the prehistoric settlement pattern of
the county. A discussion of site typology and a description
of the physiographic zones precede the table.
Observations
and a discussion of the table follow it.
In evaluating the settlement pattern scheme,
two
aspects of it must be noted immediately. First, the pattern
does not control for chronology.
Sites from all time
periods are found on it, primarily because the majority of
sites in the county are undated, and exclusion of these
sites from the table would have left the effort with
inadequate site data for manipulation. The effect of this
temporal inclusiveness is some likely skewing of each
cultural stage's settlement pattern from
the
overall
pattern.
It should be remembered however, that an accurate
settlement pattern of each cultural stage is contained
within the charted whole, and is not a different character
entirely. Refinement of the chronology will refine the
settlement pattern, not restructure it.
A second aspect of the settlement pattern is its
spatial representativeness.
All areas of the county are
adequately represented on the table in spite of the fact
that numerous sites were found in the Columbus Bend and
Cedar Creek reservoirs in the southeastern portion of the
county.
Site Typology and Physiographic Zones
The site typology used here is descriptive.
The
attempt was made to avoid straying too far from the
typologies used by previous field workers who identified
Fayette County's sites and contributed site information to
the site files. The result of numerous workers operating
independently, however, is a mixture of functional and
descriptive designations for the sites in Fayette County.
For the sake of consistency, therefore, it was decided to

CUMMINS CREEK

give descriptive designations to sites with functional
appelations.
These designations were made on the basis of
materials and features observed and excavated by field
archeologists, combining survey and excavation data where
available. It was recognized also that even a descriptive
typology necessarily divides a continuum of site variation,
and that a typology adequately accounting for every site
would have one site in each type. At that point one no
longer has a classification.
On the other hand, too
inclusive a typology would hide meaningful patterns of
sites. The typology derived here tries to balance these
opposing forces and provide a meaningful classification
which places similar sites together and reveals patterns of
site distribution over the landscape.
The taxa of site
classification are quantity of cultural material, type of
cultural material, site structures (cultural features) and
special locational features (gravel outcrops).
It
is
apparent that this typology is peculiar to Fayette County
and it is directed toward current research problems in the
area's prehistory.
The classes of typology, described in
detail below, are:
1.

dense scatters,

2.

dense scatters without features,

3.

dense scatters on gravel outcrops,

4.

light scatters with features,

5.

light scatters without features,

6.

light scatters on gravel outcrops,

7.

lithic scatters.

Locations on gravel outcrops are included in the typology
because gravel outcrops are significant resource areas in
the county and because their locations do not conform to the
physiographic divisions of the landscape.
These facts
demonstrate the very particular nature of the site typology;
this is by intent, and the typology is not intended to be
generally applicable
or
encompassing
of
sites
and
territories outside the southeastern area of the Central
Texas archeological region.
1. Dense Scatters With Features. This type and all
the dense scatter types are what have been termed habitation
or occupation sites by most surveying archeologists.
A
dense scatter as defined here implies both quantity and
variety of cultural materials. In addition to at least 100
items exposed on the surface or in cutbanks, dense scatters
in Fayette County have four or more of the following types

15

16

RESEARCH VESIGN

of items: burned rock, stone flaking debris, mussel shell,
charcoal, burned and unburned bone, flaked stone tools and
pottery.
Features include hearths, burned rock middens,
shell middens and burials. Dense scatters with features may
have one, a few, or all these cultural features.
2.
Dense scatters Without Features.
This
type
consists of dense material scatters without observable or
likely features.
3. Dense Scatters On Gravel Outcrops. Sites of this
type are those which combine dense and varied scatters with
locations on natural gravel
outcrops,
regardless
of
physiographic location.
Quarrying activity is one likely
function of these sites.
4. Light Scatters With Features. Light scatters are
the converse of dense scatters, being scatters with little
exposed material (fewer than 100 items), and that limited in
variety to one to three types of material. In Fayette
County the two most common material types on sites are
burned rock and stone flaking debris. Other combinations
occur, but examination of site forms showed that light
scatters had no more than three different types of items.
The potential conflicting cases of little material but much
variety, or much material but little variety did not occur,
it appearing to be true that quantity and variety vary
directly with each other.
Light scatters may reveal
features but usually just one feature or one type of
feature, never several or all types of features. The light
scatter types were usually functionally termed limited
activity sites by previous surveying archeologists.
5.
Light Scatters Without Features.
These sites
consist of light scatters of cultural material without
accompanying features.
6. Light Scatters On Gravel Outcrops.
These sites
consist of light scatters located on gravel outcrops, where
quarrying was likely the primary function of the site.
7. Lithic Scatters.
These sites are composed of
scatters of stone flaking debris, stone cores and unfinished
or broken stone tools. They are common but distinctive due
to their monotonous emphasis on lithic debitage and their
lack of any other kind of material.
If another type of
material was observed on the site, the site became, by
definition, one or another of the light or dense scatter
site types.

These zones can be thought of as dividing the landscape of
Fayette County.
Certain areas of overlap occur, primarily
where streams cut the first terrace and floodplain of the
Colorado, and designation of site physiographic zones in
these areas admits judgmental factors.
Generally, it was
decided that a site lay on a stream terrace if it lay
immediately adjacent to a creek flowing across the first
terrace or floodplain.
Farther away from a creek, a site
would be designated as a first terrace or flooplain site.
In short, creeks flowing across the first terrace and
floodplain of the Colorado are considered to lack upper
drainage slopes and stream divides. For more background on
physiographic zones in Fayette County and the region, see
Kenmotsu and Freeman (1980), Looney (1977), and Thornbury
(1976).

Results
Results of the file search and tabulation of site types
in each physiographic zone are seen in Table 2. One hundred
sixty-four sites are included, all are prehistoric sites.
Twenty-five historic sites in the TARL files were excluded,
as were eight prehistoric sites for which either locational
or descriptive data were so inadequately recorded that a
Table
determination of locale or site type was impossible.
2 is followed by observations of its patterns, some
interpretations, and a method for the testing and further
application of the settlement pattern indicated by the
Table.
OBSERVATIONS
1. Fluviatile creek terraces are the locales of 62.8
percent of the sites included in the study, far more than
any other physiographic zone. Additionally, at least one
site of every type is found in this zone. Light scatters
without features numbered 38 sites on creek terraces, and 39
lithic scatters are found on them. These two site types
have more entries in this landform category than any other
type in any other category.
This fact is undoubtedly
culturally significant, and this is partially explained by
Observation two.

The most complex sites, dense
scatter with
features, dense scatters on gravel outcrops, and light
scatters with features, occur on the Colorado floodplain,
the first terrace of the river and on creek terraces, but
not on the higher elevations
upper slopes and stream
divides. As an allied general observation, the more complex
sites cluster in the zones of lower relative position while
simpler sites are found in higher physiographic position.
With reference to the table, higher site frequencies are
found progressively from left to right and top to bottom,
beginning with frequencies of more complex sites in lowland
locales to greater number of simpler sites in upland
locales, centered around stream environments.
The settlement pattern presented
here
hints
at
predominant creek terrace locational and economic strategies
employed by the prehistoric cultures of the area. Sites on
creek terraces may have been camps that were off shoots from
larger base villages at other points along the creeks, on
the floodplain of the Colorado River or first river terrace
Â·of the Colorado. From the creek terraces, the prehistoric
people
probably
launched their foraging and resource
procurement campaigns, and it is to these that they returned
with their produce.
Â·
The preliminary settlement pattern scheme can be tested
by further survey and can contribute to test excavation and
mitigation programs to generate data and test propositions
in further research in the country.
The validity of the settlement model proposed by Robinson can be
only partially tested in a physiographically restricted area such as
the Cummins Creek Prospect.
The categories of river terrace and
floodplain are superfluous; only the possibility of confirming the
association of site types defined as light scatters and lithic
scatters with creek terraces and lower slopes could be explored. Due
to the specific limitations on environmental setting within the
Prospect, Robinson's typology was refined for the final distributional
analysis to differentiate between creek terraces and lower slopes
(Table 3).
Some ambiguity between the categories upper slopes and stream
divides was noted in this survey. Sites were found on minor upland
drainways which could be termed 11 creek terrace 11 , "upper slopes 11 , or
"stream divide 11 depending on the referrant water source. The field
supervisors opted for the most_appropriate classification.

Summarized, the settlement pattern indicated for the Cummins
Creek Prospect by previous research in the area is 1) Light scatters
with no discernable features and lithic scatters would predominate
along the minor creeks traversing the Prospect. Significantly fewer
2) Site
dense scatters with or without features would be found.
density in the uplands would be low and consist primarily of lithic
and featureless light scatters indicative of short-term or limited use
camp sites.
These somewhat self-evident assumptions are those considered
testable at the level of information obtainable from intensive survey
of the Prospect. More complex propositions set forth by Robinson are
dependent upon the acquisition of survey data from more diversified
environments than is the case in the Prospect and upon testing and
excavation programs as yet not conducted. One goal of the Cummins
Creek project was to assess the sites located by intensive survey for
the potential to resolve some of these broader questions (see
Rationale for the Recommended Testing Program).
A second consideration taken into account prior to the field
preparations was the known traverse of the Prospect by two early
historic roads, the Goacher Trace and the Wilbarger Road.

formally
environmental circumstances on the route of these roads may have been
similar to those affecting prehistoric travel. If so, evidence of
historic use of the area and prehistoric camp sites would coincide at
the creek crossings.
Resolution of this problem was dependent upon
the acquisition of both historic and prehistoric site information.

CUMMINS CREEK

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES
Results of the Survey
The proposed Cummins Creek Prospect encompasses 15,326 acres.
The total area intensively surveyed was 13,288 acres; access to the
remaining 2,038 acres was not obtained.
When mining plans are
finalized and access is granted, the unsurveyed areas to be affected
by the proposed lignite extraction will be surveyed for cultural
resources.
Site density in these areas is expected to mirror the
distribution found in the larger Prospect area wherein prehistoric
occupation concentrated along the minor drainways.
Ninety sites were recorded within the
Prospect;
56
are
prehistoric (Table 4) and 34 are historic. The historic sites are
discussed in the section entitled Historic Resources.
The majority of the aboriginal sites found in the Prospect fall
into the categories described in the Research Design as light scatters
without features. It is possible, of course, that subsurface features
lie buried and that these sites may be reclassified after limited
testing.
At the present level of information, this site type
predominates on the creek terraces of Cummins and Jones creeks. Light
scatters with detected features are distributed evenly between the two
basins - three found in the Rabbs drainage and two on Cummins Creek.
The most salient characteristic of site distribution in the
Prospect is the high concentration along Cummins Creek and in the
Rabbs Creek drainage (Fig. 1). Only five sites were found in the
more remote drier uplands and even these are near minor tributaries to
Cummins Creek.
The most obvious motivating
factor
for
this
concentration is proximity to water. However, environmental stimuli
are more complex than the simple access to one resource.
The most
stable surviving element of past environments in an area as heavily
modified for agriculture in Central Texas is the soil.
Realizing that soils are a product of the total environment, and in
turn support the vegetation which forms a major component of the
trophic cycle, a test of site distribution across the mapped soil
units (Soil Conservation Service 1982) should accurately reflect the
use of past resources~ The basic premise, stated in terms of the null
hypothesis, is if a particular soil type occupies a certain percentage
of the Prospect area it can be expected to contain the same percentage
of the total number of sites recorded.
A chi square test of site frequency by soil
types,
as
specifically mapped for the Cummins Creek Prospect, was performed
according to procedures described by Hodder and Orton (1976:224-225).
A Fortran computer program (Turpin 1978), used in this calculation,

The association of most significance is the high observed site
frequency on the Bunyan soils, creek side alluvially-derived sediments

which are frequently flooded.
occupy a small area along Cummins Creek. The high chi square is
influenced by the extremely limited occurrence of this soil type, thus
the low expected site frequency, but does reflect the preference
between the observed and expected on Shalba soils may be attributable
to the extreme gullying which provided subsurface exposure.
The distribution of sites conforms with the predictions presented
in the Research Design insofa-r as the physiographic zones are
represented in the Prospect (Table 2). Of the 56 prehistoric sites
recorded, all but five lie on the lower slopes or creek terraces. The
majority of the 23 sites along Cummins Creek and within the area
designated as the Cummins Creek Basin physiographic zone are chert
flake scatters of varying density which, with the exception of three
sites, lacked temporally diagnostic artifacts. In contrast, the 28
sites found along Jones and Owl creeks in
the
Rabbs
Creek
physiographic
zone yielded far more temporally or functionally
diagnostic tools. This variation in lithic assemblages suggests that
the Cummins Creek sites may have been oriented toward the exploitation
of the readily-available lithic raw materials and the Rabbs Basin
sites
fulfilled more generalized domestic functions.
A second
consideration in occupational variation is the reliability of water
supplies in the Prospect. Jones and Owl creeks are characterized by
pooling of spring water; Cummins Creek is intermittent, flowing only
during periods of greater rainfall. Thus, on the assumption that the
stream character has remained the same, could be expected that the
sites along Cummins Creek were of shorter duration or scheduled on a
seasonal basis. In support of this proposition, an analysis of the
estimated site areas broken down by physiographic zone and site type

26

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

shows that the Rabbs Creek drainage population is consistently larger
than that of Cummins Creek. This same variable, site area, can be
used as a discriminating factor in the site typology. Light scatters
with features (X
7010m2) average 50 percent larger than those
without (X = 4746m2). The mean area of lithic scatters (1933m2) is
less than half that of light scatters. These two facets of natural
resource distribution form the basis for Hypothesis I in the Rationale
for Additional Testing in which it is proposed that comparison of
artifact assemblages may demonstrate the Cummins Creek emphasis on
lithic procurement in contrast to the domestic activities expected in
the Rabbs Basin.

=

The scarcity of time-diagnostic artifacts inhibits the diachronic
assessment of the striking distribution of prehistoric sites in the
Prospect. Only subsurface testing and the acquisition of a larger
sample
of index markers will permit a differentiation between
occupational preference through time.
Thus, the second testing
hypothesis
presents
the
most conservative proposition
that
settlement patterns were constant through time.
The third hypothesis is not strongly based in data acquired
during this survey but, rather, is derived from models presented by
previous researchers who suggest
that mixtures
of artifacts
representative of three cultural areas - East, Central and Coastal
Texas
result from interaction with adjacent groups
or
the
overlapping utilization of the natural resources of the areas.
The limited testing program outlined in the following section is
intended to assess the potential of a representative sample of sites
from the differing physiographic zones to resolve questions of a
regional nature.
Thus, in this case, sites are considered as a body
rather than as individual entities. Based on the results of limited
subsurface testing, sites can be selected for further study for their
ability to contribute to the stated hypotheses and propositions
derived from the analysis of the tested sites. This selection process
would serve to evaluate the site's merit for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.

Prehistoric Sites Recommended For Further Testing
Prior to the intensive survey of the Cummins Creek Prospect, a
prehistoric settlement model was compiled from the distribution of
known archeological remains in Fayette County and the surrounding
region.
The results of this intensive survey proved a striking
distribution of prehistoric occupation along the minor creeks which
traverse the Prospect and conformed well to the proposed model in
terms of the association of certain site types with the physiographic
zones represented in the study area. The Cummins Creek Prospect is
largely upland and encompasses the headwaters of two drainage systems
tributary to the Colorado River - Rabbs (Jones) and Cummins creeks.

These sites contain the most varied artifact assemblages
with datable diagnostic tools. Probably sufficient subsurface material to test Hypotheses I, II , and possibly 111.

These sites provide a representative sample of debitage
for comparison with Cummins Creek sites.

potential for prehistoric subsistence and technology provide the basis
for a testing research design oriented toward the resolution of
specific problem areas.
Sites were selected for subsurface testing based on two criteria.
First, those which hold promise of intact subsurface deposits or
meaningful surface distributions also hold potential for meeting the
criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Secondly, a representative sample of sites in each physiographic zone
was selected in order to test the hypotheses stated below.
Cummins Creek is an intermittent stream which flows through an
area abundant in natural chert sources; Jones Creek is spring-fed,
entrenched, and marked by pooling of spring water, thus providing a
more reliable water source. The differences in resource availability
between the two drainages and the intervening interfluvial divide
provide the basis for Hypothesis I:
I. Cummins Creek sites were primarily seasonal camps used
when the stream was flowing and were oriented toward the
acquisition of raw materials for lithic tool production.
~ Conversely,
the sites along Jones Creek were more
permanent or of longer duration due to the more reliable
presence of pooled or spring water.

Sites recommended for testing this

Register
significance if the
positively supported:

assume
hypothesis wi 11
following questions are

a) Jones Creek sites will show a greater diversity i.n tool types
the
more varied functions characteristic of
suggesting
longer-term encampments;
b) the lithic material recovered from sites along Cummins Creek
should
reflect
a predominance of debris from initial
reduction, Jones Creek sites' debitage would result from the
final production of tools;
c) features, such as large hearths, burials or burned rock
accumulations, should be more frequent at sites along Jones
Creek;
d) perishable items, such as food residues, which might indicate
the season of occupation or primary subsistence base, are not
to be expected
in
the
uncohesive
sandy
environment
characteristic of the Cummins Creek Prospect. However, the
results of shovel probes at one site, 41FY253, indicate the
possibility of an intact hearth with charcoal at a depth of 80
cm. The recovery of lump wood charcoal holds some promise for
the
recovery
of
identifiable plant or animal remains
representative of prehistoric dietary items and may allow a
determination of the season of occupation.
Time diagnostic artifacts were more commonly found at the sites
along Jones Creek, supportive of Hypothesis I, a statement that more
diverse and formal tools would be recovered in that area than at

Cummins
locations.
The
occupational periods represented were
primarily Middle and Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric.
The
settlement pattern reflected by the distribution of prehistoric sites
across the landscape of the Prospect is dramatic in the preference for
stream-associated occupation.
In the absence of stricter time
controls, any changes
in
the
pattern which
might
reflect
diachronically
variable cultural or physical responses in site
location are undetectable. Sites selected for testing hold promise
for intact stratigraphy or buried components which might be datable by
relative or absolute means. Stated in terms of the null hypothesis,
Hypothesis II reads:
establishing
more
permanent
preference
for
settlements along Jones Creek and the sporadic occupation
of the Cummins Creek area was a constant throughout
prehistory.

II. The

Given the scarcity of intact, buried cultural deposits in the
naturally uncohesive soils of this upland prospect, sites selected for
testing will stand in support of Hypothesis II if earlier components
consistently underlie the more recent occupations. Conversely, the
isola~ion of one-component sites uncontaminated by
earlier or later
occupational debris will refute this proposition.
Previous work in this region has resulted in the description of
the general Prospect area as a contact zone between east, central and
coastal Texas cultures. If sites selected for testing are relevant to
the resolution of this proposition, they will assume National Register
significance based on regional criteria. Stated as an hypothesis:
III. Cummins Creek Prospect lies within a zone of transition
between east, central and coastal Texas cultures. A
mixture of artifacts diagnostic of these three cultural
areas will be found at the tested sites.

The attributes pertinent to this question are the presence of
artifacts characteristic of the three different cultural areas. A
second question, contingent upon the acquisition
of
such
an
assemblage, would be to discern between contemporaneous deposition,
implying trade goods or transitional cultures,
and
individual
occupations suggesting the contraction or expansion of spheres of
influence.
The recommended testing program is intended to determine if any
sites hold cultural deposits relevant to the three stated hypotheses.
If these deposits can be shown to lie in an intact context, the site
may be of National Register quality.
Recommendations for data
recovery or preservation of the sites can only be formulated based on
the results of subsurface testing. Sites not specifically recommended
for testing show little promise for meeting National Register criteria
and are described in the Appendix.

CUMMINS CREEK BASIN SITES
Additional study of eleven sites in the Cummins Creek drainage
basin is recommended (Table 6). Eight sites are dense flake scatters
with few or no finished tools and are pertinent to Hypothesis I.
Two
adjacent sites, 41FY240 and 41FY241, are recommended as a test of
Hypothesis II. One site, 41FY232, yielded an Alba arrow point,
generally considered a characteristic East Texas style. Testing of
this site is relevant to Hyposthesis III.
41FY220
This light scatter is in an improved pasture on a east bank of
Cummins Creek inside a meander.
The area of occupation is about
100.45 m. Soil is a fine sandy loam of the Bunyan series (SCS 1980).
The underlying clay was not reached in any of the shovel probes; the
matrix of creekside probes was gravel.
Surficial cultural material
was scattered chert flakes and burned rock; one finished biface
fragment was found in a burned-out depression. Six shovel probes were
dug to a maximum depth of 65 cm; flakes and burned rock were recovered
throughout. These surface and subsurface deposits define a fairly
large occupation area. Although some cultural debris has been moved
by plowing, it is possible that intact material lies buried by
flood-deposited sediments.
This site is one of the sample selected from Cummins Creek to
compare with those in the Rabb 1 s Creek basin as a test of the first
hypothesis, that the Cummins Creek sites would show less diversity and
fewer permanent features. If time-diagnostic artifacts are recovered,
they may, by determining site age, provide information pertinent to
Hypothesis II.
41FY221
This light scatter of flakes and burned rock is in an open field
on a sandy western terrace of Cummins Creek and is bordered on the
east by FM 1291. The soil here is a Mabank variant (SCS 1981) of fine
sandy loam which appears to have been under cultivation at one time.
The area of occupation was approximately 120x40 m. Two shovel probes
revealed flakes (mainly tertiary) and burned rock to at least 85 cm
below the surface. No features were found in any of the probes.
This site has been selected for comparison with those in Rabbs
Creek Basin as a test of Hypothesis I and II. The depth of the soil
on this natural levee suggests that it may retain undisturbed cultural
deposits which perhaps include time diagnostic material.
41FY222
This large scatter of flakes, tools and burned rock is on the
southwest bank of Cummins Creek on the inside of a meander. The area
of occupation was about 90x50 m. Nine shovel probes were dug in the
fine sandy laom soil of the Tremona series (SCS 1979) to depths of

CUMMINS CREEK

31

60-85 cm without reaching clay. Cultural deposits observed at 10-70
cm below the surface included chert flakes, burned rock and the distal
fragment of one finished biface. Surface finds included flakes and
one biface fragment.
No time diagnostic material was found on or
below the surface.
41FY223
This light lithic scatter is located approximately 200 m
southeast of 41FY222 along an open terrace of Cummins Creek. Area of
occupatfon is approximately 120x20 m with the long axis parallel to
the creek.
This site, like 41FY222, is notable for its number of
artifacts and depth. Cultural material was noted on the surface,
subsurface and amid exposed stream gravels in the northeast-facing
bank of the creek. Chert flakes, utilized flakes, one finished biface
fragment and burned rock were found to a depth of 75 cm in six shovel
probes. Soil type is a Tremona series of loamy fine sand (SCS 1979).
None of the probes reached the underlying clay substrate.
Subsurface investigations and surface collecting are recommended
to test the assumption that this site location was influenced by the
proximity of the lithic resources of the stream and surface gravels.
41FY224
This is another of the large flake scatters found along the
southwest terrace of Cummins Creek. Approximately 250 m southeast of
41FY223, this site is on a open terrace near the confluence of a
southeast-flowing tributary and Cummins Creek. The terrace is covered
by short grasses and surrounded by post oak and cedar. The soil is a
loamy fine sand of the Tremona series (SCS 1979) and none of the six
80-cm-deep shovel probes reached underlying clay.
The area of
occupation was about 240x60 m paralleling th~ creek. Two recent use
areas were identified, a 75x20 m area in the northeast part has been
used as a garden and the area of the site adjacent to the creek has
been a barbeque and picnic area.
Flakes and burned rock were observed on the surface; one biface
preform was found in the garden. Six shovel probes found flakes and
burned rock to 80 cm below the surface. This site, as with 41FY222
and 223, may have been used as a camp site while exploiting the nearby
raw lithic materials.
41FY228
Located on the outside of a meander amid short grasses and
surrounded by post oak/cedar stands, this site has cultural residues
similar to those found at 41FY222, 223 and 224 to the southeast. Site
size is about 80x90 m. Fine sandy loam of the Aral series (SCS 1981)
at this site is no more than about 30 cm deep; shovel probes reached
layers of fist- and pea-sized gravels at varying depths. Cultural
material, flakes, cores, burned rock and a biface preform, was found
scattered on the surface amid stream gravels, and in shovel probes.

32

PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

One probe (A-1) exposed what appears to be a concentration of burned
rock, possibly a hearth, at 10 cm below the surface. Although
shallowly buried, the cultural deposits at this site may remain
intact.
Areas of the site southwest of the probed portion appear
deeper and should be included in the recommended limited testing.
41FY232
This light scatter of chert flakes and burned rock is located in
an open field about 25 m northeast of the West Fork tributary. The
confluence of Cummins Creek and West Fork is 250 m southwest of the
site.
Area of occupation is 65x25 m. Cultural material readily
apparent on the surface is limited to scattered chert flakes and some
burned rock. Two shovel probes revealed cultural debris to 65 cm in a
loamy fine sand of the Tremona series (SCS 1979). A chert arrow point
base and a medial fragment of the same point were found below the
surface. This point strongly resembles an Alba point collected from
41BU1 in the Somerville Reservoir 18 km north of the study area (Honea
1961:Pl. li); Alba is a style most commonly found in east Texas. This
tentative
identification
suggests
that this site may provide
information relevant to Hypothesis III, the proposed transitional
character of the Prospect area.
41FY239
On the southwest terrace of Cummins Creek overlooking the modern
flooplain, this light scatter of flakes and ceramics was found in a
clearing of field grasses surrounded by dense stands of post oak,
cedar and yaupon. The soil is loamy fine sand of the Tremona series
(SCS 1979). The clay substrate was not reached in any shovel probe.
Site size was estimated at 30x30 m, based on both surface and
subsurface deposits.
A few chert flakes and two pottery sherds were
sparsely
distributed on the surface. The pottery, tentatively identified as
Leon Plain, is a bone tempered plain ware found in various ~areas of
Texas but confined mainly to the Central Texas cultural area where it
is considered a hallmark of the Late Prehistoric period.
Six shovel
probes revealed limited subsurface cultural debris to depths of 60 cm;
one more piece of pottery was found at 13 cm below the surface.
Only
two sites recorded in this survey, 41FY232 and 239, yielded artifacts
diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric period.
Testing is recommended
both to determine if temporal variation can be detected and to assess
the validity of Hypothesis II.

41FY240
This site is located on a lower terrace between Cummins and Flat
creeks about 100 m north-northwest of the confluence.
It is a
featureless but fairly dense scatter of lithic debris,
mainly
secondary and tertiary chert flakes. The area of occupation is about
150x55 m. The soil is light brown to gray-brown loamy fine sand of
the Bunyan series (SCS 1980).
The site area has been recently
cleared; felled trees are piled on the northeast and west sides.
Cultural materials were observed in five shovel probes throughout the
75-80 cm depth of each test. A chert core was found 45 cm below the
surface in probe 5. None of the artifacts observed were temporally
diagnostic. Although this site has been cleared and some erosion is
evident, it is possible that mixing of cultural debris is confined to
the upper 25 cm and those below are undisturbed.
41FY241
This dispersed 200x120 m lithic scatter lies in an open fallow
field surrounded by live oaks about 75 m west of the confluence of
Turkey and Cummins creeks. The soil is Tremona loamy fine sand (SCS
1979) to at least 90 cm below the surface and the upper part has been

site, like 41FY240, is one of the large flake scatters in the Cummins
Creek basin. Its size and quantity of debitage suggest it may have
served as a possible procurement area.
41FY271
This light flake scatter is located on a sandy knoll 700 m
southwest of the confluence of Turkey and Cummins creeks. Site
41FY241 is near the same confluence. The site is in an open field
partially planted in coastal bermuda. The owner of the property moved
the house, which sits on half the site, from neighboring Waldeck
(41FY299).
The owner reports finding a complete biface under the
house.
Surficial cultural material included flakes, one biface tip and
burned rock.
Most material was noted in rodent backdirt. Three
subsurface probes uncovered large quantities of chert flakes and
burned rock to a depth of 70 cm. The clay substrate was reached at 50
and 80 cm. Soils at the site are Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS
1981).
Depth of cultural material at the site, combined with its
quantity and the location of the site, suggest subsurface testing
might demonstrate relevance to the first two hypotheses.

UPLAND INTERFLUVIAL ZONE SITES
Only two potentially intact sites were found on the upland
interfluves of the Prospect. The other three upland sites had been
destroyed by modern land use practices.
Both recommended sites
contain subsurface cultural deposits of burned rock and chert flakes.
The rarity of prehistoric utilization of the upland divides provides
little opportunity to determine the motivation for these camp sites.
Testing of 41FY216 and 234 is recommended to provide a basis for
comparison with sites in the drainage basins and to identify the
resource base which prompted limited use of the interfluvial zone.
41FY216
This light lithic scatter is on the edge of a once-cultivated
field between two east-flowing, unnamed tributaries of Turkey Creek.
The field is surrounded by stands of cedar and post oak.
This site
measures about 30 by 60 m. The soil is a fine sandy loam of the Arol
series (SCS 1981).
Surficial cultural material, found mostly in
rodent hole backdirt, was chert flakes, one utilized flake, one
finished biface and burned rock. One shovel probe revealed subsurface
deposits of flakes and burned rock to a depth of 30 cm. No temporally
diagnostic material or features were observed.
41FY234
This light lithic scatter is located on the upper part of a
northwest trending slope about 150 m southeast of a tributary of
Turkey Creek. This site is in a small clearing of field grasses
surrounded by dense stands of post oak and cedar, and on a fine sandy
loam soil of the Falba series (SCS 1981). Cultural material was found
scattered on the surface over an area of about 20x25 m. This material
was limited to flakes and burned rock; one possible prismatic blade
may be indicative of a Late Prehistoric period occupation (1250 - 200
B.P.). Five shovel probes were dug to a maximum depth of 50 and 65
cm.
Subsurface materials were predominantly flakes and burned rock,
one finished biface medial fragment was recovered from probe A-1 and a
utilized flake from probe B-1. Three probes reached clay at depths of
between 10 and 50 cm.
RABBS CREEK BASIN SITES
Seven of the 28 sites recorded within the drainage of Rabbs Creek
hold promise of intact cultural deposits or materials sufficient to
test the stated hypotheses. All seven sites lie along Jones Creek and
its tributaries. Unfortunately, the sites in the Owl Creek system had
either undergone post-depositional dispersal or were too sparse to
merit further study.
The selected sites, however, are considered a
representative sample of the total recorded distribution within the
Rabbs Creek Basin as a whole.
Only evaluation of the subsurface
integrity will permit an assessment of these sites against National
Register criteria.

CUMMINS CREEK

35

41FY242
This large dispersed lithic scatter is located at the point of an
east-west trending interfluve separating Jones Creek to the north from
a northeast-flowing tributary to the south.
The tributary empties
into Jones Creek approximately 40 m west of the site. Surficial
cultural material of petrified wood and chert flakes, one finished
biface medial fragment and one dart point fragment were scattered over
an area approximately 120x60 m.
Concentrations of flakes were
observed along a sandstone rim bordering the site.
Subsurface
deposits of flakes and burned rock were found to a depth of 40 cm.
Soils at the site are a Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS 1981).
Depth of sediments, as determined in five shovel probes, ranged from
10 to SO cm. Probes dug to the east or away from the rim and up the
interfluve in deeper soil held a greater amount of subsurface cultural
debris. Based on two biface fragments noted, this site is tentatively
dated as Archaic. It and others within the Rabbs Creek Basin have
more varied and, in most cases, more datable assemblages than those in
the Cummins Creek Basin. Therefore, testing this site for comparison
with Cummins Creek Basin sites is recommended as relevant to the first
hypothesis.
41FY244
Located on a knoll along the southwest rim of the same east-west
trending interfluve as 41FY243 100 m to the north, this site lies amid
scattered and clumped cedar. The area of occupation was approximately
100x30 m. The majority of the site area has been cleared of trees by
hand cutting, leaving the area open to erosi~n. Soils at the site are
Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS 1981). A thin flake scatter and
one finished biface fragment were found on the surface.
Four shovel
probes recovered chert flakes and burned rock to a depth of 1 m, all
contained within the loamy sand; basal clay was not reached.
Two
probes exposed a layer of compact sand at SO cm below the surface.
Depth of the deposit at this site, and its proximity to 41FY242,
suggest testing may recover data pertinent to Hypotheses 1 and 2.
Site disturbance appears to be limited to plowing, clearing and
the
activity of burrowing animals.
Since substantial cultural
material was found below the level of disturbance, there is a strong
possibility that much of it is undisturbed.
Systematic surface
collection and subsurface testing for samples of debitage and lithic
artifacts is recommended as a test of Hypothesis 1, statement b.
41FY2S2
This light scatter lies on a 3 m high bank/meander scar along the
northwest bank of Jones Creek and extends downslope to the south. A
northeast-southwest ranch road cuts through the site paralleling the
creek bank.
Cultural materials found on the surface were chert and
petrified wood flakes, three chert cores, one quartzite mano fragment,
one utilized flake, one unidentified dart point and one Pedernales
dart point. Subsurface materials, recovered from two of the four

contained within the Falba variant loamy fine sand to a depth of 95
cm.
The Pedernales dart point suggests an occupation during the
Middle Archaic Period, ca. 2600-3400 B.P. Burned rock was noted on
the surface but no substantial concentrations were apparent and no
buried features were detected. This site was selected for additional
testing because of the apparent depth of the loamy sand and the
recovery of subsurface material. It is considered as representative
of the sites found along Jones Creek and holds some potential for
intact cuJtural deposits including time diagnostic artifacts.

This light scatter extends along the slope of a sandy knoll on
the east bank of Jones Creek in a relatively open field with scattered
cedar and oak on the knoll and more dense stands of trees fringing the
creek.
Sites area is estimated at 165x80 m. Cultural material is
exposed on the eroded bench above the creek and contained within the
loamy fine sand (Falba variant) of the knoll. Three shovel probes
along the lower slope revealed chert flakes to a depth of 90 cm; clay
was encountered in one at 75 cm. A fourth probe high on the slope of
the knoll produced chert and petrified wood flakes underlying 40 cm of
sterile
sand.
A probable hearth composed of burned rock and
containing a large lump of wood charcoal was struck at a depth of 85
cm.
Time diagnostics recovered were one Yarbrough-like dart point 10
cm below the surface in a shovel probe and one Pedernales dart point
from the surface (Fig~ 3a). The latter places one term of occupation
during the Middle Archaic period, ca. 2600-3400 B.P.
Testing of site 41BP253 is strongly recommended.
The high
probability that buried features remain intact at considerable depth,
overlain by 40 cm of sterile soil, provides an opportunity to test
Hypothesis 2, the squential use of preferred camping grounds through
time. Additionally, the recovery of lump charcoal holds promise for
the preservation of both datable material and other perishable

This light flake scatter is located on the top and slopes of a
knoll that forms the southeast portion of a northwest trending
interfluve. The tributaries bounding this interfluve lie to the
northeast and southwest and flow northwest into Jones Creek about 200
m from the site. The site is in an open, improved pasture surrounded
by dense stands of cedar and post oak. Chert and petrified wood
flakes were scattered on the surface, visible in gopher backdirt piles
and in a road cut through the site. Two of the six shovel probes
within the 140x84 m site area reached a depth of 1 m with flakes and
burned rock fragments found throughout. None of the probes reached
the underlying clay substrate nor sandstone. The soil is a loamy fine
sand of the Falba variant series (SCS 1981).

and limited subsurface testing are recommended.
41FY266
This concentrated lithic flake and tool scatter is located on an
eroding bank along the north side of Jones Creek. Site size was
estimated at 22x12 m in a relative open area covered with short
grasses and scattered cedar and live oak. Cultural material observed
in the cut bank included secondary and tertiary flakes, one Taylor
chert dart point (Fig. 3e), one unidentified burned chert dart point,
one Marshall chert dart point (Fig. 4a), one chert drill/perforator
which appears to be a reworked Angostura point (Fig. 3d), one core, a
metate fragment and burned rock. Material was exposed by erosional
gullies downcutting into the bank and in over-bank slump caused by the
undercutting action of the creek. Cultural material on the surface
was minimal but subsurface deposits were found to 75 cm. Two of four
shovel probes reached underlying sandstone at 50 and 60 cm. The soil
matrix is Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS 1981).
The time diagnosic projectile points tentatively date at least
two occupations of the site as Early Archaic (ca. 5000 B.P.) and Late
Archaic (ca. 2250 B.P.). The quantity and variety of tools suggest
multiple functions such as food processing, hunting and hide working.
A more detailed analysis of this site may contribute to the resolution
of Hypothesis 1 and II.

HISTORIC RESOURCES
Background
The history of Fayette County is rich and varied and has been
well researched and reported (Lotto 1902; Sinks 1975; Weyand 1936).
Because this history is so well documented and because much of it does
not relate directly to the specific survey area, these studies will
not be reviewed here. Only a brief outline of County and State
history is included so that those unfamiliar with the chronology of
Texas history will be able to place specific material in a temporal
context.
The major chronicles of Texas history usually begin with the year
1519 when the Spanish accomplished the conquest of Mexico. The
divisions of history given below (from Pass 1974) are intended to
provide a general chronological framework.

Pre-nineteenth century Spanish colonial sites may exist but none
of these are in or near the study area. The real European settlement,
and consequently the written history of Fayette County, does not begin
until period II-D in 1821. The Mexican government authorized Stephen
F. Austin to bring Anglo-American settlers into the area and to make
land grants to them on behalf of the Mexican government. Granting of
choice tracts along the Colorado River in central Fayette County began
in the summer of 1824.
The majority of the first-wave settlers and land speculators
coming to this portion of the Austin Colony were generally old-line
southerners. These families were in the majority throughout the
Colony and their names are attached to most of the original land
grants. Austin was evidently displeased that the Colony was almost

southern Anglo and was, by 1830, considering the
introduction of Swiss and German people. "They have not in general
that mania for speculation which is so prominent a trait in the
English and North American character, and above all they will oppose
slavery," Austin wrote (letter quoted in Barker 1925:254).
The actual promotion of German immigration to the Austin Colony
was accomplished, not by the design of the empressario, but by a
single private letter back to Germany.
The writer was Friedrich
Ernst, Â· the former chief gardener to the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, who
immigrated to the United States in 1829 and moved to Texas in 1831
(Biesele 1930:44-45).
His long letter to a friend named Schwartz in
Oldenburg described his land in the Austin Colony and life in Texas.
This letter was later printed in an Oldenburg newspaper then reprinted
in a widely circulated book, Detlef Duntâ¢s Reise nach Texas.
Dunt
added the comment to Ernst's letter:

poor, this letter could not fail to create a big sensation,

(Dunt 1834 as quoted in Biesele 1930:44).
The town of Industry grew up around the Ernst farm in Austin
By 1838, the town had a postmaster and around 1840, Mrs.
County.
Ernst opened a hotel. This was the first German settlement in Texas.
The second was founded by Joseph Biegel, who laid uut a farm on
Cummins Creek in neighboring Fayette County.
It was near this
settlement that the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in
Texas, or Adelsverein, in 1843 purchased a plantation from Robert
Mills, the prominent merchant and planter of Brazoria County. The
plantation, situated on the William H. Jack league on Cummins Creek
just south of Round Top, was renamed Nassau farm.

before the Civil War, latecoming German settlers began to buy farmland
in this upland region. Round Top remained the only real town in the
area.
After the Civil War, when the Houston and Texas Central Railroad
was built across the northern corner of Fayette County, the town of
Ledbetter was founded.
The railroad brought products
of the
industrial society and opened a market for agricultural products
produced in uplands far from water transport. Ledbetter was laid out
along the railway, platted and dedicated on December 6, 1870 (Fayette

Land Grants and Early Roads
Figure 5 depicts the original land grants in the Cummins Creek
area; the shaded area indicates that portion which was surveyed and
specifically examined in this study. This map also shows the location
of three very early roads, the Adelsverien 1 s Nassau farm, and the
towns of Round Top and Ledbetter.
The LaBahia Road, which passed
through Round Top, ran about 3 miles south of the study area.
Originally an Indian trail, this road was adopted by the Spanish and
used as early as 1690 by Alonso de Leon (Webb 1952 Vol. II:2). The
same road was better known during the nineteenth century as Opelousas
or Lower Road, when it was heavily traveled as a cattle trail.
The two other old roads depicted on the map cross the study area.
The Washington to Bastrop Road is also known as the Goacher Trace and
Â·the historical marker found along FM 1291 refers to the road by this
name.
The
Washington
terminus
is,
of
course,
Washington-on-the-Brazos, the site of the signing of the Texas
Declaration of Independence in 1836 and one-time capital of the
Republic. This once-thriving riverport city that saw two steam boats
built to serve it in antebellum days failed to offer a subsidy to the
railroad builders and was bypassed.
By 1885, the former capitol
retained only about five percent of its pre-Civil War population (Webb
1952 Vol. II:865). This roadway was replaced by one running parallel
to the Houston and Texas Central tracks through Ledbetter.
The Goacher Trace originally led from the cabin of James Gautier
on Rabb's Creek in southern Lee County to both Bastrop and San Felipe
de Austin, connecting the upper and lower Austin colonies.
It was
laid out about 1828 by James Gautier (Webb 1952 Vol. I:697), a native
of Alabama. Several members of this family were killed and a number
taken
captive by Indians in 1837; Gautier himself was killed
attempting their rescue. The grave of Amos Alexander and his son, who
were also killed by Indians near the Goacher Trace in 1835, was found
during the survey. This killing was avenged by an expedition of
residents led by Colonel John H. Moore of LaGrange (Ray 1949:299).
Thus the era of Indian occupation endured, in the study area, to the
era of the Republic.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

48

The third old roadway shown on the map, the Wilbarger Trace, also
passes through the study area.
This road is named for Josiah P.
Wilbarger, a teacher and surveyor in the Austin Colony who lived for
some time in LaGrange before moving to Bastrop. Wilbarger survived an
1833 Indian attack in which he was scalped. He died in 1845.
All of these old roadways wander across the landscape on easy,
level ground with access to water and, of course, were in existence
before the land in the study area had been surveyed and partitioned
into land grants.

of
the

according to early land grant maps and on aerial photographs by
surface checks of possible leads supplied by the aerial photographs.
Neither of the two historic roads could be traced on the ground nor on
aerial photographs.
It is probable that vegetation obscures any
remnants of these two roads which might have survived modern land use.
PRIMARY ZONE GRANTS
The Green C.

DeWitt and Charles Mason Grants

A large percentage of the study area was originally granted in
two tracts to the heirs of Green C. DeWitt. These constitute the
eastern end of the designated study area and include the town of
Ledbetter.
Also included in this discussion is the Charles Mason
first-class headright grant, the early history of which closely
parallels that of the DeWitt heir grants. Â·
About one-half of the 3301.6-acre Green C.
DeWitt grant is
within the study area (Texas General Land Office 1978 map, abstract
no. 164). Nearly all of the larger 4428.4-acre DeWitt grant (op.
cit., abstract no. 165) is within the survey bounds and the Charles
Mason 1813.49-acre grant is entirely inside the study area (op. cit.,
abstract no.
236). Both DeWitt and Mason are historical figures of
some note. Mason married Eveline DeWitt and thus, along with his
wife, was one of the heirs to whom the DeWitt grants were patented.
Green C. DeWitt was the empressario of the colony east of the
Austin Colony and made his headquarters at Gonzales. A very prominent
figure in the Colonial period, on equal footing with Stephen F.
Austin himself, DeWitt died May 18, 1835 (Webb 1952 Vol. I:496) before
the Declaration of Independence. Two grants in Fayette County were
made in the ten years following his death to the surviving heirs by
the Republic of Texas. The smaller grant was patented to the heirs on
April 2, 1845, and the larger on the following day (General Land
Office, Fayette first class file no. 60 .and 67).
These heirs were
C.C.
DeWitt, Minerva DeWitt Jones, Charles Mason and William A.
Matthews (Fayette County Deed Book S, p. 382).
The grant to Charles Mason was patented on December 11,
evidently it was he who thought the land had some potential.

1841;

was a veteran of the Revolution, having fought in both the Battle of
Gonzales and the Battle of San Jacinto.
He was born in 1812 in
Augusta, Georgia. At age 26, after the Revolution, he married Eveline
DeWitt on April 28, 1838, in Houston (Webb 1952 Vol. II:154). In 1840
Mason was living in Travis County but owned 1138 acres in Gonzales
County.
No Masons are listed in the 1850 census of Fayette County;
evidently Mason never lived on, nor improved, any of his holdings in
the study area. He was still a resident of Gonzales when he died in
1883 at age 71.
Clearly these lands were held for speculation and never improved
nor put into production before the Civil War. From 1841 to 1867 Mason
paid the taxes on these vast holdings, waiting for a proper time to
sell.
That time never came. In the immediate aftermath of the Civil
War the collapse of the Southern monetary system forced
many
landowners to sell vast tracts to settle cash debts. In September
1866, one Eli Mitchell obtained a lien on all of Mason's lands in
Fayette County to settle a judgement of $516.24 (Fayette County Deed
Book S, p. 384). Except for the one-fifth interest of C.C.
DeWitt,
the DeWitt lands were also sold to Hodge (see Deed Book S, p. 382ff,
April 27, 1867).
.
Hodge recorded a power of attorney to Hamilton Ledbetter, a Round
Top lawyer, on January 18, 1871 (Fayette County Deed Book W, p. 432)
for the purpose of subdividing and disposing of the land. The town of
Ledbetter had been laid out and platted about a month earlier, on
December 6, 1870. The firm of Ledbetter and Weyand acted as agents in
the subdivision of the remaining lands through the 1880 1 s. Farms as
small as 20 to 50 acres were sold during this period.
Very few of
these small holdings proved to be viable as a single farm.
Hodge is listed in the 1870 census as a farmer who was born in
He had been the U.S. Postmaster of Round Top from
Texas in 1828.
January 31, 1861, until his reappointment of the same job by the
Confederate government on July 12, 1861 (Wheat ms:1290). Hodge was
replaced as postmaster on December 22, 1864, also
under the
Confederate government.
According to Worth S. Ray (1949:268), the
Lebetter family was among the first settlers in the Round Top area and
occupied land some 3 miles east of that town, where the Round Top
Academy was built. Ray says that the first Fourth of July celebration
organized in Round Top in 1851 was presided over by the "Honorable H.
Ledbetter
in his resplendent decorations. 11
The third member of the development team, George
Weyand,
Ledbetter's partner in the firm that subdivided the lands, was a
Prussian.
The 1860 Round Top census taker recorded him as a
35-year-old farmer and butcher holding real estate worth $2,000.00 and
personal property of equal value. His oldest child, a daughter named
Wilhelmina, was born in Texas in 1853. Weyand 1 s will (Fayette County
Probate Records) indicates that quite a large number of people had
borrowed money at interest from him. This may, in fact, have been a
sideline business for some time.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

50

To recapitulate and to relate this history of the DeWitt and
Mason lands to the general themes of this chapter, let us look back
briefly. Charles Mason claimed land in 1841 on upper Cummins Creek,
ten years after the choicer parcels to the south had been granted by
the Austin Colony. Mason sucessfully pressed two additional claims in
the name of his long-dead father-in-law, gaining two large grants for
the heirs in 1845. These lands were evid~ntly held for speculation
alone until their sale was recorded in 1867.
The profits of
speculation came to others with the post-Civil War influx
of
immigrants seeking land. The establishment of the railroad made cash
crop agriculture a new way of life in these upland regions. Ledbetter
prospered as a cotton belt railroad town. By 1902 there were four
general stores, two lumberyards, two drug stores, two saloons, a
blacksmith shop, and two physicians in town (Lotto 1902:396).
The Elias Gilpin Lands
The 2331-acre Elias Gilpin grant is contained entirely within the
study area; indeed, it is in the center. This land was patented to
his heirs on September 15, 1854 (General Land Office, Fayette
first-class headright file no. 102). Unlike the DeWitt heirs, the
Gilpin heir, Lucretia Gilpin Brooks, placed
portions
of
her
inheritance on the market almost as soon as it was granted. The
earliest sale located was a 400-acre tract sold to R. Hildebrandt on
November 18, 1855, for $200.00, or 50 cents per acre (Fayette County
Deed Book K, p. 462). The purchaser appears to have been Rheinhard
Hildebrandt, a resident of the nearby Biegel settlement, the one man
who was arrested and imprisoned for his part in an alleged 11 rebellion 11
against the Confederate government (Carter and Ragsdale 1976:88; U.S.
War Department 1866:945-946).
Because Hildebrandt owned over 800
acres of other land in 1860 and is widely reported as a resident of
the Biegel settlement, it is unlikely that he intended to settle on
this land himself. Tax records indicate that land values in and near
the study area varied greatly in the latter half of the nineteenth
century, reflecting the suitability of the land for growing crops that
were profitable at that time. Hildebrandt's 400 acre parcel of the
Samuel P.
Brown grant, located just west of the intersection of the
Wilbarger Trace and the LaBahia Road, was evaluated in 1860 at ten
times as much as his Elias Gilpin parcel of the same size (Texas State
Archives:microfilm tax roll). The Brown grant had been patented in
1821; the Gilpin land lay unclaimed for another 23 years, even though
it lay only eight miles further up the Wilbarger Trace.
A number of others purchased smaller tracts of the Gilpin survey
from Mrs. Brooks. Fred Raithke bought 100 acres on February 20, 1857
(Deed Book M, p. 30). Charles Wiederanders bought 101 acres the same
day (Deed Book M, p.
531).
Valentine Storch bought 100 acres
November 10, 1856 (Deed Book 0, p. 94). Bernard Fabken purchased 183
acres on July 10, 1855 and resold it to John Jungermann in 1859. In
1857, James C. Bell purchased the balance of the Gilpin survey and
continued to sell off small farms to settlers. He still held 67 acres
for tax purposes by 1860.

Table 7 represents a reconstruction of farms, and their products,
in operation on the Gilpin tract by 1860. The table was compiled by
comparing the 1860 manuscript census schedules, Productions
of
Agriculture, and the tax return rolls. The sometimes imaginative
spellings of German names in those documents have been corrected but
readers are advised to be somewhat wary of the result. The numbers of
horses and other livestock are generally higher in the census than on
the tax roll. The higher values are given in the table.

Note that the two largest farms listed in the table belong to
Anglo-Americans, rather than to Germans.
The 500 acre George W.
Thompson farm is certainly a large-scale cash crop operation but other
records describe his holdings as more modest. It is possible that
Thompson was farming a combination of his own holdings plus tracts
leased from others.
The other large holding, the John C. Moss farm, requires special
mention.
The antebellum log cabin, barn (Fig. 6) and other features
of this farm are intact and well preserved, and still owned by his
descendents.

of

Moss was shown in the 1860 census population schedules (Fayette
County 1860 census, p. 61, Round Top Post Office dwelling 477, family
551) as a 26-year-old farmer born in New York holding real estate
valued at $1,000.00 and personal property worth $330.00. The value
placed by Moss on his land seems to reflect a price of perhaps one
dollar per acre.
His wife, Francis [sic] Moss, was born in 1840 in
Oldenburg. Two children, both born in Texas, are listed - Susana, age
3 and Adelaine, age 1.
In the 1860 census, Louise Fink is listed as only 12 years old
but apparently keeping house for her father and three brothers. All
of the Fink family, including 9 year old Fritz, were born in
Mecklenburg. John Fink purchased the 177 acre John Paine grant on May
14, 1860 (Fayette County Deed Book 0, p. 397) and his is the first
farm listed in Table 6. Louise Fink was to become the second wife of
John Moss (Von Rosenber~ 1974:140).
John Paine Grant
John Paine received headright certificate number 114, good for 11 a
league and a labor 11 (5000 varas square and 1000 varas square, or,
4828.4 acres). He claimed the league (General Land Office 1978,
abstract no.
260) in the southern part of the county in 1852 and
evidently lived there. On March 3, 1854, the smaller, one-labor grant
was patented to Paine (spelled variously Payne, Pain and Paine in the
records) and on November 20, 1855 he sold it to C.H.N.
Hartz.
John
Fink purchased the holding from D. Hartz and it remained in the Fink
family until September 26, 1872, when John and Fritz sold it to Edward
Powitzsky (Fayette County Deed Book 16, p. 217). Twenty two years
later, on October 3, 1894, the farm was purchased by Fred MÂ·ull er
(Fayette County Deed Book 51, p. 135).
The farm remains intact today but was found to contain 204 acres,
rather than 177.1.
When our survey was conducted in 1982, the
property belonged to Paul Pietch.
Isaac Mullins Grant
This 315 acre grant is entirely within the study area. The third
class headright certificate issued to Mullins was used to patent two
separate parcels of land. The parcel patented to Mullins himself
(General Land Office 1978, abstract no. 246) is located in another
part of the county. The parcel in the study area (General Land Office
1978, abstract 247) was patented to E.W. Crawford on March 16, 1854
(General Land Office, Fayette Third class file no. 19).
There are two Isaac Mullins grants, one of 315 and one of 325
acres, which creates some problems in researching the early tax rolls.
It appears, however, that the Mullins grant within the Prospect was
not occupied by an active farmer until after the Civil War.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

54

Franklyn Darby Grant
The Franklyn Darby grant presents a similarly ambiguous history
that suggests it was never actively settled in the nineteenth century.
The Darby certificate was evidently purchased by Andrew M.
Lindsey,
who used it to patent this 320 acre parcel on September 1, 1852
(General Land Office, Fayette Third class file no. 18). Lindsey does
not appear in the 1860 agricultural census as an area farmer. The
land was left in Lindsey's will, dated October 5, 1865, to Mary E.
Lindsey and Queen E. Lindsey (Fayette County Deed Book 91, p. 391).
The next recorded transaction was the sale of this parcel by Queen E.
Lindsey and others to Charles Korb on December 5, 1911 (Fayette County
Deed Book 93, p. 196).
While it is possible that this land was leased and under
cultivation in the nineteenth century, there is no direct evidence to
support this. The land is now cleared and shows signs of recent
cultivation.
Examination of the 1949 aerial photographs also shows
significant cultivation of the tract. However, the survey crews found
no archeological sites or standing structures over 50 years old and it
appears that usage of this land has occurred mainly after 1911.
Henry R.

Craig Grant

The first class headright certificate issued to Henry R.
Craig
was evidently sold to a land speculation partnership, Redmond and
McGill, and used by them to patent a 1475.83 acre tract astride the
Wilbarger Trace on April 19, 1846 (General Land Office, Fayette First
class file no. 63).
This large tract remained intact until 1895 when G.T.
Arnold
began to sell off smaller parcels. On January 4, 1895, Carl Busch
bought 150 acres (Fayette County Deed Book 51, p. 252).
Twenty six
acres were sold to John Will on June 6, 1895 (Fayette County Deed Book
53, p. 182). Henry Albers bought a larger, 281.8 acre, tract on
October 10, 1900 (Fayette County Deed Book 68, p. 40).
Two standing structures were found on this property.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Hays, the present owners of both houses, believe they were
constructed in the 1920 1 s. A more specific discussion of these houses
is contained in the next chapter.
Robert G.

Baugh Grant

Just to the south of the Craig grant and also bisected by the
Wilbarger Trace is the quarter league granted by the Austin Colony to
Robert Baugh on October 5, 1835. Because this 1107.1 acre grant was
to one individual, we made an extensive, but unsuccessful, effort to
identify him. The 1840 census of the Republic of Texas contains no
one of that surname in the index (White 1966:214). There is no entry
for any such person in Webb's Handbook of Texas. The 1850 census of
Fayette County shows no individual with this surname.

CUMMINS CREEK

55

It appears that effective settlement of this tract began only
after the Civil War.
A subdivision plat of the quarter league was
entered February 12, 1867 (Fayette County Deed Book T, p. 159).
The
30 to 100 acre parcels were sold largely to families with German
surnames during the 1870's.
PERIPHERAL BUFFER ZONE
The Baugh grant is the last of the land grants that lies partly
within the primary mining zone. The tracts discussed below in this
chapter are either wholly or partially included in the buffer zone
which surrounds the primary mining zone. These areas will experience
only indirect effects of the mining operations and discussion will be
limited to the very earliest ownership history. A more complete and
comprehensive land history is possible and should be undertaken where
extensions of the mining zone are later envisioned or when significant
historic sites are identified. For the present, a brief discussion of
each parcel in the periphery will suffice.
James G.

Wilkinson Grant

A small portion of this grant from the Austin Colony is included
in the southwest corner of the buffer zone. This league was titled to
the grantee on October 14, 1835.
John Vanderworth League
On the southern edge of the study area roughly the northern half
of the Vanderworth league is included in the buffer zone. This league
was patented to the grantee on August 12, 1848 (General Land Office,
Fayette First class file no. 81). The Wilkenson league borders it on
the west, the Baugh and Charles Mason grants are along its northern
boundary and the smaller Green C. DeWitt grant lies to the east. The
two DeWitt grants extend into both mining and buffer zones
Nicholas Taylor Grant
Three small grants along the northern border of Fayette County
comprise the remaining lands in the buffer zone. The easternmost of
these is the Nicholas Taylor grant. Taylor was given a Bounty Land
Warrant (no.
1162) by the Adjutant General of the State of Texas on
November 11, 1852, for service in the Army of the Republic from June 1
to November 30, 1837.
It was good for 640 acres of land (Miller
1967:632). On the following day, November 12, 1852, 640 acres were
patented to Taylor in Fayette County (General Land Office, Fayette
Bounty file no. 45). Less than a year later this entire tract was
transferred to Marion G.
Taylor (Fayette County Deed Book J, p.
332).

Thompson Donation Grant

The Thompson grant was also based on military service in the
Revolution.
In this case, a special donation certificate was

HISTORIC RESOURCES

issued to Thompson by the Secretary of War of the Republic of Texas on
May 15, 1838, because he was at the Battle of San Jacinto (Miller
1967:855). Thompson, a prominent Houston lawyer who served as Chief
Justice of Harris County in 1842 and 1846, died there in 1873 (Webb
1952 Vol. II:773). He never lived in Fayette County.
At some time
between 1838 and 1872 the Thompson donation certificate was sold to
James P. McKinney who used it on August 23, 1872 to patent the land
discussed here.
It is perhaps significant to note that, although this land was
bisected by the Washington-to-Bastrop Road (or Goacher Trace) and lay
just south of the crossroad with the Wilbarger Trace, it remained part
of the unclaimed public domain forty years after the bulk of the
county lands had been claimed.
Montraville Wood Grant
The 320 acre Montraville (also spelled Montroville or Montrivill)
Wood grant which lies between the Thompson and Taylor grants
underscores the same point. The southwest corner of this tract was
also crossed by the Goacher Trace which was in use after 1828, but
this parcel remained unclaimed public domain until April 26, 1877.
This land, too, was claimed on the basis of a Bounty Warrant issued
for three months service, July through November 1836, in the Army of
the Republic of Texas (Miller 1967:700). The warrant was issued 13
years later, in 1849, and not exercised until 1877.
Montraville Wood appears in the 1850 census of Fayette County
(Carpenter 1966:733) as a 44-year-old farmer with nine daughters and
one son. The son, Montraville Jr., was 4 years old. Wood, a native
of Missouri, obtained an Austin Colony grant along the Colorado River
in 1831. It seems most likely that he continued to live there and not
on the tract under discussion. Because Wood Sr. would have been over
70 in 1877, it may be that the land was actually patented to his heir,
31-year-old Montraville Jr. In any case, the 320 acres could not have
been very attractive for settlement if it remained unclaimed for over
a generation.
Forty six years elapsed between the time Wood gained
title to the choice tract on the Colorado and the time this smaller,
upland tract was claimed.
Summary
The study area is a largely upland region on the upper reaches of
the Cummins Creek watershed near the divide between the Colorado and
Brazos drainage basins.
It does not appear to have been very
attractive to the earliest wave of Anglo-American settlers. Such
claims as were made in the area were evidently more a financial
speculation against rising land prices than true homesteading.
The first effective settlement seems to have been accomplished by
immigrants from the German states during the late 1850's. Although
some Anglo families lived nearby around Round Top, the area remained

57

CUMMINS CREEK

largely German until after the railroad came to, and largely created,
the town of Ledbetter. This opened the cash crop phase of the area's
history and made the extensive gravel deposits a saleable commodity as
well. Lotto (1902:396) speaks of "gravel pits and rock quarries the
rock of which was used for the construction of the Galveston jetties."
This late nineteenth century exploitation of the gravel deposits
had a considerable effect on the cultural resources of the region.
Traces of railroads constructed to transport gravels still remain in
the northeastern portion of the Prospect near U.S. 290. Gravel
quarrying in the past and at the present has undoubtedly affected the
known distribution of prehistoric sites.
Those located on the
gravel-rich uplands around Cummins Creek are often severely damaged
and it can be assumed that many were destroyed.

his book German Seed in Texas Soil Terry Jordan concluded that
settlers in eastern settlements, such as the Round Top area in
County, differed from their countrymen in the hill country in
respects:

In general, greater contrasts were noted between
the
immigrant Germans and native southern farmers in the western
counties. For example, the Hill Country Germans had a more
diversified crop economy and, in ante-bellum times, a
distinctly higher number of oxen in proportion to horses
than the Americans in adjacent areas, while at the same time
they utilized imported construction methods
and
even
attempted
to
establish
the farm-village system.
In
contrast, the Germans of the eastern settlements adopted an
undiversified crop association dominated by corn and cotton
like that of their Anglo-American neighbors, made no effort
to introduce Old World settlement forms or construction
methods, and had an ox/horse ratio almost identical to that
of the southern yeomen. (Jordan 1966: 194)
Two of the following four propositions derived from Jordan's
study present an excellent opportunity for strictly field survey data
of historic archeological sites and standing structures to be used to
test propositions established through another discipline, in this
case, cultural geography. Two require the use of archival census
data.
Reworded, the testable hypotheses are:
1.
The German settlers in the upper Cummins Creek area
established a dispersed hamlet settlement pattern of small farms
similar to their Anglo-American neighbors.
2. The German settlers used building methods
house types similar to their Anglo neighbors.

and

vernacular

58

HISTORIC RESOURCES

3. Early agricultural patterns of the Germans in this region
were similar to the Anglo norm with heavy dependence on corn and
cotton as undifferentiated staple crops.
The first two hypotheses can be tested with data gathered from
the distribution and nature of houses where the ethnic background of
the family can be established.
The third is subject to
the
acquisition of background information from the Products of Agriculture
schedule of the census for the earliest year of effective German
settlement.
Data on the livestock can be taken from the same source
allowing us to test a fourth hypothesis derived from Jordan 1 s general
conclusion:
4. The ratio of oxen to horses held by the Germans in the
Cummins Creek area did not differ significantly from the ratio of
draft animals kept by Anglo farmers in the region.
These propositions are predicated on the expectation that the
area to be surveyed was largely settled by German immigrants beginning
in the 1850 1 s.
Historic Sites and Structures
INTRODUCTION
Thirty five historic sites and standing structures (Table 8) were
documented during the survey. Our criteria for recording a particular
house or the remains of a structure was quite simple:
any over 50
years old were recorded. When the exact age of a house was fn doubt,
it was recorded. Although this will fill the files with a great many
photographs of houses of little current research interest, we are
preserving for future researchers the essentials for settlement
pattern and vernacular architecture studies.
Eleven sites, described below, are of sufficient
architectural merit to warrant further consideration.

or

CEMETERIES
Cemeteries enjoy a special status under Texas state law and are
not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The four
cemeteries in the Prospect all merit historic site designations as the
burial grounds of early settlers and for their unique tombstones.
41FY273, The Bell Cemetery
This small country cemetery is located on the Elias Gilpin
survey.
Engravings on the headstones are largely in the German
language and many of the surnames of the earliest settlers on the
Gilpin tract are represented.
There are about 30 marked graves in
this rather small square plot. Some of the gravestones are worthy of
consideration as folk art.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

The gravestone of Johan Gottliebilgen pictured in Figure 7 is
perhaps one of the best.
It is probable that this is the correct
spelling of the name which we gave as John Gonder (following the 1860
tax roll) in Table 7. In any case, the birth year matches well with
an entry on page 61 of the 1860 Fayette County MS census (dwelling
478, family 552). The surname begins with 11 G11 and ends with 11 en 11 for
a farmer named John age 37 born in Mecklenburg. His 35 year old wife,
Sarah, was born in England and their 7 year old son, George, in Texas.
As can be seen from the gravestone, Johan died in 1881.
The grave of another of the early settlers on the Gilpin survey,
Friedrich Rethke, (1813-1898) is also in the Bell cemetery. The other
graves in the cemetery are largely late nineteenth century but at
least one 1978 interment was noted.
The name of the cemetery seems to have derived from the common
school district which once defined a dispersed rural hamlet as a
Be 11 who
community. The name 11 Be 11 11 probably comes from J.C.
purchased the estimated 700 acre balance of the Gilpin grant from
Gilpin's daughter and who continued to sell off small farms to newly
arrived settlers. Bell purchased the parcel on February 20, 1857 and
had sold all but 67 acres by 1860.
41FY281, Amos Alexander Memorial
Near the northern boundary of the prospective m1n1ng zone is a
memorial to Amos Alexander and his son who were killed by Indians
along the Washington-to-Bastrop Road on June 1, 1835. It is not clear
from the wording of this monument whether it marks the graves of the
Alexanders or the presumed site of the massacre, or both. Local oral
tradition favors the burials being at this spot even though the
wording on the memorial is ambiguous. The monument itself appears to
date from perhaps a century after the deaths. The only sure way to
prove this is a grave would be to excavate it, which, if it is a
grave, is a violation of Texas criminal law. It seems prudent to
assume this is an isolated cemetery.
41FY283, Moss Family Cemetery
This small, well-fenced cemetery is located well off the road in
a wooded area. The oldest grave is that of a two-year-old boy, Irving
Barnes, who was buried in 1892. The grave of the patriarch of the
Moss family in Fayette County, John C. Moss (1831-1897), is the most
notable of the six marked graves.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, Moss settled on
portion of the Gilpin survey in the late 1850's and was
successful farm in 1860 (see Table 7 above).
The log
outbuildings of that farm were found largely intact

41FY289, Schumann Family Cemetery
The Schumann cemetery is a neatly kept, well-fenced plot along a
country road in the southwest corner of the Nicholas Taylor grant.
The original Washington-to-Bastrop road ran through this general area
but the present road system tends to follow cadastral survey lines.
As with the Moss cemetery, the earliest marked burial here is
that of a child. Ida Christina Burkhardt (1899-1900) is shown on the
earlist stone. There are, however, at least five unmarked graves.
The eldest individual buried here was Lammat B. [sic] Schumann
(1847-1922). This seems to be ''Lambert" [sic] Schumann who appears in
the 1860 census as a 12-year-old boy from Hanover in the Henry
Behrends household with his mother and older brother (1860 census
61, dwelling 479, family 556). Aunchen Schumann
Fayette County p.
was 46, born in Hanover, as was her 18-year-old son, Henry.
Henry
Behrends, the head of the household, was 75 and his wife 68. Mrs.
Schumann could have been their daughter, however, the relationship is
not clear from the census entry.
The remarkable stability of the initial German settler families
is again demonstrated by this small cemetery. Henry H. Schumann, no
doubt named for his forebear, was buried in 1967 at the age of 85.
The_ last stone to be placed in the plot was dated 1972.
Standing Structures
41FY272, Albers-Behrens Farm
This complex of nineteenth century vernacular farm buildings
appears to date from the antebellum era. The land was sold by C.
Kruse to B.H. Behrens on May 29, 1860 (Fayette County Deed Book R, p.
14).
One Carl Kruse is listed in the 1860 MS census for this area
(Round Top P.O.
dwelling 482, family 559). He was a 32-year-old
farmer from Oldenburg living alone. It seems certain that this is the
same "Oldenburger schoolmaster" that is mentoned by Biesele (1930:60)
The census
as one of the founders of the Welcome in Austin County.
entry makes it clear that he was living in the area in 1860.
A close neighbor of Kruse (dwelling 479, family 553) in 1860 was
Henry Behrends [sic], a 75-year-old farmer from Hanover, with his two
sons, Seebert, 31 and John, 28, who are listed as well diggers.
Bernard H. Behrens, who purchased this property from Kruse, is listed
in the 1870 census (Precinct 3, Ashen's Store P.O. p.
38, dwelling
319), as 43 years old, born in Prussia, with $500 each in real and
personal property. Pauline, his 36-year~old wife, was also Prussian
born.
Their children, Pauline 8, Henry 6, Louis 5 and Helene 2, were
all born in Texas. Dwelling 321 on the same page is occupied by a
family headed by John Behrens. One cannot make a clear match between
the John Behrends [sic] well digger age 28 in 1860 and John Behrens
age 41 ten years later.
However, because the census taker often

HISTORIC RESOURCES

talked to only those family members who happened to be at home at the
time, ages that were not known exactly were often estimated. The
change in the place of birth given from Hanover in 1860 to Prussia in
1870 may be explained by the fact that the Prussian takeover of
Hanover occurred during that decade and that Bismark unified Germany
as an empire in 1871.
Hanover had ceased to be a sovereign state
between 1860 and 1870.
Perhaps the oldest extant features of the site itself are two
quite crude single pen log structures that now serve as outbuildings.
Neither of these show any sign of having had a fireplace or other
means of heating.
It was tentatively concluded that both buildings
were erected originally as outbuildings and were never intended as

of the better educated Germans who came to Texas in the middle of the
nineteenth century lacked the frontier skills of cabin building and
that their attempts to adapt sometimes led them to construct rather
crude shelters. As Jordan observed (1966:166) "the native southerners
remained in log cabins for many years before finally replacing them
with modest frame houses, the Germans regarded their initial dwellings
as temporary necessities of pioneer life, to be discarded as quickly
as possible."
The modest vernacular frame house on this property, pictured in
Figure 8, conforms well with the general profile of German frame
farmhouses in Texas. The attic room, entered from the outside by
stair or ladder is, perhaps, the most distinctly ethnic feature of
this house. The house appears to be of a post-Civil War date and the
building hardware employed suggests that cast iron stoves and patent
locks brought into the stores in Ledbetter were available when it was
constructed
RECOMMENDATIONS: If the log outbuildings on this site were
indeed used at one time as dwellings, they are significant to the
heritage of the German element in Texas and therefore worthy of
consideration for National Register status. If these buildings were
erected originally as outbuildings in the late nineteenth century, no
such
potential exists.
It is therefore recommended that test
excavations, a more intensive archival research effort and a local
oral history collection be undertaken to determine if these log
structures were ever used as human habitations.
The following general hypotheses are offered as
research design for the testing phase:

41FY280, New Wendler House
This is a modest board and batten sided vernacular farmhouse with
a gable end chimney on the west end. It has a metal roof. This house
was constructed on the site of an earlier log cabin {41FY279, see
Appendix) around the turn of the century.
This site merits further investigation as to its history and
composition because of the very long term occupation by a single
family and the consequent rich store of oral history that can be
obtained from the current landowner and his uncle. The Wendler farm
seems to have considerable local significance and should be further
investigated to determine whether it may meet the criteria for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
41FY284, John C.

Moss Homestead

This is a remarkably well-preserved, mid-nineteenth century
farmstead (Fig. 6). It consists of a single pen log cabin dwelling,
a log barn and another log outbuilding which may have been either a
separate kitchen or perhaps a smokehouse. The dwelling itself is in
virtually pristine condition with a solid, watertight roof.
The main original log pen is constructed of hewn square logs with
elaborate full dovetail notching.
A native limestone chimney and
large fireplace with mantle intact grace the gable end of the main
floor.
A well constructed, small, box stairway leads to a finished
sleeping loft above the main room.
Traces of the original lime
whitewash can be seen on the log walls of this space. A later, two
room addition is appended to the rear of the house.
This property clearly can be considered for a determination of
eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places because of its
relatively intact condition and age. The Moss family still . owns the
land and successive generations have been prominent members of the
Ledbetter and LaGrange communities. Edward H. Moss, the son of John
C.
and his second wife, Louise Fink, was born in 1874. He became a
well known lawyer in LaGrange, serving as both city attorney and
county attorney (Von Rosenberg 1974:140).
Through him, his heirs
currently own the pioneer farm established by their grandfather.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Further research and limited subsurface testing
should be undertaken to aid in the assessment of the National Register
potential of this property. Extensive photogrammetric recording of
these structures should be undertaken to preserve this rare glimpse
into a mid-nineteenth century farmstead.
41FY294, Wehrmeister Homestead

filled-in well complete the major features at this site.
The house was built by the master carpenter, Mr. Petzold, before
1888. The reputation of Mr. Petzold for building solid, high-quality
homes has survived almost a century. Owners of these homes mention
with pride the name of the builder. Photogrammetric recording of this
house and further oral history research into the work of Mr.
Petzold
are recommended to assess the National Register potential of this
site.
41FY297, Bernhausen-Koopman House
This late nineteenth century farmhouse (Fig. 9) is now used to
store hay.
The current tenant of the property lives in a modern
mobile home which largely obscures the old house from the road.
The
house presents several features which are unusual including a large
loft room in the attic which is reached via a retractable ladder that
folds into the ceiling of the porch. This arrangement of a loft room
entered from the exterior is a characteristic of the more distinctly
ethnic German vernacular architecture found around Fredricksburg and
the more western German settlements.
The house is currently in poor condition. It is doubtful that it
will stand another five years or that the ruin could be restored. The
current cond1tion of the structure suggests that it would not meet
National Register criteria. However, the interesting features of the
house as possible examples of Central European folk architecture
transplanted
to Texas make further investigation and recording
advisable.
Also, more detailed recording using
photogrammetric
techniques, research to establish the identity and ethnic origin of
the builder, and evaluation by an architectural historian would be
required to make a complete determination of eligibility of the
National Register potential of this property.
41FY300, Drawe Hof (Gr: farmstead)
An elaborate and imposing farmhouse was erected by the Drawe
family on the western portion of the larger Green C. DeWitt survey.
According to members of the Drawe family who still own the property,
Ludwig (Louis) Drawe came to Texas in the late 1830's and built the
large, comfortable house for his family shortly after he purchased a
parcel of the DeWitt survey in May 1884.
The 1860 census of Fayette County (Round Top P.O.
family 439)
lists the Drawe family as residents in the general area. Louis [sic]
is shown to be a 44-year-old farmer born in Lippe-Detmold.
His wife
Cathren [sic] was 30 that year. They had four sons - Louis 10, August
8, William 6, and C.L. 3. A five-year old daughter, Henretta [sic]
and her baby sister of nine months, Willhelmena [sic] complete the
family.
The house itself (Fig.
10) is a remarkable blend of high
Victorian trimwork, practical dogtrot breezeways and solid carpentry.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

It has been well preserved by the family and is in good repair.
Although the structure might merit consideration as a potential
National Register of Historic Places property, the owners are not
inclined to favor such a nomination. It is clear that the house is in
good enough repair and of sufficient architectural merit to be a clear
candidate for adaptive reuse on this or another site.

41FY301, Town of Ledbetter
Ledbetter was laid out in a most ambitious manner with ample
provision for growth.
Like many other small towns that sprang up
along the railroad following the Civil War, it enjoyed an era of
growth and prosperity that ended during the Great Depression half a
century ago.
The original plat of the planned town is depicted in Figure 11

RECOMMENDATIONS: If Ledbetter is included within the final

of an oral history and photographs in order to support a determination
of eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.

eastern region, such as the area of the Prospect, quickly adapted to
the southern Anglo lifeway and failed to preserve ethnically distinct
patterns.
Discussed below is an examination of each
of the
propositions derived from Jordan's work to see how well this model
conforms to the information gained in the survey.

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Our first hypothesis was:
1. The German settlers

in the upper Cummins Creek area
established a dispersed hamlet settlement pattern of
small farms similar t!> their Anglo-American neighbors.

Before Ledbetter was founded, there seems to have been no real
central focus of the community. The Bell community cemetery appears
to have served most of the original German families who settled on the
Gilpin lands before the Civil War. There was also a Bell community
school. One of the houses (41FY278) recorded in the survey once
served briefly in that capacity. The physical remains of the school
were not recorded because our crew did not have access to the land,
however, the concrete steps were visible from a public road. The
school is located some distance from the cemetery, thus at least these
two central-place functions were dispersed.
The name 11 Bell Settlement" appears to have derived from J.C.
Bell who purchased the balance of the Gilpin survey from Lucretia
Gilpin Brooks on February 20, 1857 (Fayette County Deed Book 0, p.
205) and subsequently sold these lands in small parcels to the newly
arrived German settlers. There is a brief note in the 1870 census (p.
38) that Aschen's store served as the post office for this area but
this was a short-lived situation.
The small separate farmsteads suggest the same dispersed hamlet
settlement pattern of yeoman farmers from the upper south. There is
no evidence of any attempt to set up a central European agricultural
village here. Our first hypothesis is then confirmed.
Our second hypothesis was:
2. The German settlers used building methods and
house types similar to their Anglo neighbors.

vernacular

The validity of this hypothesis may be questioned by some of the
structures in the Prospect. The Moss cabin is typical of the housing
erected by Anglo settlers in this area before the Civil War. While it
is true that sawn lumber was available for building purposes from
several mills along the Colorado as early as 1850 and even earlier at
San Felipe de Austin, the typical cash-poor, southern yeoman farmer
normally erected a log home first. As was done at the Moss cabin, by
or for its New York-born owner, the central log pen often served as
the base for later additions built of sawn lumber and was often
"weather boarded 11
to present an overall appearance of milled
horizontal siding. It is significant that the solidly built Moss
cabin is the only one of its type found in the study area; most other
early settlers were German.
The two, rather crude,
single
pen
structures
on
the
Albers-Behrens farm (41FY272) and the Wendler Cabin (41FY279) are the
only cabins in this area probably built by German settlers. The frame
house at the Albers site presents some characteristics] atypical of

CUMMINS CREEK

73

the Anglo building tradition although the materials (sawn lumber),
methods (balloon frame, board and batten siding, single wall) and
exterior features (front porch) are similar to the "east Texas house"
defined by Evans (1952). The floorplan of this house and some other
early structures in the area suggest that, while some traditional
center-hall Anglo houses were built, these earlier houses had a single
front room with a loft above and a rear kitchen. The Albers house had
no interior stair to the loft as in the Moss cabin; the loft room was
reached from outside by ladder.
This loft room entered from the
outside is frequently seen in German built houses in Fredericksburg
and other western German hill country areas.
The generalized single-room loft-and-kitchen type house (Fig.
13) is a composite of the Albers-Behrens house (41F272), the Wendler
house (41FY280), the Bernhausen-Koopmann house (41FY297) and the
Stuermer cottage (41FY282). Although none of these conform exactly to
the pattern, all seem to derive from some such ideal type.
The
general layout and profile of this type is similar to the stone-built
A. Fischer farmhouse illustrated by Jordan (1966:83) as a typical
small German hill country farmhouse.
Thus, the second hypothesis might be generally confirmed - we
found no stone or half timbered central European farmhouses - but
there does seem to be a distinct house type associated with the German
settlers.
None of the early German houses conform to the Anglo
tradition of the center-hall house. Until Mr. Petzold began to erect
two-story homestead houses in the fashion of the late nineteenth
century, many of the German-built homes presented novel, somewhat
individual departures from the Anglo building tradition, though many
features were borrowed and no
uniquely
European
construction
techniques were used. The Drawe Hof (41FY300) is an extreme example.
It presents a facade of center-hall normalcy to the world but is
halved by a dog trot that opens all rooms to the outside. This is an
individual and imaginative adaptation of several ideas common in Texas
Anglo tradition which are not usually found in combination.
We find that Hypothesis 2 is incompletely confirmed.
There
appears to be a distinct folk type of house found in the study area
that can be identified with the German-Texas building tradition.
The
house illustrated In Figure 13 attempts to generalize this house type.
Our third hypothesis was:
3. The German settlers adopted the general farming practices
and crop patterns of the Anglo farmers, depending heavily
on cotton and corn as staple crops.

This general thesis was originally part of Jordan's conclusion
based on census data from Waller and Austin counties (Jordan 1966:63).
Our evidence, while it is from the census figures and of a rather
limited number of farms, does not overlap with Jordan's original data
base which was from the census in two different counties.

CUMMINS CREEK

In this area the most striking aspect of the produce from these
farms in 1860 was not ethnic differences but how poorly these farms
produced compared with the averages derived by Jordan from his
Austin-Waller county sample. The following table illustrates some of
these figures (averages are per farm).

The Cummins Creek German averages are derived from all farms
listed in Table 7 except that for that of Mr. George W. Thompson.
The Moss farm is included in the figure. Because the Thompson farm
was listed in the Agricultural Census as 500 acres with 250 under
cultivation, we believe that it did not include the 130 acre parcel in
the Gilpin survey that lies within the study area. The production
figures suggest that Thompson had a plantation elsewhere and very
likely owned slaves.
Again, these figures point up the
marked difference
in
productivity in the richer Colorado River valley lands and this upland
region. No marked differences in intent between the Anglo yeomen and
these German immigrants are implied, only the capacity of the land to
yield. Most of the farmers attempted to grow cotton and corn to the
exclusion of small grains.
Only two, Henry Behrends and John
Jungermann, grew rye in 1860. The data does not refute the basic
hypothesis but tends to confirm it.
Our fourth hypothesis was:
4. The ratio of oxen to horses among
identical to that of Anglo farmers.

the

German

farmers

The farmers listed in Table 7, again excluding George W.
Thompson, owned no more than four horses; the average per farm was
two. However, the same 12 farmers owned 32 oxen, averaging almost
three per farm.
Jordan's (1966:84) averages are roughly 4 horses/5
oxen for German non-slave holders and 1 to 1 for southern yeomen with
no slaves. Our figures do not depart significantly from these norms.
The comparable ratio for Cummins Creek would be 4 horses to 5.5 oxen

is

76

HISTORIC RESOURCES

in 1860.

Thus our fourth hypothesis is confirmed.

CONCLUSION
The evidence gained from this survey on the upper Cummins Creek
watershed substantially confirms the observations made by Jordan in
Austin and Waller counties that the German settlers adopted the
southern yeoman lifeway at a very early date in these eastern
counties.. Jordan (1966:197) attributes this difference to
the
frontier isolation of the western counties where there was neither the
opportunity to see and copy Anglo traditions nor pressure to conform
to prevailing agricultural practices.
Summary of Recommendations
There are four cemeteries in the study area.
The Schumann
cemetery (41FY289) and the Moss family cemetery (41FY283) are in the
buffer zone and can be easily avoided. The Amos Alexander Memorial
(41FY281) is close to the boundary of the buffer zone and could be
avoided with a slight modification of the mining plans.
The Bell
cemetery (41FY273), however, is well within the primary mining zone
and will require a carefully planned scheme for avoidance.
Seven more of the total 34 recorded historic sites require
further investigation or consideration. We have recommended limited
subsurface archeological testing combined with detailed oral history
and archival investigation to assess the National Register potential
of the John C. Moss homestead (41FY284) and the Albers-Behrens farm
The New Wendler house site, 41FY280, which was also the
(41FY272).
site of an early log cabin, is recommended for further investigation
through archival research and oral history to assess its National
Register potential, but no subsurface testing is recommended.
Ledbetter has been assigned site number 41FY301 and recorded
through extensive photography. Although it is difficult to create and
maintain a National Register Historical District where a large number
of landowners in a small town are involved, Ledbetter deserves to be
considered for a determination of eligibility.
The two remaining sites are of interest primarily as examples of
rural folk architecture. The National Register of Historic Places or
Historic American Building Survey potential of these structures should
be assessed by a qualified architectural historian to aid in this
evaluation. These structures should be recorded by photogrammetry and
additional archival and oral history research should be done to
establish firm building dates and ethnicity of the first owner. These
two sites are:
41FY294, the Wehrmeister house and 41FY297, the
Bernhausen-Koopmann house. Both structures are in the extended buffer
zone.
The Drawe hof (41FY300) was sold and removed from its site within
the primary mining zone while ......this report was under review. The chief

CUMMINS CREEK

merit of this structure lay in its unusual architecture; thus,
further consideration of the original house site is recommended.

The results of this survey touch on several study topics outlined
in the Texas Historical Commission German-Texan study unit (Brown and
others 1982:142ff) but the limitations on survey data preclude
treating any one of theÂ· defined topics in depth. Our hypotheses
related most directly to Topic 20 (ibid:143) which addresses the
persistence or demise of European regionalism within the Texas
environment. Our findings are that although residual architectural
traits of German origin could be found in the earlier structures, the
acculuration process was rapid and the German immigrant population was
soon assimilated into the Anglo-American majority.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We would like to thank the people who helped bring this project
to a conclusion, both in the field and back at the lab. Many thanks
to Terry Colgan and Loy Aston who, along with their respective staff
at the L.C.R.A. helped us with their complete cooperation. Also, we
owe much gratitude to the many landowners who granted us access to
their property and supplied us with information about local history
and family history. Mr. Gordon Baker, the Tax-Assessor- Collector of
Fayette County rendered much valuable assistance in tracking down some
of the more elusive landowners.
Without his help, access to the
prospect properties would have been much less complete.
Back in the lab, we are very thankful and appreciative for a fine
staff of people who helped us from the beginning to the end of the
project. They include: Carol Fabac, who edited, typed and drafted;
Deborah Smith, who typed, input data on the computer and composed
tables; Abbie Treece, who typed and input data and Ann MacGuinness,
who typed and edited many of the site forms and text. Also our
appreciation to Dana Kolflat for developing the many photos. for the
project.

APPENDIX

Sites recorded in this survey but not specifically selected for
additional testing or excavation are described below in narrative
form. Additional characteristics are listed in abbreviated form in
Tables 4 and 8. Based on survey data, none of the sites described in
this appendix meet the basic criteria for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places either because of sparsity and shallowness
of cultural deposits or severe post-depositional disturbances caused
by modern land use, such as gravel quarrrying or agriculture.
Prehistoric Sites
41FY217
This site lies on the lower slope near Cummins Creek on Mabank
fine sandy loam (Soil Conservation Service 1981). Exposed in a gravel
pit, much of the site has been destroyed making it impossible to
estimate its bounds.
Burned rock and flakes were exposed in the
gravel pit walls to a depth of 40 to 50 cm. Lithic debris and burned
rock were lightly scattered over a broad surface area. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed and no period of occupation could
be determined. This site has been destroyed by gravel quarrying.
41FY218
On a lower slope of a terrace near Cummins Creek, this 30x30 m
site lies on Tremona loamy fine sand over clay (SCS 1979). Three
shovel tests were made and white cemented loamy sand encountered at
20-25 cm below the surface. In one test, black clay was found at 25
cm. This light scatter of flakes, chips, bifaces, and burned rock has
been seriously disturbed by quarrying and bulldozing. A few flakes
and burned rock were recovered from one probe between 20 and 25 cm
below the surface. None of the artifacts were time diagnostic.
41FY219
This light, featureless scatter is located along the northeast
bank of Cummins Creek approximately 800 m northwest of 41FY218.
Cultural material consists of burned rock and flakes exposed by gravel

observed on the surface, in bulldozer cuts, and in the small segment
of the site which remains unmodified. The soil is Bunyan fine sandy
loam over gravels (SCS 1980). No formal tools were observed.
This
site has been destroyed by gravel quarrying.

CUMMINS CREEK

41FY225
This site is located on a cleared north terrace of Cummins Creek.
The soil is Bunyan fine sandy loam (SCS 1980). Dense grass obscures

yielded flakes and burned rock. No formal tools were recovered.
41FY226
On a terrace of Cummins Creek, this 50x25 m site has probably
lost some of its cultural deposits on the north side due to erosion in
an old channel of the creek.
Two shovel tests were done in the
central and southeastern parts of the site. Cultural material was
observed to a depth of 60 cm but was largely burned chert and
limestone; one burned quartzite cobble may have been battered. The
frequently flooded Bunyan loamy fine sand soil (SCS 1980) of the
terrace contains small chert pebbles and is at least 60 cm deep. No
time of occupation could be assigned. The site has been disturbed by
gravel quarrying and rodent activity.
41FY227
Massive gravel outcrops on an upper slope overlooking the Cummins
Creek flood plain are the site of this light lithic scatter and raw
materials procurement area. Numerous cores and primary and secondary
flakes are scattered over an area about 40 m square. The site is
pocked with gravel quarry pits and largely destroyed.
No cultural
affiliation could be determined from the observed artifacts. The soil
is Tremona gravely loamy fine sand (SCS 1979).
41FY229
Located at the confluence of an unnamed tributary and Cummins
Creek, this site is nearly destroyed by gravel quarrying. The soil is
Bunyan fine sandy loam (SCS 1980) to at least 70 cm below the surface.
A lens of burned rock and flakes was exposed in the side of one gravel
pit. The site area measures about 20x20 m and no time diagnostics
were found.
41FY230
A light lithic scatter with burned rock, this featureless site is
located on the northeast terrace of Cummins Creek. Soils in this area
consist of Bunyan fine sandy loam over a clay subsoil (SCS 1980).
Chert flakes were observed on the surface of this 50x50 m occupation
area. Six shovel tests to a maximum depth of 1 m revealed a few
flakes and burned rock throughout all levels in three of the probes.
Cultural material was limited to flakes and a few burned rocks, hence
temporal assignation of the site is not possible.

PREHISTORIC SITES

88

41FY231
This site, situated on the flood plain in Cummins Creek, is
comprised of a light lithic scatter and encompasses an area of 110x40
m. No features were observed. The soil in the area of the site
consists of Bunyan fine sandy loam (SCS 1980). One shovel probe
excavated to a depth of 35 cm revealed cultural material to 25 cm
below the surface.
Artifacts observed include flakes, cores, a few
pieces of burned rock and one biface. Because none of the cultural
material is temporally or culturally diagnostic, cultural affiliation
cannot be determined.
41FY235
This site is situated on a terrace of Turkey Creek.
The site,
measuring 30x25 m, consists of a light scatter of lithics and burned
rock. Soils on the terraces of Turkey Creek in the vicinity of the
site are Arol fine sandy loam overlying clay (SCS 1981). Shovel
probes taken to a depth of 50 cm revealed the presence of minimal
subsurface cultural material in addition to that observed on the
surface. Artifacts include burned rock, a few chert flakes and a
chert biface.
Due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural
affiliation could not be determined.

Because of its location in a gravel quarry, this site near Violet
Creek is largely destroyed.
This once-extensive site now measures
approximately 56x30m. Quarrying has radically altered the terrain,
stripping the upper Tremona sandy loam soils (SCS 1979) down to clay
subsoil and thereby obscuring the original landform upon which the
site was situated.
Many artifacts were found in the bulldozer dirt
piles on the periphery of the quarry.
These include chert flakes,
utilized flakes, bifaces and cores. A Tortugas type dart point (Fig.
3f) would suggest the presence of at least an Early Archaic
occupation.
41FY237
Located on a terrace of Cummins Creek, this 75x30 m site is
characterized as a light scatter of lithics. Soils in the site are
Bunyan fine sandy loam (SCS 1980). Six shovel tests to a maximum
depth of 75 cm failed to reach the underlying clay subsoil. Cultural
material was observed on the surface as well as a few flakes at
varying depths below the surface in four of the shovel probes.
Included in the art if act inventory are flakes, a fl at piece of
sandstone which may be a metate, and a small amount of burned rock.
No features were observed and a lack of diagnostic artifacts prevent
assigning this site to a temporal or cultural period.

This light lithic scatter covers a 30x20 m area on a lower slope
above a primary tributary of Jones Creek about 100 m west of 41FY242.
A few petrified wood and chert flakes were observed on the surface and
two biface cores were found in one of the deep gullies that cut the
site. The soil is a Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS 1981).
This
site is so badly eroded that any information about its function has
been lost.
41FY245
This site is located on the terrace of a gully or intermittent
drainage feeding into a tributary of Owl Creek. The drainage has been
dammed to form a stock tank. The surface has been cleared of trees
and brush; part of the clearing was probably by burning. This light
lithic scatter consisted primarily of petrified wood flakes and cores
although one chert core was also found; none were time diagnostic.
The site measures about 30x35 m and lies on a deflated clay surface.
The site is badly eroded - artifacts are exposed in gullies which cut
the area. The little soil on the site is a Shalba fine sandy loam
(SCS 1978).
41FY246
Situated on a lower slope of Jones Creek, this 20x35 m light
lithic scatter is exposed on the surface, an erosional gully and a

ground. stone, primary, secondary and tertiary flakes and 3 cores.
Four shovel probes were dug; three yielded cultural materials in a
Falba variant loamy fine sand (SCS 1981) before sterile clay was
reached at 10-35 cm below the surface. No time of occupation could be
determined.
41FY247
Among scattered oak and cedar trees, this Middle Archaic site
lies on a lower slope of Jones Creek. It is cut by erosional gullies
but some short grasses remain. Cultural materials were sparse on the

site is so badly eroded that any information that it might once have
contained is lost.
41FY250
A 110x30 m lithic scatter on a heavily eroded terrace of Jones
Creek lies on eroded and deflated Falba variety loamy fine sand (SCS
1981). Cultural materials are exposed in erosional features of the
site and only a few were observed in one of five shovel probes. Chert
and petrified wood artifacts were mostly flakes; one unifacial tool,
cores, a preform, one mano fragment, and a Dari dart point were also
observed. The dart point dates on occupation of the site to Late
Archaic or between 1400 and 1250 8.P. The site has been destroyed by
erosion.
41FY258
A light lithic scatter measuring 25X20 m is located on a remnant
terrace of a large, unnamed tributary of Owl Creek. Numerous drainage
gullies dissect the site, causing a great deal of erosion. The soils
here are Shalba gullied fine sandy loam (SCS 1978) to a depth of about
20-40 cm. In some places erosion is so severe that the clay subsoil
is exposed. Fewer than 10 petrified wood flakes and chunks were noted
on the surface while small quantities of burned rock were observed at
the base of the terrace. No time diagnostic artifacts were noted.
This site has been destroyed by erosion.
41FY256
This extensive burned rock and lithic scatter is located on the
northwest bank of a deeply incised drainage of a major tributary that
flows west to Owl Creek. What appears to have been a major flood
surge flowing southwest has scoured out an area of the drainage to
within 60 m southwest of the site center. One result of this radical
gullying has been heavy erosion along the northwest and southeast
banks, isolating circular islands of land within the drainage basin
that support a single tree and grasses. Apparently this happened
sometime before 1940 since aerial photographs in that year show
distinctive gullying. Erosion initiated by the surge has stripped off
the overlying fine sandy loam and exposed the underlying clay
substrate.
In some cases, this extends 50 m up the bank. Cultural
debr"i s was found lying on the clay and remnant a horizon.

Other
identifiable, but not temporally diagnostic atifacts included a
petrified wood biface preform, a unifacial end scraper, a number of
cores and preforms. Flakes of chert and petrified wood were scattered
on the surface. Concentrations (hearths) of burned rock were observed
eroding from the bank. Eight shovel probes done within the 75x65 m
site bounds revealed a fine sandy loam soil of the Shalba gullied land
complex. series (SCS 1978).
All probes were sterile of cultural
material and all but one reached the clay substrate at depths of
between 20-35 cm.
This site has been destroyed by erosion and
flooding.

This extensive lithic scatter is along the northeast bank of a
drainage that feeds into the same drainage forming the southwest
boundary of41FY256 20 m to the north. The site, 80xl20 m, lies in a
wooded area of post oak, cedar and yaupon. Cultural material along
the eroded banks of the drainage included chert and petrified wood
flakes, two mano fragments, two core tools, four core fragments and a
finished biface. In contrast to site 41FY256, very little burned rock
was found on or below the surface. No cultural material was found in
any of the seven shovel probes that reached clay at a depth of 35 cm.
The soil is a fine sandy loam of the Burlewash series (SCS 1978).
This site is also considered destroyed by erosion.
41FY259
This site consists of a light lithic scatter with a burned rock
and fire-cracked chert feature.
Heavy erosion was noted on the
surface, particularly along the western side where an
unnamed
tributary to Owl Creek has cut into the edge of the site. Two shovel
probes revealed Shalba gullied fine sandy loam soils (SCS 1981) to a
depth of at least 20 cm but no subusrface artifacts. Cultural
material included two petrified wood flakes, one burned quartzite (?)
mano fragment, and a concentration of burned rock. No time diagnostic
artifacts were recovered. This site has been destroyed by erosion.
41FY260
A featureless light lithic scatter; this small 48x24 m site is
situated on the bank of a drainage to an unnamed tributary of Owl
Creek. Numerous drainage gullies cut across the site resulting in
extensive erosional damage. Most of the artifacts were found in these
drainages and none were observed in the four shovel tests.
Chert
flakes, cores and a biface fragment, in addition to a petrified wood
core fragment and burned rock, none of which
are
temporally
diagnostic, complete the artifact inventory. The soils in the area
are Burlewash fine sandy loam (SCS 1978).
This site has been
destroyed by erosion.

This site is situated on the bank of a drainage of an unnamed
tributary of Owl Creek. Six discrete clusters of petrified wood and
chert flakes and cores, found along the edge of the drainage, are
within the 150x30 m site boundaries. Although no shovel tests were
conducted because of heavy erosion, the.profile exposed by drainage
erosion shows no evidence of subsurface cultural deposits. Because no
temporally diagnostic artifcts were observed, cultural affiliation of
this featureless lithic scatter cannot be determined. Soils are
Burlewash fine sandy loam (SCS 1978); clay subsoil is exposed along
portions of the drainage.
41FY262
A light lithic scatter without features is located on the terrace
slope of an unnamed tributary of Owl Creek. A number of small gullies
dissect the 30x60 m site, eroding the Burlewash fine sandy loam down
to the clay subsoil (SCS 1978). All cultural material is temporally
non-diagnostic and includes, primarily, petrified wood flakes and
burned rock.
Three shovel tests, taken to a maximum depth of 30 cm,
failed to reveal subsurface cultural deposits.

A drainage to an unnamed tributary of Owl Creek dissects this
upper terrace slope site.
Petrified wood flakes and cores, chert

featureless lithic scatter. Four shovel probes were dug but chert
flakes were observed in only two. Cultural materials were, in fact,
very sparse and not time diagnostic. No period of occupation could be
inferred. The soil is Tremona loamy fine sand (SCS 1979) to more than
90 cm in places but the site has been extensively Â·damaged by erosion,
bioturbation, extensive clearing and some burning.
41FY268
This light lithic scatter was found on the deflated and eroding
surface of a creek terrace on an unnamed tributary of Owl Creek. Only
a few flakes of pertified wood and chert and some burned rocks were
found on the surface and in erosional gullies; more were observed in
four shallow shovel probes. The Burlewash fine sandy loam soil (SCS
1978) ran no more than 15 cm deep in these probes. A Scallorn point
was found southwest of the site on the opposite bank of the tributary.
This was recorded as an isolated find rather than an extension of the
site. The cultural affiliation of this site could not be determined.
41 FY269
Located on Owl Creek, this 35x100 m site rests on the clay
surface of a deflated terrace.
Five shovel probes were dug into
sterile clay. Soils in the area are a variant of Falba loamy fine

The light lithic surface scatter was of chert and
petrified wood flakes, burned rock and two bifaces; none were time
diagnostic.

a traditional nineteenth century farmhouse.
A bunkhouse, barn,

Mueller Farmstead

This site consists of a standing building and six outbuildings.
The foundation piers of an eighth building are also present. The
dwelling presents a traditional Anglo-American single story, center
hall house, but upon examination has several rather unusual features.
First, there are three exterior doors opening onto the east-facing
front porch.
Secondly, the rear of the house has two doors and two
windows. This unusual number of doors and the absence of gable end
fireplace suggests that this may be a duplexed or "double shotgun"
floorplan house.
Our survey crew did not have access to the interior
so
conjectures about the floorplan cannot be verified. The field crew
also had the impression that the main dwelling may have been moved
onto this site from another location and that, although the house may
be older than 50 years, the site itself is not.
This general
impression was not, however, verified by either oral history or
archival research.
41FY277, Edwin Muehler House

41FY278, Willie Pietsch House
This is a handsome example of a two-story, "homestead" style
vernacular farmhouse. The main front wing of the house was built by a
local master carpenter, Mr. Petzold, in 1900. The rear single-story
addition was added in 1915. According to the current owner, the upper
floor of this house served as the Bell common school district
classroom while a new schoolhouse was being constructed.
41FY279, The Wendler Cabin
This log cabin was moved to its present location when the family
constructed a new frame house which now stands on site 41FY280. The
current location was never the site of a habitation.
The present
owner was born in the newer house, his uncle was born in the cabin.
The 11 new 11 house is perhaps 80 years old. The cabin shows split log
construction with half dovetail notching. The current condition of
the cabin is poor, little more than a ruin.

Black family. The house is not typical of the Black vernacular house
tradition as defined by Vlach (1978) but appears to be more typical of
the German adaptation of the Texas frame house with a shed kitchen and
a separate loft room. The house has two rooms on the first floor plus
the loft room. A centered front door is flanked by two windows.
The
room at the rear of the main house is sheltered under a continuation
of the main roofline. This rear room has an opening for a stovepipe.

T-shaped floorplan.
It is of frame construction set on a pier and
beam foundation. There are five rooms on the main floor and two
sleeping rooms in the attic. The wooden shake roof has been replaced

Hughes Guest House

Although the property on which this structure was found has been
in the Hughes family since the late nineteenth century, this house and
the main house were both moved in from elsewhere and do not relate to
the earlier Hughes farm. This house is a frame board and batten house
on piers. Although the main fabric of the structure is over 50 years
old, the corrugated metal roof is new as well as much of the trim and
the site itself.
41FY291, Buck Albers Bungalow
This house, according to the present owner, was built by his
parents in 1927.
Other local informants aver that it was moved in
from the town of Ledbetter where it was once the home of a local
physician. We did not attempt to resolve these conflicting stories.
The general craftsman bungalow style of the house with projecting
braced roof beams and an entrance in the gable end are consistent with
the 1920 1 s construction date. The house appears to be typical of
packaged 11 kit 11 bungalow style homes that were sold by lumberyards and
by mail order during the first quarter of this century.
41FY292, Ebner-Schultz House
Mrs. Ebner (nee Schultz) states that she was born in this house
over 72 years ago and that the house itself is more than 100 years
old. The back porch is a recent addition. The strueture is a modest
clapboard farmhouse with a porch across the entire front sheltering
two doors, each of which is flanked by two windows. The gable ends of
the house have four windows on the main floor and one into the attic.
41FY293, Matejowsky-Schultz Farm
The dwelling that was formerly on this site has been moved with
only the foundation stones, a concrete cistern and a well head with a
metal pump to mark the dwelling area. However, a large single pen log

The front facade of this old house is unusual in that it has a
set of double doors in the center and two other front doors on either
side flanked by windows. Otherwise, the general outlines seem to
conform to the traditional Anglo center hall, story and a half pattern
with a kitchen wing 11 T11 at the rear. Two small sheds and a concrete
wellhead inscribed "W K Well Co.

41FY296, The Soloman Homestead
The original site of the Soloman house has a full complement of
outbuildings including a barn, a large shed, and a single pen log crib
constructed of split logs with half dovetail notching.
The artifact
scatter around the original house foundations appears to represent a
long term, but very neat occupation beginning in the late nineteenth
century.
The Soloman house was moved from its original site near the
outbuildings in 1961 or 1962.
It was extensively renovated and
remodeled at that time. Apparently the central door of the main wing
was replaced by windows. The interior floor plan, although clearly
derived from a traditional center hall Anglo tradition house, has also
been extensively modified.
41FY298, Hickey-Wendler House
According to Mrs. A. Albers (nee Wendler) this large, two-story
bungalow style house was erected in 1927 by the Wendler family. The
large porch across the entire south side wraps around both the east
and west sides. The corners of the porch roof are supported by siding
walls with windows which give an initial impression that they light
interior rooms rather than the corners of the porch.
This is an exceptionally well-kept house with many of the
architectural details typical of a well-built 1920's bungalow. It is
currently owned and occupied by the Hickey family.

This modest, turn-of-the-century, three gabled, 11 L"-shaped house
has a porch along both the east and north sides. It has been
extensively restored and was not originally on this property.
The

41FY302, Stephan-Moss House
This late Victorian cottage in the town of Ledbetter was located
at the end of Bastrop Street on the original plat. The Stephan family
has owned the house for almost half a century.
The house was also
owned by the Faske family but was built by the pioneer, John C. Moss,
whose log cabin is designated 41FY284 and whose grave is in the family
cemetery designated 41FY283. The house was given a site designation
separate from Ledbetter to highlight its connection with the Moss

Mr. Weise also stated that extensive renovations and additions were
Â·made to the house in 1936 and were done under the supervision of Mr.
Petzold who was then about 75 years old. At least two other of the
