Caddoan Radiocarbon Dates
Compiled and edited by

T. N. CAMPBELL

At present there are 21 published radiocarbon dates from Caddoan
archeological sites, nearly all being dates from components or sites
attributed to the Gibson Aspect. Nine different sites are involved,
seven in Oklahoma (Spiro, Brackett, Harlan, Hughes, Norman, Reed,
and McCarter), one in Louisiana (Belcher), and one in Texas (Davis).
For individual sites the number of datings is usually small--one date
each from Brackett, Reed, McCarter, and Davis, and two dates each
from Belcher, Harlan, Hughes, and Norman. There are, however,
nine dates from Spiro, but five of these are not currently accepted as
reliable. As the literature on these radiocarbon dates is scattered, it
is believed that a list of the dates and citation of the pertinent literature will be useful to workers in the Caddoan and adjoining areas.
The age determinations given below are presented site by site, the
order of sites and dates for each being based on successively older
datings. In each case the essential facts are presented under four headings: (1) sample number and name of laboratory that produced the
date; (2) sample provenience--material of sample, stratigraphic position, major associations, and culture dated; (3) datings in years before the present and also in terms of the calendar; and (4) references
to published literature. In the last category a distinction is made
between (a) published date lists and (b) publications that interpret
and evaluate the dates.

2700 +-- 400 years ago, or 744 --+ 400 B.C.
These dates, according to Crane and Griffin (1959), are now regarded as "absurdly high." They were obtained by the carbon-black
method; later age determinations by gas counter were consistently
lower (see other datings from Spiro Site).
