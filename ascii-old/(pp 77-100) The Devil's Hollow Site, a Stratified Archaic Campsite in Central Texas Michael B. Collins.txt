THE DEVIL’S HOLLOW SITE, A STRATIFIED
ARCHAIC CAMPSITE IN CENTRAL TEXAS
MICHAEL B. COLLINS

ABSTRACT
The Devil’s Hollow Site, excavated by the W.P.A. in 1939, contained a
small sample of projectile points and other artifacts of Early, Middle and
Late Archaic forms; these were stratified (respectively) below, in, and
above a small burned rock midden. The midden is of the general category,
"ring midden," and may have contained an earth oven not previously
reported at this time horizon. The dart points occurred in morphological
groups that

have important

implications

for Central Texas dart point

typology. Unfortunately, the site does not shed light on the nature of burned rock midden accumulation, however, as a possible earth oven, it raises
the question of communal cooking by a sizable group, The hypothesis is
put forward that seasonal coalescence of hunting-gathering bands may
have accompanied intensive but brief food-collecting activities.

INTRODUCTION
The Devil’s Hollow Site is a small buried midden of burned rock
excavated under sponsorship of the Works Projects Administration
through the agency of The University of Texas from November 3 to
16, 1939. Field supervision was by George R. Fox. The collection and
Fox’s excellent documentation are housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
The site was originally designated CT-67 and now bears the number
41 TV 38. Devil’s Hollow is now flooded by Lake Travis.
Data recovered by Fox indicate three important facts about the
site: (1) cultural material at the site is stratified; (2) the midden can
be placed in the Early Middle Archaic Period of the current Central
Texas Chronology; and (3) the midden possibly contained a large,
centrally-located, ash-filled cooking pit similar to that occurring in
"mescal pits" (see Greer 1965; 1967). Also, the projectile points as a
group have important typological implications.

FIELD METHODS
A crew of approximately eight unskilled laborers was employed
to excavate the Devil’s Hollow Site. It is clear from Fox’s notes that
the object of this excavation was to expose the midden, recover the
artifacts from it, and nothing more. Fill above and below the midden was removed with picks and shovels and thrown, without

screening, into the creek bottom. Evidently, trowels and brushes
were employed in excavating the midden, but is likely that picks
and shovels also were used. The midden fill was not screened. In
other words, specimens collected or counted were those noticed by
the workmen. Profiles, maps, and photographs were made in quantity and are of high quality.

THE SITE
Devil’s Hollow is a deep, narrow canyon tributary to the Colorado
River. The canyon averages a few hundred yards wide and heads
less than 3 miles northwest of its junction with the Colorado; this
junction is in northwestern Travis County approximately 16 miles
northwest of Austin, Texas (Fig. 1). The intermittent Devil’s Hollow
Creek has entrenched into colluvial deposits at the base of the
steeply sloping walls of the Hollow and has deposited limited
amounts of alluvium along its margins (Fig. 2).
The Devil’s Hollow midden was seen eroding from the left bank
of th~ creek approximately one-fourth of a mile above the Colorado
River: Roughly its southwestern half had been eroded away and the
resulting exposure was a northwest-southeast profile through the

DEVIL’S HOLLOW

79

center of the midden (Fig. 3, Profile I).
Exposed in the cut bank were, from the base upward, a stratum of
red clay at least 5 feet in thickness, the midden, a deposit of
weathered limestone colluvium ("gravel" in Fox’s notes) averaging
4 feet in thickness, and a dark-colored topsoil layer approximately 2
feet in thickness (Fig. 4). The surfaces of each of these strata dipped
downstream and toward the cut bank (that is, to the southeast). As
soil samples were not available for examination and the site is no
longer accessible, Fox’s stratigraphic descriptions must suffice; his
notes (pp. 9, 18-19) include the following:
(1) RED CLAY: red, sandy clay with a thin layer of occupational
debris near the top; otherwise, it contains no gravel, shell, or
stones.
(2) MIDDEN: described below.
(3) "GRAVEL": yellow gravel laid in successive layers, some
layers of stone separate strata of gravel; present were limited
amounts of cultural debris and many mussel shells.
(4) TOPSOIL: dark-colored humus soil, archeologically sterile.
To judge from profiles and photographs, the contact between the
red clay and the "gravel" involves some interbedding, perhaps
resulting from downslope movements. Similarly, a small lens of
midden deposit is buried in the red clay (Fig. 3, Profile II)

suggesting either periodic deposition of midden debris with intervening accumulation of red clay or some form of mixing.
The midden was 26 feet in northwest-southeast diameter and 9
feet of its northeast-southwest diameter remained. Its upper surface
(Fig. 5) sloped slightly from upstream to downstream (northwest to
southeast) and included a shallow, ash-filled depression near the
center of the original eroded profile. This depression was approximately 8 feet in diameter and about 1.0 foot in depth. The center of the depression contained a nearly rock-free ash deposit 1.2
feet in diameter and 0.3 of a foot in thickness. As can be seen in
Fox’s photograph (Fig. 4) there are virtually no rocks in the profile
below this central depression, a strong indication that the rock-free
center of the midden extended down to the red clay. This condition
would suggest the presence of an earth oven (perhaps similar to, but
shallower than, those characteristic of the "mescal pit") rather than
a surface hearth from which fire-cracked rock had been thrown into
a circular heap ("midden circle"); unfortunately this can only be a
suggestion as no other observations were recorded or data collected
to refute or corroborate the photographic hint.
The intact ashy deposit in the central depression precludes the
possibility that some form of post-depositional disturbance caused
the depression in the center of this midden.
The midden surrounding the central depression was composed
principally of angular fragments of burned limestone rock and con-

DEVIL’S HOLLOW

tained considerable ash as well as a large number of freshwater
mussel shells.
Fox notes that the mussel shells were scattered throughout the
midden but that some tended to occur in concentrations. One concentration of more than 100 shells was 1.4 feet east of the ash-filled
pit and consisted of a "pile" of 0.4 of a foot thick (diameter not
recorded). Another such concentration occurred in Square B-4.
Mammalian remains included only a few small charred scraps of
long bone (deer?) and a fragmentary innominate (deer).
In summary, although this was clearly a ring midden, too few
details are recorded to determine the precise configuration of the
central depression, and it is impossible to assign the feature to
either the "midden circle" or "mescal pit" categories as they are
defined by Greer (1965, 1967).

depression.

rock-flee depression is to the right, and the ring midden configuration of
the burned rocks is clearly visible.

Excavations were not extended more than a few feet beyond the
margins of the midden (Fig. 3) so data are lacking on the nature of
the site adjacent to this feature. Artifacts were found in the upper
portion of the red clay, in the midden, and in the "gravel" above the
midden. These materials, particularly the projectile points, provided
additional data toward the refinement of the local chronology.

THE ARTIFACTS
Sixty-eight implements, all of stone, are described below; an additional 262 flakes are tabulated by vertical provenience, but these
were evidently discarded at the time of excavation. Dart point data

83

DEVIL’S HOLLOW

have been presented in more detail than those of the other artifact
classes. The projectile points are designated by specimen numbers
in the plates, in the descriptions, in the tabulations of metric data,
and in Table I. For the remaining artifact classes, individual data are
not presented, and provenience is reported by classes and by ver.tical provenience only (Table II). Measurements of chipped stone
artifacts are reported in millimeters; of ground stone artifacts, in
centimeters. An asterisk (*) denotes an estimated measurement.

Dart Points
Bulverde-like I (7 specimens, Fig. 6). Blades are triangular with slightly convex
edges; shoulders are prominent and lack barbs (except specimen 3 with one barb);
four (6,9,7, and 3) exhibit slight asymmetry; stems are parallel-sided or expand very
slightly; bases of 6 and 9 are straight and bases of 11, 7, 12, 14, and 3 are slightly concave; the stem of 11 is wedge-shaped in longitudinal section. Stems average one-third
of total length. Specimens are thin, bifacia!ly-flaked, and exhibit marginal retouching;
specimen 12 has longitudinal, bifacial thinning flakes extending up from the base. All
are of opaque flint in gray and gray-tan colors. These projectile points occupy a morphological position between the defined types Bulverde and Pedernales (Suhm and
]elks 1962:169,235).

edges. The specimens occupy a morphological position between the defined types
Bulverde and Nolan as defined by Suhm and ]elks (1962: 169,225) but lack the distinctive wedged stem of the former and strongly beveled stem of the latter.

Other Bifaces
Large, thinned bffaces (3 specimens, Fig. 7). These are convex-edged, bifacially
thinned implements exhibiting marginal retouching; the base of the one complete lanceolate specimen (Fig. 7a) is cortex, and the basal fragment (Fig. 7c) exhibits a chipped convex base. Length of complete specimen, 107 mm; widths are 48, 40, and 45
mm.; thicknesses, 15, 9, and 12 ram.

Fragmentary bffaces (10 specimens).

These include 3 probable projectile point

tips, 6 fragments of small, thin, bifacially-flake "knives" and 1 thick bifacial fragment.
Thick, crude bffaces (9 specimens, Fig. 7). These are large, thick crudely-flaked
bifaces with very limited trimming of edges’, roughly lanceolate in outline to irregular,
the more irregular items are probably cores whereas the more regular ones may be
either implements or unfinished implements (preforms).

Miscellaneous Chipped Stone
Scrapers (4 specimens, Figs. 7 and 8). Three

specimens are convex-edged

side

scrapers, one is an irregular flake with edge-trimming on two intersecting edges. One
of the convex-edged specimens exhibits very heavy wear along a portion of the
scraping edge; this section of the scraper edge also exhibits bifacial chipping, apparently resulting from the heavy use (Fig. 7f).
Flakes (268 specimens). Flakes were not systematically saved by Fox’, however,
they were counted and their vertical distribution is summarized in Table II. The 6
flakes which were kept include 2 initial cortex flakes, 2 secondary cortex flakes, and 2
interior flakes.

Choppers (3 specimens, Fig. 8). One is a large quartzite cobble with flakes
removed from both faces along two4hirds of its circumference; the remaining third
exhibits cortex. Opposite the cortex, approximately one-half of the chipped edge is
heavily battered (Fig. 8b). One smaller specimen (Fig. 8d) is a cortex~covered cobble
with flakes removed bifacially from one end. The other is similar but was made on a
large flake.

GROUND STONE
Manos
Biracial manos (9 specimens, Fig. 8). Of these 9 specimens, 8 are fragmentary.
Materials include fine-grained pink granite (5), dense limestone (1), sandstone (2),
and quartzite (1). Grinding surfaces vary: four specimens exhibit 2 convex facets; one
exhibits two flat facets; and four exhibit 1 flat and 1 convex facets. Thickness ranges
from 3.5 to 5.5 and averages 4.5 cm. The one complete specimen is oval and measures
11.5 x 7.5 x 4 cm.
Unffacial manos (3 specimens, Fig. 8). This group includes a circular sandstone
mano with a flat facet (10 x 9.2 x 4.8 cm.); a small ovoid mano of pink granite with a
small, oval flat facet (8 x 7.5 x 4.5 cm.); and a small oval quartzite mano with a small,
round flat facet (8 x 7.5 x 5 cm.).
Mano fragments (3 specimens). These are two sandstone and one pink granite
fragments exhibiting one or two grinding surfaces; none is sufficiently complete to indicate its original form.

Surface Collection
In addition to the specimens descrfbed above, several items of surface provenience
occur in the Devil’s Hollow Site collections; according to Fox’s notes, this surface
collection was made over an area of several acres and probably has little relevance to
the excavated material. The surface finds include basal fragments of one Montell, one
Travis, one Pedernales, and 2 unidentified stemmed dart points plus a triangular dart
point ("Taylor Thin-Base") and a small convex-based biface. Also present in the surface material are a quartzite unifacial mano, a quartzite hammerstone, 14 cores or
thick bifacial implements, a large burin spall, and 5 utilized flakes.

SYNTHESIS
Although better controls and documentation prevailed in the excavation of this site than in many of its contemporary excavations,
three basic kinds of information are lacking: descriptions of the
natural strata are inadequate; no excavations were conducted outside of the midden area; and many items (e.g. chipping debris) were
not saved. A sample of mussel shells was saved. And, apparently
the few existing mammalian faunal specimens represent all that
were found. Of course, it would not be realistic to expect in 1939 the
application of certain procedures which are today considered fairly
routine (e.g., collection of charcoal; systematic collection of flakes;
collection of soil and pollen samples; more refined provenience
controls, etc.) and Fox cannot be criticized for these deficiencies.
However, it is impossible to evaluate the prevailing ecological conditions during the various periods of occupation or even to determine the depositional environment (e.g., it is not known if the "red
clay" is water lain or if the term, "gravels," refers to actual gravels
or to colluvium as the photographs would suggest). Similarly, with
excavations restricted to the midden proper, nothing specific can be

said of the remainder of the site and no progress is made toward understanding burned rock middens in terms of their relationship to
associated cultural activities. Stone-chipping technology must be inferred from the more-or-less finished specimens collected, and the
nature and amount of chipping conducted at the site remains obscure.

On the other hand, the diagnostic specimens were recovered in a
stratigraphic relationship consistent with that from other sites in
Central Texas (Table I). In the red clay beneath the midden were
found projectile point types Nolan, Travis, and Bulverde-like I as well
as one miscellaneous form. These give an age indication estimated
at 3500 to 2000 B.C. and are assigned to the Early Archaic (Sorrow et
el. 1967:141-144; Johnson et al. 1962:118-124). The midden contained
Early Middle Archaic specimens -- types Bulverde-like I and II and
one possible Bulverde- probably dates from about 2000 B.C.
(Sorrow et al. 1967; Johnson et al. 1962). Although there is certainlya
considerable temporal overlap among types Travis, Nolan and
Bulverde (Sorrow et al. 1967; Shafer 1963; Weir 1967), there is reason
to believe that Bulverde may not have achieved popularity as early as
did Travis and Nolan and may have survived longer (Johnson et al.
1962) which is perhaps the case at Devil’s Hollow Site (Table I).
Ring midden dates from elsewhere range from about 600 B.C. to
A.D. 1500 (Greer 1968), considerably later than the evident dates for
Devil’s Hollow.
Above the midden are found Early Late Archaic Montell points
which seem to date between 900 and 400 B.C. (Sorrow 1968:46-47).
Other than the projectile points and manos, the relative vertical
distributions of artifact classes at Devil’s Hollow appear random,
although most classes show an increase in frequency within the
midden. Manos show a trend of increasing numbers through time
with bifacial forms becoming the most abundant implement in the
gravel stratum. Incidentally, as no metates were found at the site, it
is not entirely clear what the functions of manos may have been.
One is tempted to suggest that the trend of increasing manos may be
evidence of increased reliance on the gathering (and processing) of
plant foods. However, in the absence of metates it seems best not to
rule out the possibility that manos served in some capacity other
than plant-food grinding -- hide working, for example.
The collection of dart points from Devil’s Hollow midden is
small; however, the Bulverde specimens, particularly Bulverde-like I
and Bulverde-like II, form a very homogeneous group. The degree of
homogeneity may indicate a short interval of manufacture, although

92

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

this can only be speculation. Aside from their homogeneity, these
points are interesting in light of their morphological position between types Bulverde and Pedernales as well as an apparently intermediate stratigraphic position. The Devil’s Hollow Bulverde
points persist later in time than types Travis and Nolan, a condition
not found in Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Sorrow et al. 1967) or at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). At most stratified sites in Central
Texas, later Pedernales points replace earlier Bulverde, Travis and
Nolan points. Perhaps at Devil’s Hollow an incipient stage of Pealerhales development is isolated in the midden deposits.
In general, then, the Devil’s Hollow Site contained evidence of occupations from the Early Archaic to the Early Late Archaic and
tends either to confirm the slightly later peak of Bulverde popularity
seen at the Wunderlich and Oblate sites in Canyon Reservoir (Johnson et al. 1962) or to evidence an incipient stage in Pedernales
development.
Technological and subsistence data are meager. The fairly large
number of flakes in each of the three strata indicates that at least
some flint work was done at the site. This may be further indicated
by some of the artifacts here referred to as "thick, crude bifaces"
(e.g. Fig. 7e) which appear to be early stages in bifacial thinning and
by certain of the "large, thinned bifaces" (e.g. Fig. 7b) which appear
to be unfinished bifacial implements. The granite manos and quartzite chopper indicate direct or indirect acquisition of materials from
the Colorado River gravels or the Llano Uplift region whereas the
varietites of flint are probably all obtainable on the Edwards
Plateau. Lack of floral and adequate terrestrial faunal remains
preclude evaluation of these aspects of the subsistence base. Mussel
shells were present in the following numbers: red clay-620; midden1176; gravel-749. These figures indicate a continuing exploitation of
Colorado River resources throughout the occupations of the site as
well as corroborate the artifactual indication that the greatest
amount of cultural activity transpired at the site during the period of
midden accumulation. An inquiry into the possible nature of that
cultural activity is presented below.
Perhaps the most important single aspect of the Devil’s Hollow
Site is the possible presence of an earth oven. Had it been more
clearly documented, the large central depression in the upper surface of the midden might have been an important feature to be considered, not only in the technological repertoire of the Early Middle
Archaic peoples of Central Texas, but as an indicator of moderate
social complexity. Earth ovens require an expenditure of labor and

DEVIL’S HOLLOW

93

are efficient only for quantities of food consistent with fairly large
social groups. However, the depression is not certainly an earth
oven~ and the presence of such features at this early time horizon
must await confirmation at other sites.

Burned Rock Middens and Cultural Activity
Burned rock middens have been investigated for more than fifty
years in Central Texas (Pearce 1919), yet very little progress has
been made toward understanding their place in the total range of activities conducted at the sites in which they occur nor has it been
determined how they fit into the annual cycle of the cultures of
which they were a part.
Thus far, concern mainly has been with the content of burned
roc~ens, their temporal position, and their taxonomic
significance to the Midwestern system. However, the following
suggestions have been made concerning the activities which brought
about these distinct concentrations of midden debris:
(1) most authors agree that a range of activities is involved
but that repeated use of stone in fireplace preparation is of
major importance (Kelley and Campbell 1942; Johnson et
al. 1962; Weir 1967).
(2) the feeling that activity was concentrated on and very
near the midden area is implicit or explicit in most
discussions of burned rock middens (Suhm 1959; Jelks
1951; Weir 1967; Johnson et al. 1962; Kelley and Campbell
1942)
(3) it is suggested by some that burned rock middens are
central to a larger spread of activity areas (Sorrow 1969: 1,
46-51) or that they are the result of deliberate removal of
debris from an area of habitation to a central point of
disposal (Sorrow 1969; Hester 1970:247; Sorrow and Hester
personal communications).
The suggestions presented in number 3 above are based in part
upon investigations not yet published; however, each is inferred
from convincing evidence at different sites. My purpose in this
discussion is to suggest that certain technological and social consequences of seasonality must also be considered in evaluating
these proposals. This is deemed necessary in light of the widespread
opinion implied or explicitly stated in most discussion of burned
rock middens, that such middens are the result of activities (perhaps
intermittently) of small social groups over long periods of time.

94

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

The archeological cultures of the Central Texas Archaic are
generally thought of as resulting from the activities of small
nomadic groups subsisting by hunting and gathering (cf. Suhm
1960:73). This inference is warranted by the evidence; however, it
requires a qualification. Ethnographic evidence suggests that with
very few -- mostly maritime -- exceptions, reliance upon wild flora
and faunal resources in temperate regions dictates that the exploitative groups must be small and nomadic with the exception of.
certain seasonal congregations into larger units. It has not been invalid
to interpret the archeological evidence from the Central Texas Archaic (which actually persists until at least A.D. 1250 and the first
consumption, though perhaps not production, of agricultural
products) as indicating reliance upon hunting and gathering. Nor
has it been invalid to further infer that this involved small, nomadic
groups. However, it is possible that it has been an oversight to
assume that only small units existed and, therefore, that the accumulation of a sufficient volume of material to be called a burned
rock midden indicates the elapse of considerable time.
Is it not possible that in the Central Texas Archaic small nomadic
groups did prevail through most of the year but coalesced annually
or seasonally? Ethnographically this pattern is not uncommon; for
example, the hunting-and-gathering Washo of California and
Nevada (d’Azevedo 1963) and the Southern Paiute of Utah and
Arizona (Kelly 1964; Steward 1934) are known to have assembled in
large groups in the early fall, but to have operated as small, dispersed bands during the remainder of the year. Similarly, the
Coahuiltecans of southwestern Texas and northeastern Mexico
congregated into large bands during the harvest of prickly pear tuna
in late summer (Newcomb 1961). This pattern of activity could
result in the accumulation of a midden the size of that at Devil’s
Hollow in a short period of time.
If we assume for the moment that half of the Devil’s Hollow midden had eroded away at the time that Fox excavated it, we may get
an idea of its total size by doubling Fox’s counts for various kinds of
debris. The resultant estimated quantities for the entire midden are
a.s follows: 38,906 burned rock, 136 stone implements, and 2352
mussel shells (burned rock and mussel shell counts from Fox’s
notes). I can think of no basis for calculating rates of accumulation
for burned rock and implements for various group sizes, however,
food remains and estimated rates of consumption allow some very
gross calculations of elapsed time of accumulation. These
calculations rest upon a number of assumptions, none of which is

DEVIL’S HOLLOW

demonstrably valid, and the
possibilities whose sole purpose
for further discussion. The first
and counted accurately all of the

results can be taken only as
is to provide a point of departure
assumption is that Fox collected
mussel shells in the midden. The

second assumption is that all cooking activities of the entire group
(of whatever size) transpired at the communal midden. The third
assumption is that no significant quantities of mussel shell were
discarded outside of the midden area. None of these assumptions
regarding the sample can be verified. Further assumptions are
necessary concerning the nature of human consumption of river
mussels; the variables here are not subject to specific verification
for the prehistoric Devil’s Hollow inhabitants, but reasonable ranges
of estimate within human limits can be verified in a general way.
Without detailed data on the identification and food value of the
mussels from the Devil’s Hollow midden, estimates through foodvalue figures and human requirements are not possible (see Ascher
1959, for an example of this method using marine mollusks), nor
would this be warranted given the nature of the sampling.
Fox’s count of 2352 single valves suggests the figure of approximately 1200 bivalve mollusks for the midden. Employing the
relationship,
No. mussels/person/day X No. persons X No. days - 1200
mussels, the following table may be constructed (see Figure 9 for a
graph of these relationships):

Reading from the graph (Figure 9), a given number of people
eating five mussels per person per day or twenty mussels per person each day will require a certain number of days to accumulate
the 1200 or so mussels represented by the Devil’s Hollow remains.
The estimates possible from these figures range from six people

requiring 40 days to consume 1200 mussels to 100 people requiring 2
or 3 days at the rate of five mussels per person per day. Eating 20
mussels per day per person, 6 people could accomplish the task in
10 days or 60 people in one day.
In short, even as minimum figures, these data indicate that the
amount of debris comprising this midden could have accumulated
in a matter of days or weeks, especially if a con~munal earth oven
were constructed where a fairly high number of stones were heated
in the preparation of one "meal."
The alternative to a large number of people for a short period of
time would be a small number of people for a long period of time.
Burned rock middens, in the latter case, then would result from the
prolonged, and probably intermittent, use of the same place for
small cooking fires (cf. Kelley and Campbell 1942). This is clearly
the case at many Central Texas burned rock middens; for example,
the Williams Site (Suhm 1959) was evidently repeatedly used for a
number of centuries.

The evidence now available suggest that certain middens, as well
as certain deposits within middens, may result from the brief activity
of a large group whereas other middens may have accumulated
slowly as a result of repeated occupation at the same locus by small
groups. An hypothesis worthy of testing would be that two seasons
in the annual cycle are represented by these two distinct kinds of
midden deposit. Support for the hypothesis would come from
significant differences in the maturational stages or seasonal assemblages of faunal and (if preserved) floral remains, including pollens.
In this connection, the very few bits of deer bone (probably from
one individual) found in the Devil’s Hollow midden would be consistent with the suggestion that the site was occupied briefly,
perhaps during a season of heavy plant-food or river mussel exploitation when deer were killed only opportunistically.
Artifactual evidence provides a far weaker source of inference;
however, sites such as
al. 1962), Midden G at
den at Devil’s Hollow
dart point forms. The

Midden B at the Wunderlich Site (Johnson et
the Greenhaw site (Weir 1967), and the midshow moderate to extreme homogeneity in
extreme homogeneity of the Devil’s Hollow

specimens 3,6,9,11,12,7, and 14 and their close similarity to
specimens 10,16, and even 15, may be evidence that a short interval
is represented. This is to say, individuals enculturated in the same
group would be more likely to produce a homogeneous array of
projectile points than individuals experiencing separate learning
environments (Hemmings 1970, has put forward a similar interpretation regarding the high degree of homogeneity among Clovis
points from the San Pedro Valley in southeastern Arizona). Less
marked than, but similar "to, the degree of homogeneity at Devil’s
Hollow is the homogeneity of the 11 Nolan points from Greenhaw
Midden G which were found with 18 other points of types Langtry,
Gastroville, Marshall, Pedernales, Travis, Zorra and unclassified forms
(Weir, 1967). Pedernales points account for almost 40% of the dart
points from the Wunderlich Midden B whereas the remaining 60%
is composed of 22 different forms (Johnson et al. 1962). On the other
hand, Greenhaw Midden C, Wunderlich Midden A and numerous
other sites contain very heterogeneous collections of dart point
forms and probably represent extended and repeated periods of occupation; but it is possible, particularly in the light of the spatial
segregation sometimes recognized in dart point forms within the
heterogeneous middens (cf. Jelks 1951), that these repeated activities
at least occasionally were by large groups for short periods of time.
In summary, data from the Devil’s Hollow Site form the basis for

98

three proposals amenable to testing in future investigations of burned rock midden sites in the Central Texas Archaic. First, in order to
test the suggestion that earth ovens may be present, careful scrutiny
of the midden configuration needs to be made. Second, two
suggestions concerning the significance of typology, especially of
projectile points, are made: perhaps recognition of homogeneous artifact forms will lead to further refinement of the local chronology;
also, the tenuous position has been taken that marked homogeneity
of projectile points indicates an abbreviated interval of manufacture
within a single social unit. Third, to test the proposal that social
groups of large size may be responsible for at least some middens, a
number of specific kinds of information are to be sought. In the
vicinity of the midden, the presence of reduplicative and contemporaneous clusters of remains indicative of separate households
would offer one positive test for large group occupancy. Biological
evidence should be sought and analyzed for seasonality. Means for
estimating population size from food remains might be developed as
well as an appreciation for the food potential of the Central Texas
flora and fauna under various environmental conditions, in different seasons, and under various extractive technologies.
