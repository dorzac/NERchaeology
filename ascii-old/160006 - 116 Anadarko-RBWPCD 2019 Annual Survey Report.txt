MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2019 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for five proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power
Control District (RBWPCD) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included
well pads, access roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs). All five projects were privately
funded and did not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the RBWPCD is
considered to be a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the portions of the five projects on
RBWPCD property all fell under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the
request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys
of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. Overall, these surveys
assessed approximately 22.6 acres of RBWPCD property. The purpose of the surveys was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the five Project Areas and, if any
existed, to determine if the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural
resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8808.
The cultural resources surveys of the five Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effects on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. The THC concurred with these recommendations for all
five projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2019 calendar year for five proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD) in
Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All five projects were privately funded and
did not require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the RBWPCD is considered
to be a political subdivision of the State, the portions of the five projects on RBWPCD property
fell under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural
resources surveys of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The
purpose of the surveys was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the five
Project Areas and, if any existed, to determine if the projects had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8808.
The five Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2019 included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) that were located wholly or partially on tracts of land
owned by the RBWPCD. The well pads are typically constructed by leveling each area by
bulldozing the higher elevations and using that material to fill the lower elevations. Additional fill
may be brought in if necessary. The well pads often have associated reserve pits to contain
liquids associated with or produced by the well drilling. Reserve pit construction typically
consists of the excavation of a pit several feet deep that is then filled with a polyethylene liner.
Access road construction consists of the bulldozing (cutting and filling) of the alignment and may
also include the capping of the alignment with caliche or other forms of road base. Pipeline
construction efforts consist clearing vegetation from each ROW via heavy machinery, followed
by the excavation of the pipeline trench measuring several feet wide and excavated down to
depths around 6.0 feet (1.8 meters [m]) below surface. Only the portions of each project
situated on RBWPCD land were assessed under TAC annual permit number 8808. These
included the entirety of certain projects and only portions of others. Overall, these surveys
assessed approximately 22.6 acres of RBWPCD property. Each of the five projects is listed in
Table 1-1, along with its map identifier in Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports prepared for
each project, as well as the individual responses from the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
are presented in Appendix A.

The cultural resources investigations for each of the five projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s
president) served as the projects’ principal investigator, while Jacob Lyons, McKinzie Froese,
and Jared Wiersema conducted the field investigations at various times in 2019 .
The cultural resources surveys of the five Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effects on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery. The
THC concurred with these recommendations for all five projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The five Anadarko projects on RBWPCD land that were assessed in 2019 are all located
in northwestern Reeves County, Texas, on the western and southwestern sides of Red Bluff
Reservoir. They all can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red Bluff,
Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1; also see individual interim reports in
Appendix A). The five projects include four pipeline/flowline ROWs and one well pad with an
associated access road ROW. Each of these five projects is summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The five Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Salt Creek, its tributaries, and tributaries of the Pecos River.
Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all five of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin. All
are located to the west or southwest of the Red Bluff Reservoir on elevated landforms
overlooking the Pecos River. All are drained to the east or northeast by overland sheet flow in
to the reservoir.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The five Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all
of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950).
Blair notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties, including Reeves, were once part of an old
bolson now drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas
of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprising sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum
frutescens) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY

3.1

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into three main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500
B.P.), Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period
is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. to
3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.) subperiods.
3.1.1

PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game such as deer and turtles were also likely
utilized as food items. Plant foods undoubtedly made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.
3.1.2

Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces

HJN 160006 AR 116

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

along tributary watercourses but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.
3.1.3

Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.
3.1.4

Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.
3.1.5

Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.
3.1.6

Historic (250 B.P. to Present)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented, due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of three
Jumano Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to
have irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the
region noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the
1870s that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the twentieth century, state
law permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the
region. By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in

the numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the
only two towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s
saw the expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407
residents. By the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and
agriculture. In the early 2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

3.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The northwestern region of Reeves County has undergone extensive archeological
surveys in the last 60 years, with the majority having been completed since the mid-1980s.
Most of these archeological projects included Phase I and II subsurface investigations in
support of oil and gas extraction projects. These investigations were undertaken along pipeline
corridors and well pads for companies such as Anadarko, El Paso Natural Gas Company, and
Plains All American Pipeline. Archeological surveys were completed by environmental
engineering firms such as Horizon, SWCA, Inc., and Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations, as well as from academic institutions such as the Cultural Resource
Management Division from New Mexico State University.
The archeological sites recorded in Reeves County demonstrate a wide range of Native
American historic and prehistoric material culture, with noteworthy examples of skilled artistic
expression in both pictographs and petroglyphs, as well as in the form of richly decorated clay
vessels, and other ritual and ceremonial objects depicted in media such as exotic shell, bone, or
rare stone, including turquoise, malachite, and kaolinite (O’Laughlin and Black 2019). The
temporal range of these cultures spans from Paleoindian through the Archaic and into the
Contact period. Many of the sites consist of prehistoric lithic scatters, burned rock middens
containing fire-cracked rock (FCR), hearth features with faunal remains, and ceramic sherd
assemblages. The distinct archeological tradition Jornada Mogollon existed in the region from
roughly A.D. 400 to 1500 (Lehmer 1948). These peoples practiced sedentary lifeways, including
an emphasis on cultigen intensification of crops such as maize and squash. The Jornada
Mogollon, a part of the Pueblo complex, lived in pithouse villages (Whalen 1981) and produced
skilled ceramic techniques such as El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-White, and
Playas Red incised (O’Laughlin 2001). All of these ceramic styles favor the Casas Grandes
(Paquime) culture artistic style to the south near Chihuahua, Mexico (Lehmer 1958). These
shared artistic types demonstrate extensive trade networks in and out of the Reeves County
area. Later historic tribes in the region included the Jumanos, Apache, and Comanches.
The Red Bluff Reservoir region in northwestern Reeves County contains several
archeological sites which are exceptional and notable to mention. Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric petroglyphs occur at 41LV1, also known as Jackson’s Petroglyph Site. This site and
many others within close proximity occur in Loving County just north and northwest of Red Bluff
Reservoir. However, the lake’s south end and southwest region has yielded very few artifacts
and features. Site 41RV169 includes a low-intensity lithic scatter, site 41LV22 includes lithic
debris, as well as two bifaces and mussel shells, and site 41RV130 contains several hearth
features, lithic debitage, and a broken mano. Farther to the southwest of the reservoir, and

closer to the Culberson County line, sits site 41RV14, where approximately 30 hearths have
been identified, as well as several diagnostic projectile points, groundstone, and lithic debris.

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and via the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of the five Project
Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys in the
area, only one previously recorded archeological site (41RV169) was documented within the
1.0-mile (1.6-kilometer [km]) review perimeters of three of the five Project Areas. The results of
the archival research conducted for each of the five projects are presented within the associated
interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A one- to two-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the five
separate Project Areas at various times in 2019. The survey efforts typically entailed intensive
surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For projects
between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which included most of the well pads, the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of two shovel tests per
acre. For linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all the
assessed pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per mile. Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all five Project Areas. The number of
shovel tests excavated within each Project Area are presented in Table 4-1. The specific
methodology for each of the five projects is presented within the associated interim reports in
Appendix A. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL for permanent housing. Similarly, for any

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld Global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations and shovel test data are presented within the
associated interim reports in Appendix A.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at TARL in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and

Based on the survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of the five
projects would have no adverse effects on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on RBWPCD property. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery. The
THC concurred with these recommendations for all five projects. The THC comments for each
of the five separate Project Areas are presented in Table 5-2.

Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8808
HJN 160006 AR 103

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Bluegill 57-1-38 Unit
2H 3H Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 1H Flowline and Gas Lift Pipeline Project in Reeves County,
Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 5). The development of the Project Area will be
privately funded. However, the Project Area is located on property owned by the Red Bluff
Water Power Control District (RBWPCD). As the RBWPCD is considered to be a political
subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project
Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area on RBWPCD property and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8808.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jared Wiersema (Horizon project coordinator) and McKinzie
Froese (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.3 miles (8.5 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. It is situated within an area that has experienced
considerable impacts over time from adjacent gravel mining operations as well as oil and gas
development. The Project Area consists of pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures
approximately 1,745.0 feet (531.9 meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide. Overall, the
Project Area totals approximately 1.2 acres. It initiates at the existing Bluegill 57-1-38 and
Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad and extends to the east where it connects to another
existing well pad.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, the entire ROW will be cleared of
vegetation and leveled. The flowline and gas lift pipelines will be installed within open-cut
trenches measuring 24.0 to 36.0 inches (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide with minimum depths of 3.0 feet (0.9
m) and maximum depths of up to 6.0 feet (1.8 m).
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (Figure 6; THC
2019), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019).
The previously recorded site, 41RV169, is located just southwest of the western end of the
current Project Area. It was documented as a prehistoric lithic scatter by Horizon during an
earlier 2019 survey of the Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad
Project. While the majority of the site was located within the production pad area, the site
recorders noted that its deposits appeared to continue to the north towards Red Bluff Reservoir.
Due to the diffuse and surficial nature of the site, the assessed portion was recommended as a
non-contributing element to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site. The THC concurred with
this recommendation in a letter dated 4 March 2019. Since that time, the assessed portion of
this site has been destroyed by the development of the Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38
Remote Production Pad Project.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 7.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, in conjunction with the presence of
previously recorded site 41RV169 within the review radius, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew surveyed the Project Area on 5 June 2019. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project
Area measured approximately 1,745.0 feet (531.9 m) in length, a minimum of 5 shovel tests
were necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 8 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were
screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense
clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are
presented on Figure 8. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
8 excavated shovel tests. Soils across the Project Area consisted of shallow silty loam
overlying caliche bedrock (Figure 9). Small gravels were prevalent across the surface. If
cultural deposits had been present, they would have been confined to surface or near surface
contexts by the shallow soils at this location.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bluegill
57-1-38 Unit 2H 3H Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 1H Flowline and Gas Lift Pipeline Project will have
no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be
notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year.

Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8808
HJN 160006 AR 104

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit
2H 3H Flowline and Gas Lift Pipeline Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD).
As the RBWPCD is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is
regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group
(Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on
RBWPCD property and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8808.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jared Wiersema (Horizon project coordinator) and McKinzie
Froese (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.3 miles (8.5 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. It is situated within an area that has experienced
considerable impacts over time from adjacent gravel mining operations as well as oil and gas
development. The Project Area consists of pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures
approximately 750.0 feet (228.7 meters [m]) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. Overall, the
Project Area totals approximately 1.7 acres. It initiates at the existing Bluegill 57-1-38 and
Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad and extends to the west where it connects to
another existing well pad.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, the entire ROW will be cleared of
vegetation and leveled. The flowline and gas lift pipelines will be installed within open-cut
trenches measuring 24.0 to 36.0 inches (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide with minimum depths of 3.0 feet (0.9
m) and maximum depths of up to 6.0 feet (1.8 m).
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (Figure 6; THC
2019), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019).
The previously recorded site, 41RV169, is located just south of the eastern end of the current
Project Area. It was documented as a prehistoric lithic scatter by Horizon during an earlier 2019
survey of the Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad Project. While
the majority of the site was located within the production pad area, the site recorders noted that
its deposits appeared to continue to the north towards Red Bluff Reservoir. Due to the diffuse
and surficial nature of the site, the assessed portion was recommended as a non-contributing
element to the overall SAL eligibility status of the site. The THC concurred with this
recommendation in a letter dated 4 March 2019. Since that time, the assessed portion of this
site has been destroyed by the development of the Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38
Remote Production Pad Project.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 7.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, in conjunction with the presence of
previously recorded site 41RV169 within the review radius, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew surveyed the Project Area on 5 June 2019. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project
Area measured approximately 750.0 feet (228.7 m) in length, a minimum of 2 shovel tests were
necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 2 shovel tests within the undisturbed portions of the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 8. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within either of the
2 excavated shovel tests. This location has been heavily disturbed by existing pads to the east
and west. As such, the 2 shovel tests were excavated in the center of these 2 locations where
prior impacts were less intensive. Soils across the Project Area consisted of shallow silty loam
overlying caliche bedrock. Gravels were prevalent across the surface. If cultural deposits had
been present, they would have been confined to surface or near surface contexts by the shallow
soils at this location.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 2H 3H Flowline and Gas Lift Pipeline Project will have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Bluegill-Threadfin 57-1-38 Gas, Oil, SWD Pipeline Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8808
HJN 160006 AR 105

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Bluegill-Threadfin 571-38 Gas, Oil, SWD Pipeline Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through
5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is
located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD). As the
RBWPCD is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on RBWPCD property
and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on
sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8808.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jared Wiersema (Horizon project coordinator) and McKinzie
Froese (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.3 miles (8.5 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. It is situated within an area that has experienced
considerable impacts over time from adjacent gravel mining operations as well as oil and gas
development. The Project Area consists of pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures
approximately 2,070.0 feet (630.9 meters [m]) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. Overall, the
Project Area totals approximately 4.8 acres. It initiates at the existing Bluegill 57-1-38 and
Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad and extends to the west where it connects to an
existing pipeline ROW.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, the entire ROW will be cleared of
vegetation and leveled. The pipelines will be installed within open-cut trenches measuring 24.0
to 36.0 inches (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide with minimum depths of 3.0 feet (0.9 m) and maximum depths
of up to 6.0 feet (1.8 m).
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (Figure 6; THC
2019), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019).
The previously recorded site, 41RV169, is located on eastern end of the current Project Area
within the existing Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad. It was
documented as a prehistoric lithic scatter by Horizon during an earlier 2019 survey of the
Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad Project. While the majority of
the site was located within the production pad area, the site recorders noted that its deposits
appeared to continue to the north towards Red Bluff Reservoir. Due to the diffuse and surficial
nature of the site, the assessed portion was recommended as a non-contributing element to the
overall SAL eligibility status of the site. The THC concurred with this recommendation in a letter
dated 4 March 2019. Since that time, the assessed portion of this site has been destroyed by
the development of the Bluegill 57-1-38 and Threadgill 57-1-38 Remote Production Pad Project.
As such, while it is currently mapped on the eastern end of the current Project Area, it is
physically no longer present at this location.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
10 excavated shovel tests. This location has been heavily disturbed by gravel mining
operations and modern oil and gas development. The 10 shovel tests were excavated in areas
where prior impacts were present but less intensive (Figure 9). Soils across the Project Area
consisted of shallow silty loam overlying caliche bedrock. Gravels were prevalent across the
surface. If cultural deposits had been present, they would have been confined to surface or
near surface contexts by the shallow soils at this location.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the BluegillThreadfin 57-1-38 Gas, Oil, SWD Pipeline Project will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project
Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (RBWPCD) – TAC Permit No. 8808
HJN 160006 AR 108

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit
4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD).
As the RBWPCD is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is
regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group
(Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on
RBWPCD property and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8808.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jared Wiersema (Horizon project coordinator) conducted the
field investigations and was responsible for the data compilation and figure drafting.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.4 miles (11.9 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. It is situated within an area that appears to be
relatively undisturbed aside from some agricultural terracing along its western extent. The
Project Area consists of pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures approximately 3,558.5 feet
(1,084.6 meters [m]) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. Overall, the Project Area totals
approximately 8.2 acres. It initiates at an existing well pad and extends to the west where it
connects to an existing compressor station.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, the entire ROW will be cleared of
vegetation and leveled. The three pipelines (gas, oil, and SWD) will be installed within open-cut
trenches measuring 24.0 to 36.0 inches (0.6 to 0.9 m) wide with minimum depths of 3.0 feet (0.9
m) and maximum depths of up to 6.0 feet (1.8 m).
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV169, is located approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) southeast of the Project
Area.
Soils
A total of three soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above the floodplain of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist surveyed the Project Area on 31 July 2019. This entailed intensive
surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project Area measured
approximately 3,558.5 feet (1,084.6 m) in length, a minimum of 10 to 11 shovel tests were
necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating
a total of 12 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
12 excavated shovel tests. Soils across the Project Area consisted of silty loam overlying silty
clay. Gravels were prevalent across the surface within the eastern half of the Project Area. If
cultural deposits had been present, they would have been confined to surface or near surface
contexts by the shallow soils.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Threadfin 57-1-38 Unit 4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Beaver 57-1-16 Unit
3H / Nutria 57-1-16 Unit 3H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1
through 5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Red Bluff Water Power Control District (RBWPCD).
As the RBWPCD is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is
regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group
(Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a
cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the
survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on
RBWPCD property and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8808.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jacob Lyons (Horizon project archeologist) and McKinzie
Froese (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 10.2 miles (16.4 kilometers [km])
northwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of: 1) a well pad
measuring approximately 6.4 acres in size; and 2) two access roads totaling 460.0 feet (140.2
meters [m]) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (0.3 acre). Overall, the Project Area totals
approximately 6.7 acres. Its center point is located at Latitude 31.963008 and Longitude -103.
971184. The well pad area is broken into two areas in order to avoid impacts to an existing
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that extends north-south along the west side of the main pad area
(see Figures 2 and 3). One of the short access roads accesses the main pad off of County
Road (CR) 453, while the second short access road connects the two separate well pad areas.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, there is a slight elevation difference across
the pad areas. As a result, pad construction will consist of clearing the area of all vegetation
and then cutting and filling to create level well pad areas.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite with
associated petroglyphs. This site, 41LV1, is located approximately 2.2 miles (3.6 km) northeast
of the Project Area on the opposite side of Red Bluff Reservoir in Loving County.
Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an

Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew surveyed the Project Area on 4 December 2019.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. This equates
to a minimum of 13 shovel tests within the 6.4-acre well pad portion of the Project Area. The
TSMASS also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of 2 shovel tests along the 460.0 feet
(140.2 m) of access roads within the Project Area. In all, a minimum of 15 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 16 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the observation of one specimen of
lithic debitage on the surface of the Project Area (Figures 8 and 9; see also Figure 7). This
specimen consists of a secondary flake of fine-grained, gray chert that retains chalky-white
cortex over half of its cortical face.
Aside from this one isolated specimen, no other cultural materials were observed on the surface
of the Project Area or within any of the 16 excavated shovel tests that were excavated across
the Project Area. Due to its singular nature and the lack of other associated cultural materials,
the location of the isolated find was not documented as a formal archeological site.
The majority of the shovel tests revealed deposits of reddish-brown or pinkish-brown gravelly,
silty loam on the surface and throughout the excavated vertical extent of the shovel tests. In
several shovel tests, limestone bedrock or marl was encountered at depths down to 21.7 inches
(55.0 centimeters [cm]) below surface, while silty clays were encountered at depths down to
27.6 inches (70.0 cm) in other shovel tests. As noted above, all excavated shovel tests
produced negative results for subsurface cultural deposits.
Recommendations
Based on the survey results wherein only one isolated prehistoric specimen was observed in
surface contexts within the Project Area, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Beaver 57-1-16 Unit 3H / Nutria 57-1-16 Unit 3H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and the RBWPCD should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8808 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the
approval of the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials,
samples, and original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Dear Russ Brownlow:
Thank you for your submittal regarding the above-referenced project. This response represents the comments of the
Executive Director of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), pursuant to review under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
The review staff led by Drew Sitters and Caitlin Brashear has completed its review and has made the following
determinations based on the information submitted for review:
Above-Ground Resources
• No historic properties are present or affected by the project as proposed. However, if historic properties are
discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties are found, work should cease in the immediate area;
work can continue where no historic properties are present. Please contact the THC's History Programs Division
at 512-463-5853 to consult on further actions that may be necessary to protect historic properties.
Archeology Comments
• No effect on archeological sites. However, if buried cultural materials are encountered during construction or
disturbance activities, work should cease in the immediate area; work can continue where no cultural materials
are present. Please contact the THC's Archeology Division at 512-463-6096 to consult on further actions that
may be necessary to protect the cultural remains.
• THC/SHPO concurs with information provided.
We look forward to further consultation with your office and hope to maintain a partnership that will foster effective
historic preservation. Thank you for your cooperation in this review process, and for your efforts to preserve the
