The Prehistory of South Texas
Thomas R. Hester

ABSTRACT
The prehistoric archeology of southern Texas is summarized in this paper. The region, often known as the
Rio Grande Plain, has a distinctive archeological record in terms of site use patterns and artifact types. From the
Paleoindian through the Early Archaic, the cultural patterns of the area are part of broad phenomena crosscutting
this and other regions. With the Middle Archaic and Late Archaic, specific regional patterns can be seen; of
particular note are major cemetery sites and trade or interaction with other regions. During the Late Prehistoric,
regional patterns are present, and the Toyah horizon of Central Texas expands to encompass much of the area.
Protohistoric sites of the 16th and 17th centuries are also known. Much remains to be learned about South Texas
prehistory, since few sites have been excavated, few radiocarbon dates exist, and specific theoretical goals have
not been made explicit.

INTRODUCTION
The southern Texas archeological area (Figure
1) has been the subject of synthesis in a booklength treatment by Hester (1980), an overview of
the western Gulf coastal Plain (Story 1985), a paper
that dealt with both the interior and coastal portions
of this region (Black 1989), and a regional synthesis
written in the context of the Loma S andia (41LK28)
analysis (Black 1995). The present paper focuses
on the interior of the region, usually referred to as
the Rio Grande Plain, the Nueces Plain, or the South
Texas Plains. The northern boundary can be placed
at the Balcones Escarpment, the western edge set
artificially at the Rio Grande, the northeastern
boundary in the Guadalupe-San Antonio rivers
drainage system, the eastern boundary at the
juncture with the coastal bend, some 50-65 km
inland from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline,
and south, at the mouth of the Rio Grande. Black
(1989:Figure 19) noted five "biogeographical areas"
in the region: the Rio Grande Plain, the Rio Grande
Delta, the Nueces-Guadalupe Plain, the Sand Sheet,
and the Coastal Bend. As noted above, I will not
deal with the coasta! bend region in this present
synthesis (see Ricklis, this volume). Another
suggested set of subdivisions for this region was
proposed in the first South Texas Archeological
Palaver in 1988. The "South Texas Planning
Region" was divided into the Middle Nueces Zone,
the Brasada (McGraw et al. 1987), the Sand Sheet,

and the Rio Bravo corridor encompassing the
archeology of both sides of the Rio Grande. This
particular configuration did not include the Rio
Grande delta, leaving it as part of the coastal strip
extending up the coast from Brownsville.
The earlier syntheses have summarized various facets of the ecology of the South Texas region
(see also Jurgens 1980). Hester (1981) has noted
the variation in plant and water resources across the
region, distinguishing between "high density" (resource) areas and those of "low density." These
manifest different archeological records.
The difficulty in describing, in any detail, the
hydrology, vegetation, and fauna of the region
results from wholesale modification of the South
Texas environment during the Historic era. Hester
(1980) has outlined these, as has Hall (1985; see
also Hall et al. 1982, 1986). The principal changes
can be briefly summarized here. First, the mesquite
and other thorny shrubs that dominate the "Brush
Country" today spread (or at least increased in
density) within Historic times (e.g., Fisher
1977:183; Doughty 1983:122-123). However,
mesquite was clearly present in riverine zones as
early as 6000 B.P. This is based on wood species
identification of hearth charcoal done by Hol!oway
(1986); Jurgens (1980) suggests that the typical
riverine environmental pattern in that area today
was in place by 300 B.C. There is considerable
deba~e in the literature over the extent of mesquite
on the Rio Grande Plain, based on early Historic

accounts. Some report vast grasslands, while others
note that mesquite was rather widely distributed
(e.g., Inglis 1964; Lehmann 1984; Weniger 1984).
Various factors contributed to the spread of
mesquite, especially overgrazing and the lowering
of the water table. The latter was aggravated with
20th century deep well irrigation. This had the effect
of drying up springs that had fed perennial streams,
perhaps for millenia. A county park with abandoned
bath houses sits, like ancient ruins, adjacent to a
1920s swimming hole, on formerly spring-fed

Carrizo Creek (Dimmit County
[Brune 1981:165-166]).
The animal population has
also been significantly altered.
Gone are the bison, pronghorn,
bear, wolf, and jaguar (Doughty
1983:76) that were present in
southern Texas up to the
beginning of the 20th century
(Doughty 1983:54). Added to the
species list is armadillo (in the
19th century) and javelina; the
latter apparently first appeared ca.
A.D. 1400 (e.g., at site 41MC222
[Hall et al. 1986:215]), but began
to flourish in the 18th century,
based on faunal records from
Spanish Colonial missions (e.g.,
Davidson and Valdez 1976).
Except for Late Prehistoric sites,
faunal preservation is often poor
in South Texas. Steele and Hunter
(1986) provides a faunal study
from three Choke Canyon sites
that looks at diet, hunting patterns,
and environmental reconstruction,
topics not easily dealt with in
most
faunal
assemblages
elsewhere in the region.
One aspect of long-term environmental change on the Rio
Grande Plain has been the movement of stream channels through
time. Rivers like the Nueces and
the Frio, and their major tributaries, have often cut widely across
their valleys, creating a dendritic
pattern. Some channels can be
traced and roughly dated by archeological remains on their
banks (e.g., at Chaparrosa Ranch

[Hester 1978a]). In the Choke Canyon Project, Bunker (1982) studied in detail the movements of the
Frio River, and in their unpublished manuscript on
the East Chacon Project (Zavala and Uvalde counties), McGraw and Knepper (1983) have proposed
shifts in the Nueces River channel since Late Pleistocene times, as well as in its tributaries in their
study area.
South Texas archeology is beginning to benefit from geomorphological research, especially in
the terraces along the Rio Grande (Collins 1991)

Hester ~ The Prehistory of South Texas
and in the Rio Grande Delta (Collins et al. 1989).
Other studies were also carried out at Choke Canyon (Bunker !982) and Loma Sandia (Ho!liday
1995), but much remains to be done across the
region.
Evidence of climatic change in the region is
also hard to obtain. Robinson (1982) used phytolith
data from Choke Canyon Reservoir to offer a pattern of short vs. tall-grass occurrence through time,
perhaps reflecting alternating wet and dry episodes.
While tree-ring coring has helped to give drought
histories for part of Texas since 1698 (Stahle and
Cleaveland 1988), this has had only preliminary
application in South Texas (Gunn 1985).
The history of archeology in southern Texas
has been reviewed in detail by Mallouf et al.
(1977), and most recently by Black (1989:40-44).
In essence, little work was done in the region prior
to the late 1960s. Since that time, a number of important sites have been excavated (e.g., Montgomery 1978; Highley 1986; Black 1986), a major
reservoir study was carried out at Choke Canyon
(Live Oak and McMullen counties) providing 12
volumes on the prehistory, history, and
ethnohistory of that area, a number of cultural resource management surveys (and occasionally, test
excavations) have been done (including a largescale survey of the proposed Cuero I reservoir [Fox
et al. 1974]), and site reports and artifact distributional studies have been reported in the pages of
La Tierra, the quarterly journal of the Southern
Texas Archaeological Association. A series of
major surveys, archival studies, and excavations
have also taken place along the Medina River in
southern Bexar County at the locus of the proposed
Applewhite Reservoir (McGraw and Hindes 1987;
Thoms 1992). This study area is on the northern
periphery of southern Texas, as were the excavations at 41ME34 to the west (Hester 1990a). However, both have chronological data that help to
build on the cultural-historical framework of southern Texas.
The native peoples of southern Texas are traditionally labeled as "Coahuiltecans" (Newcomb
196t). However, they included Coahuilteco speakers (Johnson and Campbell 1992), and groups that
spoke perhaps six other languages (Goddard 1979)
and a language known as Sanan, recently published
by Johnson and Campbell (1992). The South Texas
hunting and gathering lifeways are hard to reconstruct from Spanish documents. The descriptions

429

by Newcomb (1961) provide a general view of
their existence, but for more details, the studies by
Campbell, gathered in a volume in 1988, are highly
recommended. The Indians of the Rio Grande delta
have been studied by Salinas (1990), and McGraw
et al. (1991) have shed new light on a number of
South Texas groups encountered by the Spanish
along the Camino Real and related early trails. The
native peoples became culturally extinct in the 18th
century (Hester 1989a) as a result of Spanish-introduced diseases, raiding by Apaches and
Comanches, the Spanish missionization process,
and acculturated new lives as farmers. After the
missions were secularized in 1794, many of these
lost their lands to "avaricious townspeople" as at
San Antonio de Valero (Almaraz 1989:38-39; de
la Teja 1995).

THE NATURE OFTHESOUTHTEXAS
ARCHEOLOGICALRECORD
Evidence of human occupation in southern
Texas is extremely abundant, yet has proven quite
challenging in terms of dating and interpretation.
Open occupation sites dominate the site types, usually found to be heavily eroded, with abundant surface debris such as chert flakes, land snails, mussel
shells, scattered hearthstones, and eroding hearths.
For a detailed discussion of South Texas site types
and features within sites (e.g., lithic caches, hearths,
pits, bone clusters, and activity areas), see Black
(1989:46-48).
These sites have been a boon for artifact-collectors, since large numbers of projectile points are
deflated onto a common surface. It is not uncommon for South Texas projectile point collections to
range into the many thousands of specimens. Thus,
"arrowhead collecting" is a popular pastime, as this
author found beginning around age 7! Today, much
of the ranchland is leased for hunting, and "arrowhead collecting" is often featured in urban sports
pages as an activity to while away the time during
deer-hunting. This results in large numbers of projectile points being indiscriminately collected and
"exported" to Houston, San Antonio, and beyond
by hunters. Of course, local collectors have been
active for decades; Shafer and Baxter (1975) point
to the absence of points at surface localities in a
McMullen County study area (see also Robinson et
al. 1992).

The South Texas open camp sites are very
difficult to excavate. Unlike Central Texas camp
sites where cultural debris is often concentrated in
a small area, and where a few test pits can provide
chrono!ogical information, the typical streamside
South Texas open site is really an "occupation zone"
(Hester 1981)--long, narrow strips of occupation.
Excavations will detect components of different age
in horizontally-separated parts of the site, seldom
overlapping to any great extent. The task of excavating these kinds of sites was evident at Choke
Canyon where small test pits yielded little, and our
strategy of open, block excavations (Figures 2-3)
improved both recovery and studies of horizontal
patterning (supplemented by machine-stripping; see
Brown et al. 1982) but they produced far less data
than we had expected (Hester 1986a). The same is
true for sites on Chaparrosa Ranch, again where
block excavations failed to yield little beyond scattered hearths and occasional diagnostics (Hester
1978a; Montgomery 1978). This is not to say that
such occupation zones are insignificant and not
worthy of excavation. Rather, we have to think in
terms of larger blocks and the use of backhoes and
geomorphological input for planning excavation
placement. By contrast, Late Prehistoric sites in
southern Texas are often dense concentrations of

a

features, faunal remains and artifacts, and have been
productively studied through the use of block excavations (Black 1986; Hightey 1986).
Another common type of site is related to lithic
procurement. On the high terraces of the NuecesFrio drainage systems, Uvalde gravels are extensively exposed. Here, one finds loci of tested cobbles,
debitage, and bifaces abandoned during reduction
(Hester 1975a). In the Duval County area, Chandler
and Lopez (1992) report an outcrop of qumâtz arenite
(Goliad formation) used by Archaic knappers. Along
the Rio Grande in the Laredo region, Warren (1989)
has reported "lithic reduction sites" in the uplands,
along with larger "lithic procurement/quarry sites"
that cover up to 1500 acres (see also Miller 1995).
Near the Rio Grande, multi-colored Rio Grande
gravels are reduced. Such sites in South Texas have
not been adequately studied; indeed, sometimes they
are not even given site numbers due to their broad
horizontal extent (cf. Warren 1989). I would argue,
however, that much more could be done with them,
especially in terms of defining local tithic reduction
sequences (Hester 1975a; Kotter 1980). They should
not be ignored or dismissed as unimportant by cultural resource management surveys.
Temporary campsites are often found in the
uplands or along high terraces. Characterized by a

Cemetery sites are present
in southern Texas, and are
rather common in the coastal
bend. The Loma Sandia site
(41LK28 [Taylor and Highley
1995]) is the best known, having yielded a large number of
burials with associated mortuary caches. Loma Sandia
once appeared to be anomalous, with its concentration of
burials and numerous grave
goods. Now, we know of two
or more such cemeteries in the
Falcon Reservoir area of
South Texas and adjacent
northeastern Mexico, again
with many burials and grave

(1989) also notes "intermediate campsites,"
which based on his definition appear to
represent similar short-term activities.
Deeply stratified open campsites do
occur in southern Texas. Excavations at
41LK31/32 at Choke Canyon provide one
example (Figure 4; Scott 1982) While little
could be contributed to regional culture
history at this site, it did yield abundant data
on intrasite activities (i.e., a chert-reduction
area, and concentrations of mussel and fish
remains) and large, well preserved hearths
with abundant charcoal for both dating and
wood species identification. Such stratified
sites also occur in the middle Guadalupe
River drainage, including Johnston-Heller
(Birmingham and Hester 1976), Willeke
(41VT17), and Berger Bluff (41GD30, on
Coleto Creek). To date, only Berger Bluff
has been partially excavated (D. Brown
1983; K. Brown 1987, n.d.). I have also seen
stratified sites at the mouths of major creeks
emptying into the Rio Grande in Webb
County; no excavations have been done at
these.

document and scientifically record these burials.
This fiasco at Falcon, during low-water episodes in
the 1980s and 1990s, is evidence of the failure of
the International Boundary and Water Commission
to live up to its responsibility to protect archeological sites (although one minor survey was done by
OâNeill et al. [1992]) on both sides of this reservoir. None of these kinds of sites were detected by
the limited Falcon Reservoir salvage efforts in the
early t950s (e.g., Cason 1952), and despite state
and federal laws, and international treaties, motorboat looters have largely erased a critical archeological record.
Other burial sites have been documented in
recent years. These include the Haiduk burial
(Mitchell et al. 1984), with Late Archaic diagnostics at a site in Karnes County; several disturbed
burials at the Shrew site (Labadie 1988); a burial in
Lavaca County (Hester 1994a) with an associated
Gahagan biface, reflecting trade with East or southeastern Texas; and a Late Prehistoric burial in Frio
County (Hester et al. 1993) with an associated
Scallorn arrow point. One burial salvaged by James
B. Boyd at Falcon Reservoir had a Caracara point
(Saunders and Hester 1993; Turner and Hester 1993)
deeply embedded in a vertebra; other burials in that
area have also yielded Caracara points as mortuary

inclusions. We are awaiting radiocarbon dates to
help place this point type, and these burials, in the
appropriate temporal niche within the Late Prehistoric. Stable isotope studies, designed to reveal dietary information, have also been undertaken by
Jeffery Huebner.
Sites with rock art are extremely rare in southern Texas. Overhangs with pictographs are known
from Webb County (e.g., Hester 1986b; see Figure
5), and James B. Boyd has photodocumented several pictograph sites on the Mexican side of the Rio
Grande in the Falcon Reservoir area. A major
petroglyph site known as the Fronton de Piedras
Pintas (Morales 1983) lies about 50 km from the
border near Paras, Nuevo Leon; it has been visited
in recent years by Rose Trevifio (Laredo), who has
extensive photographic records from the site. Other
pictograph sites are known to occur in overhangs or
on bluffs along the Nueces River between Uvalde
and La Pryor (e.g., the Bee Bluff pictograph and
petroglyph site reported by Ray Smith, personal
communication, 1987; records on file at TARL). A
petroglyph site is also reported by Smith east of
Uvalde, just south of the Balcones Escarpment.
At several sites, painted pebbles have been
found. These are thought of as typical of Lower
Pecos rockshelters (Shafer 1986). However, a

these data with professional archeologists. This
effort needs to be greatly intensified. Unfortunately, there is the erroneous belief among many
collectors in the region that professionals can
"confiscate" their collections; this is patently untrue, but can restrict documentation tasks. Landowners such as Radcliffe Ki!lam of Laredo have
made collections available for documentation
(Bettis 1994), while some families have donated
major collections for long-term curation and research (e.g., at TARL, the Bromley Cooper and
Dr. Pat Riley collections). This is to be especially encouraged.

CULTURAL-HISTORICAL
FRAMEWORK
The characteristics of the South Texas archeological record, and the comparative lack of
intensive excavations, all contribute to a chronology that remains poorly known. Johnson and
Goode (1994) have recently offered a revised
chronology for the central part of Texas, derived
from more than 70 years of excavations and

material. For example, large Clovis specimens made
of Edwards Plateau chert (see Figure 7a) (translucent brown) have been found at sites in Wilson and
Dimmit counties (Kelly 1988). Another from
Atascosa County provides insight into manufacturing techniques (see Figure 7b-bâ; Hester et al. 1993).
One Clovis base was found at a locality on Southern Island on the Mexican side of Falcon Reservoir; reportedly, up to 22 other Paleoindian points
were collected from that site (notes on file with the
author, TARL).
No mammoth kill or butchering sites attributable to Clovis have been found in South Texas,
although the Late Pleistocene fauna and possibly
associated lithics in the deposits of the Berclair
Terrace in Goliad and Bee counties remain an enigma
(Sellards 1940). Mammoth remains are commonly
found as secondary deposits along South Texas
creeks (T. C. Hill, Jr., personal communication, 1971;
Kay Hindes, personal communication), as well as in
the paleochannel of the Palo Blanco River of Kenedy
County (Suhm 1980). Brown (1990) reports the
geomorphological context of elephant remains bur-

ied in gully fill at the interface of the South TexasEdwards Plateau regions north of the San Antonio
airport. However, no artifacts were found in association with the elephant remains.
Folsom artifacts are also widely reported across
the Rio Grande Plain (Figure 8; Chandler and Kumpe
1994a; see also Largent and Waters [ 1990], although
their distribution map is not a wholly accurate representation of the geographical or numerical distribution of Folsom in the area). Numerous brief papers
have appeared in La Tierra documenting specimens
from the region, along the drainage of the Rio Grande
(Chandler and Kumpe 1994b; Cole Moore, personal
communication; notes on file at TARL) and east and
south on the coastal plains (e.g., Chandler and Lopez
1992). Folsom point preforms or failures have been
found in collections in Webb County (Bettis 1994;
Figure 8c-d) and near Falcon Lake (James B. Boyd,
personal communication, 1995; notes on file at
TARL; see Figure 8e-fâ). Aside from localities with
two or three Folsom points (Hester 1968), no Folsom
camp or kill sites have been located. The nearest, on
the edge of the Balcones Escarpment in Bexar

Hester ~ The Prehistory of South Texas

County, is Pavo Real (41BX52 [Henderson and
Goode 1991]); Clovis materials are also reported
from this site.
Certainly the most intriguing Paleoindian site
to have been excavated in the region is Berger
Bluff (41GD30) in Goliad County (Brown 1987,
n.d.). Buried more than 8 meters below the surface
along Coleto Creek (and now indundated by Coleto
Creek Reservoir), excavations on a ledge or bench
deposit uncovered a hearth, an in situ chipping area,
cores, two small pits, and an unfinished (or rejected) triangular biface; there were no projectile
point diagnostics. Eight radiocarbon dates were obtained, averaging around 9500 B.P., although both
earlier and later dates were obtained. Associated
with the cultural material was a considerable bone
deposit of small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Detailed research by Brown (n.d.) indicates
that these were collected and eaten by human foragers, perhaps by what Brown suggests was a task
group of women and children. The Berger Bluff
fauna, as well as tiny snails obtained by
waterscreening, is fully Holocene in character, but
with some species that are no longer present in the
area today. Three species of snails, now extripated
in the Coleto Creek/southern Texas area, are more
typical of colder waters, or of marshes more typical
of the eastern United States.
Later Paleoindian patterns in southern Texas
are represented by large numbers of projectile points
(Figure 9; Weir 1956; Hester 1977b, 1987). However, typological problems abound in distinguishing
between Plainview (ca. 10,000 B.P.) and Golondrina
(ca. 9000 B.P. [Hester t983]). Clearly, there are
points that would fit within the range of Southern
Plains Plainview points, and many of the Golondrina
forms are quite distinct (Figure 9d-e, but see Figure
10, a cache of Golondrina points from southern
Uvalde County, reflective of variation within the
type, ranging from the finished form to heavily
resharpened ([Hester 1994c:41]). Kelly (1982) provided a statistical approach to distinguishing between the two types, using specimens from South
Texas. In addition, there are many parallel-sided
points that have been called Plainview (see Figure
9a-b) but which are usually smaller and more narrow than those from the type site and related localities. For example, at St. Maryâs Hall in Bexar County,
excavations in 1977 revealed a discrete camp site
and chipping locality with distinctive points. While
they have been called Plainview in several papers

435

(e.g., Hester 1990b), I am now convinced that they
are not of this type. My re-assessment is based on
stratigraphically-recovered points from the WilsonLeonard site in Williamson County, where similar
points appear to date after Golondrina. Anne Kerr
(personal communication, 1995) calls these "St.
Maryâs Hall points." A better picture of the relationships of several Central and South Texas Late
Paleoindian types will be possible upon analysis
and publication of the Wilson-Leonard data.
Another Paleoindian type known from Devilâs
Mouth (Johnson 1964) and Wilson-Leonard
(Michael B. Collins, personal communication, 1995)
is also present in South Texas. This is the Early
Stemmed or "Wilson" type (Turner and Hester
1993). Bettis (1994) reports one specimen from
Webb County.
Extremely common in southern Texas is the
Angostura type (see Figure 9f-g). Recent excavations
in the area of the Applewhite Reservoir in southern
Bexar County have uncovered a buried Angostura
component radiocarbon dated to approximating 9800

B.P. (Thoms and Mandel 1992). This is in line with
dates for Angostura from Wilson-Leonard (M. B.
Collins, personal communication, 1995). Possibly
related to Angostura is the Early Stemmed Lanceolate
form (Turner and Hester 1993) found in some
numbers in Victoria County (Birmingham and Hester
1976), and perhaps in the Late Paleoindian/Early
Archaic cache reported from Loma Sandia (Taylor
and Highley 1995).
Scottsbluff points (see Figure 9h) typical of
the Plains and into eastern Texas (Turner and
Hester 1993), are scattered across southern Texas
(Hester and Hill 1971a; Chandler and Hindes
1993), with a notable concentration in the Victoria
County area. Based on cross-dating with the Plains,
these are thought to date around 8800-8400 B.P.
(Gunnerson 1987).
A typological problem that is present in South
Texas Paleoindian studies involves the so-called
Lerma type (as defined by MacNeish 1958). These
narrow, bipointed specimens may or may not be of
Paleoindian age (Turner and Hester 1993). An unpublished manuscript by the late T. C. Kelly (1989)
remains the best effort to assemble data on the Lerma
form in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico. A
point classified as Lerma was found at the base of a
stratified site on the Nueces River (41ZV263) by
Gibson (1981), but is not chronometrically dated.
The best opportunity in southern Texas to find
the Late Paleoindian forms in context, and to gain
other than typological or distributional data for
them, are the deep sites noted earlier in Victoria
County, especially Johnston-Heller and Willeke.
Work at the River Spur site (41VTl12) in 1993
(Cloud et al. 1994) suggested that this was a

In dealing with the Early Archaic, I draw heavily
from a paper prepared for a conference on the Archaic of southern North America (Hester 1989b).
We are still a long way from having a sufficient
number of excavated sites and applicable radiocarbon dates to develop a detailed description and chronology of this early period in southern Texas.
To summarize the Early Archaic patterns in
the 1989 paper, I offered definitions of two widespread horizons. The first was termed the "Early
Corner Notched Horizon," followed by the "Early
Basal Notched Horizon" (the latter has affinities to
the Calf Creek horizon in Oklahoma and Arkansas
[Wyckoff 1995]). Dating of these horizons parallel
the chronological parameters provided in Central
and lower Pecos Texas for related phenomena (see
papers by Collins and Turpin, this volume). My
goal in offering these two concepts was to emphasize the broad cross-regional distributions of the
index-marker projectile points of these horizons in
the Texas-Mexico borderlands.
In southern Texas, the "Early Corner Notched
Horizon" is most poorly known. It is typified by
corner-notched dart points with recurved or notched
bases. Typologically, these would fit within the
Martindale-Uvalde-Baker-Bandy continuum (Figure
l la-c; see also McReynolds 1993), and to some
specimens of the Gower type (Ricklis and Cox
1991). While points of this horizon are seen in
collections from the region (e.g., Hester and
Whatley 1992), their site distribution is little
understood. In the excavations at Choke Canyon
reservoir, site 41LK51 yielded a Bandy-style point,
along with thin triangular bifaces, and from a
context 20 cm below a radiocarbon assay of 51304450 B.C. At Chaparrosa Ranch, points of this
horizon are on high terraces overlooking Turkey
and Chaparrosa creeks. As noted above, settlement
patterns for the Early Archaic are unknown; perhaps
these peoples operated as small bands, highly mobile
and wide-ranging due to the arid climate inferred
for part of this time frame (McKinney 1981; Story
1985). McGraw and Knepper (1983) in their survey
of the East Chacon area found Guadalupe tools to

be "water-proximate," while the general Early
Archaic settlement paralleled that of the previously
mentioned Chaparrosa Ranch and the Paleoindian
site distribution in this area.
The "Early Corner Notched" horizon markers
may encompass the bifurcated base points found by
Thorns (1992) at the Richard B eene site (41BX831),
with a radiocarbon date of about 7000 B.P. Interestingly, James Karbula (personal communication,
1995) has found what appear to be identical points
at the Eckols site in Travis County, stratigraphically
below a component with Martindale points (Karbula
1993). It may be that these bifurcated points are a
Central Texas, not a South Texas, form, but this is
just speculation given the meagre data on hand.
From typological cross-dating, the temporal span
of the "Early Corner-Notched Horizon" may be
from ca. 6000-3500 B.C.
Associated with this earliest Archaic horizon
appear to be Guadalupe tools (see Figure 1 ld-e;

437

Hester and Kohnitz 1975; see also Prewitt
1981:78). Alhough found mostly in the San
Antonio-Guadalupe River basins (Black and
McGraw 1985), they also occur along the
Rio Grande, along the middle Nueces drainage (Brown 1985, 1989; Nightengale et al.
1989), and in the Zavala County region
(Highley 1984). Based on radiocarbon dates
for Guadalupe tools along the southern edge
of the Balcones Escarpment, they fall somewhere in the range of 3300-4700 B.C. (e.g.,
Hester 1990a: 1).
The subsequent "Early Basal Notched
Horizon" includes specimens with deep basal
notches, large barbs, and distinctive long stems
(Figure 12a-g). The recognized types include
Bell and Andice of the Calf Creek horizon.
Early Triangular bifaces are probably also
part of this horizon (Hester and Whatley 1992);
some of these are preforms for Bell/Andice,
others may have been used as knives (Black
and McGraw 1985), and yet others bear impact flutes indicative of their use as dart points.
Based on my excavations in Uvalde County
(at the La Jita and Smith sites [Hester 1971;
Hester et al. 1989]), it looks as if the Early
Triangular form may first appear in the "Early
Corner Notched Horizon," and perhaps continue into the later horizon.

The "Early Basal Notched Horizon" extends from the southern Texas coast, across
the Rio Grande Plain, and into northeastern Mexico
east of the Sierra Madre Oriental (Chandler and
Kumpe 1993; James B. Boyd collection; notes on
file at TARL). Fox and Hester (1976) reported
Andice points from 41VT17 in Victoria County,
and Bell/Andice are noted in several papers in La
Tierra as derived from surface contexts in South
Texas (e.g., Hester and Whatley 1992; Chandler
and Kumpe 1993). Ricklis and Cox (1991) report
Bell points from the McKinzie site (41NU221) at
the mouth of the Nueces River; these specimens,
and three unstemmed points, are linked to radiocarbon assays of ca. 3000-3600 B.C. (see Ricklis, this
volume). In general, the "Early Basal Notched Horizon" likely dates in this rough time frame. Other
recognizable traits of this horizon are large unifacial
"Clear Fork" tools (Hester and Kohnitz 1975), as
well as smaller forms (Hall et al. 1982:Figure 79)
and multi-notched "eccentric" Bell/Andice specimens, found as far south as Falcon Reservoir (see

yielded diagnostics of neither horizon. While there
were several well-defined features, abundant mussel and Rabdotus shell, cores, debitage and faunal
remains, the only "formal" artifacts were three
unstemmed thin biface fragments (Hall et al.
1986:397). The diet appeared to focus on freshwater mussel, Rabdotus snails, turtles, and freshwater
drum (Scott 1982).

Although Johnson and Goode (1994:5) include
the latter part of this range in their Central Texas
"Middle Archaic," I prefer to follow Hall et al.
(1986) in defining the South Texas Middle Archaic
period with the onset of specific regional cultural
patterns ca. 2500 B.C., emphasizing unstemmed
dart points and smaller bifacial and unifacial beveled tools. Of course, the way in which I have
modeled these two horizons, in defining broad cultura! patterns across several parts of Texas, may be
too simplistic as we learn more about the southern
Texas Early Archaic. For example, at site 41LK31/

Hall et al. (1986) date the Middle Archaic between 2500-400 B.C. As just noted above, this period represents a regional material culture pattern
easily seen in the archeological record. Triangular
dart points, known as Tortugas and Abasolo (Figure
13a-b), dominate the projectile point assemblage.
Some of them may have been used as "knives;"
however, studies of triangular point assemblages
from South Texas by Karbula (1990) and Bettis
(1994) reveal high frequencies of impact fractures
at the tip. Another regionally-specific type is Carrizo
(Turner and Hester 1993), illustrated in Figure 13c.
Utilitarian lithics include smaller unifacial distallybeveled tools (the Dimmit form [Figure 14] of Nunley
and Hester [1966]), in some areas made in high
frequencies from gray quartzite (Hester et al. 1973;
see also Inman et al. 1995). Some distally-beveled
tools are also bifacial. There is much reworking and
resharpening of these tools, which appear to have
been used largely in woodworking tasks (Hester et
al. 1973; see Howard [1973] for experimental data).
Along the Rio Grande between Eagle Pass and Falcon Reservoir, the artifacts are often made on cortex
flakes, with the dorsal side flaked, and the ventral
side remaining as cortex (Chandler 1974). While
Hall et al. (1982:Figure 79) have proposed a sequence of these distally-beveled forms, focusing on
Early vs. Late Archaic (Figure 15), it is likely that
localized examples of these tools, along with extensive resha~ening and other modification (e.g., for
hafting) have left a functional and technological
morass that will require much research to sort out.
One example is the Nueces tool (see Figure 13e-f;
Hester, White, and White 1969; Nightengale et al.
1989; Turner and Hester 1993), which can be lunate
to trapezoidal in outline, largely reflecting the extent of resharpening of the beveled bit.

are often identified by the presence of stemmed
points that can be cross-dated with Central Texas
(Pedernales, Lange; see Figure 13d), the lower
Pecos (Langtry), and the central coastal plain
(Morhiss). Assemblages that include Middle Archaic materials (and those of both earlier and later
periods) are published from the middle Nueces
drainage (Ward 1984; Woerner and Highley 1983;
Nightengale et al. 1989), western South Texas (e.g.,
41DM59 [Hester and Whatley 1992]), the Shrew
site (Labadie 1988), and Falcon Lake (Kotter 1980;
Saunders 1985). Many of the tubular sandstone
pipes (Figure 16) found across South Texas may
also date to this era (Hester 1969; Chandler and
Kumpe 1993). A buried and as yet unexplored
Middle Archaic component appears to be present at
41ZV37 (Inman et al. 1995), with one radiocarbon
date of !831-1880 B.C. (Tx8112-calibrated); a
unifacial distally-beveled tool (Clear Fork uniface)
was associated with this component.
Settlement patterns in the Choke Canyon and
Chaparrosa study areas, along with those at East

Chacon (McGraw and Knepper 1983) suggest that
Middle Archaic open camp sites are to be found
along present or former stream channels. In later
Middle Archaic times, sites are present on floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees of present
stream courses. Middle and Late Archaic sites in
Starr County have been characterized by Nunley
and Hester (1975:13) as "gallery" (on terraces or
arroyo banks) and "bower" (in hilly areas overlooking the arroyos and their tributaries).
Dietary information is meagre, due to poor
faunal preservation. However, data from Choke
Canyon (e.g., Scott 1982), recovered from wood
species identification of charcoal from well-constructed hearths, suggest use of the beans and nuts
of mesquite, acacia, oak, and hackberry. Hall et al.
(1986) surmise that it is during this time that plant
resources drew heavy emphasis, as reflected by an
increase in formal hearths, earth ovens, and burned
rock accumulations

apparently involved cemeteries. Loma Sandia stands
out as the best known example (Taylor and Highley
1995), with 205 burials, and more than 400 features
documented at the site, many of these including
clusters of grave goods found with individual burials
(Figure 17). Contents of these clusters, often tightly
packed as if in a net, hide bag, or basket, included
triangular points (Tortugas, though with larger and
smaller forms, and Abasolo), Lange, Morhiss, and
Pedernales points, medium sized "gouges" (mostly
unifacial distally-beveled tools), flakes, cores,
fragments of marine shell (including conch), tabular
pieces of sandstone (it seems like just about
everyone had to be buried with small pieces of
unmodified sandstone), and tubular sandstone pipes
(see Hester 1980:116). In contrast to the dates for

Tortugas points at this site, a single assay from
41ME34 puts a Tortugas-like point at 3362-3398
B.C. (calibrated); Hester (1990a:1) does not
consider it to be Early Triangular, although the
dates are more in line with that form.
However, there are apparently other cemeteries in the region, based on as-yet unpublished data
from Falcon Reservoir. The Southern Island site
(sites?), on the Mexican side of the river, has yielded
many burials with numerous grave goods. These
include tubular stone pipes and triangular dart points
(as at Loma Sandia), along with Oliva shells, and
bone beads.

Late Archaic
The Late Archaic is better known, dating from
400 B.C. to around A.D. 600/700. Several excavated
components have been published or at least
described in preliminary fashion. For example, at
41ZV10 in western South Texas, Hester (1978a)
found Shumla, Ensor (Figure 18a), Marcos, and
Montell points, stratigraphically below Late
Prehistoric occupations. Interestingly, the Marcos
and Shumla points were in deposits below those
containing Ensor and Montell. The Shumla type,
best known from the Lower Pecos, is also a
widespread marker of the Late Archaic in southern
Texas. A very high percentage of the South Texas
specimens are made of heat-treated chert (Hester
and Collins 1974). Olmos bifaces, small triangular
gouge-like tools with specialized resharpening
techniques, apparently date mainly to the Late

Archaic although they may have continued to be
used in Late Prehistoric times (see Figure 18d-h
[Shafer and Hester 1971]).
At Choke Canyon, 44 sites yielded diagnostics
of the Late Archaic, including Ensor, Frio, Ellis,
Fairland, and Marcos points. Sites have extensive
deposits of fire-cracked rock, both hearths and
earth ovens (these continue from the latter part of
the Middle Archaic), and grinding implements
(manos, metates) are commonly found. These may
reflect further intensification of the exploitation of
mesquite and acacia beans (as welt as other plant
resources) after these species appeared (and
spread?) during the Middle Archaic. However, at
site 4tLK67, Feature 8 was found, a large
accumulation of fire-cracked rock (55 kg), with
considerable quantitities of mussel shell, and
Brown et al. (1982) note that "the cooking of
mussels may have been at least one of the

442

Texas Archeological Society

functions" (Feature 8 was radiocarbon dated at 400
B.C.). At Choke Canyon, Middle and Late Archaic
faunal remains suggest exploitation of small
animals (rodents, rabbits, turtles, fish, lizards, and
snakes) and deer. Rabdotus snails and mussel shells
are common, reflecting their collection as food
sources.
Late Archaic camp sites are almost always
located adjacent to present stream channels or adjacent sloughs (e.g., Kelly 1979; Highley 1986;
McGraw and Knepper 1983; Warren 1986). There
is clear evidence of lithic procurement sites as very
common occurrences in Late and Middle Archaic
times on high terraces and ridges containing Rio
Grande gravels (Kelly 1979; Warren 1986) or
Uvalde gravels (Hester 1975a; Davis 1992). There
is no doubt that these same chert resources were
also used in Paleoindian and Early Archaic times
(e.g., Berger and Associates 1989). In areas where
these outcrops did not occur (e.g., McGraw
1979:24), stream pebbles, gravels, silicified wood,
and quartzite were exploited.
Elsewhere in southern Texas, especially in
Webb and La Salle counties, Desmuke, Matamoros,
and Catan points appear to be markers of the Late
Archaic (see Figure 18b-c), along with Olmos tools.
I suspect that we will eventually find (as the data
suggest from 41ZV 10) that the Late Archaic can be
broken into two parts, or that it would be wise to
use the concept of a "terminal Archaic" for sites
with Ensor, Frio, Catan, and Matamoros points in
particular. This is because they often show up in
the early Late Prehistoric sites in the region (cf.
Creel et al. 1979).
Cemeteries may have continued to be used in
this period, as they did on the Texas coastal bend
(e.g., the Oso cemetery, 41NU2) and in Bexar
County (41BX1; Lukowski 1987). However,
isolated burials with grave goods provide other
insights into burial patterns. On the lower Nueces,
in the area of present Lake Corpus Christi, a single
burial associated with Ensor points was found
(Hester 1989c). In Karnes County, the Rudy
Haiduk site burial, with corner-tang bifaces,
Marcos points (see Figure 18i-j), and other Late
Archaic indicators has been published (Mitchell et
al. 1984), and another, with an Ensor point in the
chest area, was reported by Huebner et al. (1995).
A burial found by McGraw (1983) in a Holocene
Rio Grande terrace south of Laredo may also date
to this period. The disturbed burials at the Shrew

site are likely Late Archaic (Labadie [1988:110]
places Burial 1, with the associated large triangular,
edge-polished biface [Figure 19a], in the "latter
part of the Archaic").

Association.

There may have been increased trade with Central Texas in the Late Archaic. Large, smallstemmed bifaces (Figure 20a-b; Hester and Green
1972) are found on an occasional basis, including a
specimen from Frio County, and one with a cache
of 50 bifaces (Figure 20c-g), many made of Edwards
chert (Michael B. Collins, personal communication, 1995), found with a burial at Falcon Reservoir
in late 1994. Large triangular bifaces (see Figure
19b) of Edwards chert are found in several areas of
South Texas (e.g., the Riley cache [Figure 21];
Miller 1993; see also Hester and Barber 1990).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas has
been extensively studied and published on (see

Hester ~ The Prehistory of South Texas

443

Matamoros, Catan, and Zavala often occur in
what are otherwise Late Prehistoric contexts,
some even in very late contexts. These are
smal! points and surely could have been used
with the bow and arrow. Whether they were
"recycled" by Late Prehistoric hunters, or
were made and used as part of the bow and
arrow system is hard to tell (evidence for the
latter comes from 41LK106 [Creel et al.
1979]).
If we use the Central Texas sequence as
a
b
an analogy, we can argue that Edwards and
Scal!orn points (Figure 22a-c) represent the
first
diagnostics of the Late Prehistoric
0
5crn
period. At Blue Bayou (41VT94), Huebner
and Comuzzie (1992) report a Scallorn point
in a Late Prehistoric cemetery radiocarbondated in the 6th century A.D. Another
Scallorn point (Figure 22c) was found with
a burial in Frio County (Hester et al. 1993).
Scallorn points, and arrow points resembling
Edwards (Turner and Hester 1993), are
widespread in South Texas, but we have so
little on their cultural context that it is
unclear as to their affinity with Central
c
d
Texas. This is further complicated by their
apparent co-occurrence with Perdiz points at
sites like 41ZV155 (Tortuga Flat [Inman
n.d.]), and with pottery, straight-stemmed
arrow points, and late radiocarbon dates at
41MC222 (Hall et a!. 1986). A distinctive
artifact that does appear at this time is the
arrow shaft straightener (Figure 22d), made
of limestone, and often broken from repeated
reheating in the arrow-straightening process
(Turner and Hester 1993).

Further uncertainties about Late Prehistoric internal
chronology are seen along the Rio Grande below Laredo.
Here, Starr points are common, but undated. They
apparently have several variants about which little is
known. Another type, Caracara (Figure 23; Saunders
and Hester 1993; see also Fox 1979:Figure 17), is also
undated but recent burials with associated Caracara
points found at Falcon Reservoir may yield radiocarbon
assays. Toyah points are also found with some frequency
in that area, and are occasionally seen at other South
Texas sites. These are assumed to date very late in the
Late Prehistoric period, but we know nothing about
what cultural pattern they might represent.
Across southern Texas, including portions of the
coastal bend (Ricklis, this volume), the best documented
Late Prehistoric pattern is the Toyah horizon (Black
1986), dating between A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650.
Several Toyah open camp sites have been excavated,
including: Hinojosa (41JWS; Black 1986), 41LK201
(Highley 1986), 41MEt9 (Hester and Kelly 1976), and
the material culture reported from surface contexts at
Berclair (41GD4; Hester and Parker 1970). Cultural
traits include Perdiz points (Figure 24), small end scrap-

Toyah sites are located along present stream
channels or nearby sloughs (e.g., 4ILK201), sometimes buried just below the surface of natural levees
paralleling the streams. This is a pattern for other
Late Prehistoric sites in much of southern Texas
(e.g., Mariposa [Montgomery 1978] and in the East
Chacon study area [McGraw and Knepper 1983]).

movement or the cultural diffusion of traits (perhaps
largely associated with bison hunting practices).
He favors the latter idea (see also Hester 1975b),
and thus proposes the use of the term "horizon"
when referring to Toyah manifestations.
Supportive of Blackâs argument is the presence of selected Toyah traits in contemporary Late
Prehistoric sites in parts of South Texas. For example, in the Chaparrosa Ranch area, along
Tortugas Creek in Zavala County, and south into
Webb, Zapata, and other counties, sites often yield
Perdiz points, bone-tempered pottery, beveled
knives, or some combination of Toyah traits (e.g.
41ZV155 [Inman n.d.]). However, the whole assemblage is not present at South Texas sites, and
often, bison is absent (or poorly represented) in the
faunal list (e.g., 41ZV10 [Hester 1978a]).
There are also sites like 41MC222 (Skillet
Mountain #4 [Hall et al. 1986]) in the Choke Canyon area that have produced bison (indeed, it appears to be a bison-butchering station), and
bone-tempered pottery, but stemmed arrow points
that are not Perdiz, as well as the absence of beveled knives, end scrapers, etc. Scallorn and Edwards
points are also present.
I suspect that native peoples of Late Prehistoric times had adopted all or some of the traits of

the Central Texas Toyah, or even that Central Texas
hunting parties ventured onto the coastal plain (cf.
Hester and Parker 1970). The uneven diffusion of
Toyah traits across the region indicates that they
should be considered horizon-markers, and not part
of a "phase" (Johnson 1987).
The latter part of the Late Prehistoric, which
includes Toyah, also has evidence of South Texas
connections to a north-south Plains trade network.
Recognizable remnants of such trade are the bits of
Idaho (Malad) obsidian that show up in southern
Texas at this time (Hester et al. 1991).
Equally intriguing as a problem of cultural
interaction is the archeological record in the Rio
Grande delta during the Late Prehistoric (Hester
1969, 1988, 1994b). Numerous sites and their assemblages have been recorded and studied by A.
E. Anderson (1932), Richard S. MacNeish (1958),
and others (Prewitt 1974; Hester 1978b, 1994b).
This cultural pattern, known as the Brownsville
Complex (see Ricklis, this volume) is noted for
manufacture of great numbers of shell ornaments
(Figure 27a-c, g). Numerous artifacts of bone were
also made (Figure 27d-f, h-j). The Brownsville
Complex groups utilized clay dunes for camp sites
and for cemeteries (e.g., Hester et al. 1969; Prewitt
1974). They were hunters (using Cameron and

along the coastal plain south of Brownsville,
he revisited some ofAndersonâs sites and
found more Huastecan pottery.
In addition to the Mesoamerican ceramics, Anderson also collected several bits of
obsidian and some pieces of jadeite and

serpentine. These, too, were items of material culture exotic to the lower Rio Grande
Delta. Later studies, such as excavation of
the Floyd Morris cemetery site in Cameron
County (Collins et al. 1969), uncovered a
large tubular jadeite bead (see Figure 27n)
with Brownsville Complex materials. Surveys by R. J. Mallouf yielded two additional obsidian flakes in Willacy County
(41WY40), and Day (1981) recovered several obsidian flakes from 41WY72.
Where did these artifacts originate and
how did they get to the Rio Grande delta?
The ceramics include ollas, bowls, and
many fragments of vessels and sherds.

The geologic sources of several obsidian flakes
from the delta have been pinned down with precision, with the techniques of nuclear chemistry used
by the Texas Obsidian Project (Figure 29; Hester et
al. 1991). For example, a tiny flake of black opaque
obsidian found by Anderson in Cameron County is
linked to the Zacualtipan source in the state of
Hidalgo. Seven obsidian flakes from 41WY72 are
all of green obsidian (Day 1981). Visually, these
appeared to be from the Pachuca, or Cerro de las
Navajas source, the most famous in ancient Mexico.
X-ray fluorescene analysis confirmed this (Kibler
1994:16). Finally, two flakes found by Mallouf at
41WY40, have also been identified as to source,
although when we first analyzed them in the late
1970s, their source was unknown. Recently, however, David O. Brown of Austin, provided obsidian
samples from a source known as Ojos Zarcos in
Queretaro state not far from Guanajuato. Colleagues
at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, used precise

x-ray fluorescence analysis (PXRF [Giauque et al.
1993]), and convincingly linked it to the 41WY40
specimens.
The jadeite and serpentine artifacts found in
the delta area include a tiny celt-like specimen and
a piece of worked serpentine. There is also the tubular bead noted earlier from the Floyd Morris site
in Cameron County, along with what Anderson
described as a spherical or jade(ite) bead no longer
available for study. The geologic sources of these
are unknown. They would have to come from beyond the Huasteca, perhaps in Oaxaca or any number of other areas where jadeite and serpentine are
known in central and southern Mexico. What is
important here is their occurrence; though they are
not true jade, they are "green stone" of the sort very
important in Mesoamerican cultures.
What processes might have been involved in
trade or contact between the Brownsville Complex
and ancient Mesoamerica? First of all, it is safe to
say that the main conduit was the Huastecan culture, the northern edge of which is about 500 km
down the Gulf coast from the delta (Figure 29).
During the Early Postclassic, the Huasteca maintained trade relations with the Toltec empire. Late
Postclassic Huastecan culture was part of the Aztec
empire amd paid tribute to them (Hosler and
Stresser-Pean 1992). Clearly, then, the region was
closely linked with central Mexico. In the Late
Postclassic, it is equally clear that the well-known
Aztec traders, known as the pochteca, interacted
with the Huastecs. Indeed, it is said that the markets of the Huasteca competed with those of Aztec
Tenochtitlan (Fagan 1984:66). Throughout the
Postclassic the Huastec merchants could have obtained obsidian and jade through Toltec or Aztec
trade networks.
But how and why did these Huastecan commodities reach the Brownsville Complex? There
are a series of frontier Mesoamerican villages in
the Sierra de Tamaulipas dug by MacNeish (1958)
and Stresser-Pean (1977). At first glance, they look
to be likely intermediaries. MacNeish (1958) notes
Huastecan Period VI "trade ware" in late sites in
the Sierra de Tamaulipas, and Stresser-Peanâs
(1977) study of the site of San Antonio Nogalar in
the southern Sierra de Tamaulipas also illustrates
late Huastecan ceramics.
There is also the broad flat coastal plain east
of the Sierra de Tamaulipas that could have been
traversed by Huastec merchants, or perhaps travel

was by boat along the coast. MacNeish (1947)
found what he termed Huastecan campsites north
of the Rio Soto la Marina and near the Laguna
Madre, only 250 km south of the Rio Grande. What
drew the Huastecans north to the delta? I believe it
was the shell ornament production of the
Brownsville Complex. We cannot yet resolve the
"chicken-or-the egg" dilemma of which came
first--the shell beads or the Huastecs? Doubtless
the hunters and gatherers making the prodigious
numbers of shell ornaments were after more than a
few pots, obsidian flakes, and poor quality jadeite!
There were surely other commodities that have not
been preserved. And, were the Huastecs only interested in the shell beads for themselves?
Brownsville-style Oliva tinklers occur among the
Huasteca (Ekholm 1944), are depicted on Huasteca
stone sculpture, and MacNeish (1947) states that

Brownsville Complex shell ornaments are common
in Huasteca sites. But are these from the delta or
made by the Huastecs themselves from Gulf coast
shell in their region? We cannot answer this question with the paucity of modern excavation data
from the Huasteca or the Rio Grande delta. It is
interesting to note that one commodity specially
favored by the Aztecs for their Tenochtitlan markets were marine shells and marine shell ornaments, perhaps largely supplied through Huastec
tribute.

Protohistoric
Adkins and Adkins (!982:242) define
"protohistory" as "the transition period between the
prehistoric and historic periods denoting a phase
for which few written records are available, and for

450

which most evidence is derived from archaeology."
In the archeology of the Plains, the Protohistoric
concept is often used (e.g., Baugh 1986). It includes sites up to ca. 1750 at which Southwestern
Indian and some European trade goods appear, but
recognizes that Euro-american explorers and settlers had not yet entered the area in sufficient numbers to have "impacted the economy of the Southern
Plains peoples" (Baugh 1986:183). This is exactly
what we have in South Texas in the 16th and 17th
centuries, before the Spanish explorers and mission
system "impacted the economy" of the Late Prehistoric groups.
There are a number of sites that fall into this
era. Especially well known are several in Zavala
County (Hester and Hill 1975) with radiocarbon
dates in this time frame. Only 60 km to the west,
missions were established at what is now Guerrero,
Coahuila, in the early 18th century (Eaton 1981),
drawing their neophytes in part from this very area.
Thus, in South Texas, the Protohistoric period
seems an apt term for Native American sites dating after Cabeza de Vacaâs unfortunate shipwreck,
and the even more unfortunate arrival of Spaniards
in the 1600s. These initial entries had no lasting
effect on the native groups (unless it was the initial introduction of disease, so rampant in the 18th
century), and left few written records about them.
Strictly speaking, the native cultures at this time are
neither Late Prehistoric nor Historic, and thus despite the views of some colleagues (McGraw et al.
1991:116, 118; Hindes 1995), I think the
Protohistoric is a cultural-historical concept; absolute dates are not significant, but rather it is the
potential to address important issues of culture process that is important about this period. Once we
learn more about this critical time frame, we can
talk with more clarity about the continuity, or lack
thereof, of native culture into the mission setting
(Hester 1989d). For example, given the long tradition of making bone-tempered pottery in South
Texas, extending back to A.D. 800-1000, I think it
is confusing to refer to the mission-era bone-tempered material as "Goliad," unless it has designs or
motifs that are definitely of mission origin. Clearly,
the Toyah ceramic traditions were still in place
south of San Antonio and towards the coast. Such
pottery seems to have disappeared, however, at the
Protohistoric sites in the Chaparrosa Ranch area,
perhaps one reason no bone-tempered ware is
present in the Guerrero missions.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper has attempted to summarize the
present status of research in South Texas prehistory. There are numerous reports in the CRM literature that I have doubtless missed, and I apologize to
their authors for these inadvertent exclusions. Many,
however, contain either negative evidence or limited information, and I simply did not have room,
within the scope of this paper, to include these
results.
The cultural-historical emphasis of much of
this paper provides the only logical way that we
have to organize the available archeological data.
As noted on several occasions, we have few large
projects on which to draw for discussions of settlement, subsistence, and behavioral change (e.g., Hall
et al. 1986; Fox et al. 1974). Other sets of archeological data, such as those from Chaparrosa Ranch,
have been presented in preliminary summaries
(Hester 1978a), but have still not been analyzed in
a complete and comprehensive manner.
An effort was made in the late 1980s to use a
different approach to the synthesis of archeological
information from Central, lower Pecos, and southern Texas (Hester et al. 1989). The Southwest Division Corps of Engineers, working with the Arkansas
Archeological Survey, commissioned overviews of
the major parts of the Southwest and Southern
Plains. The concept of"adaptation types" (Fitzhugh
1975) was employed (Hester 1989e), and while
there were problems with this approach, I think
some useful new viewpoints were obtained.
For example, the "specialized hunter" adaptation type reflected the focus (we assume) of Clovis
and Folsom as well as those of the Toyah horizon
at the other end of the time spectrum. "Holocene
hunters and foragers" encompassed the cultural patterns of South Texas peoples from Late Paleoindian
times up through the Late Holocene, including the
early Late Prehistoric and the Protohistoric. Lumping the archeological phenomena of southern Texas
into these broad groups does have a certain appeal!
However, to look at issues like climate change,
shifts in resource focus, and the spread of horizons
(or ethnic groups/phases), we still must press on
with obtaining the empirical data so badly needed
for future progress in understanding the ancient
cultures of this region. We do not have enough
substantive information to enter even a simple debate over whether these peoples were "collectors"

Hester ~ The Prehistory of South Texas
or "foragers" (cf. Bettinger 1991; see also Bousman
et al. 1990). Using the geoarcheological approach
has much potential for understanding site formation processes. Improved data recovery methods,
such as fine-mesh water-screening and flotation,
may lead to better samples of botanical remains (as
we are now learning by processing old soil samples
from Central Texas burned rock middens; Stephen
L. Black, personal communication, 1995). Longterm microwear research of lithic tools, with experimental components, is vital; casual observations
and ruminations about edge-beveling and function
are no longer sufficient to study the use and curation
of tools. Ethnohistoric research pioneered by T. N.
Campbell needs to be continued through careful
scholarship. Yet with this, and more, in the final
appraisal, we need more well excavated, stratified
sites, and more chronometfic dates for associated
cultural and ecological remains.
