ABSTRACT
On November 12 and 13 of 2009, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, at the request
of Othon, Inc. Consulting Engineers, conducted an archaeological assessment including
archival research, mechanical scraping, and deep testing within property proposed as new
right-of-way for the expansion of Garth Road near the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery
in Baytown, Texas. The Harris County Public Infrastructure Department – Architecture and
Engineering Division has been identified as the Lead Agency for this project. Work for this
project will be completed under APIN 08102M00E5.
The goal of the investigation was to determine whether unmarked human burials associated
with the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery may be located within the proposed right-ofway along Garth Road. The Area of Potential Effect for this project includes 178x3 meters
(585x10 feet) made up of proposed road right-of-way subsuming 0.05 hectares (0.13 acres)
located within 15 meters (50 feet) of the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery. Anticipated
impacts to the Area of Potential Effect will generally extend to shallow depths typical of road
improvement projects.
The investigations discussed in this report took place on easements that will be acquired by the
Harris County Public Infrastructure Department – Architecture and Engineering Division.
Work conducted to complete this survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
number 5450, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s Division of Archeology in
November of 2009.
Although the boundary of the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery is not located within the
Area of Potential Effect, mechanical scraping and deep testing were conducted within all of the
proposed right-of-way within 15 meters (50 feet) of the cemetery. These activities confirmed
that undocumented burials are not present within the proposed right-of-way and that the
Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery will not be affected by the proposed project. In
addition, no new or previously identified sites were recorded as a result. Based on the negative
results of the investigation, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further work and that the
project be allowed to proceed as planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On November 12 and 13 of 2009, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, (HRA Gray & Pape) of Houston,
Texas, at the request of Othon, Inc. Consulting Engineers, conducted an archaeological
assessment including archival research, mechanical scraping, and deep testing within property
proposed as new right-of-way (ROW) for the expansion of Garth Road near the Earthman
Memory Gardens Cemetery in Baytown, Texas. The Harris County Public Infrastructure
Department – Architecture and Engineering Division (HCPID-AED) has been identified as the
Lead Agency for this project. Work for this project will be completed under HCPID-AED
APIN 08102M00E5.
The goals of the investigation were to determine if the initiation of this project would affect
undocumented graves associated with the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery. The
archaeological assessment completed for the area discussed in this report took place on
property to be acquired by the HCPID-AED. Work conducted to complete this investigation
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 5450, issued by the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Division of Archeology in November of 2009. All fieldwork and
reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas 1969, as
amended in 1997) guidelines as set forth by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA).

1.1

Project Description

The project area can be located on the Mont Belvieu 7.5-minute United States Geological
Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map (Figure 1). The project will include expanding
the current roadway from two lanes to five lanes using the curb and gutter system with
belowground storm water drains along Garth Road between Wallisville Road and Farm to
Market Road (FM) 1942 (Figure 1). Located near the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery,
the existing Garth Road ROW is 24 meters (80 feet) wide. The HCPID-AED proposes to
expand the roadway by adding 3 meters (10 feet) of new ROW on the east and west sides of
the roadway to create a typical 30-meter (100-foot) wide ROW.
The Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery is located approximately 18 meters (60 feet) east of
the existing Garth Road ROW and 15 meters (50 feet) east of the new proposed ROW. The
proposed ROW measures 3 meters (10 feet) wide, is nearly level, is covered with St.
Augustine grass, and is flanked on either side by slopes exceeding 30% that lead to manmade
drainageways. On the western side slope of the proposed ROW is a marked buried fiber-optic
cable and two overhead utility poles. The existing ROW, including a shallow roadside ditch, is
located west of the buried fiber-optic cable. East of the proposed ROW is a 3-meter (10-foot)
wide deeper drainage way maintained by the San Jacinto River Authority (SJRA). This
drainage way holds water and contains cord grasses and other low, dense vegetation
commonly found in wetlands. The SJRA drainage way is flanked by the cemetery’s western
boundary marked by a dense hedge row.

A review of construction plans provided by the HCPID-AED at the time of the permit
application indicates that the proposed Area of Potential Effect (APE) subject to investigation
is the 178x3-meter (585x10-foot) swath of proposed ROW situated between the drainage ditch
within the existing ROW and the SJRA drainage way just west of the cemetery boundary (see
Figure 1). The APE for this project encompasses 0.05 hectares (0.13 acres). The APE
generally extends to shallow depths typical of road improvement projects.

2.0 NATURAL SETTING
2.1

Physiography and Geomorphology

The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north
as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland
areas, which includes Harris County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers. Locally, Harris County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and
unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van
Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (Abbott 2001; Barnes 1982;
Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in modern-day
Harris County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to predate human
occupation in the region, the so-called “Deweyville Terraces”, stratigraphically positioned
between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. Quaternary Beaumont Formation underlies the
project area (Barnes 1982). These deposits are made up of clay, silt, and sand. This includes
stream channel, point bar, natural levee, back swamp, and mud flat deposits (Barnes 1982).
The date of deposition for the Deweyville Terraces is not known. However, Abbott (2001:16)
among others believes the north-south oriented terraces aggraded during the Late Pleistocene
from overbank deposition of rivers and streams including the ancient Brazos River prior to the
beginning of the Holocene. Abbott suggests that aggradation ended by approximately 20,000
years before present (B.P.) (Abbott 2001:106). However, meanders of rivers including the
Brazos cut valleys through these terraces regularly during the Holocene and then abandoned
them. This process leaves large, flat, open, and well drained areas favored for campsites.
While all depositional facies other than channels have the potential to preserve archaeological
sites, behaviorally, human activity favors well drained, sandy channel-proximal localities over
floodbasin muds (Abbott 2001:126).

2.2 Soils
Soils recorded within the tract of land consist of Bernard clay loam and Lake Charles clay, 0
to 1% slopes (Wheeler 1976), both of which are described as having a low geoarchaeological
potential for containing intact cultural deposits (Abbott 2001).
Bernard loam has a very dark gray clay loam surface layer. The next layer consists of a very
dark gray clay upper layer and a dark gray clay lower layer. The following layer is gray clay
with yellowish brown mottles. Addicks, Beaumont, Clodine, Lake Charles, and Midland soils
are included with this soil and makes up less than 15% of this mapped area (Wheeler 1976).

Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1% slopes have a surface layer with a black clay upper layer and the
lower layer very dark gray clay. The next layer is dark gray clay. Below that is gray clay
mottled with yellowish brown and olive brown. Addicks, Beaumont, Bernard, Midland, and
Vamont soils are included with this soil and makes up less than 10% of this mapped area
(Wheeler 1976).

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
3.1

Prehistoric Overview

The oldest prehistoric sites in Harris County can be found around Clear Lake, and date to
approximately 4,000 B.C. placing them in the latter part of the Early Archaic. Prehistoric
archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain tend to be
composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation episodes. In
general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface
deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed stratigraphic
archaeological context.
The primary problem facing researchers working on prehistoric sites in this region stems from
a dearth of cleanly stratified deposits. Environmental conditions leading to slow soil
development combined with rapid urbanization in many areas of southeast Texas have
complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing
chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations formerly inhabiting this area.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material counts
and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are generally
considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas. Within the
base camps distinct activity loci are present (Patterson 1995). Historic sites near the project
area typically consist of farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth
centuries.

3.2

Historic Development of Harris County, Texas

Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The county was
renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John Richardson Harris, an early pioneer who had
established Harrisburgh in 1826, the first town site in the county. Harrisburgh was established
at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and Brays Bayou and by the 1830s had become the major
port of entry for the region and a transportation hub. Roads ran northwest to the Brazos
communities of San Felipe and Washington, east to the ferry landing that crossed the San
Jacinto, and west paralleling Brays Bayou to the Oyster Creek Community near present day
Stafford in Fort Bend County (Henson 2009).
Under Mexican rule, the area surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by 1832) was
known as the San Jacinto District. The district stretched east from Lynchburg on the San
Jacinto River, west to the location of present day Richmond, and from Clear Creek in the
south to Spring Creek in the north. Harrisburg County encompassed this same territory with
the addition of Galveston Island. The modern boundaries of Harris County were established in
1838 (Henson 2009).

6

The lands that would become Harris County comprised the southeastern border of Austin’s
Colony. In July of 1824, 29 titles were granted to lands in future Harris County, with an
additional 23 grants made between 1828 and 1833. These original grants concentrated mainly
on the watercourses of the region. The early settlers in the region were mostly from the
southern United States who brought with them their African slaves. In the 1840s, large
numbers of German and French immigrants settled in Harris County. The Hispanic presence in
the region was relatively sparse prior to an influx of immigrants following the Mexican
Revolution reflecting the ephemeral nature of Spanish and Mexican colonization (Henson
2009).
3.2.1

Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery

The Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery is also called Baytown Memory Gardens and the
Baytown Memorial Cemetery. The cemetery is one of ten Houston locations founded by the
Earthman family that provides funeral directors and operating cemeteries. The Earthman
Funeral Directors and Cemeteries Company was family owned and operated by the Earthman
family until the company was purchased in 1994 by the Alderwoods Group, North America’s
second largest provider of funeral, cremation, and cemetery services.
In the 1880s James Bradshaw Earthman, Sr. was a blacksmith and livery stable owner in
Taylor, Texas when he found himself assisting families with funeral services (Earthman
Funeral Directors and Cemeteries 2009). In 1904, Earthman, Sr. moved to Houston and
opened a business known as Earthman and McCarty Undertaking Company with friend and
railroad surveyor J.C. McCarty. In the 1920s, McCarty died and the company was renamed the
J.B. Earthman Company. In 1931, Earthman, Sr. passed away and eldest son James B.
Earthman, Jr. took over the company. Leaving behind a lucrative career in architecture,
Earthman, Jr. and his wife Blanche continued the company and built the Earthman Funeral
Directors and Cemeteries Company (Earthman Funeral Directors and Cemeteries 2009),
which was family owned until its acquisition by Alderwoods Group.
Little to no information could be found concerning when the Earthman Memory Gardens
Cemetery in Baytown along Garth Road was established. The Baytown location does not
provide funerary services, rather it is only a well-maintained, active cemetery. The cemetery
appears to have been first in use beginning around the 1940s, based on the earliest dates of
bereavement depicted on headstones within the cemetery.
Using information provided online by the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, it was determined
that the cemetery was surveyed in 2005 by an unknown agency recorded as “RHA” and was
assigned Recorded Texas Cemetery number HR-C185 (THC 2005). At that time the surveyor
recorded approximately 1000 burials within the cemetery. The cemetery primarily contains
individuals of Asian, European, and Mexican descent. Many United States military service
veterans and Freemasons are among those buried at Earthman Memorial.

4.0 METHODOLOGY
4.1

Site File and Literature Review

Background archival research was conducted at various locations in order to gather the most
complete record possible of the land use history of the APE and of the Earthman Memory
Gardens Cemetery. Facilities that were visited include the Harris County Clerk’s Office, the
Clayton Genealogical Library, and the Texas Room located in the Julia Ideson Building of the
Houston Public Library. Numerous attempts were also made to review available records and
maps housed onsite at the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery.
In addition, general archaeology site file research was initiated by reviewing records
maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, and by
consulting on-line research archives maintained by the THC. Research was conducted within a
1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the project area to identify all previously recorded
archaeological sites, historical markers, and historic structures eligible for the National
Register. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the investigation. There
are no previously recorded archeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project
area.
4.1.1

Assessment of the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery Boundary

The Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery is located immediately east of the archaeological
APE. The western cemetery boundary, marked by a dense hedge row, is located approximately
15 meters (50 feet) east of the proposed Garth Road ROW. Although no belowground
construction or new ROW is planned within 15 meters (50 feet) of the marked cemetery
boundary, HRA Gray & Pape’s archival research was unsuccessful in confirming the absence
of graves within the proposed ROW. Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape conducted mechanical
scraping and deep testing within the proposed ROW adjacent to the cemetery. Prior to
beginning the investigation, a scope of work to conduct mechanical scraping was coordinated
through appropriate THC representatives.
The proposed ROW measures 178x3 meters (585x10 feet) and is located along the east side of
Garth Road between two manmade drainage ways opposite of the cemetery boundary. The
proposed ROW was divided into 2 areas called the North Scrape Area and the South Scrape
Area. The North Scrape Area contained 3 block areas while the South Scrape Area contained 2
block areas. Each block area was subjected to shallow mechanical scraping to approximately
65 centimeters (26 inches) below the surface. Scraping was conducted in controlled 10centimeter (4-inch) levels to avoid buried utilities. The exposed surfaces were examined via
pedestrian inspection and soil probing to check for variations in color, compaction, and texture
possibly indicative of backfilled grave shafts. Photographs of the exposed surfaces were
captured.

8

Once the exposed surfaces were verified for the absence of grave shafts, a series of deep linear
trenches within the North and South Scrape Areas were excavated to confirm the absence of
burials. The North Scrape Area contained 2 trenches (North Trenches 1 and 2), while the
South Scrape Area contained 3 trenches (South Trenches 1, 2, and 3). Deep tests were
excavated along the length of the proposed ROW and were oriented north northwest by south
southeast. Each trench was mechanically excavated to approximately 2 meters (7 feet) in
depth. The exposed walls of each deep test were examined for variations in color, compaction
and texture, possibly indicative of backfilled grave shafts, as well as for materials associated
with burials such as bone, metal fragments, wood, and fabric.
Following all excavations, a series of representative photographs of the exposed walls and
scraped surfaces were captured. In addition, polygons of each scraped block area and trench
were recorded using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) recording device with submeter accuracy. Upon completion, all excavated areas were backfilled and smoothed to normal
surface conditions.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
5.1

Results of Site File and Literature Review

As discussed above, various facilities that maintain archival records were visited to collect the
most complete record possible of the land use history of the APE and of the Earthman
Memory Gardens Cemetery. However, all searches at these locations were insufficient to
confirm the absence of graves outside of the current cemetery boundary. In addition, attempts
to obtain records from the cemetery owners were unsuccessful.
In addition, a preliminary search of the online Texas Archaeological Atlas and a review of The
Handbook of Texas Online indicate that no historic events or historic individuals are likely to
be associated with the project area. Also, no previously recorded archaeological sites are
located within the APE.
Three previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the project area (see Figure 1). Two of these surveys were performed by HRA Gray
& Pape between the years of 2004 and 2007 on behalf of the Texas Water Development Board
and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (see Figure 1). Neither survey resulted in the
identification of new archaeological resources, nor were previously recorded sites located
within the project areas (Carper and Hughey 2004; Sick and Soltysiak 2007). Another
previously conducted survey was completed at the behest of the Federal Highways
Administration (FHWA) in 1988. This survey also produced negative findings.

5.2

Results of Field Investigations

Mechanical scraping was conducted within a total area covering 178x3 meters (585x10 feet)
within the proposed ROW on the east side of Garth Road. However, the presence of a fiberoptic cable and overhead utility poles prohibited the scraping effort from occurring within the
entire swath.
The cemetery driveway divided the APE into block areas called the North Scrape Area and
South Scrape Area. The North Scrape Area contained 3 block scrape areas subjected to
shallow scraping and 2 linear trenches (North Trenches 1 and 2) that were subjected to deep
investigation. The South Scrape Area contained 2 large block scrape areas and 3 linear
trenches, labeled South Trenches 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 2).
Approximately 90% of the North and South Scrape Areas were investigated by scraping and
subsequent deep testing. As planned, the block scrape areas were excavated to a maximum
depth of 65 centimeters (26 inches) below the ground surface, which was recognized as the
natural ground surface based on the presence of intact well-formed sediments.

Fill was not found over the entire surface as was anticipated based on the presence of the
roadside ditch and SJRA drainage way. The only location containing fill was the northeastern
edge of the North Scrape Area. It is suspected that fill was used to mitigate erosion of the
north and central portions of the SJRA drainage way (see Figure 2). The suspected erosion
was likely caused by past episodes of flooding resulting from a bottleneck of rushing storm
water into the narrow pipe culvert. As a result of the scraping activity, the natural ground
surface observed within each scraped block area, although undulating, was most commonly
composed of homogenous, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay to clay loam (Munsell 2005).
Trenching activities revealed the clay loam continued to a depth of approximately 120
centimeters (48 inches) where calcium carbonate inclusions were common. At this depth the
clay loam gradually diffuses into a massive layer of light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay
(Munsell 2005) to the depth where trenching was terminated at approximately 2 meters (7
feet) below the surface. At this depth, water seepage from the SJRA drainage way was noticed
percolating in from the eastern walls.
As a result of mechanical scraping no grave shafts or grave materials were recorded. In
addition, none of the deep linear tests contained any evidence of human interment.
Representative photographs of the scraped/deep tested areas are included on Figure 2 above.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an archaeological assessment including mechanical
scraping and deep testing to confirm the absence of potentially unmarked graves within new
proposed ROW along Garth Road near the Earthman Memory Gardens Cemetery in Baytown,
Texas. The project APE is 0.05 hectares (0.13 acres) composed new proposed ROW. The entire
project area was subjected to the archaeological investigation techniques described in Chapter
4.0. The Lead Agency for this project is the HCPID-AED. All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state guidelines under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5450.
Controlled mechanical scraping and deep trenching within the proposed ROW confirmed that
graves are not located within the proposed ROW associated with the expansion of Garth Road.
Although archival records did not indicate whether graves associated with the Earthman
Memory Gardens Cemetery were ever interred at this location, this archaeological
investigation has confirmed that the cemetery is limited to within its current western boundary
as defined by the presence of a dense hedge row.
Therefore, no human burials will be affected by the proposed project. In addition, no new
archaeological sites were recorded during the investigation. Based on these results, HRA Gray
& Pape recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
