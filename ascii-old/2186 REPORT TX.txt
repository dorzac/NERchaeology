MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
At the request of Cimarex Energy Co. (Cimarex), Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc.
(Lone Mountain) conducted an intensive cultural resource survey of a portion of an access road and
flowline corridor associated with the proposed Foxx 31 Southern Pipeline, which spans New
Mexico and Texas lands. The area of potential effect of this portion of the proposed pipeline
traverses private lands immediately south of the New Mexico-Texas border fenceline. The Bureau of
Land Management-Carlsbad Field Office (BLM-CFO) Archaeologist, Bruce Boeke, required
clearance for this portion of access road and flowline (located in Texas) as part of the proposed
Foxx 31 Southern Pipeline on the New Mexico side of the state line.
The archaeologists performing this work included Field Supervisor Thoras R. Dye, and took place
on August 29, 2016. Douglas Boggess is the Principal Investigator. The survey was conducted
according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas, published by the Texas
Historical Commission. The work performed consisted of pedestrian survey.
The project area is within Township 1S, Block 59, Section 6 and Block 60, Section 1. This surveyed
area can be found on the Owl Hills, TX-NM, 1973 7.5â USGS Quadrangle, and comprises 11.92 ac
(4.82 ha) of private lands in Culberson County, Texas. The surveyed corridor was 130 ft wide (39.6
m) and 4,061.94 ft (1,038.08 m) long. The corridor width includes a 30 ft ROW with a 50-ft cultural
buffer on each side.
Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1
mile of the survey corridor. Two surveys and two previously recorded sites (41CU316 and
41CU317) were identified within the search parameters; the sites are located between 0.7 and 1.1 mi
southwest of the current proposed undertaking.
A single isolated manifestation was the only cultural resource encountered during this survey. This
resource has been completely recorded and no further work is deemed necessary. This project will
therefore have no effect on any cultural resources.
DESCRIPTION OF UNDERTAKING
Cimarex proposes to install three buried steel gas pipelines (one 12-in, one 8-in, one 4-in) within a
single excavated corridor, to be accompanied by a two-track access road for the proposed Foxx 31
Southern Pipeline, which spans New Mexico and Texas. This pipeline will begin at the existing Foxx
31 Federal Com 1H wellpad on BLM lands in New Mexico and terminate at an existing riser, located
in T1S, Block 59, Section 6 in Texas. The portion of the line falling within Texas is 4,061.94 ft long
and will be placed within a 30-ft ROW. The area of potential effect in Texas covers 2.79 ac (1.13 ha).
The plat for this undertaking can be found in Appendix A.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is within Township 1S, Block 59, Section 6, and Block 60, Section 1. This surveyed
area can be found on the Owl Hills, TX-NM, 1973 7.5â USGS Quadrangle, and comprises 11.92 ac
(4.82 ha) of private lands in Culberson County, Texas. The surveyed corridor was 130 ft wide (39.6
m) and 4,061.94 ft (1,038.08 m) long. The corridor width includes a 30-ft ROW with a 50-ft cultural
buffer on each side (Figures 1.1 and Appendix A.1).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project is located 0.35 mi east of Owl Spring on a small bench-like area. The ground
slopes to the north-northwest at 3 to 5 degrees, and the survey corridor crosses several small
drainages. Surface visibility is 80 percent, with very sparse vegetation consisting of creosote,
mesquite, narrow-leaf yucca, tarbrush, Christmastree cholla, allthorn, broom snakeweed, and various
forbs and grasses. Elevation ranges from 3,175 ft to 3,210 ft amsl.
In some portions of the survey corridor, gypsiferous paleosol and gypsum bedrock have been
exposed due to extensive slopewash and wind erosion. The area has also been affected by fenceline
construction, previous pipeline construction, and off-road vehicle usage along the fenceline and the
previously constructed pipeline.
The project area falls within the Chihuahuan Desert. The average daily maximum temperature is 76
degrees Fahrenheit and the average daily minimum temperature is 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The
average annual precipitation is 7.7 inches, ranging from a low of 0.1 inches in April to a high of 1.4
inches in August (USDA 1980). The Chihuahuan Desert differs from its western neighbor, the
Sonoran Desert, in the absence of double maxima of precipitation, limiting rainfall to a single wet
season. Brown (1994) characterizes vegetation in the area as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, which often
consists of various cacti, mesquite, creosote, and dropseed grasses.
Soils are Hollebeke-Pokorny complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes, with Dellahunt-Neimahr-Joberanch
complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes occurring along drainages. Hollebeke-Pokorny complex, 1 to 8
percent slopes is a gypsiferous silt loam that occurs on hills as residuum weathering from the
underlying gypsum. Dellahunt-Neimahr-Joberanch complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes is a loamy
alluvium, also derived from gypsum and found in alluvial flats.
METHODS
This survey was conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for
Texas, published by the Texas Historical Commission. Data for this project was gathered employing
traditional pedestrian survey methodology. One hundred-percent survey coverage was accomplished
by the archaeologists walking 15-m interval transects. All artifacts and features identified by the
archaeologists were recorded. A photo log and feature log were maintained.
Shovel tests were to be excavated in settings that had potential for buried cultural materials and in
places that had a low surface visibility due to excessive vegetation. According to the survey
standards, shovel tests would be at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and were excavated to the
bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible. They would be excavated in levels no thicker than 20 cm,
with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh.
Given the exposed gypsum bedrock and 80 percent surface visibility, there was no need for shovel
tests during this survey.

When cultural remains predating 1960 were encountered, a determination was made as to whether
they were an isolated occurrence or a site. Especially intensive low-interval survey was to have been
conducted in areas where previously recorded sites were expected within or near the project area.

Isolate Definition
Isolated manifestations are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of
single artifacts or artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are
indicative of a single or unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited
context and cannot be related to other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated
occurrences are generally 50 years old or older, although Lone Mountain may record more recent
materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences
were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence form, a GPS reading was
taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.

Site Definition
Sites are defined as any physical location of past human activities or events. Cultural resource sites
are extremely variable in size, and range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures

with associated objects and features. A site may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource
remains. Features such as hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe,
fire-cracked rock concentrations, cists, corrals, and rock art are generally recorded as sites. Sites also
include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to specified social or cultural
groups. Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old, unless it can be demonstrated that a property has
achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years (Criterion Consideration G).

Site Recording
If sites were encountered, boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and
features were marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked
cultural materials. Sites were recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was
drawn of each site, and site locations were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. GPS
readings were taken to verify the accuracy of the field plot and were taken from a datum located on
each sketch map. Photographs were taken showing the setting of each site and any unique or
representative features. A representative sample of artifacts from each site was recorded using Lone
Mountain artifact analysis forms. Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools were made.
Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were employed
to determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned
rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials.

Evaluation and Eligibility
If encountered, sites were to be further evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility status. The key
criterion for most prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to
future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often
dependent on the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of
buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as noted above. Observations were noted
regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several characteristics. For example,
indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along road cuts and
arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.
Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that
eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural
materialâ is used, the term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment
where burial, deflation, and reburial of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few
years, evidence for buried cultural material is not necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural
material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of sites. However, even a deflated site
may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more than 100 artifacts are
present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The
relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

Archival Research
Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the NRHP on
August 29, 2016 to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mi of the survey

corridor. Two previously recorded sites, 41CU316 and 41CU317 are located 0.7 mi and 1.1 mi to the
southwest (respectively) along an existing pipeline road. The TARL site atlas map can be found in
Appendix A.
Boone Archaeology conducted a pipeline survey in the area for DCP Midstream in 2010, finding no
cultural resources and Lone Mountain conducted a surface flowline and access road survey in 2014,
finding only an isolated manifestation (a chert scraper).
LOCATED RESOURCES
Lone Mountain found no cultural resources within the surveyed area.
EVALUATION OF PROPERTIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary of Cultural Resources and Management Recommendations
Clearance for the undertaking is recommended as no cultural resources will be affected. If buried
cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should
cease immediately, and the Texas State Historic Office and the Bureau of Land ManagementCarlsbad Field Office should be notified.
