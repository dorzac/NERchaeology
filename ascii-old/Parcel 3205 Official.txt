Abstract
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of approximately 2.36 hectares (5.89 acres) of private property known as Parcel 3205 in
Chambers County, Texas. The owner of this property has requested FEMA assistance with
private property debris removal (PPDR).
The Lead Federal Agency for the project is FEMA. The goals of the cultural resources
survey were to determine if the debris removal activities would affect any historic properties
located on this parcel as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800).
There is a single previously recorded archaeological site located on Parcel 3205. Site
41CH222 was originally identified as a shell midden that contained lithic and ceramic artifacts.
As PPDR is proposed to take place in the immediate vicinity of this site, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) requested FEMA to conduct limited shovel testing and a walkover survey at
this location.
Site 41CH222 is a small midden deposit that is in the vicinity of multiple other midden
deposits. Limited shovel testing was conducted within the site area. However, a single shovel
test yielded multiple ceramic types. It is likely that additional shovel testing would also yield
cultural material. As the culture history of the region is sparse and not well documented, it is
probable that Site 41CH222 could yield data that would be relevant within the regional context.
Therefore, FEMA has determined that this site may possess the qualities of significance and may
be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
On April 20 through 23, 2009, debris was removed from Parcel 3205. In order to ensure
that no heavy equipment was used and the site boundaries were respected, a FEMA Historic
Preservation Specialist was present on the parcel for the entire time debris was removed. No
heavy equipment was used within the boundaries of Site 41CH222. Any debris removed from
the site area was removed by hand to prevent any disturbance of the ground surface within the
identified site boundaries. No cultural material or evidence of cultural features was identified as
a result of the PPDR process. All work associated with PPDR has been completed, and no
further work is recommended for this parcel.

Introduction
On March 17 and 18, 2009, FEMA Historic Preservation Specialists performed an
intensive pedestrian survey of a privately owned parcel, Parcel 3205, in Chambers County,
Texas. The landowner has requested FEMA assistance to fund the removal of debris from this
privately owned parcel. The Lead Federal Agency for the project is FEMA. As the survey was
conducted entirely on privately owned property, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) was defined as all 2.36 hectares (5.89 acres)
of property associated with the parcel.
The goal of the cultural resources survey was to determine if the activities required to
complete the debris removal would affect historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800).

Project Area
Parcel 3205 is located on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Anahuac 7.5Â­
minute topographic quadrangle in Chambers County, Texas. The parcel is located on Turtle
Bayou. It is bounded on the west by Turtle Bayou, on the east by Highway 563, and on the north
and south by private residential parcels (Figures 1 and 2). The Area of Potential Effect for this
undertaking will be the entirety of Parcel 3205, which consists of 2.36 hectares (5.89 acres) of
land.

Natural Setting
Geology and Physiography
Chambers County lies within the Beaumont Formation. The Beaumont Formation
consists of sedimentary beds deposited in the Quaternary Period; these beds are less than two
million years old (Texas Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). The Beaumont Formation itself is
thought to be only 30,000 to 37,000 years old (Aronow 1971). The project parcel is contained
with the coastal prairie physiographic region. The Coastal Prairies are composed of nearly level
strata with a maximum elevation of 300 meters (984.2 feet) (Ibid. 1996). This area is a deltaic
plain affected by sea level fall and rise, as well as modern river drainages and deltas (Aten 1983;
17).

Soils
There are three different soil classifications existing in the project area. The flood plain
of Lake Anahuac is characterized as Harris Clay (USDA 2006). Harris Clay is a very poorly
drained, very slowly permeable soil found in Gulf Coast Marsh and tidal flats. A surface layer of
very dark clay is typically underlain with a subsoil of the same texture mottled with brown clay.
The subsoil is light gray clay with gray and brown mottles. Finally, the substratum is light gray
clay.
The remaining soil types are Vamont Clays. The sloped banks rising up from Turtle
Bayou are categorized as Vamont Clay (VaB) with 0-5% slopes. This levels off to Vamont Clay
(VaA) with 0-1% slopes. This soil is a somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soil. It
commonly underlies Pine Flatwoods or mixed oak and piney woods. The surface of this soil
type is normally brown clay with red mottles. It is followed by a subsoil of yellowish brown and
light gray clay with red mottles, becoming gray and yellowish brown clay. Lower subsoil layers
are gray clay with red and brown mottles followed by grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown
and red clay. The USDA soil survey indicates that Vamont soil is prone to rutting and
compaction when the soil is wet, and the high water table inhibits root growth and trees can be
uprooted easily in this soil (USDA 2006).

Hydrology
The project parcel is located within the Lower Trinity River watershed. Specifically, it
lies on the eastern edge of Lake Anahuac, southeast of the mouth of Turtle Bayou. In the 1930s
damming upriver caused the level of Lake Anahuac to rise, submerging large portions of the
original bank line. The western portions of the parcel are located directly on the floodplain of
Lake Anahuac.

Culture History
The Trinity River Delta is located within the Upper Texas Coast. While some work has
been done within the region (Aten 1983, Ambler 1970, 1973, Shafer 1966), the resulting ceramic
assemblage has not been adequately defined with the context of surrounding cultural regions
such as the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Eastern Woodland traditions. Some (Story 1990)
see the assemblage as distinct, while others see influence and dissemination of style from the
surrounding regions (Aten 1983, Shafer 1977).
There has not been a large collection of data from the Archaic Period in southeast Texas.
Several shell midden sites have been identified within the region (Patterson 1980), but have been
difficult to verify and evaluate (Aten 1983; 49). Much of the Archaic Period coastline is
believed to be underwater, preventing archaeologists from examining sites of this period (Aten
1983; 124).
The Ceramic Period began around A.D. 100, but was delayed inland by several centuries
as the technology slowly diffused from coastal areas (Patterson 1995, Aten 1983). Most of the
ceramics of this period were either untempered or grog tempered. Approximately 700 A.D,
further advances in technology can be observed. Sandy paste ceramics and the use of the bow
marked this transition (Ricklis 2004; Strong 1990). In the Galveston Bay area it also
corresponds with the appearance of Baytown Plain ceramics (Aten 1983; 299). Aten created a
chronology of ceramics for this period, consisting of the Clear Lake (A.D. 100-425), Mayes
Island (A.D. 425-650), Turtle Bay (A.D. 650-1000), Round Lake (A.D. 1000-1350), and Old
River (A.D. 1350-1700).
Alternatively, the Mossy Grove Tradition (100-1700 A.D.) was defined as a regional
variation that encompasses the area between the Brazos and the Neches or Sabine Rivers (Story
1990). Cultural material associated with Mossy Grove sites includes Goose Creek Plain
ceramics and limited lithic types.
The French explorers were the first to make contact with local Native Americans in the
Galveston Bay area. In 1721, De Bellisle described encountering a band of about 200 Native
Americans living on the bay. De Bellisleâs counterpart, Du Pratz, described them as Attakapa
(Folmer 1940), but it is generally believed these were in fact Akokisa (Bolton 1913, Morfi 1932,
Aten 1983). The Akokisa were variously described as fishing, gathering eggs, and going inland
to prairies to hunt bison and fight enemies (Folmer 1940). Contact with the Europeans brought
sickness and war and greatly decreased the Akokisa population. While Akokisa were reported to
be living on the mouth of the Trinity River as late as 1830, they are generally believed to have
ceased to exist as a separate group around that time (Padilla 1919). It is believed the remaining
Akokisa were absorbed into the Bidai located to the north of their territories (Dyer 1916,
Berlandier 1905).
Historically, the Town of Anahuac was originally called Perryâs Point, after Henry Perry.
He was a leader of the Gutierrez-Magee expedition in 1815. Perry led a group of 300 soldiers

6

out of New Orleans with the intention of attacking the Spanish in the Bolivar Peninsular to the
South. He used Anahuac as a winter camp in 1816 and thus the name was established.
Established in 1824, Anahuac became part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas (Rowe 1903:
270). Shortly thereafter in 1825 the Wallis brothers arrived and established Wallisville
northwest of the project parcel. In 1827, John Taylor White arrived at Turtle Bayou and
established one of the first cattle ranches in Texas, where his âwagons bogged down in the rich,
black earthâ (Harry 1939). These families were among the steady influx of Anglos into the
region during the 1820s.
In 1830, the Mexican government under General Manuel de Mier y Teran established a
fort at Anahuac, and began to levy taxes. This move was unpopular with the Anglo settlers, and
Chambers County became the scene of the Anahuac Disturbances of 1832. This began when the
Mexican commander of Fort Anahuac, Lieutenant Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn, arrested
William Travis and Patrick Jack, sent to Anahuac to recover slaves escaped from Louisiana now
in the employment of Bradburn. This act was the tipping point of anger for the local citizenry
against the Centrist Bradburn (Haley 2006). When the Anglo citizenry attempted to retrieve
Travis and Jack from the hands of Bradburn at Anahuac, they were involved in skirmishes with
the Mexican troops and manage to capture Bradburnâs cavalry force on the way there. After
coming to an agreement of exchange of prisoners, they retreated to the crossing of Turtle Bayou
and the farm of John Taylor White. When Bradburn refused to release his prisoners, the Turtle
Bayou Resolutions were drafted at this location. This incident led to the removal of the fort
commander Bradford and the Mexican troops there. This incident is widely considered to be one
of the first acts of the Texas Revolution (Baker 1880).
After Texas independence was established, Anahuac became the focus of another dispute;
this time involving General Thomas Jefferson Chambers and Charles Wilcox. The two both
claimed ownership of the town; which Chambers intended to call Chambersea. This was
unpopular and Chambers was assassinated by an unknown assailant in 1865 (Webb and Branda
1952). Chambers County, named after the recently slain general, was established in 1868 from
Liberty and Jefferson counties.
Oil was discovered regionally in 1935, resulting in a small boom in the local economy.
However, the population of Chambers County has never been high. It has continued to grow
steadily, and currently Anahuac has a recorded population of 2,210 in 2000, while the total for
Chambers County is 28,771.

Site 41CH222 is located within the boundaries of Parcel 3205. This site was discovered
by Lawrence Aten in 1971. It consists of a Rangia cuneata shell (95%) and Crassostrea
virginica shell (5%) midden extending about 30 meters (98.4 feet) along the base of the levee
ridge along Turtle Bayou. Aten notes that the midden deposit is approximately 0.6 meters (2
feet) thick and prehistoric ceramics were observed.
A total of two recorded formal surveys have been conducted within 0.8 kilometers (0.5
miles) of the proposed PPDR location. These surveys include a 1976 linear survey conducted by
the EPA-TWDR and a 2008 area survey conducted by GTI Environmental, Inc. Neither of these
surveys documented any new resources.

Research Design and Methodology
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was conducted within a 0.8 kilometers (0.5
mile) study radius of the project parcel to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites,
historical markers and historic structures eligible for National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) listing.
PPDR is proposed to take place on the project parcel. As PPDR activities require the use
of heavy equipment, it is likely that the ground will be disturbed as a result of the debris removal
process. There is a known archaeological site, 41CH222, located on this parcel. The goal of this
survey effort is to determine if the deposits associated with the site retain their integrity, to
determine if culturally diagnostic material is present in subsurface deposits, and to delineate the
site boundaries. The entire project parcel was subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources
survey. Archaeological investigations included a combination of surface (pedestrian survey) and
subsurface (shovel testing) testing methods.
9

The project area was surveyed along a series of transects spaced 30 meters (98.4 feet)
apart. Transects in the survey area were surveyed from east to west. Texas minimum survey
standards call for two shovels tests per 0.4 hectares (one acre) in projects from 1.21 to 4.05 hectares
(three to ten acres) in size. For this survey, a total of 21 shovel tests were planned for excavation.
A 30-meter (98.4-foot) interval was used between each shovel test.
Excavated shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (19.7 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered. Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test
forms for each excavation.
Any cultural material recovered during the survey was documented in the field and was
not collected. Cultural material encountered as a result of this survey was photographed.

Results of Field Investigations
Parcel 3205 can be divided into a lower, floodplain portion and a higher, levee ridge
portion. Vegetation on the lower portion of the parcel consists of cypress trees and moderate
understory. This area is subject to flooding and hydric soils are present within this area. On the
levee ridge portion of Parcel 3205, there are three structures and related shell roads/driveways.
A small drainage runs along the northern boundary of the parcel, fed from a culvert under
Highway 563. The remainder of the parcel has a light cover of pine trees (Figure 4).
Parcel 3205 showed evidence of Rangia cuneata shell deposits on the slope transitioning
between the floodplain and levee ridge on the parcel. The shells in these deposits were bleached
and powdery, indicative of age. Evidence of organic soil also was visible on the surface and in
several rootballs present on the property.
A total of seventeen shovel tests were excavated within the 2.36 hectare (5.89 acre)
parcel (Figure 4). Three of these shovel tests (A-1, B-1, and JTP 1) were positive for shell
midden deposits. In addition, shells were present in one rootball (Figure 5). Based on the
current fieldwork, Site 41CH222 runs along the top of the levee ridge. The site ranges in depth
from 20 to at least 40 centimeters (9 to 18 inches) below surface.
A single shovel test, Shovel Test B-1, yielded cultural material. A total of nine artifacts
were identified from this shovel test. These included six faunal elements (five deer long bone
fragments and a single turtle shell fragment) and three prehistoric ceramic sherds. The sherds
represented three different ceramic types; one Mandeville Plain, one Goose Creek Plain, and one
Tchefuncte Plain (Figure 6). The combination of these three ceramic types suggests that the site
may date to the Clear Lake Period (100-425 A.D.) (Aten 1983). A summary of all shovel test
data is presented in Table 2.

Summary and Recommendations
This document summarizes the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources
survey conducted on 2.36 hectares (5.89 acres) of private property known as Parcel 3205 in
Chambers County, Texas. The owner of this parcel requested assistance from FEMA for PPDR.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature search and site file search to identify any
previously recorded sites that were present on the project parcel.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing of the project parcel.
Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 17 shovel tests with the APE. A single
previously recorded archaeological site was present within the APE.
Site 41CH222 was initially recorded as a shell midden that was present along the natural
levee ridge that overlooks Turtle Bayou. At the time of survey, a total of three shovel tests were
positive for midden deposits and a single shovel test was positive for cultural material. This
cultural material included faunal elements and a total of three prehistoric ceramic sherds. These
sherds represent three different ceramic types including Mandeville Plain, Goose Creek Plain,
and Tchefuncte Plain. The combination of these three ceramic types is generally associated with
the Clear Lake Period (Aten 1983, Ricklis 2004). Soils within the project parcel are substantially
disturbed near the previously constructed house and driveways; soils at the rear of the parcel
where Site 41CH222 is located appear to retain their stratagraphic integrity.

14

Site 41CH222 is a small midden deposit that is in the vicinity of multiple other midden
deposits. Limited shovel testing was conducted within the site area. However, a single shovel
test yielded multiple ceramic types. As the culture history of the region is sparse and not well
documented, it is likely that Site 41CH222 could yield data that would be relevant within the
regional context. Therefore, FEMA has determined that this site may possess the qualities of
significance and may be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
On April 20 through 23, 2009, debris was removed from Parcel 3205. In order to ensure
that no heavy equipment was used and the site boundaries were respected, a FEMA Historic
Preservation Specialist was present on the parcel for the entire time debris was removed. No
heavy equipment was used within the boundaries of Site 41CH222. Any debris removed from
the site area was removed by hand to prevent any disturbance of the ground surface within the
identified site boundaries. No cultural material or evidence of cultural features was identified as
a result of the PPDR process. All work associated with PPDR has been completed, and no
further work is recommended for this parcel.

Single Component: False
Multiple Component: False
Basis for Component: No cultural material identified.

Component Unknown: True

Cultural Features:
Parcel 5707 is a heavily eroded and developed parcel. The parcel can be divided into a lower, floodplain portion
and a higher, levee ridge portion. Vegetation on the lower portion of the parcel consists of cypress trees and
moderate understory. This area is subject to flooding and hydric soils are present within this area. This parcel has
been subjected to a number of construction activities. Buildings on the property include a residential structure with
associated walk and drive ways, as well as a concrete pad. A second smaller structure is located to the north east of
this residence. There are two trailer-type structures also present on the property. The disturbances associated with
these structures and the driveway on this parcel leave little undisturbed, natural ground. A total of four shovel tests
were excavated within the 0.22 hectare (0.55 acre) parcel. One of these, Shovel Test A-2, contained midden
deposits. None of the other excavated shovel tests showed any evidence of midden deposits or cultural material. In
addition to shovel testing, any exposed ground surface and all rootballs were examined for cultural material
Approximate Site Size: None
Basis for Determination: No material encountered.

Basis for Determination: No material encountered.
Thickness of Deposit: None
Basis for Determination: No material encountered.
Artifactual Materials Present:
None.
Discussion of Site:
The rangia shell observed within Shovel Test A-2 was not associated with any cultural material. This shell deposit is
10 centimeters (3.9 inches) in depth and was found in a very limited area. No cultural material was encountered on
the ground surface, in the rootballs, or within any of the excavated shovel tests. It is likely that the construction of the

house, grading of the road/driveway, natural erosion processes, and seasonal inundation have resulted in substantial
disturbances to the parcel. Shovel tests were placed within the parcel in order to delineate this deposit within the
APE. Based on the location of 41CH221, which is located on the adjacent parcel to the north, this midden material
may represent the ephemeral southern terminus of 41CH221. The portion of site 41CH221 located on Parcel 5707 is
shallow and has been substantially disturbed by construction activities. As no cultural material was encountered and
there is no depositional integrity associated with this portion of the 41CH221 site area, FEMA feels that no further
investigation is necessary and work may proceed as planned.
