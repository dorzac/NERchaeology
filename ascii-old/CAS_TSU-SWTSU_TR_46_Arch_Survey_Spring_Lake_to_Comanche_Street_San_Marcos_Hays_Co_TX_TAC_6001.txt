Abstract
Archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State University-San
Marcos conducted an archaeological survey in advance of a 24-inch water main to be installed between
Spring Lake and Comanche Street on behalf of the Capital Improvements Department, City of San
Marcos (City), Hays County, Texas. Work was conducted by Project Archaeologist Amy Benton, and
field crewmembers Senna Thornton-Barnett and Nathanael Stanley under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 6001, assigned to Principal Investigator Carole Leezer.
The area subject to archaeological survey included both the eastern and the western extents of
the proposed water main line, encompassing approximately 0.5 linear miles. The survey revealed a
multicomponent site containing an ephemeral historic trash dump and prehistoric, surface lithic scatter.
These deposits were recorded as archaeological site 41HY484. No intact features or significant cultural
strata were encountered. Therefore, site 41HY484 is considered to lack both significance and integrity.
Accordingly, CAS recommends full regulatory clearance for the project to proceed with respect to
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.

Introduction

Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Pursuant to
Section 191.052, the City is required to notify
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) of
undertakings before breaking ground on state or
local public land. Following coordination with
the THC concerning this undertaking, the THC
determined that the project had the potential to
impact possibly significant cultural resources on
the western and eastern extents of the proposed
route (Figure 3). Therefore, the THC required
the City to perform an archaeological survey of
the western and eastern extents of the proposed
route prior to any ground-disturbing activity.
CAS, on the behalf of the City, conducted an
archaeological survey of the western and eastern
extents of the proposed water main route. All work
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
6001 (Carole Leezer, Principal Investigator) in

On August 2, 2011, archaeologists from
the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at
Texas State University-San Marcos (University)
conducted an archaeological survey of the Spring
Lake to Comanche water main line on behalf of
the Capital Improvements Department of the City
of San Marcos (City). The project area lies within
the city limits of San Marcos, to the north of the
University (Figure 1). The City is proposing to
install a 24-inch water main to be located along
a route lying to the north of the University,
extending between Spring Lake and Comanche
Street (Figure 2).
The City’s standing as a political entity
within the State of Texas means that this proposed
undertaking is subject to the provisions of the

ACT provides some level of protection
for those sites . . . regardless of their size,

(26.2).

Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas, or its political
subdivisions, are protected by the ACT (Texas
Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). ACT Rules
of Practice and Procedure, as defined by the
THC, are explicit about perception and protection
of cultural resources located on State-owned or
controlled land:

As all cultural resources located in, on,
or under State-owned or controlled land are
considered eligible for SAL status, and not all
cultural resources are appropriately designated
as such or directly threatened by development,
the THC has criteria for practically assessing the
significance and/or need for further investigations
under the permit process (Rules and Practice,
Chapter 26.8):

. . . archeological sites and historic
structures on lands belonging to state
agencies or political subdivisions of the
State of Texas are State Archeological
Landmarks or may be eligible to be
designated as landmarks . . . The State of
Texas considers that all publicly owned
archeological sites and historic structures

Marcos Springs emanate to form Spring Lake.
The reliability of the water supply here, together
with readily available chert sources and easy
access to a broad range of floral and animal
resources, has made the Spring Lake vicinity
an attractive one for prehistoric and historic
habitation for several millennia. Prehistoric
occupations have been documented in this area
that extend back at least ca. 11,500 radiocarbon
years before present, the Clovis era (Shiner 1983),
and span in a virtually uninterrupted fashion up to
the present. Considering the project area’s setting
within the fertile San Marcos River Valley, it has
a high likelihood for containing prehistoric or
historic cultural deposits.

Bedrock geology of the region is spatially
complex because of the Balcones Fault Zone.
During the Miocene, tremendous tectonic
activity uplifted regions north and west of the
Balcones Fault over 610 meters (m), or 2,000 feet,
in elevation, resulting in the formation of the
Edwards Plateau. The project area is located on
the southeastern edge of the Balcones Escarpment
of the Edwards Plateau.

Under formatting standards set forth by
the CTA and adopted by the THC, this report
provides a brief overview of the regulatory
requirements for this project (above), defines the
project area setting, outlines regional and local
trends in archaeology, describes the methods
used in gathering data, and presents the results
of the survey. The fieldwork for this project was
performed by CAS archaeologist Amy Benton
with the assistance of field technicians Senna
Thornton-Barnett and Nathanael Stanley.

Soils in the area are part of the ComfortRumple-Eckrant formation and are characterized
by very shallow to moderately deep, undulating
to steep and hilly soils over indurated limestone.
Soils in this area include Doss silty clay (DoC),
Medlin-Eckrant association (MED), and
Comfort-Rock outcrop complex (CrD) (Batte
1984).

Climate and Weather

Project Area Setting

According to weather statistics based on a
30-year record (1951–1980), the mean maximum
temperatures of summers in Hays County are
97° F, with winters possessing a mean minimum
temperatures of 50° F (Bomar 1983). December

The project area is located at the base of
and along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment
adjacent to and within the San Marcos River
Valley, where the perennial freshwater San
4

and January are the only two months on record
that have not had temperatures above 90° F,
whereas freezing temperatures have been
recorded from October through April. The mean
annual precipitation recorded for Hays County is
33.75 inches, with most precipitation occurring in
the late spring and in the early fall (Dixon 2000).
Weather in this region is dynamic and often
marked by severe events in the form of floods and
droughts. With thin soils and high-relief bedrock
topography, the Hill Country is notorious for
flash flooding. Droughts can also be an expected
feature of Central Texas weather; there is not
a decade in the twentieth century that did not
include at least one drought (Bomar 1983:153). At
a greater temporal scale, the region’s climate can
be described as moist with mild winters and long
hot summers, but evidence indicates that climates
are variable as well (Mauldin et al. 2010).

(Ellis et al. 1995). Along the escarpment,
mesquite, post oak, and blackjack oaks interrupt
patches of bluestems, gramas, and many other
types of grass in the Blackland Prairie. These
species are also found with the Edwards Plateau’s
live oak, shinnery oak, junipers, and mesquite
(Gould 1962).

Central Texas Cultural
Chronology
The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not well understood or agreed
upon. However, archaeological deposits indicate
rich cultural development spanning several
millennia. Black (1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and
Collins (1995, 2004) have recently synthesized
available archaeological evidence from the
region. All dates are in the radiocarbon time scale
and given as years before present (BP; i.e., before
1950). Human presence is divided into three
periods: Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic.

Flora and Fauna
Floral and faunal characteristics of both
adjoining environmental regions (Edwards
Plateau and Blackland Prairie) mingle along
the Balcones Escarpment. Blair (1950), calling
this ecotone the Balconian Province, noted that
it contained wildlife from every other region in
the state, and it also contained endemic species.
Typical modern fauna found in the region
includes, armadillo, badger, beaver, black rat,
coyote, crayfish, domestic dog, eastern cottontail,
eastern gray squirrel, eastern wood rat, horse,
muskrat, common opossum, pig, raccoon, red
fox, turkey, western diamondback rattlesnake,
white-tailed deer, and white-tailed jackrabbit,
in addition to bountiful other mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, and fish. In prehistory,
many of the same animals were present, as were
bison and antelope.

Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into three
major temporal stages, the Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage
begins with the earliest known human occupation
of North America and extends to approximately
8800 BP. The Archaic stage follows, extending
from ca. 8800 to 1250 BP. The Late Prehistoric
stage begins ca. 1250 BP and is characterized by
the development of bow and arrow and ceramic
technologies.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dated the
Paleoindian period in Central Texas to 11,500–
8800 BP; The Paleoindian period is futher
divided into Early (ca. 11,500–10,200 BP)
and Late (ca. 10,200–8800 BP) phases. Early

The region’s natural vegetation is generally
a grassland-woodland-shrubland mosaic, where
grasslands separate patches of woody vegetation
5

Paleoindian artifacts are associated with the
Clovis and Folsom cultures and diagnostic items
include fluted, lanceolate projectile points. The
Clovis culture is also characterized by wellmade prismatic blades (Collins 1995; Green
1964). The Early Paleoindian stage is generally
characterized by nomadic cultures that relied
heavily on hunting large game animals (Black
1989). However, recent research has suggested
that early Paleoindian subsistence patterns
were considerably more diverse than previously
thought and included reliance on local fauna,
including turtles (Black 1989; Bousman et al.
2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983;
Lemke and Timperley 2008). Folsom cultures
are considered to be specialized bison hunters,
as inferred from the geographic location and
artifactual composition of sites (Collins 1995).

Early, Middle, and Late Archaic based on Weir’s
(1976) chronology. The Archaic stage marks
several transitions: a shift in hunting focus from
Pleistocene megafauna to smaller animals, the
increased use of plant food resources and use
of ground stones in food processing, increased
implementation of stone cooking technology,
increased use of organic materials for tool
manufacturing and an increase in the number
and variety of lithic tools for woodworking,
the predominance of corner- and side-notched
projectile points, greater population stability
and less residential mobility, and systematic
burial of the dead. However, what appears as
a new emphasis on organic materials in tool
technologies and diet is more likely a reflection
of preservation bias.

Early Archaic

The Late Paleoindian substage occurred
from ca. 10,200 to 8800 BP. Reliable evidence
for these dates was recovered from the WilsonLeonard site, north of Austin (Bousman et
al. 2004; Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard,
archaeologists excavated an occupation known
as Wilson, named for the unique cornernotched projectile point. The dense occupation
also included a human burial (Bousman et al.
2004; Collins 1998). In addition to the Wilson
occupation, Golondrina-Barber and St. Mary’s
Hall components, dating between 9500 and 8800
BP, were excavated. Collins (1995) suggested
the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s
Hall components represent a transitional period
between the Paleoindian and Archaic periods due
to the subtle presence of notched projectile points
and burned-rock cooking features.

Although Collins (1995:383, 2004) argued
that the Early Archaic spanned the period
from 8800 to 6000 BP based on three divisions
of projectile point types, the current project
considers the Early Archaic to have extended
from 8800 to 5800 BP, based on Collins
(1995) and modified by Prewitt (1981, 1985).
This cultural period is distinguished from
previous periods by significant changes in lithic
technology, such as notched projectile points,
specialized tools (e.g., Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces), and dietary adjustment evidenced by the
increased number of ground stone artifacts and
burned rock midden cooking features (Collins
1995; Turner and Hester 1993:246–256). Shifts in
subsistence were the result of a variable climate
and concomitant variation in game resources
(i.e., bison, Dillehay 1974). Collins (1995)
suggested that Early Archaic peoples occupied
the wetter portions of the Edwards Plateau. Early
Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and are seen
across a wide area of Texas and northern Mexico
(Weir 1976). However, Collins (1995:383) noted

Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) has contended that
the Archaic stage in Central Texas lasted
approximately 7500 years, from 8800 to
1200/1300 BP, and has divided the stage into
6

Late Archaic

a concentration of Early Archaic components
along the southeastern margins of the Edwards
Plateau, close to major spring localities such as
in San Marcos.

The Central Texas Late Archaic spanned
the period ca. 4000–1250 BP (Collins 1995:384,
2004). For finer resolution, the current project
divides the Late Archaic period by Johnson
and Goode’s (1994) subperiods: Late Archaic I,
4000–2200 BP; and Late Archaic II, 2200–1250
BP. Sites with ideal stratigraphic separation may
reveal three discernable subperiods for the Late
Archaic (e.g., Prewitt 1981, 1985). Late Archaic
I, according to Johnson and Goode (1994), is
marked by two significant cultural traits: 1) the
billet thinning of bifacial knives and projectile
points leapt forward in artistry and technology;
and 2) the human population appeared to
have increased. Although these patterns vary
considerably through time and from one sub region
to another, they strongly shape the archaeological
record of the Late Archaic. Overall, evidence
suggests an increasingly mesic climate through
the Late Archaic (Collins 1995; Johnson and
Goode 1994; Mauldin et al. 2010). Mauldin et al.
(2010) suggested that climatic variation resulted
in a general decrease in grassland bison range.
Some archaeologists have noted the presence of
cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall
1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) as
evidence that populations indeed increased in size
and that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). However, other archaeologists
have challenged the interpretation of a growing
population by citing a decrease in burned rock
middens (Prewitt 1981:80–81).

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic, defined by Collins
(1995, 2004) as 6000–4000 BP (5800–4000 BP
for the current project), is approximately marked
by the onset of the Altithermal. The climate
fluctuated from arid to mesic, then back to arid in
Central Texas during the Altithermal. Vegetation
and wildlife regimes all fluctuated in response
to these environmental oscillations, with human
groups responding accordingly. Collins (1995)
divided the Middle Archaic period by projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek,
Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The Bell-AndiceCalf Creek interval occurred during a mesic
period when grasslands, attractive to bison
herds, expanded southward into Central and
South Texas. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples,
as evidenced by hunting-based lithic technology,
were specialized bison hunters who followed the
herds southward (Johnson and Goode 1994). As
the period shifted from mesic to arid, both bison
and bison hunters retreated northward. During
this transitional period, Taylor bifaces were
manufactured. Later in the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis points
(Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis interval
was a period when temperature and aridity were
at their highest levels. Prehistoric inhabitants
acclimated themselves to peak aridity as seen
through increased utilization of xerophytes such
as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These plants,
typically baked in earthen ovens, also reflect the
development of burned rock middens. During
more arid episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and
resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dated the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1300/1200–260
BP and followed Kelley (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. The current project
delimits the Austin phase to 1250–750 BP and the
Toyah phase to 750–300 BP. The most distinctive
changes in relation to previous eras include

7

a technological shift away from the dart and
atlatl to the bow and arrow, and the more or less
concurrent appearance of pottery (Black 1989:32;
Story 1985:45–47).

response to the climatic patterns described above.
Mauldin et al. (2010) concluded that this change
in bison herd behavior is partly responsible for
a change in Toyah hunting strategy, involving
increasingly logistically organized hunting forays
in pursuit of spatially dispersed herds. Based on
the ratio of zooarchaeological to archaeobotanical
data associated with types of sites (e.g., bulk plant
processing, bulk meat processing, residential),
Dering (2008) provided further evidence of
Toyah phase logistically oriented subsistence
strategies and broad diet breadths. Included with
logistical subsistence strategies was what appears
to be either trade for horticultural products not
produced in Central Texas or of limited localized
horticultural practices. Both scenarios involve
maize, which is exceedingly uncommon in
Toyah-period archaeological contexts in Central
Texas, but which has been reported from at least
three locales, the Kyle Rockshelter (41HI1) in
Hill County (Jelks 1962), Bear Branch (41CA13)
in Callahan County (Adams 2002), and the
Timmeron Rockshleter (41HY95) in Hays County
(Harris 1985).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized primarily
by the appearance of arrow points, including
Scallorn and Edwards types. Evidence for
increased social strife, and perhaps overall
population density, has been seen in numerous
Central Texas burials dated to this period,
which have revealed incidents of arrow-wound
deaths, suggesting that population growth may
have resulted in disputes over limited resource
availability (Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt
1974). Burned rock middens are occasionally
found with these types of points (Houk and Lohse
1993), and ground and pecked stone tools, used
for plant food processing, become increasingly
common in the Austin phase.

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (750 BP)
in Central Texas is characterized by contracting
stem points with flaring, barbed shoulders (a style
known as Perdiz); by the common occurrence of
blade technology that is considered to be part of
a specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994); and by the appearance of bonetempered pottery in Central Texas (Johnson
1994:241–281). The wide variety of ceramic styles
and influences seen throughout Toyah phase
ceramic assemblages provide information about
the social composition of these cultural groups
(Arnn 2005). Toyah phase ceramic assemblages
display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada
Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005). In addition
to shifts in material technology, Mauldin et al.
(2010) suggested that bison herds foraged across
increasingly widespread ranges, at least partly in

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known
as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by
Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in AD 1528. The
period is generally dated between 1500 and 1700
(or 1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of Mission San
Antonio de Valero in 1718).
With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
8

from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991). Spanish priests accompanying
entradas provided the most complete information
of indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San
Marcos and described as semi-nomadic bands.
Other tribes encountered at San Marcos included
mobile hunting parties from villages in South and
West Texas, including Catequeza, Cayanaaya,
Chalome, Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading
toward bison hunting grounds in the Blackland
Prairies (Foster 1995:265–289; Johnson and
Campbell 1992; Newcomb 1993). Later groups
who migrated into the region and displaced the
earlier groups or tribes included the Tonkawa

records of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides
the mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present-day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve
was abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few indigenous people remaining were
nearly all displaced to reservations by the mid1850s (Fisher 1998).
European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836. Settlement in the region increased until
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
three years later (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Archaeological sites dated to this period
often contain a mix of both European imported
goods, such as metal objects and glass beads, and
traditional Native American artifacts, such as
manufactured stone tools.

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
Three archaeological sites have been
previously recorded within 1,000 m of the
proposed water main route: 41HY318, 41HY158,
and 41HY161. Archaeological site 41HY318 is
located near the western portion of the proposed
water main route. This site, characterized by
remains of an historic structure, was identified
during archaeological monitoring of irrigation
trench excavations adjacent to the President’s
House on the campus of the University (Jones
2003). Artifacts encountered included window
glass, bricks with maker’s marks, historic
ceramics, and bottle glass. These artifacts were

of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) in
1718, and the later founding of San Antonio de
Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja 1995).
Some researchers have demarcated the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period has been gained through the written

2003).

archaeological surveys, topographic and historic
maps, articles, and geologic surveys in order
to gather information on the context and past
uses of the project area. In addition, the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas (Texas Historical
Commission 2011) was consulted as a reference
for previously recorded archaeological sites in
the area.

Archaeological site 41HY158 is a prehistoric
lithic scatter located on a flat hilltop to the
north of the University campus. Lithic materials
consisting of debitage and crude biface fragments
were noted on the surface and mixed with modern
garbage (Texas Historical Commission 2011).

On August 2, 2011, CAS conducted an
archaeological survey involving 100 percent
systematic visual inspection augmented by a
total of 12 shovel tests (Appendix A, Figure
A-1). The survey was conducted within three
noncontiguous, high-probability areas along the
area of potential effect (APE). Two of the highprobability areas are located in the eastern end
of the proposed water main route, and one in the
western end (see Figure 3). Investigations were
carried out in accordance with and exceeding
survey standards developed by the CTA and
adopted by the THC. Standards for linear
projects require that no fewer than 16 shovel tests
per mile be excavated and that shovel tests are
not to be excavated on slopes greater than 20
percent. The portion of the proposed water main
route that was surveyed totaled approximately
0.5 noncontiguous linear miles.

SAL 41HY161, near the eastern portion
of the proposed water main route, has been
subjected to numerous investigations since its
initial recording by Joel Shiner in 1979. Shiner’s
and subsequent investigations uncovered
prehistoric lithic deposits (dating to the Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic) and burials (dating
to the Late Archaic and unknown prehistoric).
These previously recorded sites within 1,000 m
of the proposed water main route demonstrate a
relatively moderate probability of encountering
stratified and buried historic and prehistoric
resources located within the proposed project
area.

Goals and Methods
The primary objective of this investigation
was to identify any cultural resources on the
surface or subsurface of the western and eastern
areas of the proposed water main route located
outside of existing roadways. Information
gathered from this investigation is to be used to
determine the projected impacts to any located
archaeological resources. Eligibility for listing
as an SAL or on the NRHP will be assessed. It
will also be verified if further archaeological
investigations are necessary to comply with state
and federal laws and regulations.

Due to the topographic setting of the areas
under investigations, tests were opportunistically
placed in suitable level areas, such as at the tops
of knolls, ridges, or terraces. Shovel tests were
manually excavated in arbitrary 20-centimeter
(cm) levels to a depth of 100 cm below surface
(cmbs), or until bedrock was reached. Tests were
30 cm in diameter, and all excavated sediments
were screened through ¼-inch hardware screen.
All excavations were backfilled upon completion.
All shovel tests locations were recorded with a
Trimble GEO XT handheld GPS unit. All cultural
material within shovel tests were collected, as
well as diagnostic material encountered on the

were further investigated by

as well as topographic
boundaries.

all site data were recorded on
a Texsite form and placed on
file at the Texas Archaeological
Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin.

Results
In general, the highly
variable topography within the
project area was a determining
factor for shovel test locations.
For example, Area 1 was
subject to only two shovel test
excavations due to the steep
slopes and the considerable
amount of exposed bedrock.
Area 1 can be described as a

(Table 1). Area 2 is a moderately
wooded area bounded by a
steep slope terminating at a
small, unnamed drainage to
the northeast and residential
development to the southwest.
The northern portion of Area
2 is on top of a ridge that has
been partially invaded by bamboo trees, likely
originating from a residence to the southwest.
Another steep slope begins at the edge of the
ridge declining in elevation to the southeast. Due
to cultural material visible from the surface and
encountered within shovel tests in this area, site
41HY484 was recorded.

One stream channel runs directly along the
westernmost portion of the proposed water main
route and slopes downward from the water tower
to the northeast. This channel contains evidence
of modern refuse from flooding events (Figure
6). This portion of the APE is characterized by
steep slopes, exposed bedrock, and unstable
landforms with little probability of containing

a

century in England. Ceramics
in this category are defined
as the product of refined clays
fired at high temperatures with
vitreous glazes and a variety of
decoration styles (Stothert et al.
1992). Refined earthenwares
have gone through various
stages
of
development
beginning with the early
cream-colored wares (CC
ware) of the 1760s. Subsequent
developments
include
the
blue-tinted pearlwares of the
1780s and whitewares in the
1830s. In the 1850s, granite
or ironstone was developed
and is still produced today
(Miller 1980, 1991). One of the
ceramic dishes encountered on
the surface of site 41HY484
contained a maker’s mark
(Figure 10). According to
Lehner’s Encyclopedia of U.S.
Marks on Pottery, Porcelain &
Clay (1988:238), this bowl was
produced by Knowles, Taylor
& Knowles in East Liverpool,
Ohio. Knowles, Taylor &
Knowles was in operation from
1854 to 1931. More specifically,
this mark was used on table
pottery since 1905 and was
filed for registration on August
9, 1919.

The two cast iron weights are counterweights
from a sash-window. Sash-windows are vertically
sliding with a counter-balancing device made up
of weights, lines, and pulleys. This mechanism
allowed the window to remain open without
the use of external latches or other hardware.

Most of the ceramics observed on the surface
were of the refined earthenware type. Refined
earthenware, also called hard paste earthenware,
was developed in the last half of the eighteenth

14

This technology emerged
in Europe toward the end of
the seventeenth century and
quickly spread over half of
the Western world, replacing
casement windows throughout
the eighteenth century. These
windows remained popular
until the beginning of World
War I in the earlier part of the
twentieth century, when they
became too expensive to make
(Louw 1983:49).
The alternating current
motor part was manufactured by
Nash-Kelvinator Corporation.
Its part number is 1112123.

variety of household equipment
such as electric ranges, water
heaters, home freezers, air
conditioners, kitchen cabinets, sinks, kitchen
waste disposers, and laundry equipment. NashKelvinator Corporation also produced condensers
and compressors for other manufacturers of
refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning units
(Hubbert 2006).
Shovel tests within the historic component
of site 41HY484 yielded three asbestos tile
fragments, two clear glass fragments (one bottle
fragment and one window fragment), and one
glass marble at 0–20 cmbs. The glass marble is
made of transparent glass and contains green
swirling inside the sphere (Figure 11). There is
evidence of cutting and grinding on one end, a
characteristic of early machine-made marbles
produced from 1901 to 1926 (Zapata 1997).

Discussion
Archaeological survey of the proposed water
main revealed cultural resources representing

15

both prehistoric and historic human activity. One
multicomponent site (41HY484) containing a
prehistoric surface lithic scatter and an ephemeral
historic trash dump was recorded as a result of
this effort.

a historic occupation was once located on top of
the ridge northwest of the refuse concentration.
However, despite careful inspection, no standing
structure or foundation remains were located.
Also, the extension of the site to the southwest
has been adversely impacted by residential
development as well as the construction of the
Texas State University Physical Plant building.

The prehistoric component of site 41HY484
consists of a thin lithic scatter located on a small
ridge northeast of the houses on Buena Vista
Street. The lithic scatter contains a small amount
of lithic debitage and bifaces. No culturally or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed
or recovered from this prehistoric component. In
general, upland lithic scatters lack significance
due to their attritional nature. Therefore, they
are unable to contribute significantly to the
understanding of local and regional prehistory.

Overall, the research value of site 41HY484
is considered to be minimal. Cultural and
noncultural postdepositional processes have
resulted in the loss of original artifact context.
Furthermore, shallow soils limit the potential
for deeply buried deposits, and there was little
cultural material in shovel tests.

The historic artifacts of site 41HY484 are
characteristic of a historic dump site. Analysis
revealed that the majority of the historic refuse
artifacts date from the early twentieth century
to the 1930s. It was observed that the historic
remains that were comparatively larger and
heavier, like the metal sash-window weights and
AC motor, were located on top of the ridge, while
the cans, glass bottles, and dishes were scattered
down the southeastern slope. Therefore, much of
the historic remains lack their original context,
as the lightweight artifacts have been displaced
as a result of slope downwash. It is possible that

Recommendations
Archaeological survey investigations of the
western and eastern portions of the proposed
Spring Lake to Comanche Street water main
did not reveal cultural resources that could be
considered significant to the City’s, State’s, or
Country’s history. 41HY484 is not considered
eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation.
Thus, CAS recommends full regulatory
clearance for the project to proceed with respect
to requirements of the ACT.
