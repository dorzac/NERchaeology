FRANK H. WATT, PIONEER CITIZEN ARCHEOLOGIST

E. Mott Davis and Albert J. Redder

Frank Hedden Watt, for many decades the leader in archeological studies
of the Central Brazos region, was born on a farm near the village of Lynnville
in southern Indiana on January 15, 1889, and died in Waco, Texas, on October
9, 1981, in his ninety-third year. He became interested in archeology in midlife and was the mainstay of the Central Texas Archeological Society in Waco.
He carried out archeological field investigations and wrote up, edited, and
published results of archeological research. He was named a fellow of the Texas
Archeological Society in 1976.
Most of his adult life was spent in Waco, where he made his living in the
printing business as a lithographer and commercial artist. But before settling
in Waco he lived a remarkably varied life, little of which gave any hint of his
eventual interest in archeology. It was, however, the life of a person of wideranging interests and abilities, who did well at whatever he undertook and who
undertook a great deal. His work in archeology was a vivid expression of his

character.
In his late years he wrote down fragmentary reminiscences about his past,
which we have used in compiling this tribute. He also designed, engraved, and
printed the personal bookplate reproduced here. Each element in the design
symbolizes an aspect of his life, and readers are invited to refer to the bookplate
while reading what follows.
Frank’s father, Henry G. Watt, was a tenant farmer at the time of Frank’s
birth, which took place on a stormy winter night in a dirt-floored log cabin.
His mother, Clara M. Watt, was a college graduate and public-school teacher of
art and music. One of Frank’s earliest memories was of climbing a 20-foot
ladder without permission, at the age of 5, to say hello to his father, who was
working on the barn roof-and then being unable to climb back down. Frustratingly the reminiscence ends there, with little Frank stuck at the top of the
ladder.
By the time Frank was 6 the family had moved to Oakland City, a small
town nearby, so that Frank could start school there. His mother died the

Watt Collection at Baylor University and from long personal association with Mr. Watt.
Davis also has had access to extensive Watt materials in the personal library of Dr. Dee
Ann Story at The University of Texas at Austin and in his own files.

following year. It was her inspiration and instruction, he later said, that first
gave him the artistic ability that was so important throughout his life.
Although Oakland City had a population of scarcely 2,000, it was the home
of a small college that had a conservatory of music, and music was important
in the community. By the time Frank graduated from high school at the age of
18, he was playing the mandolin and guitar, was director of the high school
orchestra, was both a choir member and organist in his church, and had been a
member of the chorus in a cantata produced by the college conservatory. Music
continued to be a major element in his life.
The second important element in his life took shape in high school when he
received an eighteen-dollar scholarship that paid for a correspondence course in
newspaper illustration. His success in this course evidently determined his
career. For 2 years after high school he alternated between working for a
relative on a farm near St. Thomas, Ontario, and-using the money earned on
the farm-learning the trade of lithography and commercial art at the Winona
Technical Institute and the Herron Institute of Art in Indianapolis.
His first task on the Ontario farm, he later recalled, was to pull mullein weeds
in a wheat field. While at work he noticed interesting stone objects in the dirt.
The people said they were just old Indian arrowpoints; nothing of interest. It

would be more than 20 years before he acquired a serious interest in archeology.
At Winona Tech, his instructor soon recognized Watt’s artistic talent and had
him concentrate on drawing and engraving. When not busy at school he pursued
his musical interests, singing in a Methodist church choir.
Between graduating from Winona Tech in 1910 and entering the army in
1917 he worked as a lithographic artist for printing establishments in Louisville,
Indianapolis, and Wichita (see p. 8 for one of his engravings). In 1912 he joined
the International Union of Lithographers; in later life he was active in union
affairs.
Meanwhile his musical life continued. Many years later he was to comment,
"Lithography-my bread and butter; all other art-my ice cream and cake."
He graduated from the Indianapolis Conservatory of Music in 1913 and from
the Wichita College of Music in 1916. He played the cello in the Wichita
Symphony Orchestra, sang professionally as a church soloist, and was leading
tenor in several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. He was a member of a male
quartet, The Peerless Entertainers, which was booked on a Chautauqua circuit
out of Omaha. It is hard to see how all this musical activity could fit around a
regular job as a lithographer, but evidently he was quite successful at handling
both pursuits.
Then, strangely, in 1917 he abandoned both printing and music for a totally
different life, working all summer and fall as an apprentice tree surgeon along
the shores of Lake Erie. Since he made the change at about the same time that
he had to register for the World War I military draft, it is possible that, seeing
military service approaching and missing the outdoor life, he decided to do
something enjoyable for a few months. Or perhaps he was simply tired of city
life; his later pursuit of archeology certainly bespoke the spirit of a person who
loved the out-of-doors.
When cold weather came, the tree surgery company, rather than moving its
crews farther south, simply laid the men off. "Thus," says Frank in his reminiscences, "my hopes of a pleasant outdoor career went down the drain."
Did he plan to abandon lithography permanently? That is the implication, but
we do not know. Within a month, a jump ahead of the draft, he enlisted in the
army.
There followed 3 years as an aircraft mechanic in the Aviation Section of the
Army Signal Corps (the ancestor of the U.S. Air Force), during which he
advanced from private to sergeant first class and chief inspector at the newly
established Ellington Field (now Ellington Air Force Base) near Houston.
In 1920, at the age of 31, he left military service and was apparently casting
about for a career; again, he does not seem to have felt committed to lithography. Before long, however, he was in Waco for a few weeks to help out a
friend in the printing business. The weeks extended into months. In November
1920 he went to Kansas and brought back Faye Odell as his bride. And for the
remaining 60 years of his life he lived in Waco as a lithographer and printer, most
of that time with the Hill Printing and Stationery Company.
In the 1920s he became a thirty-third degree mason. A son, Frank O. Watt,
who survives him, was born in 1926. Musical activities, principally singing in
churches, continued. He became a stamp collector and exchanged stamps widely
throughout the world as part of the Friendship Through Stamps program. For
several years he also raised brown leghorn fowl for showing, winning many
prizes.

Texas Archeological Society

Upon reaching the age of 40, he became even more active. In 1931, as part
of his printing business, he designed, engraved, and manufactured the first Texas
State cigarette tax stamp, and described the accomplishment in 1933 in the
journal of the Texas Philatelic Association. This article seems to have marked
his entrance into writing for publication, an activity that continued for the rest
of his life and was of great importance when he took up archeology. He was
soon writing a regular column, "Watt’s Watt," for the Philatelic Association
journal, and he was librarian of the association for 5 years. He was a founder
and the first president of the Waco Stamp Collector’s Club. In 1935 he designed
and produced the first Texas State liquor and wine tax stamp;that, too, became
the subject of an article.
Other accomplishments of the 1930s were a drive from Laredo to Mexico
City in order to write a log of that part of the Pan-American Highway for the
American Automobile Association, and three talks on a Waco radio station on
stamp collecting and postal work. Meanwhile he was singing as a tenor in
several churches and a synagogue. But in 1935 a throat operation brought an
end to his singing career.
It is probably no coincidence that his archeological activity began in earnest
at about the same time his singing stopped. It would be hard to do weekend
archeology and sing in religious services too.
And so, at the age of 45, he encountered archeology. A group of collectors
of Indian artifacts were meeting informa!ly in Waco in the early 1930s, and in
1934 one of them, Sam Home, persuaded his friend Frank Watt to come along
on an arrowhead-hunting trip to the Chupik site near Waco. Frank found an
arrowpoint, became interested, and soon was asking more questions about
Indian artifacts than his collector friends could answer. He began to read and
study and do field work of his own. His first archeological paper, a brief description of a boulder mortar, appeared in 1935 under the title "Tonkawa Nut
Cracker Or Multiple Metate" in the bulletin of the North American Indian Relic
Collector’s Association, an organization that he served briefly as a member of
the advisory board.
Meanwhile he and his friends had organized formally in 1934 as the Central
Texas Archeological Society (CTAS). Frank’s writing and printing capabilities
immediately came into play, and in January 1935, volume I of the Bulletin of
the Central Texas Areheologieal Society appeared. It was a small volume, only
32 pages; later volumes were to be much larger. Thanks to the skill and standards of editor-and-publisher Watt and his publications committee, it was well
put together and edited, with many drawings and maps skillfully executed by
the editor.
This volume and those that followed are examples of the growth of what
can be called citizen archeology in the United States in the 1930s. The content
of the 1935 bulletin was appropriate for an introductory volume. Almost half
of the pages were taken up by three general articles aimed at acquainting readers
with Central Texas archeology. First, geologist Frank Bryan, who had been recording local archeological sites for nearly a decade, reviewed the geography and
archeology of the region. Then Frank Watt summarized, with the aid of drawings and a map, the kinds of stone artifacts to be found in the region. Finally,
A.T. Jackson, the foreman of field projects at The University of Texas, reviewed
field procedures in archeology.

As time went on, Frank became the driving force in the Central Texas Society, and he remained the center of the core of active people who carried the
group a!ong. Once involved in archeology, he never left it.
Over the years he roamed the Central Brazos countryside, locating sites,
collecting, recording information, and plotting locations on his map. He often
amazed his friends, as they drove with him, with his detailed knowledge of the
terrain and of the archeological sites to be found. "There is a site over there on
that hill," he would say; "This road leads to a site back in the woods"; "Down
this creek there is a site."
Lacking the opportunity for formal field training, he and his associates
read professional reports and in their excavations applied the techniques of
horizontal and vertical control that they learned from them. As all field workers know and as these workers surely found out, excavation without apprenticeship is like learning surgery from a correspondence course, at times with similar
effects on the patient; but Watt and his colleagues faced the challenge. The
second number of the CTAS bulletin, in 1936, reported investigations by the
society in the Aycock Shelter in Bell County, where 25 burials were found.
In a 39-page series of illustrated reports the excavations are described by Watt,
the geology by Bryan, the skeleta! material by two physicians, and the teeth
by a dentist-all of them members of the society. In the third number of the
bulletin, now renamed Central Texas Archeologist, a similar treatment is accorded material from a mass Indian burial found in Waco.
Frank came into his own in amateur archeological research with an article
entitled "The Waco Sinker," in the 1938 issue (number 4) of the Central Texas
Archeologist. Here in 50 pages of text and illustrations he reviewed systematically the forms, distribution, evidence for age, and possible function of the
end notched stones that are often found in Central Texas sites. This paper remains today the definitive statement on this enigmatic form of artifact.
In later years Frank recalled an interesting consequence of this article. Dr.
K.H. Aynesworth, a prominent Waco surgeon, was a charter member of the
CTAS who had served on the publications committee for early issues of the
bulletin, in which he had reported the skeletal analysis of the burials from the
Aycock Shelter and the Waco mass burial. At the time the Waco sinker article
appeared, Aynesworth was a member of the Board of Regents of The University
of Texas. He was so impressed by the article that he offered to help Frank get
a job at the university and study anthropology there. Wisely, Frank declined
the offer. We do not know why he turned the opportunity down, but we do
know that he was nearly 50 years old then, and his extensive reading in archeology and anthropology probably made it clear to him that he was not in
a position to start in on a new, highly technical field.
Meanwhile, his archeological efforts had become of wider importance. He
joined the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (TAPS) (now the
Texas Archeological Society) in 1937 and gave papers at TAPS meetings, although he did not publish in the TAPS bulletin until much later because his own
bulletin was available as an outlet.
More important, when in 1939 a statewide committee of amateurs and professionals was formed for the purpose of examining the standards and methods
of archeological research in Texas, Frank was one of eight persons chosen to
serve. This committee was the nucleus of the Council of Texas Archeologists.

6

Texas Archeological Society

an organization specifically concerned with improving the quality of research in
the state. The council was short lived because of the onset of World War II,
but in its brief existence it set up the quadrangle system of site designation that
was to be standard in Texas for more than 15 years and published a newsletter
concerned with methods and techniques.
At the same time, in 1939, Frank began publishing a mimeographed newsletter of the CTAS. In the early 1940s he led the CTAS in a major excavation
of the Asa Warner site, which was reported much later in the Central Texas
Archeologist (number 7, 1956). By this time he had also published several
articles in the Lithographer’s Journal, one of them entitled "Archeology as a
Diversion from Lithography," and had edited and published two books on the
genealogy of his family. In his reminiscences he notes that two articles on union
matters that he submitted to Lithographer’s Journal were turned down as being
too controversial. The editors may have been afraid of honest controversy, but
not Frank.
World War II was a time of little archeological activity, but Frank continued
to publish the newsletter through 1942, and in 1944 he produced a small issue,
number 5, of the Central Texas Archeologist, which consisted largely of a study
he had made of abrading implements, principally milling stones and bedrock
mortars, in the Waco area. He served as a regional vice-president of the Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society from 1941 through 1948.
Dormant during most of the 1940s, the Central Texas Archeological Society
was resurrected in 1950, and Frank became president in 1952. At the same time
he began 2 years of work for the Air Force, setting up the 3500th Field Printing
Squadron, a complete military printing establishment that had produced several
technical manuals by the time Frank’s participation was brought to an end by
a printing-press accident that injured his arm and hand.
He also began executing a series of pencil and charcoal drawings of world
leaders and other famous people, based on newspaper and magazine photographs. When he completed a drawing he sent it to the subject, requesting that
it be autographed. A collection of some. 20 autographed drawings resulted
from this activity.
Meanwhile, in 1953, he published number 6 of the Central Texas Archeologist, in which the principal article was one of his major contributions to Texas
archeology, "Pottery Diffusions in the Central Brazos Valley." This paper
described a series of Central Brazos sites on which potsherds had been found.
Much of the pottery was clearly East Texas Caddoan in style. Through this
work he demonstrated the existence of Caddo influences in the Central Brazos
region, west of the Caddo home territory.
In 1956, now past retirement age, Frank was elected a trustee of the Texas
Archeological Society and was in charge of the society’s annual meeting in Waco
that year. He also published number 7 of the Central Texas Archeologist, which
included his report on the earlier excavations at the Asa Warner site. In this
issue he included notes about each author, and about himself he said, "President
of the Central Texas Archeological Society, editor of CTAS publications. Commercial artist, amateur archeologist, and genealogist." His genealogical interests
led to his also being a charter member and director of the Waco Heritage Society
in 1957.
The CTAS did not function in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but Frank was
anything but inactive. In 1963, already 74 years old, he assisted The University

of Texas in a site survey of the new Lake Waco, then under construction. In the
course of vigorous field reconnaissance he became interested in the different
kinds of barbed wire in the many old fences he had to climb through. This
interest eventually resulted in a large collection of barbed wire samples, each
type identified and labeled, which is now part of the Frank H. Watt Collection
at Baylor University. He also applied his considerable skill with a camera to
photographing and identifying the local wild flowers and systematically collected and identified the fresh-water and land snails of the area.
His report on excavations at the Clark site, a Late Prehistoric site north of
Waco, appeared in 1965, in volume 36 of the Bulletin of the TexasArcheological
Society. By this time, also, he had begun what was to be his most important
field work, the investigation of the Horn Rock shelters, about which more will
be said.
Amateur archeologists in Waco organized again in 1966, adopted the name
of the old society, revived the CTAS newsletter, and elected Frank president;
but he declined. Not satisfied, in 1967 they elected him president emeritus.
He took over editorship of the newsletter in September 1967 and published it
regularly for 10 more years, nearly a hundred issues in all, ending in late 1977
when he was almost 89 years old. Most of the contents he wrote himself:
notes on archeological sites, reminiscences of archeologicat experiences, and
comments on local natural history, in addition to CTAS news. Anyone doing
research today on the archeology of the Central Brazos should go through the
pages of this newsletter; they contain much valuable information.
Meanwhile he contributed two articles to Texana, a historical quarterly
published in Waco. "First Indians of Central Texas," published in 1968 with
Professor George A. Agogino as junior author, discussed Paleo-Indian materials
found on a site near Waco. "The Waco Indian Village and Its People" appeared
in 1969 and was reprinted as number 9 of the Central Texas Archeologist, the
last issue of that publication that Frank was to publish. It was 58-page ethnohistoric study of the Indians who had lived on the site of the city of Waco.
In 1967 the Guild of American Prehistorians, a national organization of
amateurs, awarded Frank the title of Master Archeologist in recognition of his
contributions to American archeology as an amateur. Although the Guild was
never an influential organization, Frank was justifiably proud of the award.
Nine years later, in 1976, the Texas Archeological Society belatedly bestowed
a similar honor uponhim by naming him a fellow of the society.
During the 1970s, as he moved toward his ninetieth year, Frank continued
to work, in partnership with Albert Redder, on what was to be the crowning
achievement of his archeological career-the investigation, at the Horn Rock
shelters of the first Paleo-Indian components discovered and dated in the Central
Brazos Valley. As a result of this work he produced his final, and to him his
most important, report, "Radiocarbon Chronology of Sites in the Central
Brazos Valley," published in 1978 in volume 49 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. In this article he made the case for Paleo-Indian occupation of the area, defined a new point type (Brazos Fishtail), and presented
the projectile point sequence-reinforced by radiocarbon dates-from PaleoIndian to recent times. One of the present authors (Davis) edited the report
for publication; one of the rewards was the privilege of sending queries to the
old printer-archeologist, then in his ninetieth year, and receiving in reply cryptic
and incisive marginal comments on both substance and matters of style.

Frank passed away quietly at the Hillcrest Hospital in Waco on October 9,
1981, 3 months short of his ninety-third birthday. He had seen transportation
go from wagons and railroads to moon rockets, and had helped Texas archeology
go from relic hunting to disciplined investigation. He had published more than
100 archeological notes and articles. After his final paper was published he sent
a reprint of it to one of us with the note, "This shows what can happen when
the mind of an artist-musician wanders down strange paths." But although he
had thought of himself basically as an artist and musician ever since his youth
in Oakland City, he was equally a craftsman and scientist. A more fortunate
combination of talents would be hard to find. And the "strange paths" were not
so strange. He had been familiar with archeology for more than 40 years, had
assembled and organized much information on the prehistory of his home area,
about which little had been known before his time, and had made it available
in print to those who would continue the work. Most of his archeologicat collection was left to the Anthropology Program at Baylor University in Waco,
where it is housed in a special room.
To Frank Watt, more than to any other individual, goes the credit for establishing the initial base for archeological studies in the Central Brazos region. His
life and work can serve as a model for citizen archeologists of the future.

ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT MUSK HOG CANYON,
CROCKETT COUNTY, TEXAS
A Report of the 1976 Texas Archeological Society Field School

William Edward Moore

ABSTRACT
Archeological investigations at Musk Hog Canyon, Crockett County, Texas,
cofiducted under the auspices of the 1976 Texas Archeological Society Field
School are described. Ring middens and burned rock accumulations, considered
by most researchers to represent food processing stations, provide the main
focus of this paper. Data obtained from the Musk Hog Canyon study revealed
that these unique sites probably functioned as ovens in which desert succulents
such as agave and sotol were baked for the purpose of human consumption.
Projectile point types such as Ensor and Frio suggest that the ring middens in the
study area were utilized primarily during Archaic times. Ethnohistoric accounts
indicate that similar sites were used during the Historic period. Comparisons between ring middens from Musk Hog Canyon and other areas are made, and a
brief overview of ring middens is presented.

INTRODUCTION
In June 1976, the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) conducted a field
school in the western part of Crockett County, Texas. The field school was
designed to salvage valuable archeological data from a few sites in Musk Hog
Canyon that were endangered by the proposed construction of Interstate Highway 10. The possibility that this area might be eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places added additional importance to the archeological work conducted in Musk Hog Canyon.
The archeological objectives of the field school included (1) completing a
survey of the canyon in order to record all visible sites, (2) determining the
spatial patterning of these sites, (3) describing the sites in terms of their environmental settings, and (4) testing some of the burned rock midden sites in order
to secure data on structure, function, use of plant materials, and age of these
sites. A secondary objective was to provide TAS members with experience in
site-survey and excavation procedures (Shafer and Moore 1976:1).
The field school was divided into two groups: the excavation crews, under
the direction of Harry J. Shafer, and the survey crews, under the direction of
Gary Moore. Utilizing a specially designed site-survey form, the field school
crews surveyed about 90 percent of the Musk Hog drainage, and 435 sites were
added to the archeo!ogical record.
Sites recorded by the TAS survey include 14 chipping/quarrying locations, 22
lithic scatters (chipped stone and burned rock), 146 individual burned rock
middens, 140 hearths (circular or oval pavements of burned rock usually less

than 2 meters in diameter), 73 burned rock scatters (which may be either
scattered hearths or small burned rock middens), and 40 rock-shelters. Complementing the site survey was a rock-art recording crew supervised by John
W. Clark.
Vaughn M. Bryant, Jr., and James Phil Dering, archeobotanists from Texas
A&M University, made botanical transects in predesignated areas of the canyon
system in order to defme the distribution of modern botanical communities
whose past counterparts may have contained plants of economic importance
to the aboriginal populations of this area.
Test excavations were undertaken at five sites. The objectives of these excavations were:
¯ . . to explore the internal structure and consistency of the crescent-shaped
burned rock middens (and variations of them), to examine the culture history
and archeological potential of small rock-shelter sites which have mainly
talus deposits, and to secure botanical specimens from each site in the hopes
of delineating site function and providing some indication of the economic
use of plants in the study area (Shafer and Moore 1976:3-4).

The five sites excavated during the 1976 field school were the Pecos Terrace
site (41CX218), the Divide Windmill site (41CX241), the Eiserer Shelter site
(41CX133), the Bedrock Mortar site (41CX238), and the Children’s site
(41CX103). All five sites had burned rock middens.
Ring middens are unique to West Texas, southeastern New Mexico, and
adjoining areas but are commonly occurring archeological phenomena in that
region. Most archeologists (Greer 1968a; Word 1971; Riggs 1968a) agree that
ring middens are circular accumulations of burned rock in open-air settings,
and that they functioned primarily as pits or ovens in which desert succulents
such as sotol (Dasylirion texanum) and lechuguiUa (Agave lechuguilla) were
baked for human consumption.
There are several problems with the term ring midden and its connotations¯
One problem is the variety of names applied to ring middens. The term ring
midden implies a circular, oval, or crescent-shaped feature, but it does not imply
function. Other names, including doughnut midden, circle mound, cooking
mound, cooking pit, sotol pit, midden circle, mescal pit, and earth oven (Greer
1965:41), are more specific: two name the plant which was processed, and
three refer to function without naming what plant was cooked. The confusion
is obvious. Another problem is that factual statements regarding the function
of ring middens are sometimes presented without the support of good empirical
data. Greer (1965), for example, refers to specific sites as mescal pits, but
presents no evidence that mescal (Agave sp.) was ever processed at these sites.
Four factors that help to determine the function of ring middens are (1)
the presence of plant macrofossils, (2) physical characteristics such as burned
rock accumulations and slab-lined pits, (3) associated artifacts that relate to
plant processing activities, and (4) ethnographic analogy. However, any one of
these factors alone may not be sufficient to support a hypothesis of plant
processing as a site function. For example, the presence of a slab-lined pit
surrounded by burned rocks does not necessarily mean that sotol, mescal, or
any other plant was cooked therein. Some pits could have been built for
cooking animals instead of plants, and, without preservation of the remains of
what was being cooked, the contents of a pit cannot be determined. Although

it is known from ethnographic accounts that some historic Indian groups cooked
mescal and other desert succulents in similar pits (Sjoberg 1953; Opler 1941),
the mere presence of such a pit does not prove that it was used for the same
purpose. But it is the function of these features, not their physica! description,
that is of paramount importance to the archeologist. It has been noted above
that ring middens occur in the open, are typically circular in form-although
at least six varieties of ring middens occur (Greer 1965)-and that some of them
were used in the cooking of desert succulents (Shafer 1970).
A third problem is posed by the fact that these open-air middens are not the
only features that were used for cooking desert plants. Much of the best data we
have concerning the processing and cooking of desert succulents were obtained
from middens situated in rock-shelters. Plant macrofossils including quids and
cut leaf bases of desert succulents taken from Hinds Cave (Val Verde Co.) and
other dry rock-shelters in southwestern Texas have shown that desert succulents
constituted an essential part of the diet in the Lower Pecos region of Texas for
about 9000 years (Dering 1979). Recent studies of the stone tools from Hinds
Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977; Shafer 1978; Shafer and Holloway 1979)have
demonstrated the value of analysis of organic residue and wear patterns in
determining tool function. Hinds Cave is a large, dry, rock-shelter with ideal
conditions for excellent preservation. Thus, it has been possible for archeologists to identify the specific organic residues on some stone tools and to apply
these data to a better understanding of edge wear patterns and their relation to
motor habits such as cutting and slicing (Shafer and Holloway 1979:385). As
a result, certain tool sets at Hinds Cave have been proven to be associated with
procurement and processing of desert succulents. This kind of analysis provides
researchers with valuable data for intersite and intrasite comparisons.
Although the ring middens found in rock-shelters are sometimes circular,
in most cases they cannot be compared morphologically with the open-air
varieties. One of the burned rock middens in Hinds Cave is an exception, and,
according to Shafer and Bryant (1977:43), "is in every way analogous to the
burned rock middens which commonly occur in open-air settings throughout
the region."
OBJECTIVES AND METHOD
The first objective of this study is to synthesize available archeological and
ethnographical data concerning ring middens in southwestern Texas as they
relate to the presumed function of these sites as plant processing stations. This
synthesis will be accomplished by a thorough review of the literature regarding
ring middens, which will provide a survey of current information on site locations, age, function, physical characteristics, associated artifacts, plant remains,
faunal remains, and ethnographic analogy that have been collected relating to
ring middens of southwestern Texas.
The second objective is to analyze archeological and botanical material from
ring midden sites excavated during the field school in order to determine the
function of these sites. The Pecos Terrace site, the Divide Windmill site, and the
Eiserer Shelter site were chosen for this study. Due to a lack of information
concerning the Children’s and Bedrock Mortar sites, they are omitted from this
study.

16

Texas Archeological Society

No field notes were available for the Children’s site, and the data that could
be located concerning the artifacts from this site are virtually meaningless without the notes. Although a brief description of the excavation procedures at the
Bedrock Mortar site was available, the data were not of sufficient quality to
facilitate analysis. The writer could not find the artifacts in the laboratory
during the analysis. According to the notes that were found, the debitage was
sorted only into large and small categories. All of the information available
concerning these sites has been placed in the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Two of the excavated sites, the Pecos Terrace site and the Divide Windmill
site, contain ring middens in open-air settings. The Eiserer Shelter site is a small
rock-shelter with a burned rock midden near its talus slope. This site was included in the hope of providing additional information on plant processing
areas in rock-shelters. There are actually more than three middens involved in
this study; the Divide Windmill site encompasses at least four discernable burned
rock middens, together with at least two confirmed areas of ashy midden deposits. It is not known at this time if the different midden areas at the Divide
Windmill site represent separate site occupations, or if they are all intrasite
features resulting from a single occupation.
If these ring middens are indeed plant processing areas, the kinds of data
recovered from them should reflect those activities. Due to the scarcity of plant
remains and the overwhelming dominance of lithic artifacts, the second objective will be accomplished mainly through lithic analysis.
The lithic assemblages from each study collection are separated first into
tools and debitage. These categories are subdivided into specific artifact types
such as unifaces and dart points. Each artifact type has been examined in an
attempt to ascertain its particular function. The resulting assemblages are then
compared to collections described in the literature from other parts of the state
in order to see how the Musk Hog Canyon artifacts compare to assemblages
from other sites with ring middens. Some specimens have been examined for
wear patterns under a binocular Nikon dissecting microscope with magnification
ranging from 10X to 80X. The artifacts from the Eiserer Rock-shelter have been
examined to see if they are similar to collections from the open-air sites in the
study. If the rock-shelter site was also a plant processing area, the lithic assemblage from it should be similar to those from the open-air sites.
Proper collecting and recording of data from any archeological project is
invaluable if successful interpretations are to be made. Errors can be expected
on every project, and they must be reported to allow the reader to evaluate the
conclusions presented. The Musk Hog Canyon project is no exception. Problems in several stages of the project, from collecting to recording, have made it
difficult in some cases to present the information in an ideally accurate, objective, and professional manner.
Measurements taken during the field school were not consistent. For example, the data concerning elevation and distances and the grid designed for
surface collecting at the Divide Windmill site were expressed in the U.S. Customary (English) System, whereas at the other sites measurements were recorded
according to the International Metric System. The metric system is followed
where possible in this report. However, whenever measurements were presented
in the English system by TAS personnel, they have been converted to their
metric equivalents and follow the metric in parentheses.

Some of the artifacts listed on the TAS inventory sheets are missing from the
collections. After the lithic artifacts were examined and counted, the numbers
were checked against the specimen inventory sheets and, in many cases, the
number of specimens recorded on the sheets is greater than the number of
specimens on hand. In a few cases there are more artifacts for units or levels
than are indicated on the inventory sheets. It is possible that the missing artifacts are simply misplaced somewhere in the laboratory. It is also common for
many of the items listed as flint to be fragments of limestone or other rock.
In addition, some specimens fall into a no provenience category because of
illegible labeling or no labeling at all. All conclusions presented here are based
on the artifacts actually present in the collections, and not on the numbers
recorded on the specimen inventory sheets or the field notes.
In her laboratory report for the 1976 field school, Greer Smith (1976:personal communication), the laboratory chief, discussed some of the problems
and discrepancies in the collecting and recording of data from Musk Hog Canyon. These problems resulted from the varied backgrounds and lack of experience of the laboratory personnel. Specific discrepancies included imperfect
catalog numbering systems for the surface collections at the Divide Windmill
site and the site survey, field notes from the Pecos Terrace site and the Bedrock
Mortar site that did not cross-check against the sacks that were cataloged, and
soil samples without provenience.
The field notes for Musk Hog Canyon are often confusing and difficult to
read. This may have led to invalid statements by the writer concerning procedure and other important activities of the field school crews. Also, the field
notes for the Eiserer Shelter site were very incomplete. Much of the information
concerning this site was obtained by personal communication.
In summary, this report has been hindered by data that were in some cases
poorly collected, were often incomplete, and were sometimes inadequately
recorded. For the most part, the amount of data lost is not significant, and the
writer believes that the report has not been seriously affected.
THE STUDY AREA

Musk Hog Canyon, one of the many canyon systems dissecting the Edwards
Plateau, is about 2.9 km (1.8 miles) east of Sheffield, in western Crockett
County, Texas (Figure 1). Characterized by a broad floodplain about 3.22 km
(2 miles) wide at its mouth east of the Pecos River, the canyon drains to the
southwest, gradually narrowing at its head to a steep, rugged gully nearly 183
meters (600 feet) above the valley floor. Many smaller header canyons, extending to the north and south from both sides of Musk Hog Canyon, drain adjacent
parts of the mesa top into Musk Hog Canyon itself.
Crockett County is on the west edge of the Edwards Plateau just east of the
Stockton Plateau in southwestern Texas. The Pecos River, which winds for
about 1300 km (800 miles) from its headwaters in the Santa Fe Mountains of
New Mexico to its confluence with the Rio Grande about 50 km (30 miles)
from Del Rio, Texas, separates the two plateaus. In fact, the Stockton Plateau
is considered by Johnson (1931) an extension of the Edwards Plateau.
Geologic formations in this region are in the Comanche Series of the Cretaceous System. The limestone mantle in western Crockett County is thin, and
the local drainage systems have cut into the rock, producing a region of canyons,
rock overhangs, and wide valleys (U.S. Soil Conservation Service 1956:3-4).

Crockett County is in what Blair (1950) defines as the Balconian Biotic
Province. The climate is warm and is classified as dry semiarid mesothermal
(Blair 1950:113). The temperature ranges from 32.2 degrees C (90 degrees F),
or higher in the summer, to an average of 11.6 degrees C (53 degrees F) in the
winter. Sudden cold fronts known as northers cause rapid and frequent temperature changes. The annual rainfall averages 46.5 cm (18.33 inches), but this
varies considerably, with a record low of 17.3 cm (6.82 inches) in !952, and a
record high of 98.89 cm (38.98 inches) in 1975 (Wiedenfeld and McAndrew
1968:30).
The most characteristic plant association of the Balconian is a scrub forest
of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas Oak (Quereus texana), stunted
live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various other less numerous species. This
association occupies the more dissected parts of the area to the near exclusion
of others, and it occurs throughout the area of the Balconian. Mesquite is
distributed throughout the Balconian, and to the west, it and the live oak

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

19

become the most conspicuous woody vegetation. The floodplains of the
streams are occupied by a mesic forest of large live oaks, elms, hackberries,
and pecans (Blair 1950:113).

Tharp (1952:50-56) includes Crockett County in his Foothill-Mesa-Valley
Region of Trans-Pecos Texas. This region:
¯ . . occupies not only all of Texas west of the Pecos River but an area extending eastward beyond the Pecos. Topographica!ly it lies at elevations
below the oak savanna. Physiographically it is very diverse; and this diversity, reflected in the vegetation, renders its separation into four subregions
desirable for clarity of treatment. They are as follows: (a) the sotolqechuguilla hills; (b) the mesa slopes; (c) the intermesa valley flats; and (d) the
intermountain valleys (Tharp 1952: 50).

The vegetation in region 10a (sotol4echuguilla hills) consists mainly of sotol
(Dasylirion spp.) and lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla). Interspersed in the sotol
and lechuguilla cover, especially east of the Pecos River, are local areas with
admixtures of guajillo (Acacia berlandieri) (Tharp 1952:50). Also present are
marble-fruit prickly pear cactus (Opuntia strigil), sacahuista (Nolina texana),
and various grasses (Glendon Weir 1980 :personal communication).
The sotol4echuguilla hills:
¯ .. comprise bold foothills with steep slopes, representing the present state
of erosional dissection of the cretaceous limestone through which the Rio
Grande and its tributaries are cutting their way. For the most part the hills
are either conical or rather sharp ridged; but an occasional one is topped by
a vestige of cap rock, a level stratum of hard, resistant limestone which
farther north is a topographic feature of the "Mesa Country" (Tharp 1952:

50).
The next region is what Tharp refers to as the mesa slopes. The mesa slopes
were undoubtedly of economic importance to the aboriginal inhabitants but
have seldom if ever been described in the archeological literature (Lorrain
1968:8). An important vegetational community exists at the base of the cap
rock where rock-shelters are commonly found¯
Scrub woody vegetation is usually impenetrably dense at the base of the
cap rock, especially on north and east exposures, where greater moisture
content in the soil, together with protection from the drying effect of winds,
results in ranker growth of mesic species and the accumulation of more
humus in a richer soil (Tharp 1952:51-52).

According to Tharp (1952:52), oak (Quercus sp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.),
hackberry (Celtis spp.), catclaw (Acacia and Mimosa spp.), Texas mountain
laurel, or mescalbean (Sophora secundiflora), shrub sparge, or candeliUa (Euphorbia antisyphilitica), shrub (or bush) Croton (Croton fruticulosus), two
sumacs (Rhus spp.), Mexican buckeye (Ungadia speciosa), Mexican (or Texas)
persimmon (Diospyros texana), white brush (Aloysia gratissima), and Condalia
(Condalia sp.) combine to form thickets so dense that they exclude all but
shade-loving herbs.
The upper slopes carry thinning stands of woody growth that become progressively scrubbier as they extend downward from the base of the cap rock,
with Pinchot’s juniper (Juniperus pinchotii) the most conspicuous species
(Tharp 1952:52).
Lower slopes become more gradual near the fiats. Here cedars are replaced
by midget buckthorn (Rhamus sp.), catclaw (Acacia sp.), ocotillo (Fouquieria

20

splendens), allthorn (Koeberlinia spinosa), and Condalia (Condalia sp.) (Tharp
t952:52).
Passing on to subregion 10b, the mesa slopes, a word of explanation is in
order regarding the choice of this restrictive term rather than the more inclusive term mesa. Mesa is a Spanish word meaning table, and the Mesa
Region takes its name from the abundance of flat-topped hills which rise
several hundred feet above the broad intervening valley flats. The peculiar
topography is due to a horizontal stratum of erosion-resistant limestone
twenty to thirty feet thick which "caps" the softer underlying strata. The
sides fall away from the base of the perpendicular margin of cap rock, steeply
at first, but becoming gentler lower down toward the intermesa valleys. The
sizes of the mesas vary from mere fragments, each with only a vestige of cap
rock to those whose tops comprise scores of square miles .... the smaller
mesas, true to their appearance from the valleys below, have essentially flat
tops; but the larger ones have undulating surfaces bearing considerable
residual gravelly soil which supports a vegetation very similar to that of the
intermesa valley flats (10c) (Tharp 1952:51 ).
Subregion 10c (the intermesa valley flats) is dominated by creosote bush
(Larrea divaricata) and blackbrush (Acacia rigidula) in varying combinations
and densities.
In exceptionally favorable areas, mesquite (Prosopis grandulosa), white brush (Aloysia gratissima), and other species more common
farther east, occur in stands usually sufficiently open to constitute savannas¯
On these savannas communities of buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides),
thrive, frequently in almost pure stands (Tharp 1952:52).
Farther removed from drainage channels, the grasses, occupying the open
spaces in the predominantly creosote-bush stand, are also thinly scattered,
none having either first-rank or second-rank importance (Tharp 1952:54).

Subregion 10d-the broad intermountain valley-is essentially grassland, but
with yucca (Yucca spp.), cholla (Opuntia imbricata), and broomweed (Xanthocephalum sp.) widely distributed and frequently conspicuous. Shrubby species
of severa! affinities are more sparsely represented, mainly along the drainage
systems; desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), walnut (Yuglans sp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), small-leaved sumac (Schmaltzia [now Rhus] Mierophylla), ocotillo
(Fouquieria splendens), Apache plume (Fallugia), aUthorn (Koeberlinia spinosa),
Clematis, Coldenia, Aloysia, Condalia, and Viquiera stenloba are some of the
more common (Tharp 1952:54).
An abundance of fauna thrive in the Balconian Province. The following were
observed by field parties in the northwestern part of Crockett County during
the 1966 and 1967 field seasons:
¯ ¯ . ringtail, raccoon, ground squirrel, rock squirrel, jack rabbit, cottontail,
deer, beaver, skunk, several species of bats, rock wren, green heron, mourning
dove, bluebird, vulture, several hawks, lizards, rock rattlesnakes, diamondback rattlesnake, pink racer, fishes and freshwater mussel (Lorrain 1968:11).

Blair (1950:113-114) lists 57 species of mammals, 16 species of lizards, and
36 species of snakes in his discussion of the Balconian Biotic Province. Larger
mammals, including puma (Fells concolor), wolf (Canis sp.), black bear (Ursus
americanus), ante!ope (Antilocapra americana), and bison (Bison bison), probably were common in prehistoric times but have been eliminated ordrastically
reduced in numbers (Gentry Steele 1980: personal communication).
As of the 1970 census, Crockett County, with its 7237 km2 (2794 square
miles) (Moore 1975:16) and population of 3885 (Moore 1975:26), must be

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

21

considered sparsely populated. Conditions such as rainfall, sparse vegetation,
and poor soils, which have affected population density in the twentieth century,
probably influenced prehistoric populations as well. However, survival is possible, and man has done just that in this region for over 8000 years by adapting
and molding his lifeways to the environment.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOHISTORICAL BACKGROUND

Few systematic archeological investigations have been carried out in Crockett
County. The first scientific investigation of a prehistoric site in Crockett County
was in 1966, when the Texas Archeological Society tested two burned rock
middens and a small rock-shelter in what is referred to by Word (1971:271)
as the Dunlap complex. From this work Word concluded that during Archaic
times the west-central part of Crockett County showed a strong cultural affinity
with the Trans-Pecos region. Perishable materials such as sandals, matting, and
cordage are quite similar to those found in the Lower Pecos - Devils River areas
(Word 1971:309). Projectile point types such as Langtry, Shumla, Ensor,
Paisano, and Frio support this association, whereas the presence of Clifton and
Harrell arrow points and Daft, Ellis, Lange, Martindale, Montell, Pedernales,
Travis, Trinity, and Uvalde dart points suggest eastern influence (Word 1971:
309). "It appears that the strongest influence is from the lower Pecos - Devils
River area with lesser influences from the areas to the southwest, east, and
southeast" (WOrd 1971:309). The two burned rock middens are viewed by
Word as the result of plant processing and cooking activities, and the rock-shelter
as a camping area with a large fire hearth resembling a mescal pit that Greer
refers to as Type IV. According to Greer (1965:45), this type of pit is found
in or just inside the mouths of rock-shelters. This feature conforms in location
and description to Greer’s typology for this type of cooking pit (Word 1971 :
285). Radiocarbon dates for Midden 1 yielded ages ranging from A.D. 1010 to
A.D. 1410. Greer (1968a:41) states that the earlier date (A.D. 1010) is inconsistent with the data and that the range of dates for this complex is better
represented as A.D. 1280 to A.D. 1410.
According to Greet (1968a:39), two ring midden sites were excavated in
Crockett County between 1963 and 1968. Only one of these sites, dug by
Arnold Sommer of Midland, Texas, is discussed by Greer, and the date of excavation is not given. The presence of a small subsurface slab4ined pit suggests
an earth oven, but Greer (1968a:41) questions what was actually cooked.
In 1968, three reports concerning the prehistory of this area were published.
Findings at several rock-shelters and two burned rock middens in a salvageoriented project are described by Lorrain (1968). Aaron D. Riggs, Jr., published
four reports on shelters in Crockett County, 41CX10 (Riggs 1968a), 41CX12
(Riggs 1968b), 41CX29 (Riggs 1969), and 41CX109 (Riggs 1974).
In 1967, Riggs (1968c:79) excavated 41CXl 1, a buried midden site in northwestern Crockett County. No recognizable pattern of deposit, cooking basin,
or pit outline was discernable within the deposit. However, burned rock or heatfractured limestone in this quantity "surely was created by cooking" (Riggs
1968c:82).
Matrix samples from a thin occupation lens in Gobbler Shelter (41CX117)
were collected by the Texas Highway Department’s archeological staff. These
materials were analyzed by J. Phil Dering and Harry J. Shafer, of Texas A&M

22

Texas Archeological Society

University, in an attempt to determine seasonality of occupation. Although the
question of the seasonal occupation of this site was not satisfactorily answered,
the matrix samples provided other useful information. For example, 13 genera
of plants commonly listed as Lower Pecos food sources were identified, and
new plant identification techniques were explored. This represents the largest
compilation of potentially economic plants reported from archeological sites
in Crockett County (Dering and Shafer 1976:226). The Gobbler Shelter study
is the first systematic collection and analysis of dried plant remains in Crockett
County (Dering and Shafer 1976:210) and is one of the earliest such studies in
the greater Lower Pecos region of Texas.
More extensive archeological work has .been conducted in the Lower Pecos
region south of Crockett County. Salvage operations in the Amistad International Reservoir district and independent efforts at Hinds Cave, to name a few,
have provided important comparative data for areas such as Crockett County in
close proximity to the Lower Pecos (see references cited in Shafer and Bryant
1977:129-t37).
In all, 512 archeological sites have been documented in the Musk Hog Canyon
drainage system. The Texas Department of Highways and Transportation recorded 77 sites in a 1971 survey, and the Texas Archeological Society added 435
sites in 1976.
Musk Hog Canyon is in a peripheral part of what is known archeologically
as the Lower Pecos region of Texas. Although the prehistory of Crockett
County has not been well defined, its similarity to the Lower Pecos in terms of
environment, types of sites, and archeological materials allows an opportunity
for valuable comparative study.
The semiarid environment of southwestern Texas, with its excellent possibilities for preservation, provides the archeologist with a laboratory setting equal
to any in North America. Unfortunately the archeological record of this area
will never be complete, a result (in part) of factors such as uncontrolled relic
hunting and the unsophisticated excavation techniques of early archeologists.
"The intensity of pothunting and destruction of archeological sites is greater
than in any other area known to the writer" (Lorrain 1968:11).
Virtually every rock-shelter in West Texas has been at least partially destroyed by vandals. Archeological work in the Lower Pecos began in the 1930s,
was poorly controlled, and was conducted primarily in order to obtain specimens for museums and to build chronology. Very little of this work has been
published (Shafer and Bryant 1977:4).
In the past, major emphasis was placed on development of a cultural/chronological sequence based upon projectile point styles, sometimes to the exclusion
of other classes of artifacts. The importance of analyses of fossil pollen, coprolites, and plant macrofossils was not yet recognized. The positive result of the
emphasis on projectile point studies is a relatively sound chronology of the area
for several thousand years (Shafer 1971). The negative result, however, is the
destruction of other data that can never be recovered.
In 1965, a major change occurred in archeological tlfinking. The emphasis,
previously on chronology building, shifted to include paleoecological studies
(Shafer and Bryant 1977). Archeologists began to examine coprolites and fossil
pollen instead of discarding them. These studies have added a new dimension
to the archeological record of the region, for now variables such as prehistoric
diets and environmental changes can be measured in addition to lithics, pottery,

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

23

and other tangible artifacts traditionally studied. According to Dering and
Shafer (1976:209), archeologists, by discarding the dried plant materials, have
overlooked perhaps the largest potential source of information about the lifeways of the prehistoric inhabitants.
The sites in the Lower Pecos region of Texas vary widely. Sites considered
typical include lithic scatters, chipping/quarrying locations, hearths, burned
rock middens, burned rock scatters, and rock-shelters. Rock art is sometimes
found in sheltered localities and is described by Kirkland (1939), Kirkland and
Newcomb (1967), and Shafer (1975).
An important factor to remember is the relation of these different sites to
each other and to the environment. It is a mistake to study only a particular
site out of context with the data potential of other similar sites. For example,
rock-shelters have received the most attention because their deposits are so well
preserved. It was common in the 1930s to refer to the inhabitants of these
shelters as Texas Cave Dwellers. These sites were studied as separate entities,
apart from their context. Other sites, such as isolated hearths, were hardly
studied at all. According to Shafer (1971:44), hearths are important, although
much ignored, archeological resources. Only recently has the importance of
these single-event activity loci been recognized. Musk Hog Canyon provides
researchers with an excellent opportunity to examine these kinds of sites in
their environmental and archeological contexts. This is possible because (1)
about 90 percent of the canyon was surveyed, and (2) sites of all types mentioned above were recorded during the 1976 field school.
The current archeologlcal data suggest that Crockett County was inhabited
by small bands of hunters and gatherers who depended mainly on gathering and
processing plants such as sotol, agave, yucca, and prickly pear for their survival.
Remains of these plants are found in virtually all rock-shelters in the Lower
Pecos and Trans-Pecos regions of Texas that exhibit traces of human habitation.
The evidence from Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977; Dering 1979; WilliamsDean 1979) positively indicates an adaptation to the resources of this area with
no major changes in subsistence strategies for about 9000 years-an unusually
long period of stability. These groups were practicing a foraging lifeway within
a restricted geographical area with limited influence from external sources.
Shafer (1978:4) has demonstrated, through his study of organic residue and
wear patterns on lithic tools from Hinds Cave, that these prehistoric Lower
Pecos populations were procuring resources from the immediate environment.
Resources from outside the Lower Pecos environment were absent. "It was a
totally self-sufficient system from a natural resource perspective" (Shafer 1978:

4).
If these groups did indeed exist on the products of their immediate environments, the sites present in each region should represent groups of interrelated
activity areas. The functions of these sites are probably directly related to the
seasonal rounds of resource procurement activities. Although these statements
may eventually be disproved, they provide the context in which Musk Hog
Canyon and other large areas must be studied if meaningful conclusions are to
be drawn from the data.
Ethnographic data relating specifically to Crockett County are virtually nonexistent. However, sources relating to the area in general do exist and can
help to provide a partial picture of the historic Indian groups who inhabited this
area.

24

Texas Archeological Society

In prehorse days (prior to the seventeenth century), this part of southwestern
Texas may have been occupied intermittently by Coahuiltecan speakers of the
Hokan-Siouan linguistic family based in Coahuila, Mexico, and by speakers of
the Concho stock of the Uto-Aztecan family (Shafer 1971:3). The Concho
speakers, especially the Chisos groups, occupied both sides of the Rio Grande
in the Big Bend (Figure 1) (Griffin 1969; Campbell 1970) and may have ranged
eastward into what is now Crockett County. It is also possible that Jumano
groups, enroute to the bison country east of the Pecos, made trips into the area
from the La Junta region, and may have camped in the area for short periods
of time (BoRon 1911:1916).
Migrant Apache bands wandered into the Lower Pecos - northern Coahuila
region in the eighteenth century and filled a void in the indigenous Indian populations created by the effect of Spanish colonization (Griffin 1969). During the
nineteenth century, Comanche raiding parties were notorious for traveling across
Texas and into Mexico, but it is doubtful that they ever settled very long in one
area.
According to Griffin (1969), the Coahuiltecan-speaking Chisos groups, who
occupied the Big Bend, were nomadic hunters and gatherers. They utilized
mesquite, prickly pear, and agaves. The major game animals hunted were
rabbits (hunted with snares, nets, and clubs), deer (taken with the bow and
arrow), and fish where obtainable.
Dwellings consisted of skin-covered and grass-covered huts, probably domeshaped and open on one side (Shafer 1971:4). The use of caves or rock-shelters
for dwellings has been reported for only one group, the Tobosos (Shafer 1971 :

4).
The individual groups were usually family-sized bands ranging in number
from about a dozen to 75 or more individuals. Until they were attracted to the
Spanish missions, Tobosos bands evidently had no fixed place in which to reside
(Griffin 1969:115). They recognized territories and harvested certain plants
seasonally. One reference to Chisos bands mentions them moving to the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Salado River in the winter and "living in a
nearby mountain where they would provision themselves with meat and hides
from the buffalo they hunted there" (Griffin 1969:93). Griffin believes that
the reference to the Salado was intended to mean the Pecos River; if so, these
Indians might have been frequenting the many large rock-shelters in the Lower
Pecos - Rio Grande region and hunting bison on the Edwards Plateau and the
adjacent plains to the north (Shafer 1971:4). Although we cannot prove at this
time that these historic Indians are descendants of those responsible for the
archeological sites in Musk Hog Canyon and southwestern Texas, knowledge of
their lifeways may give us some insight into the lifeways of prehistoric hunting
and gathering populations of this area.

RING MIDDENS: AN OVERVIEW

The purpose of this section is to provide the reader with a synthesis of current information relating to ring middens of southwest Texas and adjacent
areas, the types of data collected, and theories about the functions of certain
categories of artifacts.

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

25

Location
According to Greer (1965:41), ring middens, or midden circles, are widely
distributed in central and western Texas, the Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico, east-central Arizona, northern Chihuahua and other parts
of northern Mexico, west-central California, and southern Colorado.
Ring middens are one of the most common types of archeological sites in
southwestern Texas. "With the exception of simple hearths, dense accumulations of crescent rings, or circular concentrations of angular fragments of burned
limestone, were the most frequent kind of open cultural deposit observed in
Sanderson Canyon" (Shafer 1971:6).
Burned rock middens make up the largest category of sites at Musk Hog
Canyon, with a total of 146 midden sites recorded. An additional 73 sites
described as burned rock scatters also were recorded, and it is possible that at
least some of these sites are small burned rock middens.
In the western part of the Lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos areas, ring middens
have been reported in the following counties: Brewster (Mallouf and Tunnell
1977), Culberson (Katz 1978), Hudspeth (Johnson 1977; Lynn and Baskin
1975; Skinner, Steed and Bearden 1973), Pecos (Shafer 1971), Presidio (Johnson 1977), Sutton (Jarvis and Crawford 1974), Terrell (Shafer 197!), E1 Paso
(Greer 1968a), and Val Verde (Shafer 1971 ; Greer 1968b).
According to Greer (1968a:39), ring middens in Crockett, Sutton, and Val
Verde counties are typically located in regions of low hills and fairly wide canyons. Another type of Texas ring midden site, located in E1 Paso County, is
on a flat, sandy desert section of the mountain and basin region east of E1 Paso
(Greer 1968a:39-40). Greer (1968a) also describes sites in Colorado and New
Mexico. A ring midden site east of Trinidad, in southeastern Colorado, "is on
the open plains and next to a large canyon" (Greer 1968a:40). The sites in
southern New Mexico are in the Guadalupe Mountains of Carlsbad Caverns
National Park, just north of Culberson County, Texas. Greer (1968a:40) states
that one site (with three tested middens) is at the base of the mountains, while
two others are on top of an escarpment (600 to 1300 feet high) which overlooks
the desert flats to the east and south.
Sites with burned rock middens have been recorded in the mouths of rockshelters as well as in open areas. One of the large burned rock middens in Hinds
Cave provides an excellent opportunity to compare a shelter midden with those
typically located in open-air settings. According to Greer (1968a:45-46), several
types of midden circles and mescal pits are commonly found in front of or inside
rock-shelters (Greer’s Type II and Type III midden circles and Type IV mescal
pits).
Age

Ring middens appear to be a relatively late prehistoric and historic cultural
innovation in southwestern Texas. Age determination of ring middens is based
on cross-dating of projectile points found in midden-bearing sites and radiocarbon dating of organic materials found in the middens.
According to Sharer (1971:7), cross-dating of projectile points such as Ensor,
Frio, and Paisano, which have been collected from crescent middens, has allowed
tentative placement of these sites in contexts ranging from late prehistoric to
historic (200 B.C. to A.D. 1600). This estimate is based on the Lower Pecos

26

Texas Archeological Society

chronology developed by Story and Bryant (1966), and it is also supported in
part by the sequence at Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967).
Ensor, Frio, and Paisano dart point types, as well as various unnamed sidenotched and corner-notched varieties, constitute the majority of projectile point
forms collected from crescent middens in Sanderson Canyon, with 7 of 11 dart
points falling into the above categories (Shafer 1971).
Similar evidence was found in Sutton County by Jarvis and Crawford (1974).
They tested several ring middens, and Ensor and Frio accounted for 13 of the 23
identifiable dart point types. At Musk Hog Canyon 14 of the 16 dart points
collected from the surface of several ring middens were side-notched forms
similar to Ensor, Frio, and Paisano.
Earlier projectile point forms have also been recorded. From Sutton County,
Marcos, Montell, Pedernales, Martindale, and Gower dart points were excavated
from two ring midden locations. A Langtry point was collected from the surface
of a ring midden during the Sanderson County reconnaissance (Shafer 1971).
Although the presence of these relatively early projectile point forms appears
to indicate an early beginning for ring middens, it must be remembered that
their presence alone does not lend much credence to such hypothesis. Other
factors must be considered before such a statement can be made. For example,
the Langtry point listed above was collected from the surface and cannot be
associated definitely with the midden and the activities associated with it. The
other early points listed above could have been reused and abandoned by later
groups who constructed and used the ring middens. According to Harry Shafer
(1979:personal communication), the Martindale and Gower points from Sutton
County are questionable and may actually be Ensor or Frio types. Also, such
Early and Middle Archaic points are not consistent with the radiocarbon dates
from this area (see Table 1).
An alternative function for ring middens has been suggested by Greet (1968b).
He hypothesized that a crescent midden site he tested in Val Verde County may
have been occupied more than once; the burned rock accumulations provided
convenient foundations on which temporary dwellings may have been constructed. No sound archeological or ethnographical evidence has yet been unearthed to support this statement (Harry Shafer 1980 :personal communication).
Physical Characteristics of Ring Middens
Ring middens of several varieties are found in southwestern Texas, but not
all kinds of ring middens were necessarily used for cooking or processing plants.
Ring middens in Sutton County, Texas, are accumulations of fire-cracked
rocks:
¯ . . deposited in a mounded circle with one side usually slightly higher than
the other. The center of the accumulation usually has a wide, shallow depression, often containing a dark, ashy soil mixed with a few burned rock
fragments¯ The features range in size from large, circular accumulations
measuring forty to fifty feet in diameter, to small, shallow circular or crescent-shaped, ten to twenty feet in diameter (Jarvis and Crawford 1974: 1).
Ring middens have been divided into the following types:

1. Small, low, circular middens with rock and ash rims
2. Larger, steeper circular middens with rims made almost entirely of firecracked rocks but with no ash rims

Semicircular middens with no obvious subsurface depressions
Scattered rocks surrounding wide subsurface depressions (rarely observed

form)
6. Oval-shaped with the central depression toward one end; ash is found in
the rim and the high side is very wide (Greer 1975:5)
According to Greer (1975:6), middens sometimes contain several stone4ined,
basin-shaped hearths superimposed in the centers. Some of these exhibit single
or overlapping stone4ined hearth depressions. The hearths vary greatly in form,
and it may be difficult to distinguish between stone-lined central hearths and
stone-lined earth ovens.
Three types of concentrations of angular fragments of burned limestone rocks
were recorded in the Sanderson Canyon watershed (Shafer 1971:6-7). The most
common is a crescent-shaped accumulation with flat or depressed ashy areas
between the open ends of the crescent. A smaller, dome-shaped accumulation
often extends across the depression (or open area) from the concave part of the
crescent-shaped deposit.
One of the burned rock features from Hinds Cave described above is tentatively dated to Period B (7000 B.C. to 4000 B.C.) (Table 1) in the Lower Pecos
sequence based on the association of sma!l, thin, barbed points with fish-tail
bases. These fish-tail points are classified as Bandy points by Word and Douglas
(1970:21). This burned rock feature is not a true ring midden, and the date

28

Texas Archeological Society

assigned to it is not necessarily applicable to open-air ring middens. However,
the area in which this feature occurred apparently was used in the preparation
of desert succulents in much the same manner as were the open-air middens.
If this is true, and if this feature has been dated correctly, there is strong evidence that prehistoric populations in the Lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos areas of
Texas changed their adaptive strategy very little for at least 5000 years, and
possibly for as long as 9000 years as Dering (1979) has suggested.

Eighteen radiocarbon dates are reported by Greer (1968a:42) for ring middens in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Dates for sites in Texas were obtained from Crockett, E1 Paso, Sutton, and Val Verde counties. Seven of the ten
dates for Texas sites cluster between A.D. 1240_+80 (Tx-362) and A.D. 1410+
100 (Tx-358). Three earlier dates of 610+100 B.C. (Tx-291), A.D. 990_+80
(Tx-363), and A.D. 10!0_+120 (Tx-310) years suggest that the use of ring
middens in open-air settings may be somewhat older than has been previously
believed.
Function
Among those who have studied middens, the consensus is that ring middens,
crescent middens, and other circular burned rock accumulations in southwestern
Texas and other parts of the Southwest functioned as areas of plant processing
and baking, using an earth oven principle.
Greer (!968a) divides ring middens into two categories: midden circles and
mescal pits. According to his studies (Greer 1968a:39), "midden circles are the
remains of the surface hearths from which the broken stones have been thrown
back in a circle producing a mound of rocks and ash with a central depressed
area of ash." He views mescal pits as the remains of earth ovens. The mounds
of burned rocks and ash are the result of raking back the coals and broken slabs
after plant baking.
Ring middens have also been referred to as doughnut middens, circle mounds,
cooking mounds, cooking pits, sotol pits, earth ovens, circular middens, midden
circles, and mescal pits. The association of massive charcoal deposits, together
with overcooked plant remains and cut leaf bases of processed plants, in the
burned rock midden in Hinds Cave is strong evidence that this shelter midden
was used as a plant preparation site in much the same way as open-air ring middens are believed to have functioned.
The open ends of the crescents in the middens recorded during this survey are
oriented toward the east, southeast, or south (Shafer 1975:6). This is consistent
with Greer’s (1975:7) statement that "middens with a northerly dip (wind from
the north) are exceedingly rare."
Site 41TE48 is a good example of a crescent burned rock midden. The main
burned rock concentration is facing south-southeast. The highest and thickest (in width) portion of the deposit is at the west side where the burned
rock reaches a height of approximately 4 feet. From the highest point, the
accumulation grades down to the ground level at each point of the crescent.
At the open end just beyond the two arms is a small, dome-shaped accumulation of burned rock slightly over 1 foot high and some 5 feet in diameter.
In the center of the feature between the arms of the crescent is a depression
about 10 feet in diameter. Ashy matrix occurs in the central area of the feature and around (perhaps beneath) the smaller burned rock deposit. The
diameter of the midden is about 50 feet (Shafer 1971:6).

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

29

Some variations were noted in the morphology of the crescent-shaped middens in Sanderson Canyon. Shafer (1971:7) found the following differences:
(1) the absence of the smaller burned rock deposit at some middens, (2) a
central pit (not always obvious in some middens), (3) slight variation in the
orientation of the open end and, (4) variations in height and overall size of the
accumulations.
The second type is a circular pavement of burned rock fragments 7.6 to 12.2
meters (25 to 40 feet) in diameter, which appear as oval-shaped pavements of
burned rock fragments (Shafer 1971:7). Pits or vacant areas in the center are
not obvious at these sites, and the accumulated rock fragments are not significantly thick.
Artifacts Associated with Ring Middens
Ring middens are not usually associated with numerous artifacts. Often the
central depression or pit area is completely devoid of artifacts. A typical site is
described as follows:
¯ . . other than burned rock, the occupational debris occurring on the site
may include flint flakes, chipped stone artifacts, snail and mussel shells,
fragments of animal bones, battering and grinding tools and, in some areas,
pottery sherds. In most cases lithic artifacts are absent or very sparse (Jarvis
and Crawford 1974: 1).

As noted previously, dart points typically found in ring middens are sidenotched forms such as Ensor, Frio, and Paisano. Occasionally older forms such
as Montell, Marcos, and Pedernales are recorded. Arrow points are sometimes
recovered from the upper levels and from surface collections (Jarvis and Crawford 1974:13). Other types of artifacts believed to be associated with ring
middens are burins, unifaces, gravers, battering and grinding tools, knives, end
scrapers, drills, altered flakes, projectile point preforms, and miscellaneous
bifaces.
Lithic materials in the form of debitage are consistently the largest category
in virtually every assemblage. For example, debitage from the Perro Salvaje
site (41SU2) in Sutton County included 5948 flakes but only 592 tools and
altered flakes (Jarvis and Crawford 1974).
Plant Remains A ssociated with Ring Middens

Identifiable plant remains from ring middens are typically sparse, due at
least in part to the rapid deterioration of organic materials exposed in open-air
sites. The Sanderson Canyon watershed is one of the few areas in which plant
remains have been recorded in open-air middens. At site 41TE50, for example,
charred cut leaf bases were recovered from a late crescent-shaped midden, and
these macrofossils are believed to be the remains of sotol (DasylMon sp.) and
lechuguilla (Agave sp.) (Shafer 1970).
Identifiable plant remains have also been recovered from the burned rock
midden in Hinds Cave. Plant macrofossils such as sotol and lechuguilla, in the
form of overcooked plant remains and cut leaf bases of processed plants, constituted the major part of plant remains from this feature (Dering 1976).
Faunal Remains A ssociated with Ring Middens
Faunal remains are not very common in ring midden sites. At the Perro
Salvaje site only small quantities of bone (identified as deer, cottontail rabbit,

30

Texas Archeological Society

rodent, and bird) were recovered (Jarvis and Crawford 1974:25). Fragments
of bone were also recovered from the Pecos Terrace and Divide Windmill sites
at Musk Hog Canyon, but the fragments were few in number and have not been
identified at this time.
Snail shells make up the greatest body of faunal material recovered from both
Perro Salvaje and the excailated ring middens at Musk Hog Canyon. According
to Jarvis and Crawford (1974:25), the shells found in Sutton County have been
identified as land snails (Polygyra texasiana and Rabdotus sp.). The shells from
Musk Hog Canyon have not been identified at this time. Mussel shells constituted a significant portion of the midden fill at the Pecos Terrace site; mussels
were also present at the Divide Windmill site and Eiserer Shelter but only in
small quantities.
Ethnographic A nalogy

Several historical accounts briefly describe the Lipan Apache and Yuma
Indian techniques of plant preparation in earth ovens or rock-lined pits. One
such account is by F.M. Buckelew, a captive for many years among the Lipan
Apache, who describes the preparation of sotol as follows:
In the preparation of this plant for food, large quantities of the bulb were
gathered and collected in a place suitable for a large kiln. A large circular
hole was then dug three or four feet and several feet in diameter. In this
hole they would place a large pile of wood and rock in such a way that the
rock would become thoroughly heated by the time the wood was consumed.
The rocks were then placed in such a way that the soto (sic) could be placed
on and around them. When this was completed, brush and leaves were placed
next to the soto, and the entire heap covered with dirt so as to make it airtight. This was allowed to remain several days during which time the heat
from the rocks would thoroughly cook it. When satisfied that the contents
were thoroughly cooked, they would remove the dirt and leaves, exposing a
glistening white heap of crisp soto. The bulbs were then spread out in the sun
where they could dry. When perfectly dry the flakes or thin layers would
spearate easily. This completed, the task of preparing it for food was just
begun, as it was necessary to make large holes in rocks or logs in which the
soto was placed when it was beaten and ground by large wooden pestles until
it resembled white flour. The flour was then mixed with water and made
into small cakes and baked in the ashes and embers of a fire (Dennis and
Dennis 1925:72-73).

Accounts of the processing of mescal by the Apache (Lipan?) are provided
by Opler. Apache women, unless they lived near a mescal source,
¯ . . make a long trip to obtain it, establish a temporary camp, and prepare
it there before returning home. When many crowns are to be baked, a large
pit must be dug and many rocks transported to it . . . (Opler 1941:356).
Opler (1941:357) goes on to say that when men accompany the women on
such a trip, they dig the pit while the women gather the yucca stalks. He describes the pits as follows:
¯ . . round, seven feet or more across and three or four feet deep. This hole is
lined evenly with rocks¯ Then a pile of wood is brought¯ This is put into the
hole in criss-cross layers, first a layer one way and then a second layer the
other¯ It is built up like this until the pit is just about full. Then more rocks
are put on top of this wood. Fire is touched to it (Opler 194! :356).

Another account of the preparation of mescal in an earth pit states that:

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

31

Mescal pits are usually circular depressions in the ground, a foot to 3 feet in
depth, and lined with coarse gravel. A fire was built in the pit, raked out
after the stones became hot, and the mescal plants put in and covered with
grass. After two days’ steaming the pile was opened and the mescal was ready
for consumption (Hough 1959:846).
The White Mountain and San Carlos Apache groups of east-central Arizona
also exploited mescal. Their method of gathering and processing this plant is
described below:
¯ . . a large pit is dug and filled with dry wood, on which a large quantity of
stones is piled. The wood is then ignited and when it burns down to live coals
and the stones to a white heat, wet twigs, rushes or flags are quickly placed
on them to a thickness of about a foot. The mescal roots are then hurled
on the smoking mass, wet grass and twigs placed over them, and then all the
whole is snugly covered over with a foot or more of earth. A fire is then
kindled over this pile and kept burning. The cooking continues for about
twenty-four hours¯ This pit is then opened and the tubers taken out ...
(Reagan 1930:293).

Mesquite prepared in earth ovens was also eaten by the Yuma Indians:
The mesquite pods.., were cooked in a pit 3-15 feet in diameter and 3-5 feet
deep, which was lined with mature pods, covered with arrow-weed, wetted
to facilitate sweetening, covered with dirt, and then left for generally 30 days.
Sometimes a fire was built on it to hasten the process (Lynn and Baskin
1975:16-17).

In a similar manner, corn was prepared by the earth oven principle by the
White Mountain and San Carlos Apaches:
¯ . . a pit is dug and a large quantity of wood thrown into it. On this, stones
are piled. The wood is then ignited. When it has burned down to live coat
stage, the wet grass, twigs or cornhusks are piled in and then the green corn
with the shucks on is hurriedly thrown on. The corn is covered with more
wet grass or corn fodder and about six inches of dirt is heaped over the pile.
Just before closing in the top a quantity of water is poured in, to make
steam. The cooking process is then allowed to take its course for twentyfour hours, when the dirt is removed and the corn taken out .... The abandoned pit is left as sort of a mound for the speculation of future generations
(Reagan 1930:292).

The distribution of earth ovens used in the preparation of mescal in historic
times has been discussed by several people. Probably the most prominent groups
who prepared mescal in pits were the Mescalero (Schroeder 1960) and other
Apache groups (Reagan 1930; Opler 1941), and the Navajo (Greer 1965:53).
According to Spier (1928:119), "mescal (agave) is gathered and roasted in pits
by most, if not all, the non-Puebloan peoples and perhaps by the Pueblo and
Mexican tribes as well. It is an item of some importance for the Jicarilla, Mescalero, White Mountain and San Carlos Apache, Navajo, Havasupai, Paiute, Yavapai, Pima, Cahuilla, and Huichol." The Cochimi, Sonora, Sinaloa, Culican,
Concho, and Jumano tribes are listed by Beals (1932:164) as mescal roasters.
He also reports the use of pit ovens for agave in the Mexican states of Nuevo
Leon, Jatisco, and Mexico.
The bulbs at the base of the upper leaves of the mescal were used in the
preparation of an intoxicating beverage (Reagan 1930). This practice extended
from the Fort Apache region in Arizona into northern Chihuahua (Greer 1965:

32

Texas Archeological Society

50). Greer (1965:49) also mentions that in some areas of northern Chihuahua
mescal is used in the preparation of candy.
According to Spier (1928:106), mescal was used by the Havasupai to make
paint. The paint was made by boiling the rocks at the bottom of the pit to
dissolve the mescal juices that had dried onto the stones during roasting. Red
paint was added to this juice and the mixture was boiled until it reached a
doughy consistency. Then it was rolled into a small ball which was used as a
crayon or mixed with water to form a liquid paint.
The above references are presented in order to demonstrate the varied uses of
earth ovens by Indians in historic times in Texas and the Southwest. The writer
is not postulating that the ring middens at Musk Hog Canyon were used for all
of the purposes mentioned above.
Not all cooking pits are necessarily old, as some desert succulents are still
being exploited. According to Greer (1965:50), abandoned pits used in the
modern-day production of intoxicating drinks from sotol resemble his Type I
mescal pit, and the surface features conform to his Type IB midden circles.
The techniques used by a small group of Mexican nationals processing yucca
(Yucca treculeana) in eastern Zavala County in the 1970s is described as an
activity that may closely resemble the techniques by which local prehistoric
groups harvested yucca (Hill, Holdsworth, an d Hester 1976:19-21).

SITE DESCRIPTIONS AND ARTIFACT COLLECTION PROCEDURES

Pecos Terrace Site (41CX218)
The Pecos Terrace site is a moderate sized ring-shaped (circular), burned
rock midden situated on a terrace of the Pecos River near the mouth of the
arroyo draining Musk Hog Canyon (Figure 2). This site was selected for testing
because of the ring-shaped feature on its surface, its proximity to the Pecos
River, and its floodplain setting.
The major component of the Pecos Terrace site is the accumulation of angular fragments of fire-cracked limestone cobbles and dark gray ashy soil containing mussel shells, snail shells, and lithic artifacts (listed in order of frequency). The mounding of discarded rock fragments around a central depression has resulted in a ring-shaped feature (Figure 3). Dimensions of the principal
midden were 12.2 meters north to south and 13.2 meters east to west. The
central depression measures about 7 meters north to south (ridge crest to ridge
crest). The height and rock mass of the midden ring are greatest on the north,
where the mounding reaches 75 cm; a secondary mounding on the south side
reaches about 50 cm. The highest point is about 80 cm. Alluvial fill postdating
midden use covers much of the outer apron of burned rock. Evidence provided
by the excavation indicates that much of the regular caliche/limestone bedrock
was exposed at the time the midden was in use.
The objectives of testing this site were (1) to expose a profile through the
center of the midden in order to examine its structure and explore for a central
pit-oven, (2) to recover charcoal for radiocarbon dating and botanical analysis,
and (3) to recover a representative artifact sample (Shafer and Moore 1976:
4). It was also hoped that this site and its artifacts could be used in a study that
might suggest a broad time frame for burned rock midden use, and that it

might help to delineate activity or behavior sets associated with midden function.
EXCAVATION
E. Mott Davis supervised the test excavations at the Pecos Terrace site.
Horizontal control was maintained by establishing north-south and east-west
base lines that intersected at the approximate center of the midden (Figure 3).
Using this intersection, designated N50/W50, as the basic reference, a grid
system was established. Excavation was carried out in 1-meter squares and 1by 2-meter rectangles excavated in 10-cm levels. All loose soil was passed
through quarter-inch (6.4 mm) hardware cloth to facilitate recovery of small
artifacts and botanical and faunal materials. Most digging was with small hand
tools such as trowels and brushes.
Aside from the midden itself, the only structural feature encountered in the
excavation was a slab-lined, rubble-filled central hearth. This feature was located

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

35

beneath the approximate center of the central depression in the midden. The
hearth was in a natural depression in the bedrock and was lined with slabs of
slightly to moderately stream worn limestone rocks, possibly gathered from
walls of the nearby arroyo draining Musk Hog Canyon. The hearth measured
about 2 meters in diameter, was roughly circular, and varied in depth from
about 15 to 30 cm below the surrounding bedrock. The actual depth of the
hearth could not be determined precisely, but was probably greather than 30
cm.

The central hearth was probably the focal point for baking activities that
produced the burned rock rubble forming the midden. If so, the hearth was
used many times. Its volume, estimated at between 0.80 and 1.0 meters3
suggests a capacity adequate for processing a large quantity of plant foods
(Harry Shafer 1980:personal communication). Attempts to recover sufficient
charred plant material and charcoal for dating were not successful.
SURFACE COLLECTION
According to Davis (1976:46), intensive surface collections were conducted
in transects extending north-, east-, south-, and westward from the midden.
This strategy was not intended to produce a complete collection but was rather
intended to provide an indication of the relative distribution of debitage on the
surface (Davis 1976:48).

Divide Windmill Site (41CX241)
The Divide Windmill site is on a mesa overlooking an intermittent stream that
flows eastward draining Musk Hog Canyon (Figure 2) and contains at least four
burned rock middens and at least two confirmed areas of ashy midden deposits
(Figure 4). Jack T. Hughes supervised the excavations, which, due to the large
area of occupation, were more extensive here than at any other site in the canyon.

EXCAVA~ON
Excavations at the Divide Windmill site consisted of four excavation areas
(Figure 4). Two of the four burned rock middens on the site were tested--one
in Area 1, and one in Area 3. Both of these middens are of the crescent-shaped
variety, with the crescent-shaped burned rock deposit forming the north-northwest rims.
Excavation Area I

Excavation Area 1 was in the larger of the two middens examined. The area
yielded the remains of a large central pit and enough charcoal for dating purposes (radiocarbon analysis is not yet completed). Hughes (1976) believes this
burned rock midden is an example of a creeping midden as defined by Greer
(1975). The term creeping midden refers to the apparent gradual movement of
the mass of burned rocks that make up the outer perimeter of these features.
Its configuration is a result of the practice by the users of the midden of tossing
the burned and broken rocks from the hearth into basically the same area,
relative to the hearth, following each use. The accumulation of burned rocks
grows and as new pits are dug the middens actually do creep as the burned rocks

are tossed over and over again into the areas previously occupied by the hearths.
The midden in Area 1 of the Divide Windmill site shows evidence of reuse that
resulted in creep to the south (Harry Sharer 1980:personal communication).
The pit Fall consisted of sooty soil and burned rock fragments, with some
snail-shell and wood fragments. The pit was lined with limestone slabs, and the
bedrock basin was as much as 80 cm deep. Excavation Area 1 was tested by a 1by 5-meter trench that crossed the center of a probable baking pit, extending
from a small rock heap on the south to a large rock heap on the north (Figure

4).
Excavation Area 2

This is one of the ashy midden areas of Area 1. The excavation consisted of
ten alternating 1-meter squares in a 2- by 10-meter rectangle (Figure 4). The
excavation was in lo-cm levels, and all soil was passed through quarter-inch
(6.4 mm) hardware cloth. Material recovered from Area 2 included mussel
shell, snails, unidentified bone, charcoal, a few fragments of wood, and lithic
flakes.

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

37

Excavation Area 3
Area 3 consists of a small crescent-shaped midden east of Areas 1 and 2
(Figure 4), apparently built around a pit oven that was used perhaps only
twice (Shafer and Moore 1976:6). Using the volume of the burned rock in
Area 3, Hughes intends to calculate the approximate intensity of use for this
part of the site (this information is not available at this time). The crest (north
side) of the midden is 20 cm above the original ground surface. The excavation
at Area 3 was a row of four 1-meter squares (Figure 4). Vertical control was
maintained by 10-cm levels.
Excavation Area 4
The three squares dug at Area 4 bisected what Hughes (1976:4) describes as
a "high dark earth spot." Vertical control was maintained by 10-cm levels
(Figure 4).
SURFACE COLLECTION
Surface collecting was organized by superimposing a grid of 91.44-meter
(100-yard) squares over the site and the surrounding catchment area, by dividing
the grid into four 45.72-meter (50-yard) quadrants labeled NW, NE, SW, SE,
and subdividing each quadrant into four 22.86-meter (25-yard) squares to
facilitate horizontal control (Figure 4). All artifacts were collected from the
surface of each square.
Eiserer Shelter Site (41CX133)
The Eiserer Shelter site is a small rock-shelter south and west of the Divide
Windmill site (Figure 2). The drip line of the overhang is about 12 meters long,
and the shelter is 6 meters deep. The highest point in the shelter is 2.75 meters
(Alvin Lynn 1980:personal communication) (Figure 5). Along the south wall
is a highly polished rock bench about 2.5 meters long. Near and on this bench
are several mortar holes, and on the roof are some red and yellow monochrome
pictographs. The site survey form for this site lists the shelter as undisturbed
with about 1 meter of fall. The mortar holes are described as being "in various
stages of use" (that is, of various depths). Copious amounts of burned rock and
flint debitage were scattered on the steep talus slope. Jane Schweitzer (1980:
personal communication), one of the crew chiefs, stated that an aboriginal path
from the mesa top down to the rock-shelter was still visible. The center of the
shelter was littered with roof spalls and occupational fill, and a large juniper tree
was growing there. The remainder of the shelter was mainly exposed bedrock.
According to crew chiefs Jane Schweitzer (1980:personal communication) and
Jim Warren (1980:personal communication), no significant amounts of burned
rock were visible in the shelter. Most of the burned rock was scattered along
the talus slope.
EXCAVATION
Escavation at the Eiserer Shelter site was under the direction of Jim Warren
and Jane Schweitzer, with assistance from Alvin Lynn. Two groups of 1-meter
squares were excavated, four inside the shelter and four along the talus slope
(Figure 5).

Rock Shelter Excavation

Four 1-meter squres, 1E through 4E (designated by the stakes at the southwest corners) were excavated in the south end of the shelter (Figure 5). The
datum point is at the right corner of the shelter, at the southern end of the
roughly north-south base line. Two of the excavation units were on the base
line 2 meters north of the datum point; the other two were directly east, making
an excavation area 4 meters on each side (Figure 5). This part of the shelter
was selected for excavation because it offered the best opportunity for recovery
of cultural material with the least amount of interference from roof spalls and
the large juniper tree in the center of the shelter (Harry Shafer 1980:personal
communication).
An inconsistency in the labeling of the excavation units has made it difficult
to separate the artifacts recovered from the shelter excavation from those
recovered from the surface of the talus slope. The excavation units in the rockshelter were initially referred to as 1E through 4E. Later, however, they were
changed to 1S through 4S. This is confusing because some of the surface collection units were also labeled -1S through 4S. In order to interpret the artifacts
properly, the lot number for each specimen had to be consulted before it could
be assigned to one area or the other. As a result, the artifacts with S numbers
but no lot numbers were not included in this report.
Talus Slope Excavation
The four 1-meter squares (A-D) excavated on the talus slope were set up from
the bottom to the top of the slope (west to east) (Figure 6). The datum point
for these units was fixed to the center of the juniper tree in the mouth of the
shelter, and they are designated by the stakes at the southeast corners of the
squares. Excavation unit A, for example, is called W7/NO. Because of the steepness of the slope, these units were dug to different depths. Excavation unit A
was taken to 100 cm, but excavation unit C was dug only to 60 cm. Excavation
was started at the bottom of the slope so that debris and activities associated
with the excavation procedures would not disturb any units below the one being
excavated. There was not enough time to dig more than four units. Also, cactus
and other plants growing on the slope interfered with digging operations in parts
of this trench (Alvin Lynn 1980 :personal communication).
SURFACE COLLECTION
Two separate surface collections are recorded for the Eiserer Shelter site: a
random collection taken from inside the shelter, and a controlled collection
from the talus slope.
Rock-Shelter Surface Collection
The collection from inside the shelter consists entirely of artifacts that were
found on the surface (Jim Warren 1980:personal communication). No details
of provenience were recorded for any of these materials.
Talus Slope Surface Collection
The collection from the surface of the talus slope came from eight 5- by 10meter collection units (Figure 6). The same datum point used for the talus slope

excavation was used for the surface collection. Units 1N4N and 1S4S were
laid out on both sides east of the east-west base line that extends from the
datum point at the center of the north-south base line down the middle of the
talus slope (Figure 6). The crews advanced from the bottom of the talus slope,
collecting the artifacts that were visible on the surface. The crews made only
one pass up the slope, so it cannot be assumed that all of the surface artifacts
were recovered.

ARTIFACT CATEGORIES
Except for two ground stone tools (a mano from the Divide Windmill site
and a possible grinding stone or metate from the Pecos Terrace site) all of the
lithic artifacts from the sites dug in Musk Hog Canyon are of chipped stone.
In this report the artifacts are divided into two major categories: tools and
debitage. In this part of the report the surface collections are treated separately

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

41

from the excavated artifacts, but for the formulation of conclusions and inferences the artifacts recovered from each site are grouped together, regardless
of how they were recovered.
Too!s
Tools recovered from Musk Hog Canyon include projectile points, stemless
bifaces, battered stone tools, miscellaneous graverlike implements, unifaces,
burins, manos, and ground stone tools.
Some of the specimens described below may never have been used as tools,
but it is postulated here that the flint knappers who made them envisioned
tools as the end products of their work.
Certain problems are encountered in the study of artifacts and their intended
functions. Ideally, for an artifact to be classified as a tool, some evidence of
wear should be present. When no such evidence is present, identification of
specific tools and their probable functions poses problems. For example, it is
known from ethnographic accounts that arrow points were hafted to the ends
of shafts and were used in combination with bows for hunting and warfare,
and as a result they are routinely classified as projectile points whenever they
are encountered in lithic assemblages. But in many cases the functions of artifacts cannot be ascertained from shape alone, although archeologists commonly
assign function to points solely on that basis. It is quite possible that some
artifacts that are assumed to be projectile points may have functioned as knives
or as other implements (Harry Shafer 1979 :personal communication).
A different kind of problem is posed by flakes collected from the surface,
which often appear to be marginally retouched when in reality they have been
fractured by fortuitous contact between the hooves of cows, horses, and other
large animals and rocky surfaces. For that reason, only those specimens recovered from excavations were examined for possible retouching.
BIFACE TOOLS

Biface tools are divided into the following categories: projectile points,
Group 1 stemless bifaces, battered stone, and gravers, all of which are considered manufacturing end products. The bifacially flaked artifacts that were
broken in the manufacturing process-or for some other reason represent failures
in manufacture-are included under debitage.
Projectile Points
The term projectile point is used in an effort to avoid implying the specific
functional interpretations inherent in the more descriptive terms arrow point
and dart point. Artifacts are not included in this category on the basis of shape
None. Several of the items from Musk Hog Canyon have snap fractures that are
typical on artifacts broken as a result of their use as tools. Also, in a foraging
lifeway where food procurement is the predominant activity, it is not likely
that these kinds of artifacts (thinned bifaces, both stemmed and unstemmed)
would have been manufactured for nonutilitarian purposes. Morphological
characteristics such as shape, size, and width also were considered in the classification of artifacts as projectile points. Type names, when applicable, follow
Suhm and Jelks (1962). Projectile points are divided into two categories:

42

Texas Archeological Society

Category 1, Probable Dart Points
Category 1 hlcludes those projectile point forms that are likely to have
functioned as dart points.
Category 2, Probable Arrow Points
Category 2 includes those projectile point forms that are likely to have
functioned as arrow points.
Group 1, Stemless Bifaees
This category includes biface tools that are not classified as projectile pointsfinished artifacts with both percussion and pressure flaking.
Stemless bifaces have been known to function as projectile points (Harry
Shafer 1980:personal communication), but there are no data to support the
assumption that the stemless bifaces from Musk Hog Canyon functioned in that
capacity.
Battered Stone
Artifacts in this category are derived from large flint nodules, are bifaciaUy
worked, and have many hinged flake scars characteristic of edges that have been
struck or battered against other objects. This is not a new category; similar
artifacts have been found in ring midden sites in the Sanderson Canyon watershed (Shafer 1971:31).
Gravers
In this category are small, thin flakes that have been worked bifacially and
have intentionally produced drill-like or punchlike projections.
UNI~ACE TOOLS
Uniface tools from Musk Hog Canyon are divided as follows: categories 1-4
(according to the area that has been flaked), category 5 (end scrapers), category
6 (burins), and category 7 (uniface fragments), all of which appear to represent
manufacturing end products. Items are assigned to categories 1-4 solely on the
basis of their morphological characteristics. All worked edges of these artifacts
are described in terms of the following: (1) the bulb of percussion is at the
proximal end of the artifact, (2) the artifact is viewed with its dorsal surface
at the top and its ventral surface at the bottom.
Category 1, Unifaee Tools
These specimens retain the bulb of percussion and are unifacially flaked on
both lateral margins and on the distal part of the dorsal surface.
Category 2, Uniface Tools
These specimens retain the bulb of percussion and are unifaciaUy flaked on
the right margin only of the dorsal surface.
Category 3, Uniface Tools
These specimens retain the bulb of percussion and are unifaciaUy flaked on
the left margin and distal end of the dorsal surface.

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

43

Category 4, Uniface Tools
These specimens retain the bulb of percussion and are unifacially flaked on
the left margin of the ventral surface.
Category 5, End Scrapers

End scrapers are characterized by convex and steeply beveled distal ends.
These artifacts are similar to those described by Shafer (1971:31) from Sanderson Canyon as end scrapers, and it is assumed that the specimens from Musk
Hog Canyon functioned in the same capacity.
Category 6, Burins

Burins are unifaces that cannot be placed satisfactorily into any of the above
groups. Most of the tools in this category, in addition to being unifacially
trimmed, have the broad chipped notches in one or both lateral edges that are
characteristic results of application of the burin production technique. These
steep beveled notches served as striking platforms for removal of burin spalls
from edges or ends. The resulting facets are generally found on the dorsal
edges, and the resulting sharp angles of the facets converge with the ventral
surfaces. In some cases the bulbs of percussion have been altered or entirely
removed, giving the resulting tools flat ventral surfaces. Burins both with and
without cortex are present in Musk Hog Canyon. The function of these ubiquitous tools is not clear. According to Shafer (1971:34), the burin technique may
have been used to refurbish tools. The tranchet technique described by Sharer
(1976) is similar to the techniques employed at Musk Hog Canyon (Harry Shafer
1980:personal communication). The edges created by this method can be quite
sharp and could be ideally suited for the processing of desert succulents.
Pitzer (1977:12) mentions several possible uses for burins, including woodworking, leatherworking, engraving of bone, splitting reeds for basketry, and
medical purposes. Giddings (1964:211) states that the term burin "implies a
group of instruments made by a common technique; it does not always imply
equivalence of function."
Uniface Fragments
These fragments do not retain enough of the bulb of percussion to permit
classification.

GROUND STONE TOOLS

Artifacts in this category were formed by grinding and/or abrading motions
rather than by chipping. Usually the only smooth face on a ground stone tool
is the one that has been smoothed by use.
Manos

Tools in this category are typically fashioned from locally obtained cobbles
of sandstone, limestone, and sometimes, stream-worn quartzite (Shafer 1971:
34). Manos are typically associated with plant processing activities such as
grinding corn and seeds, and are common artifacts in ring midden sites in West
Texas and the Trans-Pecos.

44

Texas Archeological Society

Grinding Stones
This category includes metates-also called grinding slabs (Katz 1978:44)and other large stones used for grinding purposes. They differ from manos in
that they are larger and are not hand-held tools.

Debitage

All of the artifacts grouped under this heading lack some of the attributes
of finished tools. In this category are some bifaces that although they could not
have been further thinned, could have been used for some purposes. In this
study, however, artifacts classified as debitage are not tools. They are residue
from specific stages of tool manufacture, and as such they indicate the kinds
of flint-knapping activities that were performed at the site. The debitage is
divided into the following categories: projectile point preforms, Group 2 stemless bifaces, cores, burin spaUs, and flakes. Flakes are further grouped as primary
cortex flakes, secondary cortex flakes, and interior flakes.
PROJECTILE POINT PREFOPdVlS
These stemmed bifaces are considered failures in the projectile point manufacturing process. They occur in the archeological record for several reasons,
including impurities in the stone and poorly struck or improperly placed blows
by the flint knapper.
GROUP 2, STEMLESS BIFACES
Stemless bifaces occur in a variety of shapes and sizes, but each is characterized by obvious percussion chipping by either hard or soft hammer. Some
specimens are apparent failures in the manufacturing process. For example,
several were broken during the removal of a flake, when the flake hinged into
the mass, thus snapping the preform. Others are the result of premature snapping-perhaps along hidden stress lines-of the intended artifact. This is primarily a catchall category, because it includes those stemless bifaces that were
spoiled before completion and thus cannot be identified as specific tools.
CORES
Cores are the nodules from which flakes are removed. The flakes that were
struck from the cores were, in this case, the products desired by the flint knappets; the depleted cores, as residue, are classified as debitage. Cores vary in size
and shape, since cores that have been subjected to extensive reduction are
naturally smaller than ones that have produced only a few flakes or blades.
BURIN SPALLS
Burin spalls are presumably the by-products of the burin retouch technique.
In classic examples the spalls were removed from cores that had unifacially
trimmed edges (Harry Shafer 1979:personal communication). The function of
the unifacial trimming may have been to establish striking platforms for spall
removal. The spalls retain remnants of the trimmed edges on the striking platforms. In cross section the spalls are typically triangular or somewhat rectangular.

FLAKES
Flakes, the residue of tool manufacture, are classified according to the
manufacturing method that produced them and their positions on the cores
from which they were removed.
Primary Cortex Flakes
The outer surfaces of tile initial flake or flakes removed from a patinated
cobble by hard hammer percussion are covered with cortex and are referred
to as primary cortex flakes.
Secondary Cortex Flakes
Secondary cortex flakes retain cortex over part of their dorsal surfaces.
Interior (or Tertiary) Flakes
Flakes with no cortex are caUed interior, or tertiary, flakes.

BIFACE TOOLS
Projectile Points
Category 1, Probable Dart Points (3 specimens, Figure 7, a, b)
One specimen is a side notched Ensor-like point with no distal tip and hingefractures on both faces (Figure 7, a).
Another specimen (Figure 7, b) has long, deep corner notches, a straight
base, and no distal tip. One of the lateral edges appears to have been smoothed
through use, but this cannot be confirmed because materials have been applied
to this edge. Evidence of crushing and grinding of the notch suggests possible
hafting.
Group 1 Stemless Bifaces (2 specimens)
One specimen, consisting only of the basal part, has parallel margins and a
concave base.
UNIFACE TOOLS (see Table 2)
GROUND STONE TOOLS
Grinding Stones (1 specimen, from Excavation Unit 1,4)
This broken specimen is made from sandstone, is about 2 cm thick, and was
probably about 13 cm long. Both faces are smooth, but one face appears to
have undergone considerably more abrading than the face opposite.
DEBITAGE
Pro]ectile Point Preforms {1 specimen, from Excavation Unit 1B)
This artifact is a small form with a concave base that is broken on both sides,
making it difficult to tell if it was ever side notched.

One specimen (Figure 7, c) is the basal fragment of a side notched form recovered from excavation unit 2E. The other specimen (Figure 7, d) is also side
notched and resembles the Ensor type. The base of the latter is beveled and
slightly concave, and one of the barbs is missing. The presence of large flake
scars near the base of the artifact and the overlapping of smaller flake scars
worked into the blade toward the distal end indicates that the point may have
been resharpened for reuse.

Projectile Points

Category 1, Dart Points (14 specimens, Figure 8, a-n)
The common denominator among the 14 specimens is that side notching is
more pronounced on some than on others (Figure 8, a-m). It is difficult to
classify most of the specimens according to established types. However, all but
four appear to fit into the Ensor, Frio, or Paisano types or variants thereof.
Not all of these specimens are complete, but most retain enough of the basal
ends to enable placement in the dart point category. One additional fragmentary specimen (Figure 8, n) is most likely a dart point also. This artifact
has enou~ of its original shape to make it evident that it originally had barbs
suggestive of a side notched point. This specimen was found just outside the
grid.

51

Category 2, Arrow Points (2 specimens, Figure 8, o-p)
One of these points (Figure 8, o) has concave lateral margins, an elongated
tip (similar to an awl or drill) with short but pronounced barbs, and a contracting base. No type is ascribed to this artifact. The other point (Figure 8,
p) is a fragmented biface lacking a stem, most of its barbs, and the distal tip.
Group 1 Stemless Bifaees (1 specimen, Figure 8, q)
This biface has both percussion and pressure retouch. Pressure flaking is
especially evident along the lateral margins and the base. This artifact is complete, except for two areas near the base on each lateral margin. This specimen
is considered stemless because too much of the artifact is missing to place it in
a corner notched or stemmed category.
Battered Stone Tools (3 specimens, Figure 9, a)
These artifacts have many hinged flake facets characteristic of edges that
have been struck or battered against other objects. These tools are constructed
from large flint nodules and are bifaciaUy worked.
Gravers (2 specimens, Figure 9, b)
Both artifacts are bifacialty worked and have dril14ike or punchlike projections.
UNIFACE TOOLS

Category 1 Unifaee Tools (7specimens, Figure 9, c)
One specimen (Figure 9, c) is polished on the left margin of the ventral surface (not visible in the photograph), making it similar to artifacts from the
Lower Pecos that were used for slicing desert succulents (Shafer 1978).
Category 2 Uniface Tools {1 specimen, Figure 9, d)
The presence of cortex on the left margin and the distal end of this artifact
may have precluded retouching in those areas.
Category 3 Uniface Tools (1 specimen, Figure 9, e)
Cortex is present on the right margin and may have been a factor in the
absence of retouching on this side of the artifact.
Category 4 Uniface Tools (1 specimen, Figure 9, fJ
End Scrapers (4 specimens, Figure 9, g)
Three of the four specimens retain the striking platforms, which are opposite
the unifacially worked distal ends. The flaking on one specimen is carried to
the left margin of the dorsal surface.
Burins (162 specimens, Figure 9, h, i}
Some of the specimens have cortex. Typically, these tools are unifacially
trimmed, and sometimes the bulbs of percussion are either altered or entirely
removed, resulting in flat ventral surfaces. The large size of this sample precludes describing each specimen.

DEBITAGE

Projectile Point Preforms (3 specimens, Figure 10, b)
One specimen has a contracting stem and convex base. The distal tip and a
large part of the blade are missing. Many hinge fractures on both faces of this
specimen reflect the difficulty the craftsman encountered in thinning this artifact. The break probably was due to end shock as defined by Crabtree (1972:
60).
Another specimen is side notched, broken along the medial axis, and is
missing the distal tip.
The third specimen (Figure 10, b) is an apparent failure in the manufacture of
an Ensor dart point. Deep hinge fractures on one face attest to the problems in
thinning this point. The distal tip and one of the barbs are missing. Apparently
the distal tip was broken as a result of end shock. There is no pressure flaking
on this unfinished artifact.
Group 2 Stemless Bifaees (121 specimens, Figure 10, e)
The thinness and well-defined points of some of the specimens suggest that
they might be the distal tips of projectile point manufacturing failures.
Cores (48 specimens, Figure 10, d)
This sample includes both depleted cores that have been subjected to extensive reduction and cores that have had only a few flakes removed. Some retain
part of the cortex, while others have none.

Summary
The artifact collections from the sites in Musk Hog Canyon are similar to
assemblages from the other ring midden sites in southwestern Texas. The presence of only chipped and ground stone artifacts at Musk Hog Canyon is consistent with the artifact inventories from Sanderson Canyon (Shafer 1971)
and Sutton County (Jarvis and Crawford 1974), and the point types are consistent with the ones found at the sites mentioned by Greer (1965, t968a).
The majority of the dart points from Musk Hog Canyon are side notched forms
resembling Ensor, Frio, and Paisano points, but at least one Langtry point and
a few corner notched varieties were found.
The small proportion of arrow points in the projectile point sample is another
similarity between Musk Hog Canyon and the Sanderson Canyon and Sutton
County sites. Shafer (1971:30) mentions only one arrow point recovered from
Sutton County excavations. Only six arrow points were recovered from Musk
Hog Canyon.
Burins and unifaces constitute the largest tool category from Musk Hog
Canyon, but these artifacts were recovered by both surface collection and
excavation and cannot be compared with Sanderson Canyon data that were recovered only by surface collection. Since Jarvis and Crawford (1974:17) record
only three burins from Sutton County and do not list a uniface category, the
artifact inventory from their excavation cannot be used for comparative purposes. However, if the 117 specimens listed as scrapers are in fact unifacial
tools, their collection is consistent with the data from Musk Hog Canyon.
Debitage, in the form of flakes, is the largest artifact category from Musk
Hog Canyon, as well as from Sanderson Canyon and Sutton County. It was not
possible to study these artifacts intensively for retouching, so a comparison cannot be made with other areas. Jarvis and Crawford (1974:18) reported 227
altered flakes from the excavation of the Perro Salvaje site (41SU2) in Sutton
County.
The artifact inventories from Eiserer Shelter and the open sites are similar.
Flakes are the largest artifact group from this site, as well as from the surfacecollected area. Thus, debitage remains the dominant category in all areas, and
the only area from which tools are present in any numbers is the surface-collected areas of the talus slope.
The ground stone tools from Musk Hog Canyon are typical of those found in
other ring midden sites in southwestern Texas. The only inconsistency with
the other collections is that only two ground stone artifacts were found at Musk
Hog Canyon. Shafer (1971:34-35), for example, reports six manos, three
"pitted hand stones," and one grinding slab collected at Sanderson Canyon.
The small number of such artifacts at Musk Hog Canyon is probably due to the

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

63

activities of relic hunters, who have known about the sites in Musk Hog Canyon
for years (Harry Shafer 1980:personal communication). It is likely that these
distinctive artifacts were removed years ago.
DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS
Lithics

Ring middens are not usually deeply stratified, a fact that precludes a long
temporal range of artifact types, making horizontal analysis a more meaningful
approach. No vertical analyses were made of the Divide Windmill and Pecos
Terrace sites for this report. Areas 3 and 4 of the Divide Windmill site are
omitted from this chapter because of the paucity of artifacts recovered. For
example, only 11 artifacts were recovered from the entire excavation of Area
3. The Eiserer Shelter site also presents special problems of artifact distribution.
Missing field notes, lost artifacts, and the ambiguous grid system for this site
make it difficult to present anything but general statements concerning artifact
distribution. The confusion of data from the two excavated areas from the
shelter was discussed in a letter from Greet Smith, laboratory chief at the field
school, to Harry Shafer. She stated that inadequacies and confusion in labeling
the grid squares in the shelter and on the talus slope made it difficult to separate
the artifacts recovered from the two areas.
The distribution of artifacts for the Eiserer Shelter site is presented here
mainly in terms of the two major collection units. For example, the artifacts
that can be identified as coming from within the rock-shelter are discussed
separately from those identified as coming from the talus slope. Statements
relating to vertical distribution are made when possible, but only general conclusions can be presented in regard to this site.
The purpose of horizontal distributional analysis is to correlate cultural
material recorded during excavation or surface collecting activities according to
its location within the site matrix. This kind of information is useful in determining the areal usage of a site. Artifact concentrations and variations from area
to area can be then used to define various activity areas.
Unfortunately, horizontal analysis often represents only a general picture of
the site area in spatial terms, particularly when the materials are collected from
large units. At the Divide Windmill site, for example, the surface collected materials were taken from a gridded area of 91.44 square meters (100 square
yards). Tt~s area was subdivided, making each collection unit 22.86 square
meters (25 square yards). These smaller collection units are still too large for
recognition of artifact concentrations, except in a general sense. Jarvis and
Crawford (1974:29), in their study of ring middens in Sutton County, Texas,
included an illustration depicting areas of large concentrations of chipping debris
around a midden at site 41SU2. This was possible because their controlled
surface collection was conducted in 3.10-meter (10-foot) squares. They (Jarvis
and Crawford 1974:30) were able to identify concentrations of chipping debitage south and east of the midden. This was correlated with wind direction and
its possible effect on certain site-related activities during cooking operations.
They were also able to correlate the relationship between chipping debris and
the horizontal scattering of other artifact types. This kind of comparison was
not possible at the Divide Windmill site due to the large size of the collection
units.

DIVIDE WINDMILL SITE (41CX241)

Surface Collection
Most of the surface collected materials were expected to cluster around the
individual features within the Divide Windmill site, and the largest concentrations are in fact in the same squares as, or adjacent squares to, the features.
Excavation Areas 1 and 2, as well as the largest concentrations of burned rock,
are in the southeast quarter of the northwest quadrant (Figure 4). This unit
consistently produced large numbers of all artifact categories. These numbers
decrease significantly to the north, but the numbers increase to the south and
east of the burned rock concentrations. No artifacts were taken from the surface of the northeast quarter of the southwest quadrant, where Excavation Area
4 is located. The increase in artifacts to the south of site areas is consistent with
the observations of Jarvis and Crawford (1974) in Sutton County, and according
to Davis (1976:47), amateur archeologists from the Musk Hog Canyon area also
say that more cultural material is typically found south of the middens in that
area. Possibly the wind, predominantly from the southwest or southeast during
prehistoric times, was a factor in determining activity areas at Musk Hog Canyon, as hypothesized by Jarvis and Crawford for Sutton County.
If the area of high chipping concentration does indeed represent some
sort of living or working zone related to the midden, there must have been
factors, natural or otherwise, that made this area more favorable than
around the midden.
Given that the midden was used for cooking with some regularity, it is
probable that smoke, soot and ash could have been of considerable importance in effecting the location of a living and/or work zone next to the
midden. One would want to be near the midden for convenience and yet
out of the smoke and soot of the cooking fires as much as possible. During
excavations at 41-SU-2, it was noted that the winds were predominantly
from the southeast. If the predominant wind direction has not changed
since the site was occupied, and there are no indications that it should have,
then the zone of highest chipping debris lies directly upwind from the midden. The area to the southeast of the midden thus would have received the
least amount of smoke and soot from any fires being burned at the midden.
It would have been the most comfortable area to occupy in close conjunction to the midden.
Related to the wind direction being the controlling factor in the location
of the living/working area, one physiological feature concerning Midden 1 is
of interest. A ring midden measuring 35 feet in diameter, Midden 1 has its
maximum height, although slight, along its northwestern curve, downwind
from the midden center. It would have been advantageous to throw used,
burnt limestone downwind when clearing an area for a hearth in order to
keep the ashes from blowing back into one’s face. If this procedure was
followed regularly, it would be expected that a larger amount or higher
piling of burnt rocks would accumulate on the downwind side of the ring
midden. In the case of Midden !, this would be the northwest portion of
the midden (Jarvis and Crawford 1974:30).

The large number and variety of artifact type’s from the surface of the
Divide Windmill site indicates a wide range of activities for the site. Flint knapping was practiced to a limited extent at the site, as evidenced by the dart point
preforms, bifaces, and large numbers of flakes. It is logical to assume that other
activities related to flint knapping were carried out also. Certainly there was

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

65

time to spend on other activities. According to Buckelew (1911:72-73), the
Lipan Apache allowed several days for sotol to become thoroughly cooked.
Other ethnographic accounts (Opler 1941) suggest that although women were
usually in charge of the preparation and cooking of plants, men often accompanied them in order to help with the more difficult tasks such as carrying
rocks for midden construction. Much of the lithic assemblage on and around
the ring middens may be the result of flint knapping activities not directly related to plant processing and cooking. It is quite possible that men would
engage in the manufacture of dart points and other tools intended for hunting
in the area near the midden while they awaited completion of baking activities.
Some of the flint knapping may be directly related to the processing of
plants. For example, the unifaces and scrapers (similar to those from Hinds
Cave found in association with cut leaf bases) may have been manufactured and
or repaired (retouched) near the site. The art of flint knapping is assumed to be
a traditional male task, and it seems logical to assume that the amount oflithic
debitage on and around the ring midden sites is the result of male groups passing
the time in procurement-related activities.
In order to prepare sotol (Dasylirion texanum) and lechuguilla (Agave
lechuguilla) for cooking, the bulbs must be separated from all leaves and stems
and the edible parts must be cut out before consumption. The hearts oflechuguilla bulbs must be removed, and the inedible leaf bases on their exteriors
must be cut away (Mallouf and Tunnell 1977:61-62). These activities require
tools, and some of the large flakes at ring midden sites could be tools for these
activities. Flakes are multipurpose tools that can be produced as needed simply
by knocking them from cores with a hammerstone. After they are used they
can be discarded with no great loss of energy.
It is unlikely that the smaller flakes found at ring midden sites were used
in the processing of plants prior to cooking; they probably represent debitage.
What is more likely is that large flakes or blades-hafted when possible-were
used to prevent damage to the hands from sharp spines and leaves. The account
of the Havasupai of northwestern Arizona and their method of trimming the
leaves from mescal (Agave sp.), using a special hatchet (see p. 42), may shed
some light on the methods used in prehistoric times. This hatchet, according to
Spier (1928:105-106), was a "broad stone blade set in a slot midway in the
length of a short handle, 30 cm long (sometimes of pinon wood), where it is held
fast with glue or pitch and by lashings."
Schuetz (1956), in her study of archeological materials recovered from caves
and rock-shelters in Va! Verde County, Texas, describes the hafted flint blades in
collections from southwestern Texas.
Several artifacts were found still hafted with wooden handles. Two
knives of the rounded-base group described above still have handles. One is
hafted on its side leaving the blade edge exposed, and the other hafted at
the base leaving the point as the cutting part. One side scraper is also
hafted, and two of the Kinney points have asphaltum at the base where this
material was used to fix the haft (Schuetz 1956:150).
Except for the Kinney points that have asphaltum on their bases, Schuetz does
not present any data to explain how these items were hafted. These artifacts
from Val Verde County may have been used for something other than plant
processing. No attempt has been made in this report to compare the hafted

66

Texas Archeological Society

tools described by Schuetz (1956) to the unifaces recovered from Musk Hog
Canyon. They have been mentioned solely to provide additional evidence of the
presence of hafted artifacts in southwestern Texas.
The few unifaces that were recovered at the Divide Windmill site consistently came from the middens or from the areas south of the middens in
roughly the same patterns as the flakes. Unifaces may possibly represent use of
a stronger, more durable tool designed for use on plants with tough stalks.
The dart points followed the same distribution pattern as the other artifacts,
occurring mainly on or south and east of the middens. It is assumed that production of these points was one of the varied flint knapping activities that, although carried out at or near the midden, was not related to plant processing.
Of course it is possible that these artifacts were simply discarded here and that
no dart point manufacture or repair was ever carried out at this site.
Burins were fairly common at the Divide Windmill site. One of the uses
suggested for these distinctive tools is the refurbishing of uniface tools (Shafer
1980:personal communication). They could have been used to repair or refurbish unifaces that were used in plant processing. Their distribution is similar
to the oth~ artifact categories.
The remainder of the debitage-burin spalls, cores, and Group 2 stemless
bifaces-follows the same pattern of distribution as the above-mentioned artifacts. That is, they occur on or to the south and east of the sites.
Excavation Area 1

Debitage is the dominant artifact category for all units in Area 1. Other
artifact types recovered include dart points, Group 1 stemless bifaces, Category
1 unifaces, and uniface fragments. The debitage inventory consists of projectile
point preforms, Group 2 stemless bifaces, cores, burin spalls, and flakes (Table
2; Figure 4). In all units, interior flakes are the dominant category. The largest
concentration of flakes (227 specimens) occurs in Unit 1C, which is part of the
slab-lined pit. Except for Unit 1C, no concentration seems apparent, inasmuch
as flakes are common in all of the excavation units. The only square with fewer
than 100 flakes is 1E, with 42 specimens. There are three possible explanations
for the dominance of flakes over other artifact categories: (1) the flakes were
used in the processing of plants cooked in the pit; (2) they represent the residue
from the manufacture of tools, such as the ones used to cut up plants, that are
directly related to plant processing activities; and (3) they represent the waste
material from the manufacture of tools, such as dart points and other tools used
for hunting, that have no connection with plant processing activities. Considering the variety of tools found at this site, it seems likely that at least some of
these flakes represent waste material from tool manufacture. There is no evidence, however, to identify the kinds of tool manufacture that produced these
flakes. The flakes probably represent material fi’om the manufacture of all
kinds of tools.
Excavation Area 2
The excavation in Area 2 was designed to test the refuse deposits closely
associated with midden 1 (Figure 4). Except for two probable dart points and
one uniface fragment, all of the artifacts recovered from area 2 are debitage,
with flakes the most numerous category, and, within that category, interior
flakes the most numerous (Table 3).

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

67

Each excavation unit produced 50 or more flakes, except for Unit 2T, which
produced only 17 specimens. Unit 2A produced the greatest number (112) of
flakes. The most logical explanation for these numbers is the closeness of
excavation Unit 2A to midden 1 in Area 1. Unit 2A is east of and almost
parallel to Units 1C and 1D (Figure 4). Unit 2A may be a separate activity
area, and the fact that it is located just east of Area 1 may be a factor of wind
direction, as discussed above. The lithic collection from Area 2 appears to
widen the range of flint knapping activities that took place at the Divide Windmill site.
Excavation Area 3
Because of the paucity of artifacts from this midden (Table 4), Area 3 is not
included in the distributional analysis.
Excavation Area 4
This area is also excluded from the distributional analysis because of the low
number of artifacts recovered (Table 5).
PECOS TERRACE SITE (41CX218)
Excavated Collection

As at the Divide Windmill site, most of the cultural materials recovered from
the Pecos Terrace site fall into the lithic debitage category. Apart from debitage,
the only sizable category is burins (20 specimens), and there are a few projectile
points, unifaces, and uniface fragments. The largest artifact category is flakes,
with interior flakes the most numerous (Table 6 ; Figure 3).
The center of the midden at the Pecos Terrace site contains the pit feature,
and in this area all of the various artifact types are present. A pattern was observed in the marginal areas of the site. The largest number of flakes (141
specimens) was obtained from unit N43/W50 (Table 6), which is the southernmost unit of the site. The easternmost unit, N50/W42, yielded !30 flakes,
while the western and northern units, N49/W55 and N53/W49, yielded only 29
flakes and 15 flakes respectively. These figures lend support to the theory that
most of the activity at ring midden sites took place to the south and east of the
pit areas, putting them upwind from the hearths and therefore out of the areas
of blowing smoke.
Surface Collection
The surface collected artifacts from the Pecos Terrace site are not included
in the distribution study because these collections represent only a random
sampling (Table 7). However, large numbers of flakes and other lithic debris
were observed to the south of the midden where no surface collection was made.
EISERER SHELTER SITE (41CXt33)
Rock-Shelter Excavation
All of the artifacts taken from the rock-shelter excavation came from an area
four meters square at the extreme south end of the shelter (Figure 5). Some
information concerning the vertical distribution is presented in an effort to
derive as much data as possible (Table 8). As in the other sites, flakes tend to

68

Texas Archeological Society

dominate in gross numbers. Here too, interior flakes are the largest category,
with representation in every level. In each square excavated, there are twice
as many interior flakes as there are either of the other kinds of flakes. The
flakes follow a definite pattern in vertical distribution. The first 20 cm are the
most productive levels, and from there they decrease as depth increases, except
for Excavation Unit 3E, where flakes do not decrease significantly until 40 cm,
indicating a deeper midden deposit in this unit (Table 8).
Talus Slope Excavation
No meaningful patterns can be developed from these excavation units (Table
9), because the talus slope materials have been displaced from inside the rockshelter. Some of the materials may have washed down the slope from the edge
of the shelter, but it is more likely that they were tossed from the cooking area
in prehistoric times as the pit was being cleaned for reuse (Harry Shafer 1980:
personal communication). If this is true, the shelter itself apparently functioned
as a cooking area on several occasions.
It is important to note, however, that here too, flakes are the most numerous
category, with interior flakes the most common. The upper levels produced
the largest number of artifacts, but, unlike the rock-shelter excavations, artifacts
were found at all levels. The only exception was in the lower 20 cm of test pit
C (Table 10).
Talus Slope Surface Collection
This surface collection was not complete, as only one pass was made over the
area, and it is probable that many artifacts were overlooked. One pattern, however, does emerge: a majority of the artifacts collected came from the southern
part of the talus slope (Figure 6).

PLANT REMAINS
The only plant remains recorded for the Musk Hog Canyon excavations came
from the Eiserer Shelter site. Although it was anticipated that plant macrofossils
would be present in some, if not most, open-air ring middens, only a meager
amount of plant data was recovered. Plant macrofossils from the Eiserer Shelter
include sotol (Dasylirion sp.), unidentified seeds and seed pods-some of which
are probably mesquite (Prosopis sp.)-and plant fragments of what are probably
various species of Agave and Yucca (Glendon Weir 1980:personal communication). These plants were found at various levels from 0 to 60 cm. Identification
of Musk Hog Canyon plant macrofossils by species was difficult due to their
fragmentary condition. However, by making use of plant data in ethnographic
accounts, prior archeological work in this part of Texas, and accounts of extant
flora, it is possible to speculate as to the kinds of plants these macrofossils
represent.
ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNTS
The most common plants mentioned in the ethnographic literature are
lechuguilla and mescal (Agave spp.), sotol (Dasylirion spp.), mescal bean (probably Sophora secundiflora), and yucca (Yucca spp.). In addition, mesquite pods
(probably Prosopis glandulosa) are also mentioned in some accounts. Typically,

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

69

these plants were used as foodstuffs, although some of these species may have
been used for other purposes as well. Yucca treeuleana (trecul yucca), for example, was used for intoxicating beverages, baskets, twine, or rope (cordage),
and medicinal purposes (Vines !960:54). Yucca baeatta (datil yucca) was used
for soap (Vines 1960:53), while Yucca carnerosana (carnerosana giant yucca)
was important for roof thatch and palisade construction (Vines 1960:52).
Mats and baskets are known to have been manufactured from Dasylirion leiophyllum (smooth leaf sotol) (Vines 1960:69). These are just a few of the
representative species and some of the recorded uses for these plants.
One of the problems in dealing with ethnographic accounts is the lack of botanical knowledge of some early ethnographers. It is common, for example,
to encounter a reference to techuguilla or yucca, but due to the many species
of these plants it is sometimes impossible to ascertain which particular plant is
being discussed. Usually exhaustive checking and cross-checking of details such
as plant location and description in the ethnographic account are necessary in
order to identify the genus and occasionally the species. If it should be mentioned, for example-in a hypothetical case-that Indians in New Mexico made
sandals from lechuguilla in historic times, we cannot necessarily conclude that
all species of lechuguilla are suitable for that purpose, or which species were
actually used. Thus, the particular species of lechuguilla native to this part of
West Texas may not have been useful for sandal manufacture, so the Indians of
this part of Texas may have used other related plants that were known by the
same name.
Mescal provides another example of the problem of plant identification.
There is a mescal that is known as maguey (Agave spp.), and there is another
plant-a cactus of the Southwest (Lophophora sp.)-also known as mescal.
Thus, when an ethnographer refers to the use of mescal without specifically
identifying the plant botanically, problems arise. In addition, the end product
of cooking agave (Agave parri. A. havardiana, A. palmeri, A. neomexicana, and
A. americana), is also called mesca! (Vines 1960:79, 80, 82, 83); and mescal
sometimes refers to the common mescal bean, a small shrub or tree (Sophora
secundiflora). All of these plants are mentioned in the ethnographic accounts
for drug, food, and beverage use.
ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD

Through the reports of dry cave and rock-shelter excavation in southwestern
Texas and adjacent areas, it has been demonstrated that sotol, lechuguilla, and
yucca were utilized by prehistoric groups for several thousand years. Typically,
these plants are preserved in caves and shelters in utilitarian forms such as sandals, matting, baskets, and cordage. The absence of these plants as apparent
foodstuffs in the archeological record could be due to a collection bias, as the
collection and identification of coprolites, quids (masses of Yucca plant and
DasylMon spp. fibers) and fossil pollen is relatively new to archeology (Glendon
Weir 1980:personal communication).
According to Dering and Shafer (1976:215), "in dry areas of southwest Texas
fibrous remains of lechuguilla, sotol, and/or yucca often comprise the bulk of
the dry midden contents." At Baker Cave, Val Verde County, Texas, "lechuguilla, sotol, and sachuisti (or sachuista - beargrass -Nolina sp.) were the most
common plants used" (Word and Douglas 1970:71). Products made of these

70

Texas Archeological Society

plants by prehistoric groups include matting made from sprit sotol leaves (species
not given) at Eagle Cave (Ross 1965:123), and sandals from Baker Cave (Word
and Douglas 1970:67) made, in part, with lechuguilla.
The identification of these plants in archeological deposits is not always easy.
In separating these three genera archeologists have tried to rely on differences in external appearance. However, this method has not been adequate since the altered condition of most plant remains obscures the more
obvious morphological characteristics. Recent investigations in the lower
Pecos area (Alexander 1970; Shafer 1975) have created a need for a convenient and more clearly accurate means of identifying these genera in
all stages of processing in the final product, whether it is a quid or a basket
(Dering and Shafer 1976:215).
The problems of accurate identification of these fibrous remains can be
illustrated by reviewing previous reports from the lower Pecos area. Irving
(1966:61-68) reported fibrous plant remains from six shelters in the Ami-’
stad district. He found that lechugui!la was the dominant economic plant,
yet sotol was not mentioned. This is contradictory since at Fate Bell Shelter,
one of the sites Irving studied, two sotol cooking pits with fragments of sotol
had been reported earlier by Pearce and Jackson (1933:16-17). At Baker
Cave in Val Verde County, Word and Douglas (1970:12-13) reported that
quids were present but made no attempt at identification. Remains of
lechuguitla were the most abundant midden component in Parida Cave and
Conejo Shelter (Alexander 1974:220), both in Val Verde County (Dering
and Shafer 1976:216).
In Crockett and Pecos Counties, upstream from the Val Verde County
sites, virtually no macrofossil analyses have been made. Holden (1941:33)
found many quids in McKenzie Cave in Pecos County that he said were
"perhaps sotol." Near Iraan in Crockett County, Lorraln (1968:43) reported
only a few knotted sotol leaves and Several cut lechuguilla leaves from
Meadows Shelter H and she found no perishables at the Sotol Site. At Red
Mill She!ter, Word (1971:306) identified cut leaves of sotol, sachuista (Nolina
texana) and lechuguilla. He found two types of quids which he speculated
were of sotol and lechuguilla (Word 1971:307).

None of the authors of above reports substantiates plant determinations by
detailing methods of identification, and anyone trying to synthesize prehistoric
subsistence patterns in the Lower Pecos area is faced with a mixture of conflicting data (Dering and Shafer 1976:216). Dering and Shafer (1976) also
present an excellent report of their attempts at identifying sotol, yucca, and
lechuguilla plant macrofossils using different analytical techniques, such as
comparison of the cuticular features of these genera.
EXTANT FLORA

Lechuguilla, agave, mescal, yucca, and sotol are the plants most often mentioned by ethnographers and archeologists when referring to ring middens and
their function as plant processing areas. Because it may be of help in determining which species were probably cooked by prehistoric groups in the ring
middens at Musk Hog Canyon, current knowledge of these plants is presented
below. The plants discussed in this section grow in the area today and may be
the same species that were baked in earth ovens by the aboriginal populations
of Musk Hog Canyon.
Other plants certainly were utilized by the prehistoric groups in the area.
Macrofossils recovered from Gobbler Shelter (Dering and Shafer 1976), for
example, include prickly pear (Opuntia sp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

71

texana), oak (Quercus sp.), mesquite (Prosopis sp.), onion (Allium drummondii),
and hackberry (Celtis sp.); however, these plants are not known to be associated
with ring middens and are omitted from the following discussion.
Agave lechuguiUa

This plant belongs to the Amaryllis family, or AmaryUidaceae. Lechuguilla
is a perennial that often occurs in extensive colonies and is recognizable by a
tall flower stalk that rises from a cluster of many thick basal leaves. The range
of this species covers an area about 62 km (100 miles) wide and 1130 km (700
miles) long, from southern New Mexico through western Texas and southward
in Mexico in Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi, and Zacatecas (Vines
1960:80-81).
Lechuguilla blooms only once, when it is 3 to 4 years old. The plant dies
after b!ooming, but young ones are produced at the base. The scape is 91 to 366
cm (3 to 12 feet) tall and has a spinelike panicle at the apex with very short
branches that have flowers, usually in clusters of two to three or more. The
fruit is in capsule form, usually leatherlike and black to brown in color, and is
usually 15.2 to 25.4 mm (0.6 to 1 inch) long and 12.7 to 15.2 mm (0.5 to 0.6
inches) in diameter. The leaves, which are grayish green or yellowish green, are
used to make twine and rope called istle or tampico fiber. Usually a mature
plant wil! have 10 to 30 of these leaves from 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches) long.
The root, under the name amole, is extensively used as a substitute for soap
(Vines 1960:80-81).
Agave havardiana

The range of this species may not include Musk Hog Canyon. However,
according to Vines (1960:80), it is often difficult to ascertain whether Agave
havardiana or A. lechuguilla was the species being used by the Indians of western
Texas for cooking purposes, since they are closely related and very similar.
Other Agaves

Other species of the genus Agave that may have been utilized by Indian
groups in historical times and may have been used in the study area are Agave
parryi and A. neomexicana (Vines 1960:79-84).
Yucca

Two species of yucca (Yucca baccata and Y. torreyi) probably were utilized
by Musk Hog Canyon populations. There is no archeological or ethnographical
evidence that these plants were used in Crockett County. However, they are
included in this section because they occur in the area, and it is known that
yucca (Yuuca spp.) was extensively used by prehistoric and historic groups in
southwestern Texas and adjacent areas.
Yucca baccata

These plants are acaulescent, solitary, or clump forming. The leaves occur in
spreading rosettes. The range of this species extends from the open, dry plains
and mesas of Trans-Pecos Texas and New Mexico, westward to California, northward to Colorado, Utah, and Nevada, and southward to Chihuahua, Mexico, at
altitudes of 610 to 2438 meters (2000 to 8000 feet).
This yucca flowers from March through June. Its panicle is dense, upright,

72

Texas Archeological Society

30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) long, usually only 10.2 to 20.3 cm (4 to 8 inches)
above the uppermost leaves. The scape is stout and heavy, glabrous or somewhat
pubescent, green to reddish or purplish, becoming woody on maturity. The
flowering branches number from 11 to 18 (Vines 1960:52-53).
The leaf fibers, which are bluish green rosettes, are used by the Indians to
make baskets. The fruit is eaten raw, dried, or roasted. A soap substitute
known as amole is made from the roots (Vines 1960:53).
Yucca torreyi
This is an arborescent plant 0.91 to 7.3 meters (3 to 24 feet) tall, with a
simple or sparsely branched trunk. The crowded radiating leaves are usually
untidy in appearance, in part because of the persistent thatch of dead reflexed
leaves on the trunk below. The species grows from the Devils River area eastward, northwestward into New Mexico and southwestward into Mexico (Vines
1960:55).
Other Yuccas
Two other species of yucca that may have been available and utilized for food
by prehistoric populations of Crockett County are Yucca faxoniana (currently
found in Culberson County) (Vines 1960:51) and Yucca treculeana (found from
San Antonio westward to the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers) (Vines 1960:54).
Sotol

Vines (1960) describes two species of the genusDasylMon (sotol) that occur
in the study area. These species (Dasylirion leiophyllum and D. texanum) are
mentioned here as sotol and are the plants most commonly cited by ethnographers and archeologists as being cooked in ring middens.
Dasylirion leiophyllum
This species of sotol is commonly found on limestone hills (Glendon Weir
1980:personal communication) in Texas in the Rio Grande region, northward
into New Mexico, and southward to central Mexico (Vines 1960:68). DasylMon
carries a clump of slender, spiny-edged basal leaves that rise from a short trunk
(Vines 1960:68, 69). The leaves of this plant are clumped at the base, rigid,
linear, and from 15.2 to 20.3 mm (0.6 to 0.8 inches) thick. They are rarely
91.5 cm (3 feet) long and are somewhat brush tipped, green or glaucous,
smooth, and with serrulated-roughened margins (Figure 12, D). The genus
name, Dasylirion, means tufted lily, and the species name, leiophyllum, refers to
the smoothness of the leaf surfaces. The leaves have been used to make mats
and baskets (Vines 1960:58).
Dasylirion texanum
This species of sotol is commonly recorded in the archeological record for
southwestern Texas. It is the only species of sotol identified at Gobbler Shelter,
where it was present in the form of leaves, caudex fragments, and quids (Dering
and Sharer 1976).
This plant grows in dry, arid, stony soil. According to Vines (1960:70), it
is known mostly from south-central Texas, where it occurs from New Braunfels,
Blanco, and Kerrville to Sanderson, Marathon, and Fort Davis. It occurs on

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

73

novaculite hills in the Trans-Pecos and Edwards Plateau regions of Texas (Glendon Weir 1980:personal communication).
This plant has slender, basal, clumped leaves with a short, woody trunk that
is often buried in the ground. Its flowers are dioecious. The scape is 2.7 to 4.6
meters (9 to 15 feet)long, with the narrow inflorescence in a spikelike panicle,
60.9 to 91.4 cm (2 to 3 feet) long.
The fruit is capsule. The leaves are clumped at the base, linear, attenuate,
and stiff. They are 10 to 15 mm (0.4 to 0.6 inches) wide, scarcely 91.4 cm (3
feet) long, and somewhat brush tipped. The base is dilated and entire. The leaf
surfaces are green, glossy, smooth, or rough-keeled (Vines 1960:70).
CONCLUSIONS
The archeological work at Musk Hog Canyon during the summer of 1976
recovered much new data concerning the prehistory of this part of Texas. The
TAS field crews surveyed virtually the entire Musk Hog Canyon watershed and
recorded 435 sites of all types in each of the various geographical settings in
the study area.
Information obtained from a survey of this magnitude has enormous potential for meaningful archeological interpretation. This is especially true in
West Texas, where the emphasis has been on synchronic studies of individual
sites. Typically, rock-shelters receive the most attention; however, in a few
cases deeply stratified sites such as the Devil’s Mouth site have been explored.
In virtually all cases, salvage operations (such as Fate Bell Shelter and Eagle
Cave in conjunction with reservoir construction, and the Perro Salvaje site in
conjunction with highway construction), have resulted in good archeological
work. Diachronic studies such as those at Hinds Cave that are independent of
any salvage projects are an exception. Equally rare are holistic studies like
Musk Hog Canyon that cover fairly large geographical areas and embrace different plant and geographical zones, and resulting varieties of archeological
sites. In this region, too little is known of site relationships in areas as large as
the Musk Hog Canyon watershed, and the importance of a data base such as
Musk Hog Canyon provides cannot be overlooked. The opportunity for another
large-scale archeological survey combined with excavation may never again be
possible in this region.
SITE FUNCTION

The three sites involved in this study area are apparently related to plant
processing and cooking activities. Admittedly, this statement is weakened by
the absence of diagnostic plant parts in the open ring midden Pecos Terrace
and Divide Windmill sites. However, the presence of sotol and other plant remains in the Eiserer Shelter tends to support this statement. Diagnostic plant
parts have been found in Sanderson Canyon (Sharer 1970), in a ring midden
similar to the ones in Musk Hog Canyon. Unifacially flaked artifacts that have
polish or wear patterns like those found in association with cut leaf bases at
Hinds Cave were recovered from the Pecos Terrace and Divide Windmill sites,
lending support to the argument for plant processing at these sites. The presence of a definite slab-lined pit at Area 1 of the Divide Windmill site also lends
support to this conclusion. Although burins and burin spaUs have not been
definitely associated with plant processing, they are commonly found at such

74

Texas Archeological Society

sites, and their presence at Musk Hog Canyon sites may be additional proof
that desert succulents were being processed there. The economic importance of
plants such as sotol (Dasylirion spp.), lechuguilla (Agave sp.), and yucca (Yucca
spp.) has been demonstrated in ethnographic accounts and the archeological
record. Too, there is no sound archeological evidence to indicate that these ring
middens were constructed for purposes other than plant processing. Other uses
have been proposed, but they have not been accepted by the archeological
community, nor are they supported by the data from this study.
TYPES OF PLANTS COOKED

According to ethnographic accounts, sotol and lechuguilla are the plants
most commonly baked in earth ovens (yucca is most typically the raw material
for utilitarian items such as sandals, cordage, and baskets). Although the ring
middens at Musk Hog Canyon could have been used to cook any number of
items, sotol (Dasylirion spp.) and lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) are assumed to
be the plants most likely to have been processed here. However, Yucca torryei
and Yucca baeeata must be considered because they grow in the canyon at the
present time. Of course it is entirely possible that different but related species
were growing in the Musk Hog Canyon during prehistoric times.
Sotol (Dasylirion spp.), various species of Agave, and other plants, probably
including mesquite (Prosopis sp.) and mescal bean (Sophora sp.) were recovered
from the Eiserer Shelter, but they were not found in association with a cooking
pit or an oven (Jane Schweitzer 1980:personal communication) and therefore
cannot be connected definitely to cooking operations. However, the burned
rock talus, one of the more outstanding cultural features of the Eiserer Shelter
site, is analogous to the burned rock mounds that form crescent-shaped middens.
In light of this analogy we can assume that the activities that produced the
burned rock in the midden are similar, if not identical, to the activities that
produced the burned rock on the talus slope.
AGE OF SITES
The sites in Musk Hog Canyon probably represent a relatively late cultural
manifestation in West Texas. The presence of side notched dart points such as
Ensor, Frio, and Paisano in all of the sites places them somewhere in the Late
Archaic period (200 B.C. - A.D. 1000). Two possible Langtry points were recovered from the Eiserer Shelter, which suggests an earlier date (about 600 B.C.)
for that site. However, the Langtry points were not found in direct association
with a pit or oven, and since they were not found in an open ring midden site
they do not constitute evidence for a date earlier than 200 B.C. for ring middens. The presence of arrow points could reflect the continuation of ring middens as plant processing areas into historical times, but the sample is small (3
specimens), hardly enough to support such a conclusion. Too, the Langtry and
arrow points were found on tile surface and could have been dropped by
members of groups who had nothing to do with ring middens as plant processing
activities.
ASSOCIATED ARTIFACTS
The assemblage of artifacts found at Musk Hog Canyon is overwhelmingly
dominated by lithics. Most of the lithic artifacts are of chipped stone, but a
few are of ground stone. Flakes make up the largest category at each site. It

Moore-Musk Hog Canyon

75

is possible that some of these flakes may have been utilized in the harvesting and
slicing of desert succulents. The small flakes are presumed to be the results of
flint knapping activities-they are not thought to be tools. Although some of
the larger flakes could have functioned in plant preparation activities, none
appear to have wear patterns suggestive of these activities. It is possible that
further analysis of these artifacts might turn up some plant processing wear
patterns.
Indications of wear in the form of polish are visible on some unifaces from
the Pecos Terrace and Divide Windmill sites. This polish resembles that found
on specimens from Hinds Cave that have been associated definitely with the
cutting and slicing of desert succulents. This resemblance lends additional support to the hypothesis that these open-air ring middens were plant processing
areas.
It is significant too that flakes typically constitute the majority of lithic artifacts in the ring midden sites. Dart points and arrow points are present, but in
fewer numbers than are unifaces and debitage, another fact that lends support
to the theory that these sites were plant processing areas. On the other hand,
unless wear patterns that indicate cutting and slicing uses are found on dart and
arrow points, they must be considered to have been used primarily for other
purposes, such as hunting.
The artifacts in Musk Hog Canyon were concentrated in various areas within
the sites, typically to the south and east of the ring middens. This finding is
consistent with other studies of ring middens. It is suggested that these artifact
concentrations represent areas where certain activities (such as flint knapping)
may have been conducted while the plants were cooking. It is likely that these
locales were selected because they were upwind from the fires.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

All of the ring middens tested at Musk Hog Canyon were built on limestone
bedrock, contained ashy fin in the pit areas, and produced few artifacts. The
open ends of the crescent-shaped middens were oriented mainly toward the
south, a fact that is consistent with other ring middens in West Texas. Apparently the wind in prehistoric times blew predominantly from the south and southeast at the locations where, and seasons when, the hearths were being used,
causing the Indians who lived in Musk Hog Canyon to produce crescent-shaped
middens that are similar to those in Sanderson Canyon and adjacent areas.
SYNTHESIS
The archeological data from Musk Hog Canyon suggests that small bands
of prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups were foraging for their existence and obtained their food by seasonal rounds of plant and animal harvests. Plants were
especially important to these people, but they were not used exclusively.
Animals were exploited, but they do not show up as well as plants in the archeological record of the sites examined. Large numbers of mussel shells in the
Musk Hog Canyon sites probably represent still another type of food exploited
during food gathering trips.
The basic subsistence pattern was practiced by similar groups for at least
5000 years and possibly for as many as 9000 years in the Lower Pecos region

76 Texas Archeological Society
and adjacent areas (Harry Sharer 1980:personal communication). Some ring
middens may have been used for food preparation activities of relatively short
duration carried out away from more permanent campsites. This is suggested by
the data from Musk Hog Canyon and by ethnographic accounts, such as Opler’s
(1941:356) account of Apache women who traveled to areas where mescal was
plentiful, established camps, and remained there until sufficient supplies were
cooked.

BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY OF THE
GEORGE PRESTON, SMITH, AND SAM SITES:
Three Fourche Maline Sites
in Southeastern Oklahoma and Northeastern Texas

William M. Bass and Carol J. Loveland

ABSTRACT
The biological attributes of the Fourche Maline people of southeastern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas have been poorly documented due to the fragmentary nature of most of the burials. Skeletal material from three sites
(George Preston, Sam, and Smith) attributed to the Fourche Maline culture is
discussed. Cranial and postcranial measurements and interment practices from
these and other Fourche Maline sites are compared and evaluated. The data
suggest that the Fourche Maline people were characterized by rather high, long
skulls, with narrow foreheads. Flexed or semiflexed burials were most common,
but orientation of the head was extremely variable, indicating little concern for
that aspect of burial custom.

INTRODUCTION

The Fourche Maline culture of southeastern Oklahoma and northeastern
Texas has been known archeologically for many years. Bell and Baerreis (1951 :
27) suggested that the focus was an Archaic culture that had survived in basically
its original form through the Early and Middle Woodland stages. Chapman
(1952:140-143) and Bell and Baerreis (1951:27-33) felt that the sources of
Woodland influences in Fourche Maline came from the north or west. Orr
(1952:243-244) postulated that strong ties existed between Fourche Maline
and Tchefuncte. Tchefuncte was an Early Woodland culture dating to about
500 B.C. in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Later researchers (Sears 1964:269;
Greengo 1964:121) contested this early date and suggested that Fourche Maline
is most similar to Marksville and Troyville, which date from about 100 B.C. to
A.D. 500.
More recently Galm (!978a:244-245) reported that Bell had recommended
elevation of Fourche Maline to phase status and restriction of the designation
to the time encompassed by the Woodland period. A series of radiocarbon
dates from sites in the Wister Valley, Oklahoma, bracket this phase from about
A.D. 1 (perhaps as early as 200 B.C.) to between A.D. 800 and 1000 (Galm
and Flynn 1978:156). Radiocarbon dates from the McCutchan-McLaughlin
site range from 300 B.C. to A.D. 765 (Powell and Rogers 1980:Table 1).
Bell (1953:314), Orr (1952:242-243), and Wycoff (1970:98)characterized
this culture as exhibiting the following traits: (1) sites consisting of large accuBulletin of the Texas Archeological Society

53:83-100

84 Texas Archeological Society
mulations of village debris in the form of midden deposits, (2) flexed burials
(occasionally multiple) in middens, (3) rare occurrence of grave offerings, and
(4) artifacts and other debris (mussel shells, potsherds, animal bones, ftrecracked stones) scattered throughout the midden deposit. Galm has suggested
"that contracting stemmed (Gary Style) poifits and a thick ware ceramic type
(Williams Plain) may be the hallmarks of components of this phase" (Galm
1978b:74). He cautions, however, that use of these traits in the identification of
Fourche Maline components on a regional level is not desirable.
In work at the Scott site, Bell (1953:320) noted that most burials were not
marked by grave outlines. He suggested that the bodies were placed on the
ground surface and covered with debris from the surrounding midden. A similar
situation was noted at the Wann site by Sharrock (1960:22), at the Sam site
by Proctor (1957:49), and at the Williams Mound by Newkumet (1940:3).
However, Proctor did note that a few of the graves had been "scraped several
inches into the clean subsoil" (Proctor 1957:49). Galm and Flynn (1978:51)
reported that three burials from the Scott site were associated with distinct
pits ranging in depth from 20 cm to 62 cm; the remaining burials apparently
were not placed in specially prepared pits.
Many burials have been recovered from Fourche Maline sites, but most of
them are in fragmentary condition. Therefore, very few papers (Hammett 1978:
333-346; McWiltiams 1970:101-136; Powell and Rogers 1980:1-98) have included biological descriptions of Fourche Maline skeletal material. Hammett
(1978:333) examined 10 individuals from nine burials exposed at the Scott
site and three individuals from the Wann site; all of these burials were obtained
during the 1977-1978 Phase II Investigation of the sites by the University of
Oklahoma (Galm and Flynn 1978:3). In her report, Hammett included sex, age
of death, pathologies, interment conditions, and limited metric data (four
cranial measurements, two cranial indices, and stature estimation based on left
femur length) (Hammett 1978:333-346).
McWilliams (1970:101-136) looked primarily at nonmetric trait variation in
his comparison of the skeletal material from the Sam and Wann sites. However,
he did discuss burial practices, pathologies, and life expectancy in his report
and included some measurements (maximum length and breadth of the cranium
and several long bone measurements).
Powell and Rogers (1980:1-98), in their comprehensive report on the McCutchan-McLaughlin site, explored the nature and quality of the tifeway of the
Fourche Maline people as they considered such topics as demography, nonmetric traits, stature and sexual dimorphism, paleopathology, and interment
practices. Only limited measurements (primarily postcranial) were given in their
paper.
MATERIALS
In March 1979, Dave Wright, an amateur archeologist and part-time employee
of the Museum of the Red River in Idabel, Oklahoma, together with his wife,
Cindy, and a friend, Mike Lankford, excavated a multiple burial at the George
Preston site in northeastern Texas. Portions of three skeletons were recovered
and given to Dr. William M. Bass of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
The George Preston site is situated in extreme southern Lamar County on
an active floodplain bordering the North Sulphur River (Figure 1). The midden,

which is approximately 70 feet long and 25 feet wide, is oriented north-northwest to south-southeast.
A secondary and primary terrace system containing Caddoan materials occurs
to the north of the site. The soil type in the area is commonly referred to as
blackland gumbo. The region straddles the border between the post oak prairies
to the south and west and the pine forests to the east. Artifacts collected from
the vicinity of the midden consisted principally of Kent, Gary, and Yarborough
points. In the grave fill there were numerous small pieces of animal bone, potsherds, mussel shells, hickory nutshells, and copper fragments. Gregory Perino
(personal communication, September 3, 1980) attributed the burial to the
Fourche Maline focus.
In addition to the multiple burial discussed above, the writers have included
a summary of previously unpublished measurements taken by Bass in 1958 as
part of his work with the Smithsonian Institution Missouri Basin Project. The
burials are from the Sam and Smith sites, which are located in the Wister Valley
in LeFlore County, Oklahoma (Figure 2). The Sam site was excavated in 1940
in conjunction with the archeological work sponsored by the Works Progress
Administration (Proctor 1957:45-47). McWflliams (1970:101-136) reported
on some of the skeletal material presented here; however, the two samples are

not mutually inclusive. Furthermore, the major thrust of his investigations
centered around nonmetric traits; thus, he included only two cranial measurements-maximum length and breadth-and several long-bone measurements in
his discussion. The skeletal material from the Smith site has not been discussed
previously from a biological perspective.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The three skeletons from the George Preston site were oriented west to east,
with the heads at the west (Figure 3). They were all poorly preserved, the worst
being Burial 1, which was very fragmentary. The fragmentary nature of the
skeletal material made it impossible to obtain many measurements; those that
were taken, following Bass (1971:1-128), are given in Table 1. The nonmetric
traits that could be observed are given in Table 2. There was no visible grave
outline.
Burial 1 was a female in a semiflexed position, with the legs and sktfll turned
toward the right. The skull, which had some post-mortem warping, was dislocated up and away from the rest of the skeleton, probably as a result of
swelling and shifting of the soil. The skull was 48 cm below ground level. The
individual was determined to be 25-35 years of age, based upon dental attrition
(Miles 1963:204; Brothwell 1965:69).
Dental wear was advanced in the first molars. The left maxillary first molar
was worn unevenly, and the pulp cavity was exposed. Unfortunately, the
maxilla was missing, making it impossible to determine whether the tooth was
abscessed. The other teeth showed more flattened and less severe wear, with the
exception of the left mandibular first premolar, which had a peglike appearance.
The crown was almost worn away, and the tooth looked as if it might have been
broken.

Burial 2 was in a semiflexed position with the legs and skull facing left. The
right arm of Burial 2 was under the head of Burial 3. The left arm of Burial 2
also touched Burial 3. Perhaps Burial 3 was placed in the arms of Burial 2. The
skull was 48 cm below the surface, and the legs were 43 cm below ground level.
There was a lump of red ocher over the chest cavity, and some copper scraps
were found near the right hand. The ocher and copper had stained the first
and second metacarpals, the first proximal and distal phalanges, and one rib
fragment green. Analysis of epiphyseal closure (McKern and Stewart 1957:
1-179) indicated that the individual was 15 to 17 years old at the time of death.
Burial 3 was also semiflexed, with the skull facing left and the legs turned
toward the right. The skull was 45 cm below the surface and the legs were 43
cm below the surface. Burial 3 was determined to have been 2 to 4 years old
at the time of death, based upon analysis of tooth eruption (Ubelaker 1978 :
112-113) and length of long bones without epiphyses (Johnston 1962:249254).
No pathologies were noted on any of the skeletons.
Measurements could be made on only five burials recovered from the Smith
site (34LF22) (Table 3). Mean measurements were not calculated because the
sample was so small and the material was in such fragmentary condition. The
remaining 23 skeletons from the site were too fragmentary to measure. No
pathologies were noted on the Smith site burials.
Table 4 provides a brief description of the Sam site burials analyzed by Bass.
The mean measurements of those burials complete enough to measure are given

in Table 5. The sample consisted of three subadults, nine males, and 16 females.
The numerical differences between males and females is undoubtedly due to
the vageries of preservation rather than to any differences in the burial practices
of the Fourche Maline people. The highest incidence of death occurred between the ages of 20 and 30 for females and between ages 30 and 40 for males.
Cranial proportions expressed as indices provide a useful way of describing
skeletal populations. Table 6 presents the traditional terms used to describe
cranial proportions (Vallois 1965:142-143) and includes indices derived from

the measurements of the Sam skeletal series as well as comparative indices that
were calculated from measurements given by McWflliams (1970:Table 12)and
Hammett (1978:Table 45). The data suggest that the Fourche Maline people
were characterized by rather high skulls and narrow foreheads. Skull shape,
reflected in the cranial index, ranged from narrow or longheaded to average or
medium. Eye orbits were medium. Phenice (1969:69-70) described a similar
cranial configuration for Hopewellian and Central Plains Woodland populations.
Stature estimates for several Fourche Maline populations are shown in Table
7. Male estimates range from 164.3 cm at the Scott site (Hammett 1978:Table
45) to 173.0 cm at the Wann site (McWilliams 1970:Table 4). Female stature
ranged from 159.4 cm at the McCutchan-McLaughlin site (Powell and Rogers
1980:Table 8) to 164.9 cm at the Wann site (McWilliams 1970:Table 4). However, different formulas were used for calculating stature in the two reports.
Because McWilliams (1970:103) used Trotter and Gleser’s (1958:Table 12)
formula for Mongoloid males to calculate the female stature, it is likely that
those estimates utilizing the formulas of Neumann and Waldman (1968:100)
provide the most accurate assessment of stature for the Fourche Maline females.
Interment practices at the Fourche Maline sites are summarized in Table 8.
The flexed position was utilized most commonly, followed by the semi flexed
position. Orientation of the body to the right side was slightly preferred over
orientation to the left side. Orientation of the body in the grave varied greatly
at all sites, indicating little concern for that aspect of burial custom. Most
graves resembled those at the George Preston site, in that there were no discernible grave outlines.
Metric analysis of the burials from the George Preston, Smith, and Sam sites
has added to our limited biological knowledge of the Fourche Maline people.
Further cultural and biological study of these and other Fourche Maline burials
would help to provide a more complete understanding of the Fourche Maline
people and their lifeway. If enough small studies are undertaken, there will
eventually be sufficient data available from which valid conclusions can be
drawn about the prehistoric inhabitants of the northeastern Texas - southeastern Oklahoma area.

LATE PALEO-INDIAN OCCUPATIONS AT BAKER CAVE,
SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS

Thomas R. Hester*

ABSTRACT
Excavations at Baker Cave, Val Verde County, Texas, during the summer of
1976 have provided new data on late Paleo-Indian occupations in that region
9,000 years ago. Cultural materials and subsistence data are described. These
remains, especially floral and faunal evidence from a hearth radiocarbon-dated
at 7,000 B.C., permit an expanded view of the Golondrina complex of central
and southwestern Texas and northeastern Mexico. Paleoenvironmental data
indicate an early Holocene climate, perhaps more moist than at present and
without some of the xeric plants now found in the region.

Rock-shelter and cave deposits have provided archeologists with a variety of
evidence on early human occupations in the New World. The protection afforded by such sites often leads to the preservation of a remarkable array of ancient
cultural debris from which we can obtain detailed information on early lifeways-data that cannot be found at open camps or in kill-sites.
Dry rock-shelters and caves of the Great Basin, the Southwest, and the Southwest Texas - Northeast Mexico area have yielded particularly important samples
of fiber and wooden artifacts, subsistence data (including seeds, plant parts,
and coprolites), and other normally perishable examples of early cultural inventories. These sites have been important in dispelling the "big game hunter"
myth that has so commonly surrounded the study of Paleo-lndian cultures.
There are, of course, numerous examples of the hunting of megafauna and herd
animals during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, but as Heizer and Baumhoff (1970) have pointed out, this activity was only one part of early subsistence
systems. In many areas of the New World we have no evidence at all of biggame hunting. It is obvious from the data derived from dry cave and rockshelter sites that broad-spectrum hunting and gathering was widely practiced by
9000-8000 B;C. and that regional or local subsistence specializations were
developing in early Postglacial times.
THE SOUTHWEST TEXAS AREA
Evidence of Paleoqndian populations has come from rock-shelters and one
open terrace site in southwestern Texas. These include Bonfire Shelter, with
bison drives of the Folsom and Plainview complexes (Dibble and Lorrain 1968;
Dibble 1970), deeply stratified late Paleo4ndian lithic assemblages from Devil’s
Mouth (Johnson 1964; Sorrow 1968), and early radiocarbon dates for cultural

remains at Coontail Spin Rock-Shelter, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977),
Eagle Cave, and Arenosa Rock-Shelter (Patton and Dibble 1982). At yet another rock-shelter, 41VV162A, the possible association of lithic tools and late
Pleistocene fauna has been preliminarily reported (Collins 1969; M.B. Collins:
1977, personal communication).
Baker Cave is another site in this region with evidence of late Paleo4ndian
occupation. Excavations conducted by the author and Robert F. Heizer in 1976
produced additional information on early habitations at this site (Hester 1978,
1979). These new data are the focus of this report.

BAKER CAVE

Baker Cave is a rock-shelter site high in the western wall of Phillips Canyon
in Val Verde County, Texas (Figure 1). Just beyond the mouth of the rockshelter is a dramatic drop of 60 meters (200 feet). Phillips Canyon (or Creek)
is a tributary of the Devil’s River, which is in turn a tributary of the Rio Grande.
The shelter was first excavated in the 1960s by James H. Word;his report (Word
and Douglas 1970) provides the basic documentation on the stratigraphy and
material culture of the site. According to Word’s measurements, the site is 36
meters (120 feet) long and 17 meters (56 feet) deep (i.e., from the mouth to the
rear of the shelter). Fill within the shelter varies from 3 to 3.3 meters (9 to 11
feet) thick, most of this containing clearly stratified occupational remains (Word
and Douglas 1970).
Although most of the occupation at Baker Cave can be attributed to the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, Word discovered near the base of the
deposits an occupational zone containing Paleo-Indian cultural materials. He
obtained two radiocarbon dates of 6960 B.C. and 7080 B.C. (Table 1) from this
stratum, which he labeled Zone I. Below Zone I there was additional fill,
composed largely of limestone spalls and dust; however, no clear evidence was
found for human presence at the site earlier than 7000 B.C.
In 1968 John W. Greet conducted excavations at Baker Cave under the supervision of Dee Ann Story, of the Department of Anthropology, The University
of Texas at Austin. Greet excavated a triangular area along the center of the
back wall of the shelter. The results of his investigation have not yet been published (notes on file, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin).

THE 1976 INVESTIGATIONS
Although considerable work had been done at Baker Cave by both Word and
Greer, we estimated that as much as 80 percent of the deposits remained undisturbed (Figure !,b; 2 ;Chadderdon 1981). Three specific objectives were to
be addressed during the brief field season conducted in July 1976. First, we
wanted to test a variety of excavation and recording techniques in order to help
develop strategies for a future major excavation effort. Second, we wanted to
better evaluate the stratigraphy. Word’s excavations had a vertical orientation;
his profiles revealed textbook stratigraphy, with occupation zones separated by
sterile strata. We wanted to attempt, by using horizontal (open-area) excavation techniques, to "peel off" these strata and expose isolated occupations and
the activity areas within them. Our third goal was to learn more about the early

occupations. We hoped to obtain more information on tool kits, subsistence
systems (through intensive recovery of faunal and floral remains), and the environmental context. We wanted to find out if additional excavation in the
deposit reported by Word, underlying the 7000 B.C. occupation, might produce
evidence of even earlier human habitations. We were able to work on this third
problem during our brief field season because Greer’s excavations had left a
bench in the rear of the cave; in this partly excavated area, only deposits down
to the + 2600 B.C. level had been removed.
The 1976 program at Baker Cave was conducted under the auspices of the
Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio
(UTSA). The writer served as field director, and Robert F. Heizer was codirector. We received funding through the Earthwatch program of the Center
for Field Research in Belmont, Massachusetts, and the Texas Archaeological
Foundation. Logistical support was provided by UTSA. Our crew consisted
of six staff members from the UTSA Center and 14 participants from Earthwatch. A detailed study of the 1976 excavations has recently been prepared
by Chadderdon (1981).
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
Although our access to the site was curtailed by more than 13 inches of
rainfall-a 71-year record-the !976 investigations were able to deal success-

fully with the three objectives outlined above. Two major areas of the site were
excavated: Operation 2 was in the bench area left by Greer and was oriented
toward exposing the early deposits; Operation 3 began 3 meters to the north
of Operation 2 and was oriented toward exposing occupational strata utilizing
open-area techniques (Chadderdon 1981).
The emphasis in this report will be on the archeological record found in the
Operation 2 area (Figure 3 ; 5a). The earlier research of Word, and then Greer,
had fairly well established the chronological sequence at the site. Just beneath

the floor of Greer’s bench near the rear of the cave we expected to find occupation remains dating from a Pandale occupation of ca. 2600 B.C. An intensive
Pandale occupation was indeed found; one of its most interesting cultural
features was a pit filled with burned rock, plant parts, discarded fiber artifacts,
and lithics.
Underlying the Pandale zone (Figure 3) was a meter or more of loose, unconsolidated deposits containing rotted fiber (one well-preserved textile fragment
was recovered) and localized occupational lenses. Chronologically, we relate
this unit to an early Holocene cultural tradition that J.B. Sollberger and the
writer have elsewhere called the Pre-Archaic (Sollberger and Hester 1972).
(Although the term Pre-Archaic is used in this report, the writer is inclined at
present to refer these materials to the initial part of the Early Archaic as defined
by Story [1980] and McKinney [1981]). In parts of the cave, the Pre-Archaic
is characterized by corner-notched dart points-known by a variety of type
names (Baker, Bandy, Early Barbed) and part of a projectile point series of this
thne frame extending over Southwest, Central, and south-central Texas-and
triangular dart points with a similar spatial and temporal distribution. Word
assigned this cultural unit to his Period 2, 6500-4000 B.C. (Word and Douglas
1970:99). In Operation 2, this loose, unconsolidated deposit yielded primarily
triangular projectile points and several aberrant stemmed specimens that do not
fit any presently known type (Chadderdon 1981). Faunal and floral remains
extracted from this deposit have been analyzed by Kenneth Lord, Harold Wooldridge, Phil Dering, Thomas Van Devender, and others (manuscripts on file
at UTSA).
The radiocarbon assay of a charcoal sample from the upper part of the PreArchaic deposits yielded a date of 2740 +_ 150 B.C. The temporal span of the
Pre-Archaic occupations at Baker Cave generally agrees with the span indicated
by radiocarbon dates from similar contexts at other sites in the region (Weir
1976:29).
Directly below the unconsolidated Pre-Archaic fill we found a
distinctive gray stratum that had been termed Zone I by Word during his earlier
excavation (Figure 3). It is this zone that is attributable to a late Paleo-Indian
occupation of the Golondrina complex. Because of the lack of time and the
danger of wall-slumping, we were able to expose only a 6-square-meter area.
However, large quantities of cultural remains were recovered.
Lithics included a Golondrina basal fragment, a probable preform made on
a blade, and a bifacial gougelike implement (Figure 4, a-c’). The gougelike implement is particularly significant because such tools (known as Clear Fork
tools) up to that time had been found in surface or otherwise inconclusive
association with Golondrina points in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas
(Epstein 1969). This first excavated association of Golondrina with Clear Fork
tools demonstrates that the Clear Fork tool form is definitely an element in the
Golondrina complex tool kit. Additionally, the implement is covered with
residues (Figure 4,c); flake scars on the bit indicate that it had been resharpened,
apparently only a short time before it was snapped from its haft (Figure 4,c’).
Residues from this tool (and from several other flake tools from later contexts)
were analyzed by Harry Shafer and his associates at Texas A&M University.
Using methods developed for analysis of residue on lithics from dry rock-shelter
and cave deposits in the region (Shafer and Holloway 1979), Shafer has provided
the following preliminary data on the residues from the Clear Fork tool from the
Golondrina stratum. The residues are essentially organic, and they contain

recognizable plant fibers. However, specific identification of the fibers has not
yet been made. Shafer believes the fibers are probably from succulent plants
and that they definitely are not from wood. He notes that there is no evidence
of animal processing in the organic residues on the tool. The residues from
animal processing usually contain preserved animal hairs, and none were observed. It is possible that some of the organic materials on the tool represent a
mastic used in hafting; however, this has not been confirmed.
Of greatest importance was the discovery of a large basin-shaped hearth or
cooking pit, covered with a domelike pile of burned rock and filled with ash
and charcoal (Figure 5,b). The maximum diameter of this feature was 1.2
meters, and it was 30 cm deep. After the pit had been recorded and photographed, we decided to bag the entire fill and take it out of the cave for controlled fine-screening in the laboratory. Although some of our crew thought
we were especially crazy at the time for having them carry about 300 pounds of
hearth fill up the cliff face, we discovered during laboratory processing that the
fill was packed with fish, mammal, and reptile bones, seed remains, chert flakes,
and other debris. More than half of the fill from this feature has been preserved
unprocessed for future analysis.
An extensive array of materials from the hearth matrix has been processed
by severa! specialists. A preliminary pollen scan by Ed Luther, of the Department of Paleontology at the University of California at Berkeley, led to the
identification of sunflower, grasses, oak, Mormon tea, buckthorn, cattail, and a
variety of unidentified herbaceous plants (Table 2). Paleobotanical research on
the seeds and plant parts from the hearth fill has been conducted by Phil Dering.
The hearth matrix was passed through 1- and 6-mm screens, and a specialized
flotation method was utilized. The derived materials were hand sorted, identified, and quantified by Dering and his assistants. From the matrix came wood
charcoal, flowers, fruits, and seeds of 16 plant species. Selected wood charcoal
specimens were identified by Liz Porter, using a 40X dissecting microscope.
Identified woods included oak, juniper, buckeye, hackberry, guajillo, sycamore,
mesquite, and creosote bush. The most abundant seeds and fruits identified by
Dering were (in order of abundance) Texas black walnut, prickly pear, persimmon, two species of hackberry, mesquite, oak, mesca! bean, Mexican buckeye,
and several lesser species, including grape and little-leaf sumac.
Fauna recovered by fine-screening of samples from the hearth matrix have
been partially identified by Kenneth J. Lord and Thomas Van Devender. The
faunal list includes 12 species of mammals, 23 species of reptiles, and six species
of fish (Tables 3 and 4). Cottontai! rabbits, ground squirrels, rats, mice, and
gophers dominate the mammals; gray fox and jackrabbit are also present, a!though only a single jackrabbit bone was noted. The absence of larger fauna,
such as deer, from the hearth matrix is striking, but Word did find bones of deer
and coyote elsewhere in Zone I (Word and Douglas 1970). Two bird bones also
were noted, but these have not been conclusively identified. Among the fish,
the sucker family is predominant, with the red-horse sucker and the carp sucker
best represented. Also present is spotted bass, a species not found in the area
today. Van Devender’s analysis of the reptile remains from the hearth fill indicates the occurrence of one lizard species and 17 snake species (Table 4). The
snake remains generally represent large individuals, approaching 1.2 meters
(4 feet) in length. Three species of rattlesnakes are represented by charred
bones; other charred snake bones are from patch-nosed snakes, bullsnakes,

glossy snakes, and milksnakes. Bones of other snake species usually were not
charred; however, they were somewhat eroded, as if they had been digested.
All of the snakes represented in the hearth matrix are found in Val Verde
County today; however, Van Devender indicates that some of the 9000-yearold specimens were larger than those in contemporary snake populations. In
reviewing the snake remains from the hearth, William Elliott (1978:personal
communication) suggests that the "top five" species may have been Crotalus

atrox, Pituophis melanoleucus, Elaphe guttata or obsoleta, Masticophis, and
Salvadora. These are generally the more conspicuous species in a broad range
of habitats; moreover, they attain large size and are diurnal. Others, such as
Gyalopion canum, Hypsiglena torquata, Sonora semiannulata, and Tantilla,
probably were obtained by digging under or overturning rocks and debris (i.e.,
opportunistic foraging), but because of their small size they probably made only
a minimal contribution to the subsistence regime. A lizard species, possibly
the crevice or blue spiny lizard Sceloporus sp., a large diurnal lizard, was corn:non among the reptiles; most of the bones representing this species were
charred.
There is no doubt that this hearth and its contents date from Paleo-Indian
times; it is stratigraphically sealed within the stratum representing occupations
of the Golondrina complex. Two radiocarbon assays of samples of charcoal
from the hearth fill have produced dates of 7070 +_ 150 B.C. and 7230 + 220
B.C. (Table 1).
However, many questions are posed by the hearth. What can it tell us about
subsistence preferences during this period? What does it represent in terms of
food-processing technology? Can the palynological, faunal, and floral data
provide some insights into the paleoenvn’onment of this period? These and
other interesting problems can be only partially addressed at present.
Dering, Lord, and others who have worked in the region believe that a more
mesic climate system was present in the area around 9000 years ago. Plants
characteristic of xeric conditions, such as sotol and lechuguilla, are absent from
the hearth and were not noted by Dering in other botanical samples from the
Golondrina stratum. Dering has examined part of the plant macrofossil sample
from the overlying Pre-Archaic (beginning ca. 6100 B.C.) and from the Pandale

strata (ca. 2600 B.C.) and has observed distinct differences between those assemblages and ones from the Golondrina stratum. For example, small amounts of
lechuguilla appear in the Pre-Archaic deposits, and sotol is found in debris from
the Pandale period, indicating a continuing trend to3vard greater aridity. Also
in the Pre-Archaic, pecan is first introduced into the cave deposits, apparently
representing the initial appearance of this tree species in the area. This is the
earliest record of pecan in Texas (Grant Hal1:1982 personal communication).
The floral, faunal, and palynological data indicate an early Holocene environment. No Pleistocene fauna are represented in the extensive faunal inventory from the Golondrina stratum; apparently certain late Pleistocene fauna
(Van Devender has identified Procyon lotor sirnus, the large Pleistocene raccoon) can be found in the noncultural basal deposits underlying this early
human occupation. Indeed, most of the fauna found in the Golondrina stratum
are present in the area today; the spotted bass is apparently absent in Val Verde
County but has been recorded in a stream 70 miles to the southeast (Glen L.

1 14

Texas Archeologieal Society .

Evans: 1977, personal communication). Because the abundant plant and animal
remains from the Golondrina complex require continuing analysis, only preriminary comments can be offered on the subsistence activities of this early
occupation. The data from the hearth are supplemented by fauna recovered by
Word from elsewhere in the Golondrina stratum (Word and Douglas 1970).
In general, the subsistence regime was oriented toward broad-spectrum
hunting, gathering, and foraging. Although the climate may have been somewhat more moist, the people who rived 9000 years ago at Baker Cave had
essentially the same resources that are found in the area today, with the exception of the two major desert plant species, sotol and lechuguilla. Deer were
the only "large game" hunted; coyote and gray fox were killed, probably for
their pelts. Smaller mammals were much more extensively hunted or trapped,
especially rabbits, rats, mice, and ground squirrels. Judging from the contents
of the Golondrina hearth, rodents were dominant among the mammals eaten.
The other major faunal components of the diet appear to have been fish and
reptiles. Fish bones are particularly abundant in the hearth fill, although the
individual fish are comparatively small. Suckers were the most important fish
species. Reptiles (lizards and an amazing number of snake species) also were
favored subsistence items.
Most of the animal species were available on a year-round basis. Table 2
provides a list of the ripening times of the various fruits, berries, and nuts of
the plants that were in the hearth matrix. As indicated, most of the species
could be exploited from midsummer through early fall. This may reflect a
period during which the site was used by hunters and gatherers of the Go!ondrina complex. However, several of the plants found in the hearth produce
seeds or nuts that can be stored, for example, acorns, mesquite beans, hackberry seeds, and walnuts. Ethnohistoric data from southern Texas indicate that
pits were indeed used for storage of such plant remains (Campbell 1975:19).
The dominant plant item in the hearth matrix is the Texas black walnut, a
large grove of which is found today near the confluence of Phillips Canyon and
the Devil’s River. Some of the plants probably were exploited for other than
subsistence purposes. For example, the mescal bean derived from the Texas
mountain laurel has hallucinogenic properties (Campbell 1958), the Mexican
buckeye can be poisonous, the fruits of the coyotillo can cause paralysis, and
the agarita bush produces berries that reputedly have medicinal value (Vines
1960). Most of these plants may have been gathered for firewood.
With the extensive array of plant remains, it is likely that nutritional studies
could be made. Table 5 shows nutritional data that are available for some of
the plants found in the Golondrina hearth.
Most of the plants appear to represent collecting activities concentrated in
the riparian zones of the canyon and nearby Devil’s River, but some upland
species also are present. However, the mesquite, ubiquitous in southwestern
Texas today, has invaded the uplands only in the past 100 years or so, coming
in largely as a result of cattle raising and overgrazing (Hester 1975:108).
There is little direct evidence of food procurement and food-processing
technology from the Golondrina stratum. One assumes that the Golondrina
points were used as weapon tips in hunting, but they could have functioned
also as knives. Scrapers reported by Word and edge-modified flakes found in
1976 probably were used to process animals and plants, but we cannot yet

similar data (for protein, fat, fiber, and carbohydrate percentages) for California. Texas
Prosopis apparently is higher in protein content than its California counterpart; Quereus
is lower in protein in California species. Both Prosopis and Quercus are very high in carbohydrates.

assign them to specific tasks. To date, the work done by Shafer with residues on
the Clear Fork tool has the greatest potential for making it possible to link a
particular tool form of this horizon with a specific food-procurement or processing function. A hammerstone found in the stratum may have been used both
for stoneworking and for processing food items; unfortunately, no residues were
found on the specimen.
What does the hearth disclose about cooking technology? We are not yet
sure, and we may never be sure of how this large ash- and charcoal-filled pitwhich herein has been called a hearth-was used. Obviously, it was used for
repeated cooking tasks; the bottom of the basin was baked a pinkish red color,
and several lenses of ash and charcoal were noted within the pit. At the top of
the pit, just under the cap of burned rocks, were concentrations of charcoalsome pieces measuring more than 10 cm in diameter-as if the fire in the pit
had been quickly smothered. The pit probably had multiple uses, perhaps
for cooking a variety of fauna by a variety of methods. For example, fish
might have been prepared by barbecuing, baking, or smoking, and rabbits,
rats, lizards, snakes, and other small creatures might have been roasted or
scorched over fires built in the pit. And we should not overlook the distinct
possibility that the pit was a convenient trash receptacle, for in it are abundant
chert chips, primarily pressure flakes and biface-thinning flakes. In an ethnographic analogy drawn from northeastern California, it is interesting to note
that some aboriginal peoples there often tossed fish bones into their hearths
to keep their children from stepping on them (Voegelin 1942:178). Van Devender’s observation that some of the snake bones were not scorched, but were
eroded, as if they had passed through a digestive system (presumably human),

116

indicates that some of the fauna may have been eaten partially cooked or even
raw. The presence of eroded snake bones in the hearth might indicate that
feces (coprolites) ended up in the pit, again reflective of the trash-disposal
function suggested above (Bryant 1974:19). Van Devender notes that most of
snake remains come from the lower parts of the hearth. This leads me to speculate that this large cooking pit may have been used, abandoned, and reused in
a succession of seasonal visits to the site by people of the Golondrina complex.
Indeed, the profile of the hearth suggests several episodes of use (Figure 4,b).
CONCLUDING REMARKS

The 1976 excavations at Baker Cave produced a wealth of new information
on the activities of late Paleo4ndian hunters and gatherers of 9000 years ago.
Their lifeway operated during a climatic regime that was somewhat cooler
and moister than the climate in the region today (see discussions in Patton and
Dibble 1982). Major xeric plants, such as sotol and lechuguilla, used by later
Archaic occupations, are absent. Subsistence activities were focused in the
riverine and canyon environments near the site and downstream on the Devil’s
River. Small mammals, rodents, fish, and snakes (indeed there was an extensive
emphasis on snakes if not in terms of quantity at least in terms of variety) seem
to have been the most important meat sources. Walnut, prickly pear, persimmon, and hackberry were the dominant plant foods. The environment in the
vicinity of Baker Cave in 7000 B.C. certainly can be characterized as early Holocene. No vestiges of Pleistocene fauna, flora, or dramatic climatic differences
remain. The mesic conditions hypothesized above are supported by data from
earlier work in Southwest Texas (Story and Bryant 1966).
Radiocarbon dates place the Golondrina complex occupation securely in the
late Paleo-Indian period. The Paleo-Indian tradition of lanceolate projectile
points-usually carefully flaked and with lateral edge smoothing-persists here;
however, elsewhere in Texas-points of this tradition are found in other assemblages for another 1000 years. Gone, of course, are the Pleistocene mammals
and the early-to-middle Paleo4ndian hunting technologies used to exploit them.
Subsistence is geared, as it has to be, to the resources of the early Holocene.
It is perhaps misleading to say that hunting and foraging of small mammals and
reptiles, fishing, and plant-food collecting had become, at 7000 B.C., the dominant subsistence orientation; I suspect that these activities were just as prevalent
in early and middle Paleo-Indian times but are undocumented because of the
absence up to now of preserved subsistence data of the type obtained at Baker
Cave. Although I believe we should continue to separate Paleo-lndian cultural
patterns from those of the Archaic on the basis of certain technologies (especially the distinctive lithic industries), we cannot separate them on the basis of
overall subsistence regimes (Shafer 1976). This inability to separate PaleoIndian from Archaic subsistence regimes holds true for the Pre-Archaic and
Early Archaic deposits at Baker Cave. Drier climatic regimes led to the spread
of new plants-lechuguilla and sotol-but the use of resources present in the
Golondrina complex times persisted, albeit with differing emphases. By contrast, the new lithic technologies are distinctly different, but the poor preservation of fiber artifacts in the Golondrina and Pre-Archaic levels precludes any
temporal comparisons in that important area of the material cultural inventories. Only with similar samples of subsistence data from other sites and with

Hester-Baker Cave

1 17

the recovery of preserved nonlithic artifact assemblages will we be able to trace
any distinctive differences (and the reasons for them) between late Paleo4ndian
and earliest Archaic manifestations.
Although only a brief review of the !976 data has been possible here, I
believe that two major contributions have been realized. First of all, we now
have a much expanded view of the subsistence resources exploited by the people
of the Golondrina complex and, with continuing analysis, this expanded view
should have important implications for our understanding of the Golondrina
and other late Paleo-Indian complexes in Texas and adjacent areas. Second, we
can better define the Golondrina complex, knowledge of which to date has been
based essentially on its lithic technology. The Golondrina complex is widespread in Central and southern Texas and in northeastern Mexico, and the
data from Baker Cave greatly broaden our knowledge of its age, environment,
tool assemblages, and subsistence resources. With the help of the new data
from Baker Cave, the Golondfina surface sites and the accumulated distributional data referable to the Golondfina complex can be better interpreted and
can play an important role in our understanding of the final segment of the
Paleo4ndian period in the region.

MESQUITE (Prosopis) POLLEN AS AN ARCHEOLOGICAL
INDICATOR OF RECENT ENVIRONMENTS
L. Mark Raab

ABSTRACT
Historical and botanical data regarding the distribution of the genus Prosopis
(mesquite) in North and north-central Texas are ambiguous. These data do not
clearly indicate whether the genus appeared at some time during the prehistoric
era or whether, as some historical accounts suggest, the present distribution of
the genus is largely a result of invasion resulting from historic land-use practices.
Pollen, archeological, and stratigraphic evidence from two prehistoric contexts
suggests that the presence of pollen assignable to the genus Prosopis may be an
indicator of the modern environment. Archeologists are alerted to the possibility that this pattern may be useful as an indicator of contamination of prehistoric strata from the modem environment, and as a marker of the stratigraphic boundary between modern and prehistoric contexts.

Modern archeologists appreciate the fact that the study of pollen (palynology) can revea! important information about past environments and cultures.
Pollen data are sometimes the best source of information about past temperature and moisture regimes, vegetation communities, and selection of economic
plant species. Less welt appreciated, perhaps, is the fact that palynology can
also be a powerful tool for evaluating the integrity of natural and archeological
stratigraphic contexts. Two recent palynological studies in north-central Texas,
for instance, suggest that pollen of the genus Prosopis (mesquite) may be a useful indicator of the following:
1. the appearance within stratigraphic sequences of modem-i.e., Euroamerican-effects on the natural environment;
2. the degree to which prehistoric archeological contexts have been contaminated by disturbances originating in historic levels; and
3. the degree to which natural site formation processes such as shrink-swell
cracking of soil clays have introduced contaminates from modern environments into prehistoric archeological deposits.
THE PAST DISTRIBUTION OF MESQUITE

Existing botanical data on Prosopis within Texas are presently of limited
value in understanding the presence, frequency, and geographic distribution of
the genus in the state’s prehistoric environments. These data contain several
ambiguities.
Although it is a common observation that Prosopis has been invading grasslands and abandoned farm fields for decades (Gould 1975:3), it is unclear
whether this trend is a true invasion of an exotic form or merely an increase in
the numbers of an indigene.

Bulletin of the Texas Archeologieal Society

53:121-129

There can be little doubt that disturbance of natural plant communities
incidental to farming and ranching has provided an avenue for the genus to
"take over" large areas (Vines 1977:272). It is not clear whether this process
began with Euroamerican land use; i.e., whether introduction of the genus into
some parts of the state for the first time came in the wake of farming and ranching. If the "take over" did begin with Euroamerican land use, that might point
to spread of the genus from arid southwestern parts of the state and adjoining
regions. Alternatively, it could be postulated that Prosopis predates Euroamerican occupation in many parts of the state, but in comparatively small numbers.
This picture would suggest perhaps that the genus, held in check within climax
vegetation communities, began an explosive territorial expansion after land
clearing and overgrazing of grasslands weakened competition from climax species.
These two possibilities (separately or combined) are difficult to evaluate
because of interrelated temporal and spatial factors. Despite disagreement
among specialists about how many varieties of Prosopis should be recognized
taxonomically in Texas (cf. Vines 1977:273; Bogusch 1950; Correll and Johnson 1970:783), there is little doubt that Prosopis (e.g., P.pubeseens, P.glandulosa vat. velutina) varieties have occupied the arid Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan
biotic provinces of southwestern Texas and Mexico (Blair 1950) for thousands
of years. Presumably, some of these forms could have recently expanded their
range into North and East Texas. Whether mesquite has been indigenous to
North and East Texas for millennia is an open question, owing to lack of data
with appreciable time depth.
Historical and archeological data on the distribution of mesquite within
Texas are scanty, unsystematic, and suggest more questions than answers.
Historical documents indicate that mesquite was much in evidence in North
Texas and southern Oklahoma as early as the 1850s. For instance, a survey
of the headwaters of the Brazos River in North Texas by Marcy in 1854 (Terry
1962:4-6) makes frequent reference to large stands of mesquite. If the presence
of mesquite is indicative of environmental "disturbances incidental to Euroamerican occupation, these data suggest that such impacts were felt quite early
during historic settlement. On the other hand, historic observations cannot rule
out the possibility that the genus was invading northern Texas prior to Euroamerican settlement.
Archeological data offer interesting clues, but are not complete enough at
present to shed light on long-term distributional trends. Hester (1981 : 120-121)
reports that mesquite has been identified from wood charcoal, along with acacia,
oak, ash, hackberry and willow, in archeological sites in the Choke Canyon
Reservoir area 130 km (80 miles) south of San Antonio. He indicates that mesquite was present in riparian environments in the project area at least as early as
1300 B.C. Thomas R. Hester (1982:personal communication) has hypothesized
that mesquite may have been indigenous to riparian habitats in southern Texas
and that it subsequently, for reasons unknown at present, became an invading
species in other habitats. These data suggest the need to correlate long-term data
about environmental effects from many regions of the state. Again, however,
the picture of the distribution of mesquite in Texas over time is far from clear.
Despite these problems, archeologists should not be deterred from seeking
data on biological and environmental phenomena. The search for such data will
certainly require interdisciplinary cooperation, but the initiative for finding data

Raab-Mesquite Pollen

123

of use in solving archeological problems probably will have to come from archeologists themselves. In that vein, we now turn to consideration of empirical data
on Prosopis in archeological contexts.
PROSOPIS AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATOR
Two recent archeological investigations in north-central Texas suggests that
Prosopis pollen may be an indicator of recent environments because it appears
to be confined to stratigraphic contexts either produced during or disturbed by
historic occupations. In both contexts mesquite pollen seems to demarcate
effectively archeological or natural deposits largely synchronous with historic
occupation of north-central Texas.
Prosopis pollen was recognized as an indicator only after it appeared in two
contrasting site contexts, suggesting that the effect is attributable not to factors
specific to the sites, but rather to forces that crosscut site types and site settings.
One of the two sites, the Cobb-Poole site (41DL148)-a Late Prehistoric (A.D.
800-1200) occupation containing ceramics and arrowpoints-is on the second
terrace of a tributary of the Trinity River (Raab, Bruseth, and McIntyre 1981:
36-58; Raab and Woosley 1982), just outside the southwestern city limit of
Dallas. Pollen samples from the Cobb-Poole site are derived from a stratigraphic
soil column taken from a large prehistoric pit feature of entirely human origin.
In contrast, the second stratigraphic soil column came from the banks of
Chambers Creek, in Navarro County, east of Corsicana. This column was recovered from sediments of the Chambers Creek flood plain during the Richland
Creek Archeological Project, undertaken by the Archaeology Research Program
of Southern Methodist University in 198!. These sites therefore contrast with
respect to human versus natural formation processes, and alluvial versus colluvial
settings, yet certain of their palynological patterns are quite similar. Examination of these patterns illustrates this point.
The Cobb-Poole site is intriguing in several respects. It is argued elsewhere
(Raab and Woosley 1982) that Cobb-Poole was a permanently or semipermanently occupied site, containing a possible pit house, and located on a terrace
that afforded access to now-extinct springs originating in the terrace. Of interest
here, however, is the vertica! column of soil samples taken from the suspected
pit house. Thirteen soil samples (Figure 1) were taken for pollen extraction
from a column nearly 2 meters in depth. A complete description of this pit
feature, the sampling procedures, and pollen-processing methods and results are
presented in Raab, Bruseth, and McIntyre (1981) and in Raab and Woosley
(1982). Suffice it to say here that these samples were expected to reflect
changes in pollen types and frequencies that might have been occasioned by
human occupation of the pit and by episodes of pit filling, following site abandonment. Figure 1, a partial listing of recovered pollen, shows that there are
several identifiable trends in pollen data connected with those events.
Of primary interest to the present discussion are the stratigraphic location
and frequency of Prosopis pollen. It is important to note that the Cobb-Poole
site is in an abandoned farm field. Not surprisingly, sample number 25 of
Figure 1, a control sample for the stratigraphic column, contains pollen of the
genera Zea (corn), Gossypium (cotton), and Cucurbita (squash-gourd). We
might well expect to find these domesticates in a habitat disturbed by recent
farming. The finding of Prosopis pollen in the same sample is also not surprising

in view of the fact that mesquite trees were growing on the site at the time the
sample was taken and are common in the region. What is of interest, however,
is the fact that no Prosopis pollen was found below the 78-cm level of the
sampling column, and no domesticate pollen was found below the surface.
These facts suggest, perhaps, that Prosopis pollen indicates the maximum depth
of contamination of the sampling column by modern pollen.
This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that cracks in the soil extend
from the surface to a maximum depth of about 80 cm. These cracks are the
familiar shrink-swell cracks formed in the montmorillonitic clays common to
the prairie soils in which the site is located. It seems reasonable to propose
that some surface pollen could have been transported to a depth of 78 cm
under these circumstances. In line with this expectation the frequency of
Prosopis pollen grains drops from 15 in sample 25 at the surface to 5 grains in
sample 12 at 78 cm (Figure 1) (Raab and Woosley 1982). We do not know
when Prosopis appeared in the sampling column at the Cobb-Poole site, but
present evidence argues for its appearance in or only shortly before historic
times.
The Cobb-Poole site has not yet produced material suitable for radiocarbon
dating. However, collections of Gibson aspect ceramics and arrow points (Skinner and Connors 1979:37-43), including materials from within the suspected pit
house (Raab, Bruseth, and McIntyre 1981:36-58) suggest a date of about A.D.
800 to 1200 for the site. Stratigraphically, the sediments to a depth of 78 cm
in the suspected pit house appear, on the basis of water-deposited clay-silt-sand
laminae, to represent post-abandonment deposits. These facts also argue for a
post-occupational date for the sediments containing Prosopis pollen.
The Cobb-Poole data are not an isolated case. Recent work in the area of
the proposed Richland Creek Reservoir has also produced information suggesting that Prosopis pollen is a useful indicator of the recent environment. Prior
to initiation of archeological fieldwork, a soils scientist was employed to reconstruct the depositional history of the two major streams in the project area
(Richland and Chambers creeks), and to try to correlate the terraces in the project area with those of the Trinity River in the Dallas area. These objectives were
prerequisites to the project’s announced goals of paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and of attempts to predict specific depositional settings that might
contain archeological deposits.
A reconstruction of the depositional history required the excavation of deep
stratigraphic trenches into the banks of Richland and Chambers creeks, and a
synthesis of field and lab studies of the soils to produce a coherent stratigraphy
(Pheasant 1982). At the same time, soft samples for pollen extraction were
taken from the geologically defined depositional units. Table 1 presents some
of the results of this pollen work at site 41NV139 on Chambers Creek.
A complete discussion of palynological work in the Richland Project, including integration of data with soils work, extraction techniques, and the regional paleoenvironmental picture, is presented by Raab, McGregor, and Bruseth
(1982). Attention is drawn in that report to three depositional units (Table 1)
which, together with their associated paleosols (ancient buried soils), reflect
changes in the kinds of materials that were deposited by Chambers Creek on its
flood plain over a period of 5 millennia. Table 1 was prepared by the writer to
illustrate long-term changes in the frequencies of four pollen types for compari-

son with work by Bryant (1977) and Bryant and Shafer (1977). Of primary
interest is the stratigraphic position of Prosopis.
We can see from Table 1 that Prosopis pollen is found from the surface of
the column to the bottom of depositional unit3 (66 cm below surface). Below that level, no Prosopis pollen was recovered. Interestingly, depositional unit
3 is clearly of historic origin. Historic materials such as glass and metal were
found within unit 3 at many localities in the banks of Richland and Chambers
creeks. Just as Prosopis is associated with modern cultigens at the Cobb-Poole
site, so Prosopis is linked here with historic-period artifacts within a well-defined
stratigraphic unit.
Another line of evidence points to a recent date for Prosopis at site 41NV
139. Table 1 presents data from one of two trenches cut into the flood-plain
sediments of Chambers Creek. After Trench 1 was cut with a backhoe,, the
machine was maneuvered onto a bench in the bottom of the creek and Trench
2 was dug downward from the level of the bottom of Trench 1. Trench 2, which
measured 6.29 meters in depth, therefore provided a continuation of the stratigraphic column begun in Trench 1. Analysis of Trench 2 suggested, however,
that its sediments represented a recent cut-and-fill episode within depositional
unit 3, which comprises the present bed of Chambers Creek (Pheasant 1982).
Correlation of the sediments in Trench 2 with those in Trench 1, makes it apparent that Trench 1 is of recent age, contemporaneous with depositional unit 3
(Pheasant 1982). Subsequent extraction of pollen from Trench 2 sediments revealed that Prosopis pollen is mixed throughout the column in Trench 2. The
geological evidence, then, reinforces the conclusion that the presence of Prosopis is an indicator of the recent environment. Prosopis pollen is found only
in the most recent flood-plain sediments (depositional unit 3) of Trench 1 or
within sediments recently laid down in the bed of Chambers Creek (Trench

2).
How recent are these deposits? Radiocarbon dates are currently available
only for depositionat unit 1 in Table 1. These span a range of 2064 B.C. +
177 years to A.D. 420 + 150 years (Raab, McGregor, and Bruseth 1982). At
present, the temporal range of depositional unit 3-or Trench 2-is not known,
but the presence of historic artifacts throughout unit 3 indicates a modern age.
CONCLUSIONS
Certainly caution is in order in drawing conclusions on the basis of two
studies. Still, good evidence exists in two cases to suggest that the presence
of Prosopis pollen can enable us to distinguish comparatively modern environments from older deposits and, by logical extension, can isolate deposits that
have not been contaminated by pollen from recent environments, as, for example, has resulted from soil cracking at the Cobb-Poole site. The study of
pollen is useful in evaluating contextual integrity. In the case of the Cobb-Poole
site, the lack of cultigen and Prosopis pollen from the lower strata of a suspected
pit house (together with the presence of artifacts) also helped to establish this
feature as being both of prehistoric origin and in an undisturbed state of preservation, to the extent that pollen data indicate. At site 41NV139 (Frossard site),
the linking of Prosopis po!len to a recent stratum containing historic artifacts,
and to recent sediments in the bottom of the stream channel (but not in stratigraphically intermediate sediments, some of which are known to be ancient on

128

Texas Archeological Society

the basis of C-14 assays) also provides reasonable assurance that Prosopis is confined to recent contexts and that certain levels in the stratigraphic column are
apparently undisturbed. The geological evidence reinforces these conclusions.
But there is still much we do not know. For example, is Prosopis pollen a
valid indicator outside of northern or north-central Texas? We do not know and
will not know until more studies are undertaken. Even if the use of Prosopis
proves to be regionalized, however, it would still serve important analytical
ends within northern and north-central Texas. Prosopis data would also, of
course, have significance for historical biogeographers. Also, we cannot tell
yet whether Prosopis pollen appeared at the time of Euroamerican settlement
or whether it entered the area prior to that time;in short, we do not have dates
for this event. This question is important and needs investigation.
Finally, and fundamental to this report, is the accuracy with which we have
identified the Prosopis pollen. This identification was made on the basis of careful comparison of fossil pollen with type collections of modern pollen. Still,
identification of the genus Prosopis is complicated by the fact that it is one of
a group of legumes (Legumenosae) in which several closely related forms are
sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another. Several independent evaluations of the data are required. But even if another form of legume were indicated in this analysis, the existing data suggest a consistency of results that
would still serve the analytical objectives set out here.
In sum, the purpose of this paper is to alert archeologists and palynologists
to the possibility of using pollen analysis to solve important environmental and
contextual problems through identification of what are in effect marker types.
With the increasingly interdisciplinary projects that are being launched today,
this task is both feasible and potentially rewarding.

ANALYSIS OF MAMMALIAN HAIR AND PLANT FIBERS IN
CORDAGE FROM A TEXAS ARCHAIC SHELTER
Glendon H. Weir

ABSTRACT
Cordage of anima! hair and plant fibers from Gobbler Shelter (41CXl17),
an Archaic site located in Crockett County, Texas, were analyzed to determine
from which species of animals and plants these materials came. Mammal hairs
were identified by comparison with modern distributions, by separation into
the rodent-lagomorph group, and by direct comparison with reference materials.
Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to confirm the identifications
of three lagomorph genera (one jackrabbit and two cottontails) which made up
the majority of the hairs in the cordage samples. By a similar methodology,
plant fibers in the cordage were identified as being of Dasylirion (sotol) species
in the majority of the samples. The advantages of using a combination of
methodologies in hair and fiber identification is discussed, and a methodology
by which archeologists can identify similar materials is described.

INTRODUCTION
Gobbler Shelter is located in a small tributary canyon of Live Oak Creek in
Crockett County, Texas. It was discovered in 1974 by Texas Highway Department archeologists who were surveying the proposed right-of-way for Interstate
Highway 10. In January 1975, small matrix samples were removed from a fiber
lens within the shelter and sent to the Texas A&M University Anthropological
Research Laboratories for analyses. The preliminary analyses of artifacts,
animal, and plant remains were reported by Dering and Shafer (1976:210-229),
and the problems of determining seasonatity of the plant remains were discussed.
This report concerns later analyses of animal hairs and plant fibers contained in
the cordage recovered from Gobbler Shelter, with primary emphasis on the
identification of mammalian hairs. The methodology described here can be
modified slightly and applied by archeologists who lack training in hair morphology to identify such materials.
BACKGROUND

The use of hair in the identification of taxonomic groups has been studied
since the nineteenth century (Fraser 1931). In archeology it has been used
most notably since 1942, when Brown (1942) developed a key to the genera of
carnivores north of the Rio Grande for the use of nonspecialists in identifying
mammalian hair.
Today a variety of approaches of varying utility and reliability are used by
archeologists for the identification of mammalian hair. It is the objective of
this paper to describe one such methodology which the writer believes to be
both reliable and useful, and to suggest a practical application of this technique

by archeologists who may lack the technical background or not have easy access
to specialists in hair identification.
The types of hairs (Figure 1) present on the bodies of the majority of mam:
reals are: (1) fur hair, which serves to insulate the body, is typically the most
abundant type of hair on the body, and is relatively short, fine, and often curly;
(2) guard hair, which protects the fur hair and the skin from abrasian, is most
abundant on the trunk of the body, least abundant on the extremities, and is
larger and more robust than fur hair; and (3) the vibrissae, or whiskers, which
are stiff, straight hairs that arise directly from special hair follicle cells and serve
as sensory probes (Trevor-Deutsch 1970). The cuticular scales of the vibrissae
are typically worn off as a result of abrasion, and thus these hairs are of little
diagnostic value.
Normally, hair consists of three concentric layers, as illustrated in Figure 2.
These layers consist of: (1) an inner central medulla, made up of shrunken
cells and air spaces, with characteristic patterns that vary widely and distinctively among mammals; (2) a surrounding cortex, which contains the pigment
giving hair its color; and (3) the cuticle, the outermost layer of overlapping
scales, the patterns of which also vary widely and characteristically among
mammals.
It is generally agreed that the medullary cell and cuticular scale patterns
of the guard hairs (Figure 3) are the most diagnostic characteristics for use
in hair identification (Trevor-Deutsch 1970).
METHODS AND MATERIALS

Hair Samples
Two different methodologies are used in identifying mammalian hair. One
involves the development and use of hair keys to make identifications, and the
other involves the direct comparison of hair samples with comparative reference
collection hair materials. Both methods accomplish the same ends, but the
writer believes the methodology of Trevor-Deutsch (1970), who uses a combination of these two methods in a four-step key for identification of mammal
guard hairs, and also uses comparative reference materials, to be the most
reliable and useful procedure.
This method uses four dichotomous steps to arrive at the identification of
hair samples (Table 1). The first step narrows the group of animals to be considered to the characteristic mammal population of a given area. The second
step separates the rodents and lagomorphs (hares, rabbits, and pikas-smatl
tailless, harelike mammals of the genus Oehotona found in the mountains of
North America and Eurasia-sometimes called conys) from the nonrodent
mammals by means of a diagnostic characteristic of the guard hair medulla
known as the rodent base (Mathiak 1938). The third step uses the length of
the guard hair to separate the larger from the smaller animals in the lagomorph
group. In archeological samples it is not always possible to use guard hair
length as a diagnostic characteristic, since guard hairs are often broken and
fragmented. The fourth step, final identification as to genus, is then accomplished by comparing the sample hairs with reference materials.
For this report, however, the initial step was the direct comparison of sample
hair with reference material, first using light microscopy, which allows "tuning
through" some layers of the hair, making it possible to detect characteristic

structures on the inside of the hair. Scanning electron microscopy, because of
its superior ability to detect details of surface structure, such as the diagnostic
scalar patterns of the cuticle, was then used to confirm these identifications.
The comparative reference material used in this study was a representative
collection of hair from mammals whose modern distribution includes the generalized area of Gobbler Shelter (Davis 1974:229, 236, 241; Hall and Kelson
1959:261, 264, 283). Although it is not certain that past and present distributions of these animals are the same, the modern fauna were believed to be
the most likely candidates for the lagomorph population of this area in the past.
A combination of methods was used to investigate the hairs and fibers in the
cordage from Gobbler Shelter. First, preserved hairs selected at random from
the cordage were examined under a Nikon SKE II light microscope equipped
with a Kohler illuminating system, in order to determine the presence or absence
of the diagnostic lagomorph hair morphology. This consists of the so-called
rodent base (Figure 4), referring to a characteristic of rodent-lagomorph guard
hair anatomy in which there is a diagnostic regularity of medullary cell size,

shape, and arrangement (Mathiak 1938). Next, a very dilute solution of distilled
water and liquid soap (ca. 50 parts water to 1 part soap) was used as a mounting
medium in order to view the internal medullary cell pattern under the microscope, since air within the medulla often renders its structure obscure. The small
amount of soap in the water allows the solution to penetrate the medulla,
making its fine structure visible.
The individual hairs in the sample that had the rodent base were then examined by light microscopy (scanning electron microscopy at this stage would
require specimen preparation) for the characteristic medullary cell patterns that
would confirm the identifications.
Mammalian hair samples that were in a similar state of preservation as those
treated for light microscopy, as discussed above, were then cleaned in carbon
tetrachloride (or other comparable but nontoxic solvents) and prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination, in order to further refine and confirm
the light microscopy identifications. Typical mammalian comparative reference
hairs from animals whose modern ranges include the Gobbler Shelter area, and
well-preserved samples of mammalian hair selected from representative cordage
material, were then mounted on scanning electron microscopy specimen stubs.
These standard 10 mm aluminum stubs were cleaned first with xylene to remove
any wax or grease, then with acetone and absolute (100 percent) ethanol alcohol
to remove the xylene solvent. The reference and sample specimens were then
mounted on the stubs in a polyvinyl chloride and methyl ethyl ketone adhesive
and given a gold-palladium coating in a vacuum evaporator in order to prepare
them for examination.

Plan t Fibers

Various plant fibers were found in association with the mammalian hair in
the cordage samples. The more intact of these fibers were treated chemically
and viewed under the light microscope in an effort to identify individual plant
fibers, using the methodology of Bell and King (1944:152, 156-158). Samples
of the plant fibers were soaked overnight (ca. 12-16 hours) in a !0 percent
solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH), mounted on glass microscope slides,
and macerated with a spatula. When the plant fibers began to separate, they
were further separated with two dissecting needles. A drop or two of distilled
water was then added, and the slide samples covered with cover slips. The fibers
were then separated on the basis of differing morphology of the lumen (the
inner open space that runs more or less the length of the tubular fibers) (Figure
5). This difference in morphology makes it possible to use a three-step process
(Table 2) to separate the plant fibers of Dasylirion (sotol), Yucca (yucca), and
Nolina (beargrass), all of which have straight fibers. The curved fibers of Agave
(mescal) are more easily distinguished (Figures 6, 7). Identifications of the
plant fibers in the archeological cordage were then made using a light microscope.
Reference and sample specimens of hair and cordage were also examined
and photographed with a JSM-U3 scanning electron microscope. The film used
in photographing the specimens was Tri-X Pan 4 x 5 inch professional film at an
acceleration voltage of 15 kilovolts with an f-stop of 11 and a scanning speed
of 50 lines per minute.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hair Samples

On the basis of gross hair morphology and frequency of appearance in the
cordage samples from Gobbler Shelter it was first tentatively concluded that
mammalian hair of the lagomorph group (Figure 8), together with a few plant
fibers, were the major components of the samples.
The representative sample materials were then examined under a light microscope and, based on the diagnostic features discussed above, the lagomorph
hairs were tentatively identified as cottontail and jackrabbit species. The plant
fibers were similarly identified as probable sotol and/or yucca species. The
sample materials were again examined with a scanning electron microscope, and
the probable identifications were confirmed as being mainly Lepus californieus

Grey (California jackrabbit) hairs, along with a few hairs possibly of Sylvilagus
auduboni Baird (desert cottontail) and Sylvilagus floridanus Allen (eastern
cottontail), based on comparisons with reference specimens. The plant fiber
specimens were found to be mostly DasylMon (sotol) species and/or Yucca
(yucca) species, based on their diagnostic structures under both light and scanning electron microscopy.
The results of these analyses are illustrated in a series of scanning electron
photomicrographs in Figures 9 through 20. These figures are a representative
selection of the numerous reference and sample materials photographed in this
study. Figures 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 are characteristic reference fur and guard
hairs, while Figures 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 illustrate typical sample materials.
Figures 9 and 11 are micrographs of reference Lepus californicus Grey
(California jackrabbit) hairs illustrating typical guard hair morphology and
scalar patterns. As seen in the comparative electron micrograph series in Figures
9-10 and 11-12, the first of each pair represents reference material, and the
second, sample material. The typical scalar patterns from reference and sample
materials are displayed in this series of California jackrabbit guard hairs, the
major component of the hair materials in this study. These comparisons confirmed prior identifications by analysis of medullary cell patterns and other
characteristics from the same material by light microscopy.
Similarly, Figures 13 and 15 are micrographs of reference Syh~ilagus auduboni
Baird (Audubon or desert cottontail) guard hair morphology and scalar patterns,
while Figures 14 and 16 are typical similar sample materials from the cordage.
The materials in Figures 17 and 18 represent similar materials for Sylvilagus
floridanus Allen (eastern cottontail), a suspected component of a few of the
hair samples in this study. These comparative electron micrographs (and numerous others taken during this study) serve in Figures 9 through 20 to represent similar confirmed scalar patterns of desert and eastern cottontail guard
hairs from the same materials.
A few additional hairs, apparently from other species of mammals, were
present in the cordage specimens but were not subjected to definitive analyses
or photographed for this report, as these hairs did not have well-preserved
diagnostic features that would allow identifications. The preliminary indications
are that those hairs which lack definitive morphology are otherwise consistent
with deer guard hair morphology.
Plant Fibers
Figures 19 and 20 represent a sample of miscellaneous plant fibers viewed
with scanning electron microscopy and are examples of the cordage sample
plant fiber materials in various stages of preservation. Analyses of a representative selection of the better-preserved fibers in the cordage were made,
leading to their tentative identification as Dasylirion (sotol) or Yucca (yucca)
species, using the criteria discussed above. These plant fiber identifications were
more characteristically seen in light microscopy, as scanning electron microscopy requires special specimen preparation, which can obscure some details.
The plant fibers were found by light microscope examination to compare
favorably with samples of sotol or possibly yucca fiber material in the writer’s
reference collection. The analyses of the plant fiber materials bear out the
difficulties pointed out by Bell and King (1944:156) in distinguishing between
individual fibers of Yucca or Dasylirion species. These probable identifications,

however, are consistent with the reference material and with the known modern
plant communities in the Gobbler Shelter area, which includes both plants
(Dering and Shafer 1976). Further, ethnographic sources (Bell and Castetter
1941; Castetter 1935:14; Havard 1895:98-123; Standley 1912:447-463; and
Bourke 1895:41-71) amply document the aboriginal use of both of these plants
in similar prehistoric areas.
CONCLUSIONS
The identification of mammalian hairs preserved in archeological contexts
can be accomplished using the methodology described in this report. This
approach to hair analysis has several advantages to be realized through the use
of a combination of methodo!ogies, as opposed to analysis by means of hair
keys alone or by direct comparison alone. Among these advantages are: (1)
identification of mammalian hair by nonspecialists through initial screening
using readily determinable criteria such as known modern anfinal ranges, hair
morphology, and hair length, followed by direct comparison with hair reference
collections, using criteria that are relatively invariable, objective, and easy to
recognize; (2) a considerable saving of time realized through successive reduction in the amount of reference material to be surveyed; (3) minimal hair
sample preparation through use of simple light microscopy sample preparation
techniques; and (4) the possible further use of techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, which helps specialists obtain better diagnostic detail. In this
regard, a reference collection of scanning electron micrographs can facilitate
ready viewing and comparison of diagnostic detail in sample specimens.
Because every hair to some extent differs from every other hair, some subjectivity and possibility of error exists. The methodology for analysis described
here reduces considerably the potential for error by: (1) successively limiting
the number of animal species to be considered; (2) using broad diagnostic
characteristics that effectively separate major mammalian groups (e.g., the
rodent base); and (3) enabling determination of the range of morphological
variation between species by the use of reference collections of verified typical
hair materials.
Further, the combined use of light microscopy and scanning or other electron
microscopy by specialists would produce more reliable results. It is possible that
with some additional specimen preparation-sectioning hairs and special mounting of these samples-the entire analysis could be conducted using only scanning
electron microscopy, which makes possible a more objective determination of
diagnostic hair patterns and structures and better viewing of diagnostic detail.
This approach and methodology can be applied with similar results to identification of plant fibers-often found with hair materials in archeological contexts-through visual analyses of cross sections of vascular or other plant anatomy, and/or use of reference collections of typical plant fiber materials.
The relative ease of sample preparation and objectivity of the criteria used in
animal hair and plant fiber identification, together with the use of the light
microscopy level of analysis, makes it possible for nonspecialists to apply these
techniques in field or laboratory analyses. Thus, a slight modification of the
procedures described above will allow archeologists who are not trained in hair
morphology or plant anatomy to identify with relative ease many archeological
samples of common animal hairs and plant fibers.

DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS OF STONE TOOLS FROM
THE SAN PEDRO VALLEY OF ARIZONA

Norman M. Whalen

ABSTRACT
An archeological survey in southern Arizona resulted in the recording of 293
sites ranging in age from 3500 B.C. to A.D. 1450. The sites crosscut five environmental zones and yielded 3387 stone artifacts and 643 ceramic sherds.
Application of the multivariate technique of discriminant analysis disclosed the
performance of eight functional activities and demonstrated differential preference for certain activities during successive time and cultural periods.

INTRODUCTION
During the summer months of 1975 through 1977 an archeological survey
was conducted of the east side of the San Pedro Valley in southeastern Arizona
between the Dragoon Mountains and the San Pedro River (Figure 1). Within
the boundaries of the 180-square-mile (46,620 ha) area, 16.5 square miles
(4273 ha), or sections, representing 9 percent of the total area were surveyed,
and 293 prehistoric sites were discovered. These included Cochise sites of the
Chiricahua (3500-1500 B.C.) and San Pedro (1500-200 B.C.) stages and other
sites identified as agricultural features. Decorated ceramics on some sites suggest
dates as late as A.D. 1450. Five environmental zones-distinguished from one
another by elevation, topography, and prevailing forms of vegetation-crosscut
the survey area.
ENVIRONMENTAL ZONES

The central San Pedro Valley is flanked by two parallel northwest-trending
mountain ranges, the Whetstones on the west, and the Dragoons on the east.
The ranges are separated by a valley about 32 km (20 miles) wide, through
which the San Pedro River flows in a northerly course. In the surveyed area on
the east side of the valley are five environmental zones, which are described
below from the highest to the lowest.
(1) The mountain zone consists mainly of canyons cutting into the mountains at elevations averaging 5100 feet. Vegetation is primarily oak-woodland,
with a heavy gallery of willow, oak, and mesquite. The woodland is interspersed with yucca, cholla, and an occasional prickly pear cactus on an understory of grasses.
(2) The hillside zone is a narrow band of open plains about .8 km (.5 mile)
wide bordering the mountains and sloping gently downward and westward
toward the river nearly 20 km (!2 miles) away. The hillside zone has scattered

sentinels of oak and mesquite, with yucca, prickly pear, and, rarely, mescal
interspersed among thick grasses and sage.
(3)
The bajada, the largest zone, is more than 16 km (10 miles) wide and
extends from the hillside zone down to the 4000-foot elevation about 2.5 km
(1.5 miles) from the flood plain. The upper part of the bajada-nearest the
hillside-is open country with oak and mesquite surrounded by thick grasses
that rapidly diminish, to be replaced by a creosote-bursage community, heavily
congested in places. Other species on the bajada include blackbush, yucca, and
prickly pear. Mesquite grows on the bajada (but less densely than in the
riparian environment), together with paloverde, ironwood, catclaw, and several
scrubs. Elevation of the bajada varies from 4000 to 5000 feet.
(4)
The first terrace is indistinguishable environmentally from the bajada
and is in fact a continuation of it. The first terrace overlooks the flood plain
below, from which it extends upward for about 2.5 km (1.5 miles). The first
terrace was designated a zone for cultural reasons. We expected to find small
agricultural settlements there close to the farming potential of the flood plain.
Elevation of the zone varies from 3800 to 4000 feet.

(5) The flood plain is a flat, low-lying zone that adjoins the San Pedro
River and is seldom more than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above it. Here cottonwood
trees compete with mesquite, which sometimes clusters in almost impenetrable
thickets on the river bank. In places the flood plain is 1.5 km (1 mile) wide;in
others the slopes of the first terrace impinge directly on the river, leaving no
flood plain at all. Vegetation on the flood plain is more luxuriant than elsewhere due to fiver overflow and runoff from tributary washes. Grasses are
thick and tall, and the zone is liberally blanketed with creosote, sage, catclaw,
and blackbush, together with arboreal species of ironwood and paloverde.
FIELD METHODS
In the first year of the survey the initial size of a survey unit was one section,
but the unit was later reduced to a quarter-section on the assumption that the
information gathered in a quarter-section was truly representative of the entire
section (Plog 1976; Judge, Ebert, and Hitchcock 1975). By reducing the size
of the survey unit we were able to quadruple the area in diverse environmental
zones that could be covered in a given time span. This methodology is valid, of
course, only if environmental factors within the section are constant and if both
quarter-sections and sites are randomly distributed. Preparatory to the actual
survey, sections and quarter-sections were numbered consecutively and survey
units were chosen from a table of random numbers in order to minimize bias in
the selection process.
Although 9 percent of the total area was surveyed, the environmental zones
were not covered equally or in proportion to the area they cover (Table 1). The
immense size of the bajada (128 sections) precluded a 9 percent survey, since
that alone would have entailed a reconnaissance of 11.5 sections, a task that
would require two summers to complete. On the other hand, the mountain and
hillside zones received more than adequate coverage, which was required for
compliance with the terms of a permit from the U.S. Forest Service that had
to be secured because those zones were mainly located in the Coronado National
Forest. The flood plain posed a different problem. It is almost wholly under
cultivation, with very few patches in pristine condition. This fact, coupled with
strenuous objections of local farmers to any survey in their plowed and planted
fields, limited the area of flood plain open for survey. Consequently only one
quarter-section, which was undisturbed by cultivation, was examined.
Both section and quarter-section units were surveyed on foot in criss-cross
fashion from one end of the unit to the other with intervals of about 60 meters
(200 feet) between swaths. At times, particularly in mountain canyons, the
irregularity of the terrain interrupted this pattern. Sample collections of stone
artifacts and sherds, especially decorated sherds to aid in dating, were made
from each site. Artifacts were gathered at random as the archeologists walked
across the sites to determine site dimensions and locate features such as house
outlines, hearths, walls, and rock piles. Color photographs were taken of each
site and feature, house outlines were measured and plotted, and distances between houses were calculated. Data collected at each site also included horizontal and vertical distance to water, the direction to and nature of the water
source (e.g., spring, wash, river), and descriptions of site topography, soil, s!ope,
and types and density of surrounding vegetation. Each site was sketched, and its
precise location was pinpointed on a U.S. Geological Survey map. These descrip-

tions enabled us to assemble composite pictures of the environmental and
physical attributes of the sites and of the environmental zones in which they
were located. In the course of the 3-year survey, 3387 stone artifacts and 643
sherds were recovered.
ARTIFACTS

The system used by Haury (1950) in his Ventana Cave report was used for
classifying stone artifacts. Artifacts described by Haury closely resemble the
ones collected in the San Pedro Valley 160 km (100 miles) to the east of
Ventana Cave, as indeed they should, since the Ventana Cave artifacts come
from the same culture and the same time interval as the San Pedro artifacts.
The stone artifacts collected at the sites were first divided into three classes:
chipped stone tools, ground stone tools, and artifacts associated with tool
manufacturing. After this preliminary division, the tools were classified according to the types defined by Haury. Except for scrapers and choppers, no
attempt was made to divide them into further subtypes. Scrapers, however,
were subdivided into side, end, ovoid, disc, and domed varieties, and choppers
were subdivided into end and side forms. Projectile points, regardless of morphology, were listed simply as projectile points, although their cultural affiliations were noted when they could be ascertained. Manos were listed without
differentiating the various forms. Gravers were distinguished from drills by the
shortened projection of the former and the lengthened, bifacially flaked shaft
of the latter. Like manos, burins and cores were entered without reference to
subtypes.
After the artifacts had been provisionally classified, they were examined for
wear patterns under binocular stereoscopic microscope with magnifications
averaging 50X. Waste debris was examined as well as chipped stone tools, and
as a result some specimens were reclassified. For example, a tool resembling
a chopper was found under magnification to lack any evidence of wear, such
as battering, striations, or a crushed or shattered working edge, so it was reclassified as a core. In another case a tool thought to be a plane was classified
as a core after the microscopic examination failed to disclose any evidence of
wear. A tool was confirmed as a notch when, under magnification, numerous
parallel striations could be seen at right angles to the indented edge. These are
a few cases where microscopic examination corrected or corroborated tool
identification based on morphology alone. The work of Keeley (1977, 1980)
also demonstrates the value of microscopic study of stone tools prior to typological and functional classification.

Whalen-Discriminant Analysis

155

Fifty-four artifact types were identified in the collection (Figures 2-4): 46
were finished tool types, four were ground stone tools (metate, mano, mortar,
and abrader), and four were of the manufacturing tool category (core, hammerstone, flake, and chunk). Twenty-six of the finished tool types were composite
forms with two types represented on the same implement, and 20 were singular
forms. Length, width, thickness, and, where appropriate, contour, length, and
angle of working edges were measured for each artifact. Variables such as the
presence of cortex, patina, and denticulation were noted. Basalt was the most
favored raw material, followed by chert, quartzite, and rhyolite (Table 2).
Although this choice reflects the availability of raw materials in the area, it also
indicates preferential selection, since materials other than basalt were more
common than their percentages in the artifacts suggest.
SITES AND ACTIVITIES
The 293 sites found in the survey were divided into two general categories:
lithic and ceramic. Lithic sites were those with stone artifacts alone; ceramic
sites were those with pottery and usually an assortment of stone artifacts.
Lithic sites numbered 252 and ceramic, 41. Four of the ceramic sites had plain
sherds only; 15 had decorated sherds, but at only nine were the sherds sufficiently diagnostic to be identified and dated. Rim sherds were sought to aid
in distinguishing jars from bowls. A third grouping of 62 sites, distinguished
from among the first two categories, was that of the Cochise culture. These
sites were located mainly on the first terrace and consisted of 49 lithic sites
and 13 combined lithic and ceramic sites (Table 3). Six of the 13 ceramic
sites had decorated pottery, a development that evolved long after the disappearance of the Cochise culture, suggesting reoccupation of Cochise sites by
later groups. Plain ceramics on the other seven sites could denote the terminal
San Pedro stage-when ceramics first appeared in southern Arizona, about
200 B.C.-or resettlement of older Cochise sites.
Eight of the 293 sites found in the survey had round, oval, or rectangular
house structures. Five of the eight sites had one structure each, but one had

seven and two had six houses each (Figures 5 and 6). On multiple-house sites
the structures were separated from one another by distances of 1 to as much as
20 meters (65 feet), and all were on the first terrace directly overlooking the
flood plain. Also on the first terrace were 20 sites having one to eight rock
mounds, or rock piles, each, probably accumulations from surface clearing for
the practice of agriculture (Woosley 1980). Some sites had linear stone alignments at right angles to the downslope, designed to retain slope wash and arrest
soil erosion (Doyel 1979).
At higher elevations were eight rock-shelters, seven in the mountain zone and
one in the hillside zone. The shelters were not in the bedrock itself, but under
huge igneous boulders that had settled in such a way as to afford a partial overhang or shelter. On one site the boulders were so disposed that they made up
three medium-sized interconnecting chambers.
The zone most utilized for day-to-day activity was the first terrace. There,
the number of sites was highest and the density of sites per section greatest.
Despite the differences in zone size and in the areas surveyed within the zones,
comparisons of site density clearly confirm the priority of the first terrace for
occupation and activity. This priority prevailed not only among sites of the
later agricultural period but also among those of the earlier Cochise stage as
well; 54 (87 percent) of 62 Cochise stage sites concentrated on the first terrace.
The sites found in the survey were divided into base camps and work camps,
based on the length of occupation and the range of activities performed. In preagricultural times base camps were semipermanent, occupied only a few weeks a
year. After the introduction of agriculture, base camps usually were inhabited
the year around. At base camps diverse tasks were carried out: curing hides;
manufacturing tools, stone and otherwise; processing wild and/or domesticated
plant foods; erecting shelters and, in later periods, storage facilities; producing
clothing, footgear, and basketry; and, on occasion, butchering game. Base camps
were ideal settings where the injured and the infirm could recuperate; where the
very old and the very young could rest from the rigors of transhumance; and
where tribal lore could be recited and customs could be passed on from one
generation to the next.
Work camps, on the other hand, were temporary; they were occupied only
overnight or at best for only a few days. Their contents suggest a single function, such as processing hides, gathering succulent fruits, or gathering and converting suitable stone or wood into useful artifacts. This singularity of purpose
limited the size of work camps-plant gathering being an exception-to small

dimensions. Common to base camps and work camps were stone artifacts,
which clustered into groups compatible with the functions of the sites. For
example, at a kill and butchering station, projectile points were used to bring
down the game; choppers, flakes, and bifacial knives were used to dismember
it; and scrapers with edge angles exceeding 50 degrees were used to remove fat
and flesh in the preliminary processing of hides. The makeup of an assemblage
indicates its function, which in turn classifies the site. Unlike the single-purpose
work camps, base camps reflected many functions.
From the 3387 artifacts recovered, we hypothesized the performance of
eight functional activities, which we in turn consolidated into three groups.
The first group, which dealt with plant exploitation, consisted of three related
functional activities: wild plant gathering; mescal and yucca collecting which,
although they are obviously wild plants like the rest, nevertheless required
special tools; and food plant processing. The second group, which dealt with
tool manufacturing, also comprised three activities: the production of stone
tools, the fashioning of bone artifacts, and the manufacture of wooden implements. The third group was concerned with faunal resources as reflected in kill
and butchering tasks and in hide processing. Each activity called for its own set
of appropriate tools, but some tools crosscut several tasks; e.g., side scrapers
were useful in woodworking, in hide preparation, and in plant procurement and
processing.
Ethnographic accounts (Goodyear 1975; Doelle 1976; Crosswhite 1980)
describe the use of wooden tools for plant gathering as part of an inventory
that included scrapers, choppers, cores, flakes, and knives. A similar set of tools
could assist in mescal and yucca harvesting, together with picks, bifaces, and
denticulate flakes. Plant processing equipment includes metates, manos, and,
less frequently, mortars and pestles, hammerstones, scrapers, and flakes. A
concentration of cores, hammerstones, flakes, and chunks strongly suggests
stone tool production, just as tool kits high in choppers, planes, flakes, scrapers,
notches, and burins suggest woodworking. The absence of planes and the
introduction of gravers with suites of notches, burins, and steeply angled
scrapers imply the engraving of bone and antler tools (Wilmsen 1970; Wylie
1975; Cantwell 1979). Projectile points, knives, and sharp-edged flakes are
found at both kill and butchering sites and at hide-processing sites (Bayham
1976). Side scrapers and end scrapers with convex edge angles between 45
and 55 degrees are specific to hide scraping (Keeley 1980), and highly polished
handstones or manos are specific to softening and smoothing hides. Manos used
for hide softening were smaller, thinner, and had glossier surfaces than did the
larger, heavier, pitted manos used in plant processing (Mason 1891; Wissler
1920; Ewers 1937).
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS OF THE DATA
Several multivariate programs were available for statistical analysis of the
data:
analysis of variance, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis. The
first two procedures seek to discover patterning among variables through
statistical computation. We opted for discriminant analysis, which assumes the
existence of patterns in some members of the sample and uses variables of those
members to discover patterning in the remaining members. The program used
for discriminant analysis was designed by Tuccy and Klecka and is described in

Whalen-Discriminant Analysis

163

Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (Nie et al. 1975). Twenty-eight of
the 293 sites were ambiguous in terms of activity (four had only ceramics and
24 had only stone flakes) and were therefore omitted from computation. This
left 265 sites. Forty of those were among the preselected sites that were chosen
to illustrate the eight activities, leaving 225 ungrouped sites to be classified.
We reduced the 54 artifact types to 30 by redefining composite tools as single
types determined by elimination of the rarer of the two forms found on each
tool. Eighteen of the 30 artifact types analyzed were computed as most discriminatory (Table 4). For those 18 types, discriminant function coefficients
were derived (Table 4A), which produced a mean discriminant score (Table 5)
for each activity, on the basis of which all of the sites-the 40 grouped sites as
well as the 225 ungrouped sites-were classified.

The discriminant analysis program for classifying ungrouped sites selects
by mean discriminant scores the highest and second highest probability groups
for each site. The correlations between discriminant coefficients of artifacts
(standardized weights) and corresponding activities (mean discriminant scores)
are graphically illustrated for each of the six functions in Figures 7 to 12.
Function 1 (Figure 7) segregates bone working from plant gathering; notches,
burins, and gravers are attributed to bone working, and side scrapers and choppers are assigned to plant gathering. Planes correlate more closely with woodworking than with bone working. Mortars, manos, metates, and bifaces clustered closely around plant processing.
Function 2 (Figure 8) separates two extremes: stone tool manufacturing
and kill and butchering. Cores are predominant in the former and projectile
points in the latter. Manos relate more to hide processing than to anything
else. Bone working and woodworking scores are too close for any differentiation.
Function 3 (Figure 9) isolates stone tool manufacturing at one end of the
scale and bone working and woodworking at the other. Cores and hammerstones align with stone tool production; a cluster of tools-burins, planes,
notches, side scrapers, and gravers-suggests wood and bone working. Manos,
metates, and mortars align a little more closely with plant processing than with
plant gathering. Projectile points clearly denote kill and butchering as well as
hide processing tasks.

Function 4 (Figure 10) is enigmatic. Although it separates hide processing
from kill and butchering, it fails to isolate artifacts that other diagrams indicate are diagnostic of those activities. Side scrapers are indeed a recognized
component of hide processing, but it is hard to visualize the role of cores in
that task. Picks and hammerstones are closer to and more compatible with
mescal and yucca exploitation than to kill and butchering tasks, but plant
processing (on the negative end of the scale), like kill and butchering, has no
associated artifacts at all.

Function 5 (Figure 11) separates kill and butchering activities with associated

hide processing with the mano, on the negative end. Notches, side scrapers,
cores, and flakes are widely separated from the burins and gravers of bone
working. Picks correlate well with mescal and yucca procurement; metates and
mortars seem more compatible with plant gathering than with plant processing,
suggesting that those implements may have been used at temporary work camps.

Function 6 (Figure 12) places hide processing and woodworking at one end
of the spectrum, with kill and butchering and bone working at the other, thereby accentuating the differences between them. Once again, planes identify with
woodworking on the positive end of the scale, while on the negative end of the
scale burins and gravers correlate with bone working, and choppers and projectile points correlate with kill and butchering.
In summary, the six functions reveal a close association of projectile points

168

and manos with hide processing; of projectile points and choppers with kill and
butchering operations; of planes and notches with woodworking; of notches,
burins, and gravers with bone working; of hammerstones and cores with stone
tool manufacturing; of metates and mortars with plant processing; of picks with
mescal and yucca procurement; and of choppers and side scrapers with plant
gathering. The tools identified by these discriminant analyses can be regarded
as salient tools in defining the activities they represent.
To test the validity and accuracy of discriminant analysis and to confirm the
internal consistency of the procedure on archeological data that are neither
continuous nor evenly distributed, we divided the 265 sites alternately into two
groups. One group of 132 sites, with the same classifications as those accorded
in the first discriminant analysis run, was considered the preselected or grouped
sites; the remaining 133 were considered the ungrouped sites. The discriminant
analysis run was then repeated. Despite the random choice of discriminator
sites, the second discriminant analysis correctly classified in the highest probability category 106 of the 133 (79.8 percent) ungrouped sites. When the calculation was expanded to include the second highest probability category as a
correct classification, the accuracy rate increased to 119 out of 133 (89.5 percent). A site was considered correctly classified if its classification corresponded
to the highest probability category of the first discriminant analysis run. This
test confirms the accuracy of the initial classification of the ungrouped sites
and affirms the value of discriminant analysis as a technique for designating site
function and for predicting the probable functions of sites by means of tool
assemblages comparable to the ones described here.
The distribution of sites with respect to activities and environmental zones is
presented in Table 6, in which the terrace zone clearly emerges as the major
center for prehistoric occupation and activity. Not all sites were limited to
single activities. The semipermanent or permanent character of base camps
facilitated their use for multiple activities, although the temporary nature of
work camps favored their use for one activity only. In the survey 17 base camps
were identified, four lithic and 13 ceramic (three ceramic sites were also Cochise). Thirteen of the base camps had evidence of plant processing; ten, of
stone tool manufacturing; eight, of woodworking; two, of bone working; and
one each, of hide working and mescal/yucca procurement. Similarly 26 of the
248 work camps suggest two and, in three cases, three activities. Therefore the
absence of woodworking and stone tool manufacturing on ceramic sites (Table
6) does not necessarily denote the cessation of those tasks; often they turn up
as secondary activities; that is, not in the highest probability category, which
appears in Table 6, but in the second highest probability category of the discriminant analysis. For example, at 11 of the 13 ceramic base camps, woodworking or stone tool manufacturing-sometimes both-occur as secondary or
tertiary activities. The most frequent combination among multiple tasks performed at the 26 work camps was mescal/yucca collecting and woodworking.
Seventeen of the 26 multiple-activity work camps were of Cochise origin.
Distribution of the principal activities on sites in the five environmental
zones can be evaluated in terms of the three categories of sites, namely Cochise,
lithic, and ceramic. Table 6 demonstrates that wild plant collecting (mescal/
yucca procurement and plant gathering) was the predominant activity at 57.5
percent of all Cochise sites. For a hunting and gathering society there was

considerable discrepancy between the percentage of activities relating to wild
plant collecting and the percentage relating to hunting. This discrepancy suggests an adequate supply of edible wild plants and a reduced dependency on
large forms of animal life. If small game such as rabbits had been pursued,
the principal tools for their capture would have been nets and clubs, and flake
knives probably would have been used for skinning. Some of the 24 ambiguous stone flake sites may represent this activity, but only three of those were
identified as Cochise sites. Both kill and hide processing sites, like wild plant
and mescal gathering sites, occurred mainly on the terrace. Contrary to our
expectations, Cochise bands did not exploit resources intensively in mountain
canyons or on the hillside, but relied more on plant foraging in the vicinity of
the terrace, where five of their six base camps were estabhshed. The incidence
of stone tool manufacturing was low and the incidence of bone working was
relatively high, but once again multiple functions at base camps and work camps
compensated for this difference, bringing the number of both activities to nine
sites each.
The age of Cochise sites is difficult to determine. From the typology of projectile points, two Cochise work camp sites were recognized as San Pedro (Figure
4,b: F, J, and N). One is in the mountain zone and the other is in the hillside
zone. On the first terrace are two somewhat older Chiricahua sites, also dated
by projectile point style (Figure 4,b: D and L). Two of the four datable
Cochise sites are kill sites and two are hide processing sites, one each from the
Chiricahua and San Pedro stages.
Cochise sites without diagnostic projectile points may belong to either the
Chiricahua or the San Pedro period, but the probability is greater for a San
Pedro date for two reasons. In the first place, work on Cochise sites on the
west side of the San Pedro Valley-directly opposite the survey area-revealed
a higher incidence of plant gathering in the San Pedro stage than in the earlier
Chiricahua, when hunting prevailed. If that trend had been consistent on both
sides of the valley, then the higher ratio of gathering to hunting in the survey
area would suggest a San Pedro date. In the second place, seven of the 13
Cochise sites with ceramics but no datable projectile points had plain sherds,
characteristic of the terminal San Pedro period.
The main activity at lithic sites was wild plant gathering, which increased
over the Cochise to 48.6 percent. If mescal collecting is added, the percentage
rises to 62.7 percent. Since plant gathering usually required an array of wooden
tools, it is not surprising to see a substantial percentage of woodworking sites.
The level of bone working and of kill and butchering in lithic sites is c!ose to
the Cochise, but a decline in plant processing and particularly in hide working
is apparent. Stone tool manufacturing in hthic sites doubled over the Cochise,
but still trailed woodworking and bone working. As on Cochise sites, the principal activities on lithic sites were plant food procurement and artifact production.
Although the lithic category was highest in total number of sites, only one site
was a base camp.
The time period covered by lithic sites remains undetermined. Activities at
lithic sites resemble those at Cochise sites more than they do those that were
predominant during ceramic times. Such a comparison, however, can be misleading. It seems probable that work parties from both Cochise and ceramic
base camps were responsible for some of the remains found on lithic sites, but

Whalen-Discriminant Analysis

171

what is less clear is the number of lithic sites that are actually of Cochise or
ceramic origin. Not all Cochise sites yielded diagnostic projectile points, nor
were all Cochise tools made of basalt, coated with desert varnish, or crudely
made. When chert or other fine-grained siliceous materials entered the stone
tool repertoire, it was often impossible to single out the Cochise tools. Sites
with such artifacts were categorized simply as lithic. Similarly, not every work
camp utilized during the ceramic period yielded sherds; if no vessels were
broken, there would be no sherds to suggest a ceramic work camp. Conceivably,
some lithic sites may antedate the Cochise period and thus may be Paleo-Indian.
Conversely, they may be Apache sites; the Apaches encamped frequently in the
Dragoon Mountains during the historical period.
The third category, ceramic sites, emphasized plant processing, which soared
to 42.8 percent, while wild plant gathering dropped to a !ow of 11.4 percent.
The increased exploitation of mescal and yucca raised the total percentage of
plant collecting to 45.7 percent, a level not far be!ow that of earlier times.
From this it seems that half of the subsistence of agricultural societies in the
San Pedro Valley came from farming and half came from wild plant collecting.
The striking coincidence of nearly identical percentages for mescal and yucca
gathering in both Cochise and ceramic sites (35.5 percent and 34.3 percent
respectively) argues persuasively for the persistence of those plants in the terrace
zone for a long period of time. Today mescal and, to a lesser extent, yucca are
almost nonexistent in that area. A creosote-catclaw-bursage community flourishes there, indicative of the climatic change that intervened during the ensuing
centuries. The absence of woodworking and stone tool manufacturing as pri-’
mary activities on ceramic sites can be explained by their presence as secondary
activities, evident on 14 sites for woodworking and on 11 sites for stone tool
production. Kill and butchering tasks did not occur on a single ceramic site
as either a primary or secondary activity, yet hide processing was undertaken
on three sites, implying some pursuit of game.
Nine ceramic sites, all on the terrace, had decorated sherds that dated between A.D. 900 and 1450. Plain sherds on 29 other sites, some probably older,
were undatable. The most common decorated sherds were Rincon Red-onbrown, Tanque Verde Red-on-brown, Santa Cruz Polychrome, White Mountain
Redware, Mimbres Black-on-white, and Encinas Red-on-brown. The first two
red-on-brown styles were Hohokam and appeared on seven sites, including site
100 (Figure 5,a and b), which had seven houses. Besides the seven sites with
Hohokam ceramics, other sites identified as Hohokam include the 20 that
contained rock piles or rock mounds. These rock piles denote field clearance
for the dry farming that was practiced on Hohokam sites in other parts of the
San Pedro and adjacent valleys (Doyel 1979).
On 13 ceramic sites the main vessel forms were bowls, which were recognized
by the arcs of their rim sherds. Nine of the 13 sites were work camps and four
were base camps. Five additional sites, four of them base camps, had equal
numbers of jars and bowls according to rim sherd counts. Six sites yielded jars
alone. The presence of bowls suggests leguminous seed processing-paloverde,
mesquite, catclaw, or ironwood-as Goodyear (1975) points out. Jars were
used for carrying water and for processing prickly pear cactus which, like paloverde, mesquite, and catclaw, still grows in the survey area. Four of the six
sites that had ceramic jars alone were work camps.

The survey revealed two major cultures: a hur~ting and gathering culture
typified by the Cochise and an agricultural culture, typified by the presence
of ceramics. From the larger number of their sites and from numerous other
sources outside the valley that confirm the long duration of the Cochise culture, it can be inferred that hunters and gatherers resided in the valley longer
than did the agriculturists. According to projectile point styles, some Cochise
sites belonged to the Chiricahua stage and others to the San Pedro stage. Most
Cochise sites seem to be San Pedro, when gathering eclipsed hunting as the major
subsistence effort. With the restoration of more effective moisture following
the Altithermal of Chiricahua times came a decline of transhumance and a concentration of sites in the opulent resource zone of the first terrace. This development paralleled the increasing interest in and ultimate adoption of fulltime agriculture, which also favored locations adjacent to the flood plain, with
its reliable supply of water and enriched soft.- It was precisely there, on the first
terrace, that the majority of Cochise sites were found, strengthening the inference that most were San Pedro in origin. The agricultural sites that came later
followed the same settlement pattern.
Through the application of discriminant analysis it was possible to identify
eight activities performed variously on 265 sites scattered geographically across
five environmental zones and chronologically across nearly 5000 years. The
use of discriminant analysis on the survey data was vindicated by the consistency
of the results obtained. Discriminant analysis admits of a wide variety of uses
and can be employed to resolve a number of archeological problems that call
for the use of multivariate statistics. Unlike other multivariate approaches,
discriminant analysis incorporates the experience and expertise of the investigator and is dependent on his skills in the selection of the grouped data. In
addition, discriminant analysis lends itself to verification by the use of discriminators randomly selected from the data in reruns designed to measure the
accuracy of prediction of previously classified data.

EXPERIMENTAL EDGE DAMAGE ON
FLINT CHOPPING TOOLS
Leland W. Patterson

ABSTRACT
The distinctive characteristics of edge damage patterns are described for flint
tools used in experimental chopping of hardwood and bone. Comparisons are
made with patterns of edge damage resulting from the use of stone tools in other
tasks.
INTRODUCTION
It is common in archeological reports to classify certain large stone tools as
choppers and/or chopping tools, their function being inferred by artifact morphology and/or edge damage patterns. Some investigators label tools with unifacially retouched edges choppers and tools with bifacially retouched edges
chopping tools (Bordes 1968:242). Some tools are classified as choppers on the
basis of edge damage patterns alone. Although the function of chopping tools
can be inferred from specimen morphology, analysis of edge damage patterns is
a more direct method of determining whether a tool actually has been used for
this function. This paper describes edge damage patterns resulting from experimental chopping of hardwood and bone with flint tools, and compares those
patterns with other kinds of edge damage.
In actual practice, there are problems in determining if edge damage patterns
result from use of specimens as chopping tools or from other causes. For example, confusion can arise in separating chopping-tool edge damage from some
types of fortuitous edge damage. Both cases exhibit random edge fracture scars.
The random pattern of edge damage on a chopping tool occurs because edge
damage is a byproduct of hard percussive use, rather than the result of a series
of controlled fractures. The random pattern of fortuitous edge damage occurs
because the forces at work act at random, as evinced, for example, by the damage caused by stream tumbling.
Most descriptions of stone-tool edge damage patterns in the literature have
concentrated on cutting and scraping functions. For example, Tringham and
others (1974) have provided clear illustrations of predictable edge damage patterns developed by experimental cutting and scraping. The writer has been able
to reproduce these edge damage patterns in experimental deer butchering
(Patterson 1975). The literature is lacking in equally good descriptions of edge
damage patterns from chopping. In a recent symposium on lithic use-wear
analysis (Hayden 1979), some discussion was held on chopper edge damage patterns, but not in sufficient detail to aid the analyst in making consistent positive
identifications of chopping edge wear. In this symposium, Miller (1979:406)
stated that "Finally, the use damage on a flaked stone chopper can be described

as varied in size (relatively large flakes to microscopic fractures) and irregularly
distributed on both faces of the working edge. Such use fractures were sometimes rather deep."
The characteristics of edge damage on flint flakes from fortuitous causes have
not been well described in the literature, either. Most investigators assume that
this type of edge damage pattern is random and amorphous. It will be shown
here, however, that there is one type of fracture pattern that seems to characterize much of the fortuitous edge damage on flint specimens found in places such
as stream beds and open hillsides.
Large bffacial artifacts commonly are classified as handaxes in Central Texas,
but this classification may be too general. Many large bifaces are not finished
tools, but instead represent the initial stages of bifacial reduction and thinning
failures in the manufacture of smaller bifacial tools such as projectile points.
The identification of edge damage patterns would be useful in determining if
a large biface had actually been used as a chopping tool or cleaver. The writer’s
experience with Centra! Texas archeologicat sites has revealed that many large
bifaces do not have extensive edge damage patterns that are characteristic of
chopping use.
It should be noted that a fully developed edge damage pattern is necessary
for determining the type of edge damage on any specimen. There are many
cases in which the edge damage pattern is not diagnostic. Lightly damaged
edges with random small flake scars can result from fortuitous and natural
causes or from a variety of cursory tool uses. Examinations of edge damage
patterns should be made with at least 10-power magnification so all significant
details can be clearly observed.
CHOPPING EXPERIMENTS

Three experiments were performed to develop edge damage patterns from
chopping; one on bone and two on hardwood. All tools were made of flint from
the Lake Belton area near Temple, Texas. This flint is a fairly tough material
that requires heat treating before fine flint knapping can be done. Raw material
without heat treating was used for these experiments in order to retain the
characteristic toughness of the stone.
Experim en t I
One experiment involved chopping fresh beef bone of the type commonly
sold as marrow bone in grocery stores. Eight pieces of bone weighing a total of
0.45 kg (! pound) were sprit by chopping action, and a wooden block was used
as an anvil. At the start the bone pieces were approximately 4 cm (1.5 inches)
long and 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter. Each bone piece was split into a minimum
of four smaller pieces, with fractures following the bone grain. About equal
amounts of chopping were done on the outside and truncated surfaces of the
bone. The use of fairly small bone pieces gives a large amount of chopping tool
wear without requiring a very large bone sample.
The tool used for this experiment is shown in Figure 1. The working edge of
the tool was undamaged at the start of this experiment and had no purposeful
retouch. The angle of the undamaged working edge was approximately 50
degrees as measured with a swing-arm protractor. This large flake tool weighed
454 g (1 pound).

178

Texas Archeological Society

Edge damage of this tool occurred in an irregular manner, as shown in Figure
2. Flake scars developed in an irregular manner, depending on the specific point
of impact of the tool edge. There was a wide variation in flake scar sizes, and
many small step fracture terminations occurred.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 consisted of chopping hardwood with a large (363 g; 0.8
pounds) flake tool (Figure 3). As in Experiment 1, the working edge of the
chopping tool was undamaged at the start of the experiment and the original
edge angle was 50 degrees.
Figure 4 shows that the tool edge damage pattern developed from chopping
hardwood is similar to the pattern developed from chopping bone. Although
tool edge damage was evident after the first few blows, at least 5 minutes of
cilopping was required before a definite pattern developed. The edge damage
illustrated in Figure 4 is from about 10 minutes of chopping.
Experiment 3
Experiment 3 involved chopping hardwood with a bifacial tool that weighed
363 g (0.8 pounds) and had a starting working edge angle of 70 degrees (Figure
5). At the start of this experiment the tool working edge was sharp, but somewhat sinuous because of the large bifacial flake scars.
As shown in Figure 6, the tool edge damage pattern resulting from Experiment 3 is similar to that of the other two chopping experiments but, because of
the greater tool edge angle in this experiment, development of edge damage was
slower than in Experiment 2, where the tool edge angle was more acute. The
same piece of hardwood was used for Experiments 2 and 3. The tool edge
damage illustrated for Experiment 3 represents about 15 minutes of chopping,
or at least one and a half times the time used in Experiment 2. Even with the
longer use time, the tool edge damage in Experiment 3 is less than that in
Experiment 2.
The greater tool edge angle in Experiment 3 resulted in a slower rate of edge
damage than that of Experiment 2, but the greater tool edge angle also resulted
in a less efficient chopping tool. Even after edge damage occurred, the tool
used in Experiment 2, with a more acute edge angle, remained a more efficient
tool than the chopper used in Experiment 3. These experiments demonstrate
that a chopping tool edge angle of about 50 degrees is ideal; this edge angle is
acute enough to perform efficiently but high enough to prevent extreme edge
damage.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Based on these experiments, the following statements can be made:
1
There is a wide variation in fracture scar sizes-a finding that is in agreement with observations on chopper edge wear by Miller (t979:406).
In these experiments, some resulting fracture scars were up to !.2 cm
in length.
2. There are many small step fracture terminations, giving the edge a
"chewed-up" look.
3. The larger fracture scars generally follow the contours of the tool faces,
rather than being steep transverse fractures across the edge.

There is a wide variation in fracture scar shapes, varying from contracting to expanding distal terminations, with a wide variation in length
to width ratios.

FORTUITOUS EDGE DAMAGE
Edge damage can be caused fortuitously, and a comparison of such edge
damage with that caused by chopping is discussed here because both types are
somewhat random.
Common fortuitous causes of edge damage are stream
tumbling, pressure from trampling by man and hooved animals, and plowing.
Fortuitous edge damage has been observed by the author among a large number
of specimens, and there seems to be a typical pattern for such edge damage.
The specimen illustrated in Figure 7 is from a stream bed in Fayette County,
Texas, and is a tough alluvial chert common to the area.
Although fracture scars from natural and other fortuitous edge damage tend
to occur on both faces of specimens in a random manner, as in chopping tool
use, the following points can be made concerning the characteristic pattern of
fortuitous edge damage:
1. Fracture scars tend to be short, on the order of 2 to 5 mm in length.
2. Fracture scars tend to be wide relative to length, with scar widths commonly greater than scar lengths.
3. The majority of fracture scars have contracting dista! terminations.
4. Fractures tend to be steep and transverse across the edge, rather than
following the facia! contours of specimens.

There is a noticeably small amount of step fracturing, with most flake
scars having clean distal terminations.
6. The occurrence of many steep fortuitous fractures gives an edge a flat or
well-rounded appearance. The ultimate outcome of stream rolling, for
¯ example, is completely rounded edges.
5.

OTHER EDGE DAMAGE PATTERNS
It has been noted here that chopping tool edge damage is characterized by
many small step fracture terminations. Trimming an edge with a small hammerstone also can produce a series of small step fracture terminations. However,
when trimmed with a small hammerstone, the termination of the edge will be
much more uniform than an edge that results from chopping. Edge trimming
with a small hammerstone produces a combination of small flake removals and
edge abrasion, which tends to cause smoothing.
Another factor to consider in determining if a tool edge is damaged from
chopping is that tools with edges modified from use are susceptible to subsequent kinds of edge damage. It is common to find tools with modified edge
damage caused by natural forces, and this must be considered by the analyst.
If soft vegetable materials were being chopped, a fairly dull working edge
might remain useful. In this case, the chopping tool might not be discarded
until the working edge became very worn, especially if a hard anvil were being
used. Some analysts might judge the worn edge to have been rounded by rolling
from natural forces rather than by dulling from chopping use. In such cases,
all edges should be examined. If only the suspected working edge is battered
and rounded, natural edge damage is less likely. Also, even though the working
edge of a chopping tool may be somewhat rounded, it should have many small
step fracture terminations and wide variation in fracture scar sizes.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
As detailed above, there are some significant typical differences between edge
damage resulting from chopping of hard materials and those from fortuitous
causes, even though both types of edge’ damage occur in a random manner.
These differences probably are due to basic differences in force application
methods. Chopping subjects the edge to hard percussive force. Natural and
other fortuitous force applications are more likely to result from pressure from
hard objects. The high degree of step fracturing in chopping tool edge damage
is caused by varying force applications being directed into the tool material
mass, instead of at a consistent oblique angle to the edge as is performed with
controlled flaking for lithic tool manufacturing.
The steep fractures common to fortuitous edge damage (Figure 7) probably
are due to the direction of application of random forces. The fortuitous actions
that produce steep, short fracture scars on edges of stone specimens can be explained in terms of physical principles. Most fortuitous fractures would occur
from forces being applied randomly to objects that were free to move or fixed
loosely. This situation would result in most force applications being applied
quite obliquely, rather than more directly, into the edges. Highly oblique forces
applied to edges give steep fractures with relatively few step terminations,

Patterson-Experimental Edge Damage

183

especially if the force application type is pressure. The lack of step terminations
is explained by the fact that steep fractures across thin edges encounter less
resistance of the material mass to the applied force. Step fracture terminations
occur when the resistance of the material mass overcomes the applied force and
does not al!ow the fracture plane to continue directly forward into the mass.
In sum, chopping tool edge damage is characterized by wide variation in
fracture scar sizes and shapes, large numbers of step fracture terminations,
and many larger fracture scars that follow the flake faces rather than being
transverse across edges. In contrast, fortuitous edge damage tends to produce
short, steep fractures, low length to width ratios of fracture scars, large numbers
of contracting fracture terminations, and small numbers of step fracture terminations. Both chopping tool edge damage and fortuitous edge damage produce
fracture scars at random on both faces of the damaged edge.
It is hoped that more studies of chopping tool and fortuitous edge damage
patterns will be published and a significant body of data will become available
in the literature.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE PREHISTORIC CERAMICS FROM
THE RICHLAND-CHAMBERS CREEK DAM AND
RESERVOIR PROJECT AREA, NAVARRO AND
FREESTONE COUNTIES, TEXAS
Marilee Irvine

ABSTRACT
The pottery from the tested prehistoric sites of the Richland-Chambers
Archeological Project has been classified according to attribute analysis. As a
result of the analysis 10 classes of pottery were identified-two plainwares and
eight decorated wares. These classes have been compared to recognized types
when possible to obtain information on intersite distribution and temporal
placement. The data indicate that ceramics may have been used in the area as
early as the Late Woodland period. Pottery types recognized as Early Caddoan
also were identified, but no Late Caddoan pottery was found.

INTRODUCTION
Ceramic analyses traditionally have been carried out in order to establish
cultural chronologies and to provide information about specific ceramic-related
activities at archeological sites. Throughout North America, regional chronologies based on pottery typologies are common and, in most cases, well refined.
Unfortunately, the boundaries created by regionalism have caused considerable
confusion in areas where research is in its early stages. The tendencies by
archeologists to view their regions within analytical vacuums discourage interregional comparisons, thereby producing limited pictures of ceramic variability
and resulting in the creation of numerous noncomparable pottery types based
on localized descriptions.
The description of ceramic collections should provide useful data not only
for cultural and historical purposes, but also for comparisons of intrasite and
intersite variability. The present study is concerned with the identification of
ceramic groups based on analysis of certain physical attributes. These attributes were chosen because they provide data necessary for classification (Shepard 1971), because they are useful temporal indicators, and because they provide data necessary for resolution of specific questions in the research design
for the Richland-Chambers Project.
The Richland-Chambers Project is a program of archeological survey, testing,
and mitigation being carried out on the 50,000-acre (20,300 ha) RichlandChambers Dam and Reservoir area in Navarro and Freestone counties, Texas
(Figure 1). An intensive survey of the project area, followed by testing at
many sites, was accomplished in the first phase of archeological activity.
Ceramics were found at 24 of the 43 prehistoric sites that were tested. Each

sherd recovered was subjected to an attribute analysis in which seven attributes
were recorded:
temper, paste texture, surface treatment, thickness, color,
form, and decoration. The ceramic classes described in this paper were developed from significant attribute clusters within the ceramic sample.

CERAMIC DESCRIPTIONS
The ceramics recovered from the tested sites have been divided into two main
categories, based on exterior surface treatment. These two categories, plain and
decorated wares, have been subdivided into finer groups for more meaningful
identification.
The plainware sherds are classified according to the major
tempering materials used; the decorated sherds are classified according to the
mode of decoration (e.g., engraved, brushed, incised). Whenever possible,
comparisons have been made to recognized pottery types. In addition, vessel
form was determined when possible, since it might have some functional implications.
The sample collected was small (278 sherds) and provided little information
about vessel morphology. The few rim and base sherds in the sample permit, at
best, only approximations as to vessel size and function. In most cases, morphological determinations are based on analogy to other areas where whole
vessels were abundant (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Brown 1971).
Plainware
A total of 197 plainware sherds have been analyzed from 21 tested sites.
All of these sherds are undecorated, with smoothed and unburnished exteriors.
Two temper combinations were observed: grog, grit, and bone; and grit and

Irvine-Ceramics from Richland-Chambers

187

bone. These tempering materials were identified mainly by the unaided eye,
but occasionally a microscope was used. In this report the tempering agent
listed first is the one that appeared to occur with the highest frequency in the
paste. It should be noted that the 197 plain sherds may not be a valid indication of the number of plainware vessels in the sample, because some of the
"plainware" sherds may have come from undecorated parts (often everything
except the rim) of decorated vessels. Unfortunately, it is not possible to
distinguish between sherds from plainware vessels and sherds from undecorated
parts of decorated vessels; therefore, all of the undecorated sherds were put in
the plainware category.
GROG, GRIT, AND BONE TEMPER
Among seven rim sherds in the sample are sherds from standing and everted
rims, both direct and thinned. These rims suggest simple bowls, carinated bowls,
and jars used mainly for utilitarian purposes. The three base sherds in the
sample are from flat-based or conical-based vessels. The vessels were manufactured by the coiled technique, evidenced by the breaks on many sherds
(coiled pottery breaks along the coils, on horizontal planes).
More than 95 percent (189) of the plainware sherds have grog and grit temper
(i.e., grog with grit inclusions). The pulverized bone inclusions range in size
from microscopic to 2 mm. The paste is generally well mixed, coarse, and lightly porous, probably due to leaching of the bone. Both interior and exterior
surfaces are predominantly fine smoothed and uneven. They appear to be unburnished, but the surfaces of many sherds have been eroded away. Wall thickness ranges from 4 to 16 mm.
Interior and exterior colors range from brown to red and gray. Interiors are
generally darker, often dark brown or gray. Cores are usually solid and dark,
but occasionally they have zoned color differentiations. This zoning, together
with a high incidence of fire clouding, indicates uneven firing temperatures.
These plainware sherds resemble the type Sanders Plain from the Sanders
site in northeast Texas (Krieger 1946:186). They are also similar to Williams
Plain, a common type in southeastern Oklahoma and northeast Texas (Irvine
1980:15-20). Williams Plain is known from the Wister phase in the Wister
Valley, and Sanders Plain is affiliated with the Sanders focus of northeast
Texas.
GRIT AND BONE TEMPER

The six remaining plainware sherds are tempered predominantly with grit
(sand) and occasional pieces of pulverized bone. In this group are two standingrim sherds with thinned, rounded lips. No vessel forms can be inferred from the
rim morphology.
The paste texture is medium, well mixed, and compact. The grit is probably
a natural component of the clay, not an additive. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and fine smoothed, probably due to the eroded condition of the sherds.
The surfaces definitely feel sandy where the grains rub off when touched.
Thickness ranges from 4 to 8 mm. Interior surfaces are dark, mainly dark gray,
and exteriors are shades of brown and red. Cores are generally solid and dark;
fire clouding is present on some exterior surfaces.

188

Texas Archeological Society
Decorated Ware

Eight kinds of decorative techniques are present in the sample: engraving,
brushing, incising, punctating, slipping, and combinations of these (Figure 2).
Unfortunately, due to the small size of most of the sherds, few decorative modes
could be identified, and for that reason specific type identifications were difficult, if not impossible.

ENGRAVED
Engraved line designs were found on 19 sherds (Figure 2,a,b,c), six of which
came from a single vessel. This vessel, a small carinated bowl with a slightly
everted rim and rounded base, was identified as Carmel Engraved (Figure 2,a),
an Alto focus pottery from northwestern Louisiana. Carmel Engraved designs
consist of curving bands of transverse lines that produce a ladder effect. Usually
two of the curving bands are separated by an undecorated band, and engraved
lines sometimes flank each band or bisect the intervening plain band (Webb
t963:156). The temper contains grog, grit, and bone; the paste is compact and
coarse. The interior surfaces are mostly unburnished, the exteriors are burnished, and both surfaces are smoothed. Thickness ranges from 6 to 7 mm.
Colors are dark; cores are dark and solid.
Other engraved sherds have design modes consisting of single and multiple
parallel and perpendicular lines. The three rim sherds-two standing and one
inverted-have engraved lines running parallel to the rims. An incomplete crosshatched design (Figure 2,b) banded by a single line, and a scalelike overlapping
design (Figure 2,c) also are present in the sample. None of these were affiliated
with any previously defined types.
The temper contains grit, grog, and pieces of bone. The paste has a mediumto-coarse, well-mixed, compact texture. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and
fine smoothed. Thickness ranges from 5 to 8 mm. Colors of both the interiors
and exteriors are mainly light browns, although several dark interiors are present.
Cores are solid and usually the same color as the interiors. The majority of
surfaces are fire clouded.
BRUSHED
Sherds with brushed decoration are the second largest part of the sample.
Brushed decoration consists of striations made by dragging bundled stiff grasses
along the plastic exterior surface of a vessel (Figure 2~g). The designs in this
group show no apparent banding, which suggests that the motif probably consisted of random brushing over the entire body of the vessel. No orientation
was discernible, although the striations often intersect diagonally or at right
angles.
The most common tempering material is grit, with minor amounts of grog
and bone. The paste is compact and typically coarse. The interior surfaces
are usually burnished and smoothed; exterior surfaces are unburnished and unsmoothed, although occasionally the brushing is incompletely smoothed. The
thickness of these sherds ranges from 5 to 8 mm. The interiors of most of the
sherds are dark gray, but some are light brown and red. The exterior colors are
mainly light browns and reddish browns. Cores are solid and dark, usually the
same color as the interiors. Fire clouding is present on the majority of sherds.
There are no rims or bases with brushed decoration in the collection.

(g) brushed; (h) punctate-incised; (i) incised.
INCISED
Incising is the most common decorative technique (Figure 2,d,f) in the
sample.
Among the incised sherds are two identifiable as Canton Incised.
A common Canton Incised motif is a crosshatched design along or just below
the rim, and a series of parallel lines diagonal to the rim. This motif occurs
on three rims in the sample. This type was originally defined from the Sanders
site in northeast Texas (Krieger 1946). Its chronological placement is within
the Sanders focus during the later part of the Gibson aspect, around A.D. 1000
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:23).
Other design elements include single and multiple parallel lines that intersect
diagonally and at right angles. All of these design elements are incomplete,
and some may be fortuitous juxtapositions. Both sharp and blunt instruments
were used for incising, and the lines are fairly well executed. Seven rim sherds
were collected, of which three are standing, three are everted, and one is inverted. All rims are either thinned or direct, with rounded tips. Three of the
rims have sets of parallel lines running horizontally or at right angles to the lips.
No vessel forms were distinguishable in the sample.
Tempering materials consist of grog, grit, and particles of pulverized bone.
Paste texture varies from medium to coarse and is usually compact. Surfaces
generally are unburnished and fine smoothed. Wall thickness ranges from 6 to
9 ram. Shades of brown are the predominant colors, usually with darker interiors. Cores are solid and are the color of the interiors or darker. Fire clouding
is present on a number of sherds.
PUNCTATED
Two different techniques of punctated designs occur in the ceramic sample.
Indentations made by a fingernail or by a blunt instrument occur on 11 sherds.
None of the sherds has a clear design; the punctations appear instead to be

190

Texas Archeological Society

placed at random over much of the body area (Figure 2,e). One everted rim has
punctations around the lip.
The major tempering material is grit (sand) with grog and bone. The paste
texture is coarse and compact. Surfaces are mainly unburnished and fine
smoothed. Wiping marks are visible on most interior surfaces. Sherd thickness
ranges from 6 to 11 mm. Colors recorded for the interior surfaces are mostly
dark browns and grays. Most exterior colors are lighter browns, but there are
some grays. Cores are solid and are the color of the interiors or darker. Fire
clouding is present on the majority of sherds. Punctation is a common form of
decoration at Caddoan sites. Earlier punctated ceramics have random designs,
and the later styles usually are zoned. The punctated pottery from the Richland-Chambers area is probably early, associated with the Sanders focus (Story
1965:231-232).
PUNCTATE-INCISED
Two sherds make up this category, which is characterized by a combination
of random fingernail punctates and incised lines (Figure 2,h). The two sherds
are tempered with grog and grit. The paste is coarse, compact, and well mixed.
Surfaces are unburnished and highly eroded, giving the sherds a rough feel to
the touch. Thicknesses are’measured as 7 mm. The interior surfaces are dark
gray, and the exteriors are pale brown. The cores are solid and dark. No fire
clouding is apparent on the surfaces of the two sherds.
PINCHED

Two pinched sherds are present in the sample. The surfaces of these sherds
are pinched with the fingers, leaving mounds or ridges in the clay. The sherds
are too small to have identifiable patterns. One of the sherds is a direct rim
sherd that has a square lip.
Grog, grit, and bone are the tempering materials. The paste varies from
medium to coarse, but is compact and well mixed. The interior surfaces are
smoothed and burnished; the exteriors appear to be eroded and unburnished.
Thickness ranges from 7 to 8 mm. Colors range from pale brown interiors to
dark gray and light red exteriors. Cores are solid and generally darker than the
interiors.
PUNCTATE-PINCHED

Two of the sherds have a combination of fingernafl-punctate and pinched
design modes. No motif is apparent due to the small size of the sherds. The
temper is primarily grit with grog and bone. The paste texture is coarse and
compact. Surfaces are both burnished and unburnished and fine smoothed.
Thickness ranges from 6 to 9 mm. Surface colors are dark browns and grays;
the cores are dark and solid.
SLIPPED-ENGRAVED
A single slipped-engraved sherd was identified in the sample. The slip is dark
red and covers both surfaces. Two parallel lines are engraved on the exterior
surface. The temper is grog and grit, the paste is medium and compact, and
both surfaces are smoothed and highly burnished. The sherd is 7 mm thick.
Both interior and exterior are dark red, and the solid red core is an indication

Irvine-Ceramics from Richland-Chambers

191

of the oxidizing nature of the firing medium. This sherd has been identified
tentatively as Sanders Engraved, a type affiliated with the Sanders focus in
northeast Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962:137).

Discussion
Ten ceramic classes have been identified and described from the sample:
two classes of plainware sherds and eight classes of decorated sherds. All of the
sherds are tempered with grit, grog, and minor amounts of pulverized bone.
The paste texture, depending upon the tempering materials, ranges from medium
to coarse, but usually is compact and well mixed. Few sherds have suffered
any amount of leaching of material from the paste.
The frequency of burnishing is highly variable and is probably the result of
the eroded condition of the sherds. Some of the unburnished surfaces have a
chalky film that rubs off. The sherds with greater amounts of grit in the paste
have fine-smoothed surfaces and textures similar to sandstone. Interior surfaces
occasionally carry incompletely smoothed wiping marks that were created
during the process of shaping the vessel and thinning the walls.
The sherds in the sample from the Richland-Chambers Project area range in
thickness from 4 to 16 mm. Most of the sherds-particularly the decorated
ones-are between 5 and 8 mm thick. The plain sherds are generally somewhat
thicker, but this is due to the thick base sherds in the plainware sample. Fortysix Munsell colors have been recorded for the sherds: the most common colors
are browns and grays in all shades. The interior surfaces are usually darker than
the exteriors. Most cores are a solid color, although there are some zoned cores.
The solid cores are generally as dark as or darker than the interior colors. The
zoned cores occur as the result of uneven firing temperatures and often are
associated with the presence of fire clouds on pottery surfaces.
The majority of the sherds are from the bodies of vessels, and they provide
little information about vessel morphology. Twenty rim sherds and four base
sherds were recovered. Most of the rim sherds are from standing rims, both
direct and thinned, with mostly rounded lips. It is difficult to determine vessel
types from the few rim sherds, because the rims are small and difficult to orient
since no shoulders are present. Except for one small carinated bowl, no vessel
forms could be positively identified. The existence of certain vessels can only
be inferred from the sample.
Four base sherds were recovered, but only one provides information on basal
morphology. This one is from the round contoured base of the carinated bowl.
Partial reconstruction of one vessel base shows it to be a fiat disc-shaped slab
onto which the coils for the vesse! walls were applied. The size and weight
of the base suggest that it was a fairly large pot-one that would not have been
easily carried due to its weight. The vessel was probably a simple jar used for
storage purposes.
The decorated sherds represent 30 percent of the total ceramic sample
(Table 1). Only 12 of the 24 sites produced decorated sherds, few of which
can be identified with existing types because they are small, and little reconstruction has been possible. Few complete design motifs can be found. Most
of the decoration consists of single and multiple lines, random brushing, and
punctation marks. Incised4ine designs are the most common, followed by

brushed decoration and engraved line designs. Punctate designs also are common
in several different combinations. The sample contains only one slipped sherd.
DISTRIBUTION
Almost all of the tested sites have been disturbed by land modification
activities, including plowing, burning, and clearing, which in turn have exposed
the sites to further disturbance from erosion, artifact collecting, and animals.
All of these disturbances can greatly modify a site.
The hmited testing undertaken by the project produced a small ceramic
sample; only three sites have collections large enough to be considered representative. In each of these sites (41FT201, 41NV173, and 41NV203), squaremeter test units yielded enough ceramics to warrant an analysis of vertical
distribution. The test units at other sites were either shovel tests or backhoe
trenches that lacked vertical provenience.

Intrasite Distribution
The majority of the collection from the tested sites comes from the surface
(Table 2). The total from Level 1 is actually larger, but Level 1 includes the
sherds from Level 1 in the square-meter test units and the sherds from the
shovel tests, which also were designated Level 1. Thus, the figures presented
for Level 1 are inflated and do not represent the actual distribution. The numbers for Levels 2 through 8 are for those levels alone and indicate a decrease in
ceramics in the lower levels.
Table 3 presents the vertical distribution of sherds from the square-meter
units at sites 41FT201, 41NV173, and 41NV203. Two units were excavated
at 41FT201, and ceramics were recovered from the first eight levels. The
distribution in Unit 21 at 41FT201 is one of decreasing frequency from the
upper to the lower levels. The distribution of sherds from Unit 23 at 41NV173
is similar to that of Unit 22 at 41FT201.

Unit 22 at 41FT201 and site 41NV173 (Unit 23) both appear to be disturbed. The distributions for the two units are not what would be expected
for a site that might have been occupied over a long period of time. A more
logical distribution is seen in Unit 21 at 41FT201 and in site 41NV203, where
the highest frequencies are in the upper levels; they drop off and disappear in
the lower levels. Unit 22 at 41FT201 appears to have been disturbed to a
depth of at least 1 meter. This conclusion is based on the presence of a human
burial recovered from the square. The profile at 41NV173 (Unit 23) indicates
that some disturbance has also occurred in that area. The disturbances might
account for the unusual ceramic distribution.

Intersite Distribution
The 24 tested sites produced ceramics in varying quantities (Table 2). Three
of the sites produced over 60 percent of the total sample. When the sites are
considered separately, they do not provide much information about specific
site activities, but when the site distributions are plotted, a pattern of areal
settlement can be seen.
Five geographic contexts were identified among the site locations (Table
4). Terrace sites were the most frequent, followed by flood plain terrace,
erosional remnants, tributary stream, flood plain, and creek bank sites. Most
of the sites are along Richland Creek or close to the Trinity-Richland confluence (Figure 1). The five tributary stream sites are along Richland Creek;
two are near the Richland-Trinity confluence, and two are some distance away
on the western edge of the project area. Most of the terrace sites are near the
Richland-Chambers confluence, where there are greater expanses of flood plain.
All are multicomponent sites with earlier, Archaic components.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The introduction of pottery into parts of Central and northeast Texas
roughly corresponds to the Late Woodland in the Southeast and Midwest (Story
1981). Radiocarbon dates are limited, but there are acceptable dates around
A.D. 1 (Galm 1978) for surrounding areas. Few adaptive changes have been
associated with the introduction of ceramics. The use of pottery apparently
spread rapidly because of its advantages over other containers (Story 1981).
The ceramics from the Richland-Chambers area are closely related to pottery
from northeast Texas, which is mainly grog tempered with some bone (Krieger
1946:186 ; Newell and Krieger 1949:235 ; Story 1981). The plainwares from the
Richland-Chambers area are the type usually classified as Williams Plain (Story
1981), a type originally described at the Williams site in southeastern Oklahoma
(Newkumet 1940). Radiocarbon dates from southeastern Oklahoma establish
the existence of Williams Plain as early as 100 B.C. (Galm and Flynn 1978:
155).
In East Texas these early ceramics are later integrated into Caddoan wares
associated with Early Caddo complexes in the Arkansas Valley (Brown 1971).
This Early Caddo period-the Gibson aspect-is represented by the Sanders
and Alto foci in northeast Texas. Pottery types associated with these foci
have been found in the project area. Carmel Engraved is an Alto focus
pottery, and Canton Incised is known from the Sanders focus. Other decorative techniques represented in the collection, such as brushing (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981) and random punctation (Story 1965:231), have been identified as Early Caddo traits. All of the sites assessed as Late Prehistoric that
contain ceramics can be related to the Early Caddo period in the RichlandChambers area.
Ceramics from the Fulton aspect (Late Caddo period) do not seem to be
represented in the project area. This could be the result of the sampling
technique or of the inability to recognize the associated ceramics due to pre-

196

Texas Archeological Society

viously discussed limitations of the sample. Nonceramic artifacts from these
sites indicate later occupations than do the ceramics. More excavation is
necessary to provide additional ceramic materials that may shed some light
on this problem.
The distribution of sites in general, and of sites with ceramics in particular, shows that a pattern of site distribution is evident: the density of
sites is greater close to the Trinity River and along Richland Creek; the
density of sites is much lower along Chambers Creek. This difference may
be due in part to environmental factors.
Influence from areas outside of the Rich_land-Chambers area is seen in the
ceramics. This influence is mainly from northeast Texas and occurs relatively
early with the introduction of Williams Plain pottery. This influence continues through the Early Caddo period and probably longer, although it is
not evident from the ceramics.
It is interesting to note that almost all of the 43 prehistoric sites tested
were multicomponent sites with both Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations. The analysis showed that of these 43 sites only 24 yielded ceramics,
and only a few yielded ceramics in any quantity. The reason for this dearth
of ceramics is unknown, but there may be several causes. First, the testing
procedure employed at the sites could have created a bias in the sample.
Second, the sites without pottery may represent special activity areas where
ceramics were not used. In any case, the sites with Late Prehistoric occupations would be expected to contain pottery in their artifact assemblages.
A mitigation proposal for the Richland-Chambers Project area includes
the excavation of several significant sites that will provide enough ceramic
data for further analysis. Such excavation might answer the questions raised
in this report and might also extend the limits of the current investigation,
posing many new research questions.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE AVOCATIONAL ARCHEOLOGIST

Jimmy L. Mitchell

ABSTRACT
The responsibilities of avocational archeologists for reporting their findings in
local, state, and regional publications are discussed, and suggestions are made for
ways in which avocational archeologists can secure assistance in report writing.

In 1980, Kathleen Gilmore, then president of the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), asked me to serve on a special CTA committee to improve the
relationship between professional and amateur archeologists in Texas, an issue
of concern to many archeologists (cf. Hester 1981). The committee met in
early 1981 and drafted a variety of proposals, including a suggestion that the
term avocational archeologist be used in lieu of amateur or nonprofessional.
The recommendations were summarized by Kerza Prewitt and presented to the
April 1981 CTA meeting in Austin (Prewitt et al. 1981). After considerable
discussion, some of the recommendations were reported out to the CTA membership for action (Mitchell 1981; Prewitt 1981). The objectives of the project
were in large measure met, and some of the recommendations were implemented; for example, CTA invited TAS to send representatives to the 1983
CTA meetings (Spock 1983:9).
While many of the professional’s responsibilities have been spelled out in
forums such as the CTA, there has not been much discussion of the reciprocal
responsibilities of the avocational archeologist in the recent literature. However, Hester has noted that "It is thus the job of the avocational archeologist
to develop and carry out a variety of activities at the local level," some of which
include: (1) protection and preservation of sites, (2) dissemination of information about archeology to fellow laymen, (3) salvage of resources threatened by
destruction, and (4) continuing site survey programs to fill in gaps in regional
knowledge (Hester 1981:29).
Hester’s list seems to me to be incomplete. There are a number of other areas
where avocational archeologists can make significant contributions, including
report writing for regional publications, the TAS newsletter, and the annual
TAS Bulletin. Some avocational archeologists have become well known as
authors; Jim Word, for example, made major contributions to Texas archeology through his work at Baker Cave and the Floydada Country Club site.
While most of us like to dig, analyze, speculate, and read, many of us do not
like to write about what we have done. Yet, such written and published reports
are absolutely essential to expanding our knowledge of our region and of Texas
archeology in general. We need new data and reports to test our own understanding of prehistory and to help us develop new ideas. Without a continuing

flow of new information, we run the risk of becoming complacent in our thinking and smugly self-satisfied that we know all there is to know about prehistoric
Texas.
Often, avocational archeologists hesitate to write for fear that others know
more about archeology than they do. They do not want to embarrass themselves. Certainly, someone who has a formal education in archeology should
have a good, general background knowledge of the various regions of the state;
however, there is no substitute for field experience and specific knowledge of
the sites in your area. Only with such intimate knowledge of the work done can
one have any hope of fully understanding the developments in a specific county
or region. Thus, you, the avocational archeologist, are capable of analyzing and
reporting on your particular area and how it relates to other sites in the region.
Every individual has a unique perspective and understanding of local and state
archeology, and every different perspective has its own unique value.
Archeology is a science where the avocational individual can make a real
contribution (Mitchell 1982). One of the strengths of archeology as a science
is that it is perhaps the only science where one can make a very significant
contribution, regardless of specific educational background. Any one of us can
do a site report; can recognize the artifacts that are common or unusual to our
area and report them; can develop ideas about how the prehistoric people in
our area lived and worked, and offer up that idea for comment by others. Any
one of us can be sensitive to the land we live in-where the game, wood, and
water are-and figure out the best camping areas. Any one of us can have an
unusual insight or see a correlation of occurrences in the sites we know, and any
one of us can come up with some significant new understanding of what was
going on here centuries ago.
I have had the pleasure of working with a number of avocational archeologists
in recent years who have exceptional talents and archeological skills but who
were just too shy to want to be authors. With a little advice and assistance, some
have become excellent writers and have authored a variety of high-quality reports. I am convinced that almost every TAS member has one or more interesting and exciting artifacts, or concepts that they could and should report. And I
would urge every one of you to try your hand at writing up that interesting
thing you know, to share with the rest of us. Don’t be so shy; after all, you are
among friends. The Texas Archeological Society is composed mostly of people
just like you who are interested in hearing about what you have or what you

Allens Creek: A Study in the Cultural Prehistory of the Lower Brazos
Valley, Texas. By Grant D. Hall. The University of Texas at Austin,
Texas Archeological Survey Research Report 51. 1981. xx + 445 pp.,
60 figs., 66 tables.
It is not often in the archeology of Texas that a new site study describes
excitingly different data and at the same time offers up novel interpretations.
Yet Grant Hall’s report on salvage work near the Brazos River, some 70 miles
inland from the Gulf Coast, manages both these chores quite well. Among
other things, spectacular cemeteries and burial goods were found from which
far-flung trade and cult connections can be inferred. The salvage excavations
were mainly accomplished during four months of 1974 and 1975, near the
site of a proposed nuclear generating station. Happily, the construction of
this plant has been delayed.
By reading between the lines, one can see that the field program was carried
on under trying circumstances. Spectacular discoveries were made just when an
end to the digging had been foreseen, and a way had to be found to carry on.
I mention this to excuse some of the lacunae in the field work and in the study.
It would be foolish to compare this project with a leisurely field campaign
underwritten by a handsome research grant.
To the western side of the Brazos, below a sandy bluff back some distance
from the river, runs Aliens Creek. On the bluff are found the three principal
sites which were investigated. The northernmost is called the Little Bethlehem
site (41AU38), 900 feet to its southeast is the Leonard K or Kolodziejczyk (say
"Kolojeezik") site (41AU37), and onward another 1400 feet along the ridge is
the Witte site (41AU36). Other nearby sites were dealt with, but these three
are the important ones. All are situated in, or near, erosional cuts in the steep
bluff face wt~ch give easy access to the flood plain below. Their occupants were
mostly interested in exploiting the river’s environs, not the prairies to their
backs. Deep sandy soils also made the last two sites attractive as cemeteries.
Fifteen excavation squares were put down at Little Bethlehem, and four
backhoe trenches were dug into the clay deposits. Concentrations of burned
clay, batches of mussel shells, and some artifacts were found. A radiocarbon
assay produced a date of A.D. 1480_+80 (TX-2065), and all dates from Allens
Creek were corrected to a half-life of 5730 years. A few dart points were obtained (two Ensors, a Lange, and an untyped specimen), Perdiz and Scallorn
arrow points, and potsherds with sand, grog, or bone inclusions. Hall assigns
the main occupation to the later part of his Late Prehistoric period.
The Kolodziejczyk site is more interesting. Here 15 excavation squares were
put down, and five stratigraphic zones were found with occupational materials
in them. Zone 6 is a sterile stratum of dense clay containing nodules of calcium
carbonate. On its surface were found hearths, stone tools, and animal bones.

This occupation was termed Middle and Late Archaic, as was the material from
zone 5, above. Ensor, Travis, and Wells dart points were recovered, while, four
burials were dug from this zone. Burial no. 2, which was flexed, yielded a
triangular whelk (conch) pendant, an incised bone wand, and a pointed bone
object which may be a projectile point or dibber tip.
Zones 3 and 4 produced Scallorn arrowpoints and sherds of sandy-paste
Goose Creek type. One hmnan burial belongs to these zones, but was without furniture. From zone 3 there was a 14C date of A.D. 920+_70 (TX-2125).
Zones 1 and 2, the uppermost, had Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points, sandypaste Goose Creek pottery, and San Jacinto ceramics with grog inclusions.
A 14C date of A.D. 1480_+80 (TX-2126) was acquired. Zones 1 and 2 are considered early Late Prehistoric by Hall.
The Ernest Witte site is a very important find because of its 238 burials,
many with elaborate furniture, which segregate into four different cemeteries.
The surface strata of this hillock were removed with earth-moving equipment to
reach the graves quickly and safely. Thus a deal of the excavated matrix was
not screened, and the midden zones were not excavated by hand as a separate
task. Although it could usually not be determined from which level the burials
were dug, their stratigraphic superposition was clear. For some reason, the
strata were labeled from bottom to top, which is the reverse of the practice
followed at the Ko!odziejczyk site.
Zone 1 is sand with calcium carbonate concretions of pea size, while zone 2
is clayey and also has carbonates. On its surface rested the earliest hearths,
stone artifacts, and animal bones. Occurring near the bottom of zone 3 were
the 61 inhumations of Burial Group 1, which were mainly extended with heads
toward the southeast and spines oriented usually about 35 degrees beyond the
point of sunrise during the brumal solstice. Of the seven burials with grave
goods, one contained four bodkins without eyes, about 18 cm. long, and another
produced a large dart point somewhat like the Pedernales type. Two t 4C dates
of 2610+.140 B.C. (TX-2453) and 1530+.90 B.C. (TX-2t27) date this earliest
cemetery. Hall’s Brutal Group 1 from the bottom of zone 3 is in his Middle
Archaic period. A few expanding- and parallel-stem dart points were found here.
Near the top of zone 3 was the most fascinating of the cemeteries, Burial
Group 2, as well as scattered hearths. The 145 individuals found, some together
in single graves, were mainly extended and oriented with their heads toward the
northeast, approximately 25 degrees north of the rising of the sun at the summer
solstice. A few burials were flexed inhumations or cremations. The grave goods
placed with 70 of the bodies are among the most elaborate stone and bone
items to be found in the Texas Archaic: marine shell pendants and beads, dart
points, corner-tanged knives (2), boatstone atlatl weights (6), a ground-stone
gorget, as well as elaborately incised bone wands and plain bone bodkins. At
least five of these people were killed by darts whose surviving stone heads include the Fairland and Kent types, and an unnamed form. Burials 31 and 111
stand out because of the quantity and quality of their furniture: corner-tanged
knives, whelk ornaments, shell beads, a bodkin, and grains of biotite schist.
Both were women of very high status, it seems. One was quite young, and the
age of the other is not known. At least two of the atlatl weights were also
buried with women. The radiocarbon dates from Burial Group 2 are 520+130
B.C. (TX-2451) and A.D. 360+.80 (TX-2452).

Zone 4 was assigned to the Transitional Archaic period, and contained
Burial Group 3 with its nine graves and ten people. These individuals were
mostly semiflexed, with heads to the north-northwest and feet to the southsoutheast. The seven Godley points in one grave were the only burial furniture.
Numerous sandy potsherds were recovered from zone 4, as were Kinney and
Gary dart points. A dog burial and concentrations of mussel shells were also
found. Zone 4 was the only area of typically rich midden in the Witte site.
Zone 5, the topmost occupational stratum, was placed in the Late Prehistoric
period and the Galveston Bay focus because of its sandy sherds. Apparently no
arrow points were found here or elsewhere at the Witte site. In this zone also lay
Burial 4 with its 13 interments without burial goods. The bodies were flexed
and mainly placed with their heads toward the east-southeast, more or less
in the direction of the rising sun at the brumal solstice.
In the remainder of the review I shall summarize some of Hall’s conclusions
and conjectures. My present work in revising the Archaic La Harpe aspect,
located to the northeast of Hall’s area of concern, has led me to accept notions
often like his own, although in some instances we disagree about some things.
Grant Hall’s summary of the culture-history at Allens Creek begins with a possible erosional cycle around 2700 B.C., followed by a mesic interval beginning
about 1000 B.C. As a result, much of the Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic remains of the Gulf coastal plain may have been washed away or buried, either
under sediments or water. Hence their absence from Allens Creek. Halt notes,
too, that Shafer (1968) also found no Early Archaic remains in the lower San
Jacinto River. This explanation is a reasonable hypothesis, even though it is
based largely on the climate of the Trans-Pecos (Patton 1977; Bryant 1966).
Fox et al. (1974), however, included the lower Guadalupe River valley in their
climatic study. The geologic investigations by Baker and Penteado-Orellana
(1977) of the Colorado River support the theory. These geologists believe the
effects of both the early erosional era and the later mesic period can be seen in
the cyclic changes of the Colorado. At Allens Creek, Hall (p. 269) points to the
carbonate-encrusted basal zones of the Kolodziejczyk and Witte sites as evidence
of erosion predating the Middle Archaic on the lower Brazos. This evidence and
his interpretation are markedly significant.
Perhaps the place to commence looking for Early Archaic material is at
McFaddin Beach on the upper Gulf Coast of Texas, where early stone tools and
fossils are found. A collection of artifacts from the beach (Long n.d.) has many
Early Archaic and Paleo-Indian artifacts in it. Also, Aten’s newest monograph
(1983) is important. It very thoroughly documents changes in the shore of the
Gulf of Mexico and provides clues for seeking Early Archaic sites. In addition,
Hester (1980:150) reports that at sites 41LK31 and 41LK32, in South Texas,
Grant Hall excavated large hearths with charcoal that dated around 3400 B.C.
Further work there may be fruitful.
The Middle Archaic at Aliens Creek, which is mostly represented at the
Witte site, is related by Ha!l to assemblages of La Harpe aspect in eastern Texas.
This is true only in the most genera! sense. Most of the stone material is strongly
related to Central Texas, namely his Marcos, Lange, and Travis dart points.
Marcos, however, is almost too late for the Middle Archaic, since it dates in
Central Texas to the time of Christ (Prewitt 1981).
Here I need to point out the biggest weakness of the Allens Creek study-

206

Texas Archeological Society

the lack of large, stratified, artifact samples from sondage-type excavations.
A reliable sequence of midden occupations is desperately needed to define
lower Brazos culture-history. Precedence was given at Allens Creek to the
excavation of burials, and midden soil was largely removed with machines.
Although I may not have proceeded differently had I been responsible for the
dig, analyzed midden deposits are nonetheless needed to interpret fully the
cemeteries and relate them to the daily life of the local people. Archeologists
will hopefully return to Allens Creek to get this kind of information. Yet when
all is said and done, the Group 1 cemetery at the Witte site, convincingly dated
to Middle Archaic times, provides an abundance of new data on local burial
customs. The burials are significant in themselves.
" The Late Archaic at Allens Creek, as represented by the large Burial Group 2
at the Witte site, is of high interest. The mere fact of its presence and size te!ls
much about the nature of the society which there buried its dead. Relatively
large congregations of people used the area during some part of the year, at
least, and returned regularly. The burial furniture is elaborate. From it Hall
posits a Late Archaic-Woodland import-export sphere in which whelk-shell
ornaments, boatstone atlatl weights, and corner-tanged knives were traded over
an extensive region embracing some of the woodlands of the eastern United
States, the La Harpe and Fourche Maline fringe-woodland areas, and Central
Texas as well. He further proposes a marked growth in population and, later,
considerable violence as concomitants of this development.
Hall suggests that there are no known manufactories for any whelk ornaments, whether from the Allens Creek culture; from the. Glacial Kame culture
of Ohio, Indiana, etc.; from Indian Knoll, Kentucky; from Spiro, Oklahoma;
or from other areas. Although the Glacial Kame and Indian Knoll cultures are
much earlier than the period in question, the former dating back to 1500 B.C.
and the latter to 2500 B.C., the origin of their whelk shell is likewise not accounted for. Hall points out that the whelk occurs naturally on the Texas
coast, but that no workshops are known at which it was converted to ornaments. The Kent-Crane site (Campbell t952) is a shell midden on Live Oak
Point, near Corpus Christi, which preserves the spalls and fragments of whelk
shell used to make scrapers, adzes, and gouges, but not ornaments. Hal! argues
sometimes in favor of Texas as the place of origin for decorated shell, and sometimes for Florida, which also has no known manufactories. He finally decides on
Florida or Alabama, but with no concrete evidence for this stand.
Hal! discusses the distribution of corner-tanged knives at length, using J.T.
Patterson’s distributional study (!936). Patterson recorded these uncommon
artifacts mostly in Central Texas and thought it their place of origin. Hall
agrees, as do I. More corner-tanged knives have recently been found, as Hall
reports (p. 155), at the Britton site at Waco Reservoir (Story and Shafer 1966),
and at the McCann site in Lampasas County (Preston and Shiner 1969). The
single knife from Britton lay below a hearth dated at approximately 200 B.C.
by radiocarbon assays. Hall surmises that corner-tanged knives may have been
contributed by Central Texas people to the import-export sphere. If so, one
would expect to find them in some numbers in Arkansas, perhaps at sites like
Jonas Short and Coral Snake, and in many Fourche Maline sites, which all belong to this sphere. They are mainly lacking, judging from available data (e.g.,
Patterson 1937b).

Boatstones are the third item of importance to this economic sphere. Hall
once again draws from an excellent and long-neglected study of their distribution by Patterson (1937b), who found them in the four-state area around Texarkana. Most of the specimens from Burial Group 2 at Witte are of stone such
as syenite from the Ouachita Mountains, as are the specimens from the Jonas
Short Mound. In Central Texas, on the other hand, boatstones are most commdnly of limestone and sandstone, and are often !ocal products or imitations.
Interestingly, one of Patterson’s weights comes from Aransas County in South
Texas, and I should add that a few large whelk pendants are also known from
the lower Rio Grande (Hester 1969). In the boatstones Hall finds some of
his best evidence for trade.
In sum, the evidence for some kind of exchange sphere is excellent, although
I doubt that shells and boatstones were traded as reciprocal goods. I imagine,
rather, that they were exchanged for other goods, perhaps preserved food. Yet
Hall’s areal comparisons are admirable. He brings into his discussion the preCaddoan burial mounds a!ong the Texas-Louisiana border, as well as Marksvi!le
materials, and infers that imported items in the Allens Creek and other areas
were of ceremonial use, since they are mostly found as grave goods. There is
no space here to criticize Hall’s explanations of the origin of his interaction
sphere, which would entail an argument using much data both pro and contra
the ideas of Joseph Caldwell (1958) and Asch et al. (1972), which Hall for the
most part accepts. I very much prefer the notions of Howard Winters (!974),
who allows for many eventualities in explaining such origins.
To my mind, there is a simpler explanation of this sphere of interaction in
Late Archaic times, one which avoids so much speculation about economic
variables which cannot now be controlled. To wit, over much of the coastal,
central, and perhaps even far northwestern parts of Texas, as well as eastern
Texas and regions to the northeast, there existed in Middle Archaic times stable
Archaic populations well adapted to their environments through simple gathering and hunting activities. Their exploitative economy took advantage of all
the readily available food sources: nuts, roots, seeds, shellfish, game, insects,
and fish. Horticulture, especially the growing of squash and corn, may already
have existed in the eastern part of this zone.
Not long before the time of Christ, during the Late Archaic period, something
new happened. Elaborate objects such as boatstone atlatl weights began to be
produced and traded over wide areas, and may have penetrated eastward to the
lower Mississippi. Whether Hopewell areas to the northeast were definitely
involved, I cannot say. Surprisingly, the Great Plains of northwestern Texas
were sometimes included in this trade. Carinated atlatl weights, much burnt,
were found in an Archaic child’s cremation in Mitchell County, with three large
and burnt dart points typical of the local Late Archaic (Ray 1936).
Also during Late Archaic times, whelk artifacts from the Texas coast were
widely traded into the Allens Creek area and elsewhere. They also appear in
single Archaic burials of northwestern Texas, such as the Old Tom Burial
(41DK16) of Dickens County (Parsons et al. 1979), where large whelk pendants
were associated with keeled atlatl weights. Perhaps the southernmost Texas
coast and adjacent coastal areas of Mexico should also be added (Hester n.d.).
Whelk in the Ohio and Mississippi drainages may, of course, derive from the far
eastern Gulf Coast of Alabama or Florida. Elaborate corner-tanged knives were

208

Texas Archeological Society

fabricated during this period in Central Texas and traded at least into the lower
Brazos area, specifically Atlens Creek. They did not penetrate the eastern woodlands in their Texas forms, with the exception of the Fourche Maline area.
Thus a series of partly overlapping trade areas grew up, rather than a single
interaction sphere. The whelk-shell area is by far the largest, and began its deve!opment in the East at least 2000 years before the Late Archaic period. The
corner-tang region is smaller and is centered in the west of the shell zone. It
partly overlaps the boatstone area, which reaches farther east and northeast to
its heartland in the Ouachita Mountains and beyond. At Allens Creek, the data
hint that this combination of trading zones represented, at least partly, a religious sphere dominated by a powerful cult or, at the least, a forceful and widely
shared religious belief system. The "power" can be deduced from the labor
required to erect burial mounds over eminent people, such as Shane’s Mound
(Hoffman 1977; Schambach 1982:149), Coral Snake Mound (Jensen 1969),
and the Jonas Short Mound (Jelks 1965). Possibly the pre-Caddoan mounds and
the early evidence for human sacrifice at the Arkansas Crenshaw site, which is
of the late Fourche Maline culture (Schambach 1982), can also be included,
although their age may be somewhat too recent. At the Witte site the elaborate
bone bodkins and wands, Arkansas boatstones, and whelk artifacts constitute a
simpler expression of this religion. The elk’s teeth, copper bracelets, and copper
pendants of the areas to the northeast are absent, as are burial mounds.
The exact nature of the belief system cannot be discerned, but the sacred
atlatl was one of its themes. Mark L. Parsons of Austin kindly allowed me to
examine his manuscripts documenting a widespread religious use of the spear
thrower. The evidence is impressive. To cite an example from the literature,
at the Indian Knoll site (Webb 1946) both atlatls and their weights were broken
or "ki!led" before being included in burials, often of women and children.
(Indian Knoll represents a religious cult which rose and fell long before the one
being considered here.) At the Witte site, at least one boatstone had been killed,
and two boatstones were placed with female interments in Burial Group 2. At
the related Albert George site (Walley 1955) a similar boatstone may have been
deliberately broken before burial. Boatstones were hardly just burial goods for
warriors or hunters.
Women may have played some role in this cult, for the burials at Witte with
the most elaborate furniture were of females. It is even barely conceivable that
Burial no. 164 (Figure 21) may represent a man who was sacrificed. One of the
three dart points which penetrated the area of his sternum and caused death is
rather special. It is very large and remarkably well made. Only the single
Pedernales-like point from a Middle Archaic burial is as large, and similar points
were not found in Witte in other contexts. The tight clustering of these three
dart shots, apparently all made from the front, is hard to account for under
battle conditions. Also, two sting-ray spines were found in Burial 22. Without
pushing the matter, it is interesting that sting-ray spines were regularly used by
the Maya for autosacrifice (v. Rands 1957:Figure 18B). Then, too, human
sacrifice is indicated at the Crenshaw site in Arkansas (Schambach !982), perhaps as early as the Late Archaic-Woodland period. The evidence that Burial
no. 164 represents a sacrifice is perhaps slight, but to utter skeptics I recall
the case of Petalasharo and the human sacrifices of the Pawnee.
It is of httle moment whether the reader prefers Hall’s account of an import-

Book Review

209

export sphere resulting, in part, from population growth; whether he likes best
my ideas; or whether he subscribes to Schambach’s view (ibid.) of a developed
Fourche Maline culture spreading into Texas. The important thing is that
scholars are now arriving at similar interpretations from the rapidly accumulating evidence. The Late Archaic societies hardly represent simple communities in a stagnant cultural sink.
The Transitional Archaic period is represented, at Allens Creek, mostly by
the materials of zone 4 at the Witte site. The interments of Burial Group 3,
largely without burial furniture, lie in zone 4. It was during this period, according to Hall, that his import-export sphere contracted toward the eastern woodlands, finally halting in the Caddoan area east of the Trinity and Neches rivers,
and in eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, where it played some part in
the development of early Caddoan cultures. It seems to me, however, that a
hiatus may exist between this material and the later Caddoan developments, at
least in the southern part of the Caddoan region. I nevertheless agree with Ha!l’s
idea of a retraction, for corner-tanged knives and boatstones do not occur west
of the woodlands in this period. The data for whelk ornaments are not so clear,
and their use may have continued over a fairly wide region unabated. Hall
speculates that the withdrawal of the interaction sphere may have been caused
by one or more of several factors. Mostly he discusses the effect of hypothetical
population movements out of the west into the marginal zones, and possible
disruptive events in the core of the exchange sphere itself. These ideas are
speculative, but useful to contemplate when they are properly qualified.
The Late Prehistoric period occurs at Little Bethlehem, the Kolodziejczyk
site and zone 5 at the Witte site. The Galveston Bay focus is recognized, although the Allens Creek bone pottery is somewhat unusual in the lower Brazos.
In its general outlines the late Allens Creek material is like the sequence found at
Sabine Lake on the Louisiana border (Aten and Bollich 1969). The 13 burials
of Witte Group 4 also belong to this last of the four periods.
Space does not permit adequate review of all the studies done by Hall and his
comrades. There are useful analyses of lithic residue (pp. 188-190) and the
natural occurrence of shellfish species (pp. 190-193). The appendices by several
colleagues embrace a study of skeletal and dental material, a statistical analysis
of burial data, a study of the faunal remains, and notes on the canine skeleton.
In fine, the Allens Creek data are of utmost significance. They furnish heretofore unknown facts about burial and religious practices and about the movement of ideas and goods over wide areas at a time when the local Archaic people
were once thought to have had a most limited culture and few outside contacts.
Hall’s careful presentations of the information, coupled with his provocative
speculations about exchange spheres, make the publication an exceptional work.
It will be consulted time and again. At long last, large Archaic cemeteries are
being found in many areas of Texas. The Loeve-Fox site (41WM230) of Williamson County (Prewitt 1974) and the Loma Sandia site (41LK28) of Live Oak
County (unpublished) are two more examples of cemeteries which produced
masses of new information. To them can be added the important single Archaic
burials of far northwestern Texas (Parsons et al. 1979). For one thing, grave
associations are important because they give a proof of the contemporaneity of
artifacts not provided by most stratigraphic associations, where debris of many
periods and communities may end up in one zone and deceive the unwary ar-

cheologist into thinking them coeval. For another, they offer a picture of
activities and beliefs not commonly gotten from midden sites.
