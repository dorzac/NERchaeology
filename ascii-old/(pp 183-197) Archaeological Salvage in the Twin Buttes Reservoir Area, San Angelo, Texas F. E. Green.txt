Archaelogical Salvage in the Twin Buttes
Reservoir Area, San Angelo, Texas
F. E. GREEN

Introduction
spring of 1958, the West Texas Museum completed an
archaeological survey of the lands which will be inundated by the
Twin Buttes Reservoir in Tom Green County. This reservoir will be
formed by a dam which is to be constructed approximately seven
miles southwest of San Angelo, Texas, and will impound waters from
both the Middle Concho and South Concho Rivers. The results of the
archaeological survey indicated the presence of at least five sites, but
only three were considered of sufficient importance to warrant further
investigation (Willis, 1958). Of these three, a midden area on Spring
Creek was selected for test excavation by Charlie Steen, Regional
Archaeologist for the National Park Service, Region Three. The Museum entered into an agreement with the National Park Service, and
the excavation of the selected site was carried out during the week of
September 21 to September 26, 1959. This report contains the results
of the test excavation of the midden designated as TG-5 in both this
and the original survey report.
Funds that made this work possible were furnished by the National
Park Service, Region Three, as part of its archaeological salvage program. The Museum, Texas Technological College, provided the equipment necessary to carry out the project and also the facilities for study
and storage of the materials recovered. While the excavation was in
progress, personnel of the Bureau of Reclamation connected with the
Twin Buttes Project were extremely co6peradve and offered to assist
in any way possible. Mr. Joe W. Barnett, head of the Bureau’s Materials Laboratory, was especially helpful, not only in gaining access
to the site, but also in taking care of other incidemal details which

greatly facilitated the iob. To these people and organizations, the
writer is deeply grateful.
Site Description
The site designated as TG-5 is located in the west-central part of
Tom Green County approximately 10 miles southwest of the center
of San Angelo. The midden, which covers an oval area roughly 70 by
100 feet, is situated on a small but prominent knoll 700 feet north of
the ~Tpring Creek channel and has an elevation of 1,910 feet above sea
level (Figs. 1 and 3).
Spring Creek is an eastward flowing tributary of the Middle Concho
River, and as the name implies, contains numerous small seepage
springs along the banks of the channel. The Spring Creek channel in
the vicinity of TG-5 is approximately 500 feet in width and has rather
steep or vertical banks on both sides. At the beginning of the excavation~ only the deeper parts of the channel contained water, and only
a small trickle of water flowed between the holes. However, before the
project was completed, torrential rains had filled the channel from
ban]: ~o bank and a considerable volume of water was being emptied
into Lake Nasworthy, which lies two miles east of the site.
The promontory upon which the midden is situated has fairly steep
slopes on its south and east sides, and is the termination of a northwestward trending topographic nose or rise. Hearth areas, generally
consisting of a few b~lrned limestone and sandstone rocks and scattered
flint fragments, extend northwestward from the midden for a distance
of 600 feet and are c6J.afined to the crest of the rise.
The midden occupies the central part of the knoll and consists of
fill~ with no apparent stratification, made up of dark gray silt with
abundant pebbles and cobbles of burned and unburned limestone and
sandstone, angular fragments of limestone and caliche, and innumerable chips, flakes, and fragments of chert and flint. Mussel shells are
also abundant and are interspersed with the other fill materials. The
depth of the midden accumulation ranges up to 20 inches, but the surface of the underlying bedrock is very irregular and the average thickness would probably be no more than 8 or 10 inches.
The base of the midden deposit and the promontory itself is an
erosion resistant conglomerate made up mainly of pebbles and cobbles
of chert, flint, and limestone in a sandstone matrix. This conglomerate
is believed to belong to the San Angelo formation of Permian age, and
its high content of chert and flint cobbles was undoubtedly responsible

for the selection of this particular spot for a camp site by its Archaic
inhabitants. The abundance of easily obtainable lithic raw materials,
as well as the great number of flakes, fragments, and cores in and on
the midden indicate that this site was primarily a quarry. On the
premise that site TG-5 was occupied for the purpose of obtaining raw
materials, a brief reconnaissance was made to a prominent outcrop of
the San Angelo conglomerate approximately 1500 feet west of TG-5
at a point where Spring Greek makes a sharp turn to the south. The
conglomerate at this latter locality is well exposed and forms a steep
bluff on the stream side. The outcrop is capped by a small knoll
covered with the burned rocks of hearths, scattered mussel shells, and
thousands of fragments of chert and flint. In addition to the debris on
the knoll, hearth areas were noted to occur in high concentration to
the east of the knoll for a distance of several yards. This latter site is
designated as TG-6 (Fig. 3), and differs from TG-5 in that there is
no large single midden accumulation even though the hearth areas are
more extensive at TG-6. Also, no projectile points or even fragments
of points were recovered from the surface at TG-6, while they do occur
on the surface at TG-5.
An unknown amount of soil has been removed from the surface of
the prominent rises which mark sites TG-5 and TG-6. This has been
accomplished by both wind and water erosion, and the result has been
the concentration and mixing of materials on the present surface. All
of the hearths that occur to the north of the midden at TG-5 appear
to have been let down by erosion, and the burned limestone and sandstone rocks rest on a light tan sterile soil. This is also true of most of
the hearths on the knoll at TG-6; however, off the eastern slope and
topographically lower, the hearths have been buried to a depth of two
feet in some places and may be seen in the banks of shallow eroded
gullies.

Methods and Procedure
The purpose of the excavation at TG-5 wasto determine by trench~ng whether or not stratification and separation of cultural materials
existed within the midden. Consequently, prior to staking out the
trench, several small test holes were dug at random spots on the midden, and the trench was then laid out to cut through the thickest part
of the accumulation. An examination of the plan view and cross-section (Fig. 4) will show that the thickest midden deposits are on the

material removed from the trench was screened and all of the larger
flint fragments, whether worked or unworked, were retained. An estimated 15 per cent of the total flint scrap was discarded because of
small size and the time required for sorting on the screen.

Analysis oi Artiiacts
Because of the abundance of raw material at site TG-5 and the probability that it was primarily occupied for the purpose of mining chert
and flint, there is a profusion of spalls, flakes, and cores showing varying degrees of work. For this reason, and the fact that most of the artifacts are crudely made, no attempt was made to sort questionable
items at the time of screening. These materials were brought in to the
laboratory and washed before sorting and tabulating.
Even in the smaller archaeological samples such as this one, there
are usually some artifacts which defy typing. This is also true of the
materials from the trench at TG-5; however, the major problem is the
separation between the partially chipped flakes or rejects and poorly
made tools. Thus an arbitrary and artificial category called "worked

TWIN BUTTES RESERVOIR

flint" is used to include all of those flakes which show deliberate chipping on one or more edges, but which lack shaping that would permit
them to be classified as scrapers or blades with reasonable certainty.
Projectile points. All of the projectile points fall under the dart point
category, and the types are listed in Table 1, which also shows the
vertical and lateral distribution of the different types. Most of the
points were recovered from the uppermost six inches of the midden
deposit, with a few specimens from the six-to-twelve inch level, and
none from the twelve-to-eighteen inch depth. The predominant types
making up the sample are Uvalde, Pedernales, BuIverde and Langtry,

with several other types represented by only one or two specimens.
This assemblage is characteristic of the Edwards Plateau Aspect, and
the only unusual occurrence is the presence of Langtry points (Fig.
5, No. 3, and Fig. 6, No. 2). Four incomplete Langtry points were recovered from the test trench, and although they show crude workman-

TEXANS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

ship, they fall well within the range of variation of the type. In fact,
these points also fall within the range of the Gary point type of northeast Texas, but the latter points are usually thicker and narrower.
Scrapers. Excluding projectile points, scrapers constitute a major
percentage of the other artifacts recovered, and they occur at all three
levels (see Table 2). However, there is no predominance of any one
type. The collection is made up of almost equal numbers of end-scrapers, crudely made side-scrapers, flint nodule or pebble fragments with
chipped edges, and primary core flakes with the thin edges sharpened
by pressure flaking. Scrapers showing better than average workmanship are illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6.
Ovoid blades. These are rather thick, percussion-chipped tools ranging from 5 to 7 centimeters in their greatest dimension, and from 1.5
to 4 centimeters thick. Their occurrence has been noted from burned
rock mounds in the central Texas area and from middens in the Abilene area. They apparently have no diagnostic value in regard to loci
within the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
Gouges. A total of eight gouges was excavated at TG-5, and most of
these are incomplete. They consist of thick rectangular or triangular
percussion chipped blades, and are bi-convex in cross-section rather
than plano-convex as are the Clear Fork gouges (Ray, 1938). These
tools were compared with the gouggs in the Ray collection stored at
the museum, and there are no apparent affinities other than general
shape between the gouges from TG-5 and those of Ray’s Clear Fork
Culture (Focus).
Knives o1" blades. Complete specimens of this type are lacking and,
for the most part, this category is made up of thin, fairly well chipped
broken tips or mid-sections of knives. Other fragments of more crudely
worked, but distinctly edged blades make up the remainder of this
type of artifact.
Drills. Three drills are represented in the sample; two by drill
points, and one by a specimen lacking the point (Fig. 6, No. 6). This
latter artifact is tanged and is of the type usually considered to be a
reworked projectile point. However, the chipping seems to indicate
that the design of the flaring base and tang with narrow drill point
was the original purpose of manufacture, and that the drill was not
an alteration.

Gravers. Of the four gravers found, two are flat rectangular flakes
with small narrow projecting graver points on the short side of the

in Fig. 6 (No. 5), and this one may have been hafted and used as an
axe, although there is no notching or thinning in the center.
Worked flint. This category is defined at the beginning of this section and probably includes some items which would be classified as
scrap or workshop debris by other authors: It has been pointed out,
however, that all of the flakes in this class show some intentional chipping and are not simply random flakes struck from pebbles or cores.
Miscellaneous. Only one small fragment of a grinding stone (pr0bably a milling stone) was found during the excavation. This is surprising since numerous flat slabs of sandstone which would serve as
excellent blanks are present in the terrace deposits below" the midden,
and they are also common in the burned rocks found in the midden
but none shows any signs of wear. A complete basin-type milling stone
and one-hand mano were found in a shallow wash several hundred
feet east of the midden, and a few fragments of these grinding implements were noted in the hearth areas at site TG-6.
One other item of note is the abundance of fresh water mollusc
shells which occur throughout the midden deposit and around the

the collection, but of all the shells examined, only one shows evidence

the margin.

Discussion
In the original survey report of the Twin Buttes Reservoir area,
Willis (1958) concluded that the midden at site TG-5 belonged to the
Round Rock Focus of the Edwards Plateau Aspect. This was apparently based on the presence of a Pedernales point found on the surface.
There is considerable confusion in the literature in regard to foci
within the Edwards Plateau Aspect, and a lack of documented excavations which might serve to clarify the problem. As defined by Kelley
(1947a, 1947b), the Edwards Plateau Aspect includes the Clear Fork,
Round Rock, and Uvalde foci. Suhm, Kreiger, and Jelks (1954: 106107) do not follow this classification because of the lack of clear-cut
data, and treat the Edwards Plateau Aspect as a unit.
Although a thorough treatment of this problem is beyond the scope
of this report, the artifact assemblage from TG-5 is considered distinctive enough to merit consideration in respect to differentiation between the three foci of Kelley. The first separation of central Texas
cultures appeared in Pearce’s (1932) summary of Texas archaeo!ogy.
He illustrated artifacts (ibid.: Plate 10) of three different levels of
his "Texas Kitchen Midden" culture, and those of the Bottom level
clearly belong to the Clear Fork Focus, while those of the Middle level
would be classified as belonging to Kelley’s Round Rock Focus because
of the Pedernales points present. Kelley (1947a: 99) states that the
Round Rock Focus is the same as Sayles’ "Round Rock Phase" and
probably "Guadalupe River Phase;" and Sayles (1935: 53) considered
his "Round Rock Phase" to be the same as Pearce’s Middle level of
the "Texas Kitchen Midden" culture. Pearce’s report is not detailed,
but if his separation is valid, the differentiation between Round Rock
and Clear Fork foci by Kelley is certainly valid. However, a review
of reported sites, which under Kelley’s criteria should be classified as
belonging to the Round Rock Focus, shows that Clear Fork elements
are usually present. Even the characteristic points of Sayles’ "Round
Rock Phase" include Nolan points, which are considered by Kelley as
diagnostic of the Clear Fork Focus on a frequency distribution basis.
Seemingly, Nolan points and Pedernales points should be treated as
characteristics instead of diagnostics of their respective loci. Other
examples of Clear Fork and Round Rock "mixtures" are as follows:
(1) The Lehmann Rock Shelter of Gillespie County contains artifacts
in Stratum II which Kelley (1947b) assigns to all three loci (Clear
Fork, Round Rock, and Uvalde). (2) The Merrell Site in Williamson
County consists of midden deposits in an alluvial terrace, and Camp-

T~¥IN BUTTES RESERVOIR

bell (1948) reports that diagnostic elements of both Clear Fork and
Round Rock Foci are present. (3) The Collins Site in Travis County
(Suhm, 1955) contained a respectable percentage of both Nolan
points and Clear Fork gouges in an assemblage which might
otherwise be classed as falling under the Round Rock Focus. On the
basis of distinctive lithic characteristics, the term Clear Fork Focus
seems to be justifiable; however, the separation or identification of
Round Rock Focus components in the Edwards Plateau Aspect is
understandably difficult.
The third, and least known focus of the Edwards Plateau Aspect
was named the Uvalde Focus by Kelley (1947b: 116), who stated
that it comprised the upper and middle levels of Huskey’s (1935)
"Mound A" culture and the "Late Edwards Plateau" culture of Sayles
(1935). Kelley (1947b: 124) lists Frio, Montell, and Smithwick Small
Stem (Marshall) points as being diagnostic of the Uvalde Focus. Projectile points illustrated by Huskey (1935: Plate 14) as occurring in
the middle and upper levels of the "Mound A" culture appear to include Ensor, Lange, Smithwick Small Stem (Marshall), Montell,
Bulverde, Langtry and Marcos types. The lower level of Huskey’s
"Mound A" culture is omitted from the Uvalde Focus by Kelley, presumably on the basis of the presence of Pedernales points.
The Uvalde Focus is of primary importance in that site TG-5 may
represent a component of this culture. An examination of Table 1 will
show that Uvalde and Pedernales dart points are equally represented
by five specimens each. The Uvalde points as yet have no diagnostic
value within the Edwards Plateau Aspect, and are not connected with
the Uvalde Focus in spite of having the same name; thus, using
Kelley’s criteria for separating foci, TG-5 would be classified as belonging to the Round Rock Focus. An evaluation of the entire assemblage of the cultural materials from site TG-5, however, seems to
indicate that it has closer affinities with the Uvalde Focus than with
the Round Rock Focus for reasons stated as follows:
1). Neither characteristic nor "diagnostic" Clear Fork elements are present in the materials from TG-5, and it has been pointed out that these
elements are consistently present in sites which Kelley’s system would
assign to the Round Rock Focus.
2). Four Langtry points in the TG-5 assemblage indicates a stronger influence from the southwestern part of the state than from the Austin
and Abilene areas.
3). The abundance of mussel shells and the paucity of animal bones in
the TG-5 midden may indicate a preference for molluscs as food by

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

the occupants. A strong parallel is seen in the "Mound A" culture with
its abundant burned and unburned shells, and Huskey (1935: 106)
concluded that snails were the principal food of the primitive inhabitants of the Nueces Canyon.
4). Among- the distinctive elements of the Round Rock Focus listed by
Kelley (1947a: 100) are numerous manos and grinding" slabs, sidenotched pebbles, and spike-like blades. These last two items were not
found at TG-5, and the rarity of grinding implements has already been
noted. Huskey makes no mention of manos or milling stones in the
mounds of the Nueces Canyon, so one must assume that they were
either absent or of rare occurrence.

Summary
The test trench through the midden at TG-5 produced materials
which suggest that this site is probably a component of the Uvalde
Focus of the Edwards Plateau Aspect, which belongs to the Archaic
stage. The thickness of the midden itself seems to preclude an extended occupation over hundreds of years, and the presence of Langtry and Frio dart points may refer the occupation of this site to the
latter part of the Archaic stage.
The abundance of mussel shells in the midden and near the hearths
indicate that molluscs were the most important food item gathered by
the inhabitants. The quantity of worked flint and flint scrap, and the
locations of TG-5 and TG-6 on knolls formed by remnants of the San
Angelo conglomerate which contains numerous flint and chert pebbles, both suggest that these sites were primarily occupied for the
purpose of obtaining lithic raw materials.
