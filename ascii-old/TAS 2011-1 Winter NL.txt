Britt Bousman to Lead TAS in 2011
The new TAS President, Britt Bousman, has been involved in
Texas archaeology for many years and many of you know him but
some may not. His formal interest in Texas archaeology began while
he was an undergraduate at North Texas and then SMU in the early
1970s where he worked for Olin McCormick and Alan Skinner on
projects all across the State. Many of these projects, like the Mile
High Project in Sierra Blanca, actively involved members of the
Texas Archeological Society and he joined the society, one of many
times, in those years. He went to his first TAS Annual Meeting in
Lubbock in 1973 where Waldo Wedel, the granddad of Plains archaeology, was the banquet speaker. But his interest in Texas archaeology
began many years before on his grandfather’s farm in Comanche
County and as a kid finding artifacts on sites that had been recorded
by Cyrus Ray on Elm Creek in Abilene years earlier.
After finishing his undergraduate degree at SMU (he wrote
his BA thesis on the archaeology of Alibates National Monument),
graduate work at Cambridge and a three-year stint doing CRM
archaeology in Oklahoma, he returned to SMU for a PhD. He continued to do small projects with Alan, but most of his work then was
in Africa working with Garth Sampson (1977 TAS banquet speaker)
Britt Bousman hoisting a grindstone at the Antelope
in the Zeekoe Valley. On that long-term project, Britt and Garth are
Creek site, 41PT109 during the 2004 Texas State
still working on it; the crew surveyed almost 5,000 square kilometers
University field school north of Amarillo
and found over 13,000 sites.
He married April Coldsmith in 1987 and their two children,
Blythe and Atticus, are still in school. While Britt was finishing his dissertation, he began to work for Prewitt and Associates and their great staff in Austin. While at Prewitt’s, Britt worked with Doug Boyd at Justiceburg, Ross Fields at Jewett
Mine, Margaret Howard at Clear Lake, and Steve Tomka and Mike Collins all over the place.
By the early 1990s Mike had moved to Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and was beginning the new work
at the Wilson-Leonard site. Mike invited Britt to join him and it was an offer he couldn’t refuse. These were fun times at
TARL with Steve Black starting up his work with Darrell Creel on burned rock middens, Mike and Bob Ricklis were in
the middle of the Onion Creek project and Wilson-Leonard was just beginning. Tom Hester had a host of graduate students
working on a number of projects, Gene Mear was working with Mike on Kincaid shelter, Solveig Turpin and Lee Bement
were working on a number of projects in the Lower Pecos and other places, Ken Brown was working on Burger Bluff and

Continued from page 1

Baker Cave, and Paul Goldberg, now at Boston University,
joined the WL project as a geoarchaeologist. On any day
you could run into Mott Davis or Glen Evans or any of the
many visitors to TARL. While these were exciting times,
Britt wrestled with a personal calamity; his young daughter,
Blythe, was diagnosed with leukemia. Many, many people
in the archaeological community offered much help including blood drives and all sorts of other support too numerous
to list, but each one greatly appreciated.
Blythe survived, but to get more security for his
family, Britt left the WL project to take a job at UTSA
as the associate director at the Center for Archaeological
Research working with Bob Hard. This turned out to be
a great experience. CAR was best known for its Spanish
Colonial archaeology under the collaboration of Ann Fox
and Wayne Cox. This was an archaeological topic that Britt
had not a shred of knowledge. But Ann, Wayne, Britt and
the entire CAR staff worked on a host of fantastic projects:
the Alamo, Las Cabras, Refugio Mission, and Culebra
Creek, until the offer to start a research center at Texas
State University presented itself.
In San Marcos, the Center for Archaeological Studies

was approved in lightening speed. Most universities do not do
much archaeology on their campuses, but with Spring Lake
and the Aquarena Center now part of the Texas State campus,
the University got one of the richest archaeological sites in
Texas. CAS was originally established to study the archaeology there. CAS, now directed by Jon Lohse, continues to
work at Spring Lake. In 2008 it was certified by the THC
as a State Curation Center. While at Texas State Britt has
directed field schools at Spring Lake and excavated Antelope
Creek sites in the Cross Bar Ranch in the Panhandle as well
as continuing to work on Middle and Late Pleistocene sites
in South Africa. The department established a MA program
in anthropology in 2003 and it continues to grow with the
addition of the Shumla Rock Art Field School directed by
Carolyn Boyd, the Gault Project with Mike Collins and Steve
Black on the faculty. Britt has directed a succession of successful graduate students working on Texas archaeological
projects and this is the one accomplishment of which he is
the most proud. He is now an associate professor and associate dean, still active in Texas archaeology, and really excited
about serving the Texas Archeological society and working
with the members again this next year.

Grand Time Had by All in Corpus Christi
By Pam Stranahan, Bob Drolet, and Trudy Williams
The TAS Annual Meeting was a great success due to the
approximate 320 attendees and 86 paper and poster contributions. Thank you all for coming to the coast from destinations
inside and outside of Texas.
The conference sessions included seven symposia, four
general sessions, and a full day of poster presentations. Paper
and poster topics ranged from prehistoric grease production
techniques and South Texas artifact types to the interpretation
of gender roles in the archaeological record. Diverse areas of
the state were represented. Archaeologists working on studies in Mexico and Central America contributed papers with
complimentary regional themes and perspectives.
The archeology sessions began on Friday afternoon with
the first roundtable discussion. Invited speakers who represented Texas, Mexico and the Native American community

were featured. The Friday evening Public Forum was attended
by approximately 225 people, including TAS members and
local public. Speakers Rich Weinstein, Bob Ricklis and José
Dávila provided a thorough review of Native Peoples of the
Texas Coast.
On Saturday sessions began at 8 AM and some ran until
5:30 PM. Especially noted were the 14 outstanding poster
sessions that were easily accessible in the foyer. One hundred
seventy folks attended the banquet. Don Keith treated us to a
colorful and informative talk from Ships of Discovery. Awards
and passing of the gavel followed the talk.
We were especially happy to see many collegiate students
who presented papers or posters. TAMU-CC was well represented with seven; Baylor University had nine and Texas
Tech four. Their presentations accounted for 20% of the
papers given at the conference. Many of the same students
who presented papers also volunteered for conference tasks
over the three-day event.
The TAS annual meetings are growing. This year, we
extended sessions to Sunday morning given the number of
paper presentations. Like the Friday and Saturday sessions,
the Sunday sessions were well attended. Future annual meetings will undoubtedly include a three-day session schedule
due to the growing participation.
Our thanks go to several sponsors who provided financial
support—Beta Analytic underwrote the Saturday morning
coffee break, Tom Long printed the programs and Humanities Texas supported the Public Forum. And many thanks go
to the local committee for untold hours of preparation and
on-site coordination.

2010 TAS Awards
Presented at Annual Banquet
Douglas K. Boyd
TAS presented seven awards at the Annual Meeting on
October 23, 2010. Because committee chair Alan Skinner
could not attend, I presented the awards on behalf of the
committee (Skinner, Boyd, and Shirley Green). All of these
awards were recommended by the Awards Committee and
approved by the TAS Executive Committee.

Golden Pen Award
The 2010 Golden Pen Award was presented to Mr. Bill
Young of Corsicana. Bill is very active in Texas archeology,
and is a THC Archeological Steward for Navarro County. He
has been directing a cemetery survey and inventory project,
and they have researched and documented more than 200
cemeteries in the county. But the reason Bill received the
Golden Pen Award is that has been a columnist for the Corsicana Daily Sun for about a decade. He has written literally
hundreds of articles on the prehistory and history of the region
that appeared in the paper and are available online at http://
corsicanadailysun.com/. His well-written and well-researched
articles are a wonderful blend of interesting facts and preservation messages. However, the most important aspect of
this award is that Bill is reaching an audience that we often
neglect—the general public. The TAS should look into the
possibility of cloning Bill so that we can scatter him across
the state to reach an even bigger public audience!

C. K. Chandler Award
The 2010 C.K. Chandler Award was presented to Mr.
Joe Beavin of Leakey, Texas. This award is given to the avocational archeologist who recorded the most sites during the
course of a year. Joe recorded 58 sites in 2009-2010, which is
three times more sites than were recorded by the second place
avocational. Site recording is the first and most basic step in
our preservation efforts, and the volunteer time involved in
documenting and reporting 58 sites is huge. TAS is proud to
recognize Joe for his efforts.

Distinguished Service Awards
Two Distinguished Service Awards were given for a specific major service to the TAS or to Texas archeology. One of
the two 2010 Distinguished Service Awards was given to the
“Collections Volunteers at the Museum of the Coastal Bend.”

Whereas! Nobody does it better than Elton.
(Photo/Bill Sontag)
Sue Prudhomme submitted the official nomination letter for
the Collections Volunteers, and Pat Mercado-Allinger wrote
a letter of support. This group of about 15 volunteers donated
an average of 396 volunteer hours per month for about year.
Pat calculated that the monetary value of this volunteer labor
was about $8,256 per month. That comes to $99,072 in one
year—and they are still volunteering!
The Museum of the Coastal Bend volunteers have been
processing museum collections, and many of them serve as
exhibit guides and lead student tours. Many of these volunteers can share their own personal experiences of having
worked on the La Belle shipwreck and at Fort St. Louis. That
kind of personal attention is priceless and certainly enhances
the museum visit for many lucky patrons.
Congratulations to these hard working and dedicated
volunteers! The individuals who are specifically named in
the nomination letter, most who live in the Victoria area, are:

2010 TAS Annual Awards
Continued from page 5

The second Distinguished Service Award was presented
to Mr. Bryan Jameson of Benbrook. The Awards committee
felt that Bryan deserves this award because he is always there
for TAS and Texas Archeology. Anyone who has been to any
TAS event in the last few years knows Bryan… because he is
always there—whether it is at field school, annual meeting,
quarterly meetings, or an archeology academy. It is impossible
to tally all the hours Bryan spends and all the ways that he
contributes to the TAS and Texas archeology.
At the banquet presentation, I told this story of my own
personal experience with Bryan. Several years ago the TAS
was contacted by the Make a Wish Foundation of Central
Texas. A young boy was dying, and he was already blind
and confined to a wheelchair. But one wish was to get to
experience the thrill of being an archeologist. And who was
there to step up on behalf of TAS and make this boy’s wish
come true? Bryan Jameson. He spent lots of time planning
and making the arrangements for an archeology adventure at
the Bell County Museum in Belton. Bryan’s efforts meant the
world to a little boy who got to live out his dream of being an
archeologist for one day in March 2007.
Thanks to Bryan for always being there for us.

Francis Stickney Field School Awards
This award is given to individuals for major contributions
to the annual summer field school, and we gave out two awards
this year. One of the 2010 Field School awards was presented
to Ms. Carol Macaulay of Temple. I cannot remember a field
school without Carol Macaulay, and I doubt many of you can
either. As an added benefit of her involvement, TAS gets a
whole new crop of members each year from Baylor University,
and many of them go on to become permanent TAS members.
But it is not just the days of hard work Carol spends at field
school that figure into this award. In fact, Carol spends more
time working to promote and prepare for field school each year
than she does actually being at the field school! As chairperson
of the TAS Public Outreach and Membership Committee,
Carol does many behind-the-scenes tasks that have a direct
impact on field school and help make it successful. At the 2010
field school, for example, Carol did these things:
•
•
•

Made the arrangements for the public artifact
identification event
Made the arrangement for the onsite “Archeology
Open House”
Sent out press releases to notify the public about
field school

and all the associated public events

I know from personal experience that Carol’s efforts paid
off this last year. Several people who participated in the 2010
youth group were first-time folks who came to field school
because they saw Carol’s press releases. And they were so
impressed that they promised to return in 2011.
Thanks for all your hard work, Carol!

The second 2010 Field School Award was given to Ms.
Margaret Howard of Austin. The next field school in June
2011 will mark the ninth year that the TAS has been offering
Scholarships to encourage Native Americans to participate
in TAS field schools. This successful program was started by
Margaret Howard and continues through her efforts as chair
of the Native American Scholarship subcommittee of the TAS
Multicultural Committee. Every year many Native peoples
take advantage of this scholarship so they can participate
in the annual field school. In 2006, the TAS gave a record
number of 12 scholarships so members of six different groups
could attend field school—Caddo, Kiowa, Seminole, Pilam/
Coahuiltecan, Delaware, and Choctaw.
I can always count on three to six young Native
Americans participating Youth Program at every field school.
I do not believe there is any other state in the Nation where

a nonprofit archeology field school makes such an effort to
involve Native Americans. In the United States and Texas,
now more than ever before, archeologists and native peoples
must be allies in the quest to preserve the past and our
shared heritage. The TAS is certainly proud of Margaret and
everything she has helped us accomplish.

TAS Fellow
The honor of TAS Fellow may be awarded to one TAS
member each year for major contributions to the TAS and to
Texas archeology. This is one of the society’s most prestigious awards, and the Fellows are an elite group of scholars
who have made major contributions to our society and Texas
Archeology. The honor of being named a TAS Fellow this
year went to Ms. Carolyn Spock.
I don’t even know where to begin with this, except to
say…. It’s about darned time! Carolyn has served the TAS
in so many different capacities over many years. She’s been
on countless committees, and the time and energy she has
spent working for TAS would stack up against anyone in the
society, past and present.

A surprised Carolyn Spock learns she is the newest
TAS Fellow! (Photo/Bill Sontag)
Carolyn received the Distinguished Service Award from
TAS in 1996. She served as TAS Secretary-elect and Secretary from 2003 to 2005. And she served as president-elect
and president of the society in 2006 and 2007. But Carolyn’s
greatest contribution to TAS and Texas Archeology is her
unofficial role as the “Keeper of All Archeological Knowledge” at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin. Most people in the society know exactly what I mean
by this and would agree that she can legitimately add the title
of “KAAK” after her name.

It has always been difficult to separate her roles in TAS
from her work at TARL, but the time she spends helping TAS
members and others is immeasurable. It is safe to say that
Carolyn has helped almost every professional and avocational
archeologist who has ever worked in Texas in some way or
another. During the banquet presentation, I asked the audience to raise a hand if Carolyn had ever helped them to get an
answer to some obscure archeological question or provided
some assistance with site recording and other tasks. Looking
out across the sea of hundreds of raised hands, I wasn’t sure
if I saw anyone who didn’t raise their hand!
This recognition is indeed long overdue, so congratulations to our newest TAS Fellow, Carolyn Spock!

Start Thinking About Awards For 2011
Now is the time to start thinking about awards for 2011.
If this article spurs a thought of someone you think should be
nominated for a TAS award, send the Awards Committee an
email right now (email addresses below). We will file it away
and get in touch with you later on to follow up.
Here is another thing to think about. We did not give out
a Texas Biface Award in 2010. This is a stewardship award
presented to an avocational TAS member for contributions to
the preservation of cultural resources in Texas. I know that
there are many TAS members who fit this bill, so drop the
committee an email with suggestions.
One final note regarding TAS awards. In 2010, the
Awards Committee and Executive Board began discussing
the Cyrus N. Ray Lifetime Achievement Award. The official
statement on the TAS website is as follows:
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD: Recognizes an
individual TAS member’s lifetime commitment to Texas archeology. It will be presented as deemed appropriate by the TAS
Board to a TAS member in recognition of his or her lifetime
involvement in TAS and Texas archeology. Because individuals may be involved in many different ways, each recipient will
be recognized for their own unique contributions.
But the Lifetime Achievement Award has only been given
once in TAS history—it was awarded to Dr. E. Mott Davis in
1997. Obviously, the bar is set quite high for this award, but
the statement on our website implies that it was not intended
as a one-time award. It is obviously the highest award TAS
can give, but we are now wondering: Why has the society has
not presented the Lifetime Achievement Award in 13 years?
Should we change the award criteria or reconsider how we
envision this award? The Awards Committee would welcome
any and all input on this topic from TAS members. Please let
us know your thoughts on this.

Digging Deeper:
Return to Eagle Bluff
The 2011 Texas Archeological Society Field School
Dr. Thomas R. Hester, Principal Investigator
The members of the 2010 TAS field school will remember
that we have unfinished business at the Eagle Bluff site, along
Hondo Creek in northern Medina County. Or if you had a
chance to hear the excellent papers in the TAS field school
symposium at the 2010 annual meeting, you know why
we have this fieldwork continue into 2011. The hearths (or
concentrations of fired cracked rock, if you prefer) dating to the
late part of the Early Archaic are still there, under black plastic,
orange security fencing, and carefully placed backfill. These are
in Area 1, where this summer there will be the opportunity to
see what the deeper deposits can tell us about the Early Archaic
and, hopefully, Late Paleoindian occupations.
Tiffany Osburn noted in her paper at the symposium that the
further work in 2011 would be very exciting. Brad Jones, who
supervised Area 2 in 2010, spoke of the importance of “digging
deeper,” since this locale offers the potential of having the entire
sequence, from Late Prehistoric back to Late Paleoindian times.
Area 3 will continue to be the focus of the youth program,
directed by Doug Boyd. As work completed in 2010, the teams
in Area 3 were starting to expose Late Archaic deposits. With
the broad view that we can get from the block of units in Area 3,
a detailed look at the Late and Middle Archaic is very possible,
and critical in the interpretation of how and when parts of the
large Eagle Bluff site area were used through time—and in what
fashion they were used: occupation, processing of animals and
plants, earth oven technology, and the like. Area 4 may go a little
deeper, but surely it will get a lot “wider.” The impressive Late
Prehistoric Toyah component deserves much more attention and
there is a lot of room to continue to examine the activities that
went on there. Bryan Jameson and Dr. Harry Shafer reported,
in the symposium, that the artifacts found in 2011 suggest this
is a Toyah work-area, and that better defined activity-specific
areas may be found. In 2010, for example, 11 end-scrapers were
found clustered in two 1x1 units, amidst bison bone fragments.
In all of the excavations, these that continue from 2010
and new ones that might be started in 2011, we will continue
our efforts to recover faunal remains, potential radiocarbon
samples, and samples for paleobotanical analysis. In essence,
with what we have learned about Eagle Bluff in 2010, we
will be able to not only dig deeper (or wider)—but smarter.
The highly successful Historic work at the locale in Castroville has been finished will not be one of the field school

venues this year. Lynn Yakubik got a large sample of pre-Civil
War horseshoes, clay pipes, buckles, bottles (ginger beer,
wine, champagne), buttons, and leather straps, to adequately
date and hopefully interest this interesting feature. The Historic field work this summer is not set in concrete (though
concrete might be involved) at this moment. We have commitments from landowners in the village of Quihi (6 miles
due east of the Hondo City park camp location)—to work at
one of the historic Alsatian stone houses (1840s) located there.
An example is the Saathoff House, which is on the National
Register of Historic Places, considerably more restored that
many of the 1840s-1850s dwellings in the area. And we have
an invitation to do Historic research at an 1850s ranch house
just outside Hondo. Judge George Harper had a large ranching
complex at the ranch, and his horse herds were often raided
by Comanche –setting off wild pursuits through the canyons
and the brush. Sometimes, combatants on both sides would
be killed. Often, though, the Comanche must have heard these
posses coming a long way off. One of the legends-in-his-own
mind who was often among the pursuers was “Seco” Smith…
of which was said “…he would yell when the spirit moved
him…. (and) they finally got so that when they heard his war
whoop, they would smile and say ‘That is Seco Smith; he
won’t do any harm if they will let him alone.’ ” (A. J. Sowell,
Texas Indian Fighters, 1986, page 477).
There will be plenty of survey opportunities as well,
including the survey of a ranch located just 6.5 miles down
FM462 from the Eagle Bluff site. We anticipate that the survey
begun by Texas Parks and Wildlife will also continue in 2011.
And, thanks are due to Ron Ralph, who has already submitted
a 28-page, illustrated report on the survey activities that he
directed at the 400-acre Calvert Ranch.
I hope you will sign up for TAS Field School 2011 and
get involved with the second phase of this important fieldwork
program. Your help is greatly needed in the field and lab, and
you have the option of the “kind” of archeology that you
wish to do during the field school. You will also experience
a well-organized camp and excellent evening programs with
more information forthcoming in the spring edition of Texas
Archeology. No one can assure you that the humidity will be
lower than last summer, but be assured, there will be all the
humidity you’ll ever need.

Cool, Cool Water—Follow Me to Hondo!
There are two important aspects that we try to consider
when the Field School Committee plans for a TAS Field
School. We want to have good, meaningful archeology on the
one hand, but of about equal importance is the socialization
that comes from a good campground experience and associated activities. The Committee thinks the Medina County/
Hondo Field Schools bring out the best of both. This year’s
Field School in Medina County promises to be even better
than the outstanding one we had last year. As a result of
what we learned last June, the archeology will be much more
focused. We spend about six hours per day doing archeology
during Field School, much of the rest of the time is spent in
camp or partaking in other, hopefully enjoyable, activities.
Here are some of our plans:
The Field School campground will be in both the Hondo
City Park and the Medina County Fairgrounds just as last year.
Camping will again be under the large oak trees that should have
enough shade to accommodate just about all our participants.
Evening programs will be at the outdoor stage this year
or in the air-conditioned exhibit hall. We do not intend to use
the Livestock Barn for programs (just too hot.)
Swimming and bathing in the beautiful Hondo Creek out
at the dig site should again be a major attraction. Be sure and

Consider joining these work- weary crew members in
beautiful Hondo Creek this summer!
bring your bathing suits!
Motels and RV parks are right in town and will welcome
us again. The campground is only three miles from the center
of Hondo.
So make plans now to attend. We hope to see lots of folks
who were unable to make it last year as well as returning
participants. Look for more coming in your April newsletter!

Going the Extra Mile
Robin Matthews, TAS Education Committee Chairman
Thanks to a grant from the Texas Historical Foundation,
TAS was able to have an exhibit booth at the Texas Association for the Gifted & Talented Conference. There were over
3,000 teachers and parents of GT children at this conference
in Ft. Worth this past November.
Ann and Robin Matthews tended to the exhibit booth for
three days and Robin made an hour-long presentation during
one of the breakout sessions. Robin focused on rock art in
Texas, the importance of the Gault site near Georgetown, the
impact SHUMLA is having on understanding the significance
of Lower Pecos River Style rock art, the role of the Rock Art
Foundation in preserving sites, and he showed pictures from
the 2010 FAS Field School.
During the presentation, Robin also demonstrated one
exciting hands-on group activity involving rock art, using a

14

✦ Winter 2011

compass and map, writing a short story, all geared to upper
level Bloom’s and William’s Taxonomies. (Teaching style
and methods)
“The teachers were absolutely astonished that Texas has
some of the most important archeological sites in the U.S. and
none of them had ever heard of TAS or any of the other archeological groups until this presentation. Over 500 teachers stopped
by the exhibit booth. Several teachers said that they planned to
attend Field School in 2011,” according to Robin. Ann stated
that this was one of the best-attended sessions of the conference
and Robin received a round of applause after his presentation.
Each teacher attending the presentation received a free
copy of the Gault DVD, which was shown during the presentation, as well as a packet of activities, crossword puzzles,
teaching tips, and archeological handouts.

History and Archaeology Come Together
at Bernardo
by James Woodrick and Robert Marcom
Nails can tell stories! At Bernardo, the first plantation in
Texas and for many years the largest, the nails have spoken.
But first let’s set the stage.

The History
Settlement at the site began in early 1822, when Jared
Ellison Groce II arrived with a hundred slaves and a large
wagon train full of supplies. Groce, born in Virginia, had
already moved west twice—first to Georgia and then to
Alabama, where he rapidly became a wealthy cotton planter.
Hearing of Stephen F. Austin’s plans for a new colony in
Texas, he immediately packed up, headed west again, and
became one of the first of Austin’s Old Three Hundred. He
selected two leagues of land on the east bank of the Brazos at
the Coushatta Trace crossing. His decision was based on the
strategic location and the promising agricultural prospects of
the rich Brazos soil. He named his plantation ‘Bernardo’ after
the Spanish governor of Louisiana, Bernardo de Galvez, who
led his troops against the British in the American Revolution.
By the end of 1822, the skilled craftsmen among Groce’s
slaves had erected a fine house which promptly became a
magnet for visitors and incoming new settlers. Nearby was
the log cabin built in early 1822 and known as the ‘Bachelors
Quarters’. It was first used as Groce’s temporary residence
but later as a hostel for visitors. Other necessary outbuildings included a kitchen, a dairy, and a house built for the first
doctor in Austin’s Colony, hired by Groce to provide medical
care for his many slaves. Quarters for the slaves were located
on a small lake nearby and included many cabins, the house
of the overseer and a large community kitchen and day care
center. The first cotton crop in Texas was harvested at Bernardo in 1822. The first gin in Austin’s Colony was opened
here in 1825.
Groce and Bernardo Plantation played a key role in the
campaign for Texas independence. During Spanish colonial
times, Bernardo was the largest plantation and Groce was
the wealthiest man in Texas. Retreating from the advancing Mexican army after the fall of the Alamo and Goliad,
Sam Houston led his Texian army to the west bank of the
Brazos opposite Bernardo, where he camped for two weeks
on Groce’s land. During that time he was able to provide
some sorely needed training for his volunteer army. From his
plantation resources, Groce supplied food for the army in the

form of cattle, corn and bacon. On April 12, 1836, Houston
used the steamboat ’Yellow Stone’ (which had been loading
cotton at Groce’s Landing) to move his army across the river,
where they camped for two nights before departing for destiny
at San Jacinto. The two cannon known as the ’Twin Sisters’,
Sam Houston’s first and only artillery, had arrived at Bernardo
the day before.
Jared E. Groce’s eldest son Leonard Groce lived with his
family in the main house until 1853. The house was torn down
in 1864, and many of the cottonwood logs used in the walls
were recycled to build a new house on a neighboring plantation, as were the large fireplace stones. After the Civil War,
the original Bernardo lands were divided and sold, ending
some forty years as the most significant plantation in Texas.

The Archaeological Investigation
In 2009, a fortuitous set of circumstances set the stage
for a major archaeological project. Dr. Gregg Dimmick of
Wharton, author of Sea of Mud—The Retreat of the Mexican
Army After San Jacinto, An Archaeological Investigation,
had been invited to do a television interview about his book.
After the interview, Dimmick mentioned to the reporter that
his friend, Jim Woodrick, was trying to locate the person who
owned the old Bernardo plantation. Woodrick had written

and green) overlaid with floor plan sketch. Arrows point

a history of Austin County and had included a segment on
Bernardo, which was part of Austin County until 1873.
Remarkably, the owner of this historic property happened to
own that television station and was in his office just down
the hall! After Dimmick informed Greg Brown of the interest
in the historical site, Brown warmly hosted a visit to his
property. It was apparent to Dimmick and Woodrick that the
largely undisturbed site presented a significant archaeological
treasure. With Brown’s full support, a subsequent visit for a
larger group including Dr. Jim Bruseth of the Texas Historical
Commission was held. Bruseth offered THC’s services
to do a preliminary survey of the site, and in July, 2009,
magnetometer and ground penetrating radar surveys were
conducted at the suspected location of the main house. A large
magnetic return called an ‘anomaly’ about 3 by 6 feet was
located and plans were made to begin excavation.
Robert Marcom and Carol McDavid, professional
archaeologists with Houston-based Community Archae­
ological Research Institute, Inc. (CARI) were brought in to
lead the project. CARI was selected because of their research
specialty in African American historical archaeology, their
strong focus on community involvement and outreach,
and their field schools for training archeological students
in excavation methodology and techniques. CARI’s prior
experience includes work at the Levi Jordan Plantation
in Brazoria County and with the Rutherford H. B. Yates
Foundation in Freedman’s Town in Houston. Under their
direction, excavations at Bernardo began in August of
2009 and continued, including four weekends in October,
2010. The initial focus was on discovering what buildings
or features the anomalies found in the THC surveys

represented. Volunteers from the Houston and Brazoria
County Archaeological Societies and other TAS members
have made invaluable contributions to the excavations by
forming the core of the excavation team.

Discoveries
Historical archaeologists develop information by drawing upon historical documents and onsite excavations. With
Bernardo Plantation, they have a sketch of the main house
floor plan drawn by a Groce descendant. The drawing represents the recollections of one of Leonard Groce’s sons who
grew up on the plantation. It shows the main house with four
large chimneys, two on each side of the house. The large
anomaly in the radar studies was identified as the massive
brick foundation of the northeast fireplace of the main house,
carefully laid by skilled slaves using bricks they had made on
the plantation. Some 25 feet away another unit was opened,
revealing the sandstone foundation of another fireplace. When
the main house floor plan was laid on top of a map of the two
unearthed fireplaces, it perfectly matched two of the four
indicated fireplaces. Subsequent units found the other two
fireplaces and a brick skirting that had been erected to close
off the crawl space under the main house.
Not only is the Bernardo Plantation investigation an
excellent example of a productive collaboration between
professional archaeologists and historians, it also represents
a valuable collaboration with metal detectorists. Because
of the scope of the plantation’s buildings and features,
metal detectorists have been instrumental in identifying
outlying areas where artifact assemblages exist, making it
more likely that future excavation units can be located more
productively. Thousands of artifacts recovered from the site

Texas history.

in scientifically-controlled excavations at the house site will
be used in analyzing and reporting results of the project.
Artifacts include a variety of period ceramics, children’s
toys, coins, metal and ceramic buttons, rifle and pistol balls,
many square nails, sad irons, cotton hoes and other tools, to
name just a few.
Now back to the story the nails tell! Excavations under
the house produced over a thousand square nails of various
sizes. When THC experts examined these nails, those in the
eastern half of the house were identified as a style that originated in 1833, and they were clearly different than the older
nails in the western half. This led to the speculation that the
house had been significantly remodeled, nearly doubling its
size, sometime after 1833. Such a change would also account
for the two different chimney foundations—sandstone in
1822 and brick after 1833. Up to this time, nothing in the
hundreds of pages of historical records amassed about Bernardo reflected such a major change to the main house. Armed
with this information from the excavation, a box of archival
information in the Briscoe Center for American History was
rechecked. Another floor plan sketch was uncovered which
had a notation that the house was significantly expanded and
remodeled in 1838. The historians had finally found proof of
what the archaeologists had found in the ground!
Future work at the site will expand on initial testing that
suggests the locations of the kitchen, dairy, doctor’s house and
Bachelor Quarters as well as more remotely located stables,
laundry room and the extensive complex at the slave quarters.
Archaeologists, historians, volunteers, experts in various
disciplines, and researchers will continue to collaborate on

This report summarizes a few recent, interesting
projects handled by TxDOT staff. The summaries span a
variety of settings, site types, and outcomes. The purpose
of these summaries is to highlight some of the interesting
work being done by TxDOT and to initiate a dialogue about
TxDOT’s work.
Before discussing specific project results, allow us
to provide a little context for those projects. Every year
TxDOT archeologists review hundreds of proposed transportation projects for their potential effects on archeological sites. Many simple projects (e.g., repaving a road) do
not require a formal study. Some projects may require a
review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and other
sources of background information, while some also may
involve fieldwork to evaluate project effects. TxDOT archeologists consider the project type and setting to determine
the scope of investigation necessary for the assessment of
transportation project impacts.
Funding for transportation projects is declining, so
TxDOT is focusing more on simple maintenance projects,
which often have limited potential to affect archeological
sites. The overall workload has decreased from its peak of
nearly 1,000 reviewed projects in 2005 to approximately
600 projects this past year. The number of TxDOT archeologists, however, has also decreased with the retirement
or reassignment of three full-time staff members over the
past three years and a similar reduction in the number of
consultant staff working at TxDOT. Despite the changes,
TxDOT archeologists continue to find noteworthy sites and
to treat them creatively and appropriately. The following
case studies illustrate this work.

identifying and adequately sampling such sites are rare
using traditional hand excavation alone. Rather than
simply considering such sites ineligible or funding small
scale hand excavations that retrieve tiny samples, TxDOT
often works with THC and its archeological contractors
to develop data recovery strategies that use earth-moving
machinery to maximize data return from these problematic
sites. Below we describe two recent examples.

Potter’s Creek
Site 41HS915 was identified on a survey by GeoMarine archeologist Angela Tiné in advance of a bridge
replacement project on FM 2625 in Harrison County.
Limited testing of the site was conducted by TxDOT
archeologist Waldo Troell, TxDOT geoarcheologist, Dr. Jim
Abbott, and a small crew furnished by PBS&J. It recovered
relatively sparse materials consistent with a Woodland
occupation, including thick sandy paste potsherds and Gary
dart points. The results of testing suggested that the site
was thoroughly dispersed in a heavily bioturbated alluvial
sand, and that occupation surfaces and features were not
present. However, examination of the recovered assemblage
suggested that the site was largely Woodland in age, and
that a strategy that maximized artifact recovery with limited
control of provenience might prove very informative about

Using Machine Excavation to Address
Low-Density Prehistoric Sites
Low-density archeological sites are a particularly
thorny problem in cultural resource management. On
one hand, low-density sites are far more likely to represent limited spans of time, and therefore provide us with
unambiguous glimpses of individual episodes of prehistoric behavior. On the other hand, unfortunately, because
archeological excavation is expensive and time-consuming,

this poorly understood period. Working with Robert Rogers and Damon Burden at PBS&J, TxDOT implemented
an excavation strategy that used a Gradall and a motorized screen to process a large volume of sediment from a
block excavation relatively quickly (Figure 1). The block
measured approximately 30 m x 4.5 m x 1.4 m, and was
excavated in mechanical units measuring approximately 3
m x 1.5 m each. The artifact-bearing deposits within each
unit were excavated and screened in two separate levels.
Approximately 3800 artifacts were recovered from the
excavation, including 157 sherds, 143 lithic tools, 3,375
pieces of debitage, 26 pieces of groundstone, and 36 small,
poorly preserved faunal fragments. Preliminary results indicate that while the recovered assemblage is predominantly
Woodland, there are also some Caddoan and possibly some
Archaic materials present. Analysis of the data recovery
excavations will therefore focus on diagnostic artifacts.

Fish Creek
In 2005, Rachel Feit (Hicks & Co.) discovered site
41DL436 during intensive archeological survey for the
proposed Lake Ridge Parkway in Grand Prairie, Texas.
The site consisted of stratified zones of burned clay, ash,
and burned plant material, along with bone fragments from
various species, in the floodplain of Fish Creek. No lithic
debris or burned rocks were noted. During the summer of
2010, TxDOT geoarcheologist, Dr. Jim Abbott, and TxDOT
contract archeologist, Eric Oksanen (UTSA), assisted by a
small crew from Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted limited testing at the site, which encountered well-defined alluvial stratigraphy and burned deposits similar to those documented
in the 2005 survey. Although no lithic debris or burned rock
was found during testing, the ubiquity of stratified burned
zones and the return of bone and vegetal debris suggested
that, at minimum, the site would provide high resolution
paleoenvironmental data, while at best it could preserve
intact, isolated activity areas. TxDOT worked with Dr. Nick
Trierweiler and David Nickels at Ecological Communications Corp. (EComm) to develop a strategy for combining
machine and hand excavation in a large (6 x 20 x 2 m) block
that would be expansive enough to capture activity areas, if
present, and detailed enough to gather high resolution data.
Approximately 285 m3 were mechanically excavated and
20 m3 were hand excavated during data recovery, resulting
in the documentation of 42 features (including four small
fire-cracked rock hearths) distributed among at least three
principal occupation zones (Figure 2). Only one projectile

point was recovered, along with less than 20 small flakes.
Ongoing analysis of the site should provide considerable
insight into the nature of ephemeral occupations in the
lithic-poor terrain around Dallas.

A Multi-Component Site in DeWitt County
In DeWitt County, a proposed bridge replacement project provided an interesting view to the past. Background
research indicated high probability for the presence of
buried archeological deposits. TxDOT archeologist Allen
Bettis and TxDOT geoarcheologist Dr. Jim Abbott conducted mechanical trenching of the project location. During
this process, they identified and recorded a prehistoric site
(41DW277). The site was located within the existing and
proposed right of way at the edge of the project area. Based
on trenching results, Allen and Jim recommended the site
for NRHP eligibility testing and developed a plan to evaluate the site further. As part of the testing activity, additional
trenching and hand-excavated units were completed by
Rachel Feit and a small crew from Ecological Communications Corp. The diagnostic artifacts, other archeological
materials and features encountered provide preliminary
indications that site 41DW277 is a multi-component site.
The components include Late Prehistoric, Middle Archaic

and Early Archaic. The identification of small, intact hearth
features, likely associated with the Early Archaic component, lends an interesting aspect to this site, as such features
are not often encountered for that time period (Figure 3).
However, these early deposits are located at the edge of the
right of way and below the area that would be affected by
the project. Therefore, TxDOT decided to preserve that portion of the site in place. Thus, the remaining intact portion
of the site that is located in the right of way will be capped
with fill for the proposed bridge embankment.

Burned Rock and Lithics in South Texas
Site 41WB624 was recorded in 2003 during survey for
new location roadway. Although the site was recommended
for NRHP eligibility testing, right of entry issues delayed the
completion. In late 2009, site testing was initiated with the
assistance of field archeologists from PBS&J Inc, utilizing
a series of trenches, hand-dug units, and controlled surface
collection. Based on radiocarbon assays of material associated with the burned rock features and diagnostic artifacts,
activities at the site spanned the Middle Archaic through the
proto-Historic periods. The project utilized the newly operational TxDOT Laredo District Virtual Reference Station
(VRS) for spatial data collection. The VRS allowed for the
use of sub-centimeter accuracy Real Time Kinematic (RTK)
GPS providing for high accuracy data collection with no
base station or post-processing and without the requirement
for a line-of-sight needed for TDS. TxDOT archeologist,
Christopher Ringstaff, evaluated a high-density cluster of

20

✦ Winter 2011

burned rock features, chipped stone flaking debris features,
and chipped stone tools. Chris performed a minimum
analytical nodule and technological analysis on recovered
flaking debris features to ascertain an approximate number
and kinds of tools being produced (Figure 4). Replication
studies were conducted for quantitative and qualitative data
comparisons between experimentally generated debris and
recovered flaking debris features to accurately characterize
technological variability. Although analysis of the overall
assemblage is ongoing, preliminary interpretations of the
recovered debitage features indicate these spatially discrete
clusters are resultant from both in-situ production and
secondary disposal loci. The debitage features differ technologically between the open campsite/hearth field and the
adjacent upland portion of the site with the former focused
exclusively on mid to late-stage biface production and the
latter on macro-flake and early-stage biface blank production.
With subsequent analysis and integration of the rest of the
recovered chipped stone assemblage, a clearer understanding of overall technological organization may be obtained
and used to aid in the interpretation of mobility, land use,
site function, and social organization. Despite the valuable
data on chipped stone technological organization and burned
rock feature variability, the contextual and preservation
issues associated with this surficial to shallowly buried multicomponent site inhibited the ability to examine, compare, or
contrast temporally discrete components. Considering the
contextual constraints to examine cultural dynamics at the
site as well as the lack of additional recoverable data, the

site was considered ineligible for listing in the NRHP or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark.

A Stagecoach Road in Northeastern Texas
The location first drew the attention of the Atlanta
District office when they proposed a bridge replacement
located near the town of Marshall in Harrison County. The
District decided to recommend a temporary easement on
the south side of the road to avoid impacting the SloanHaynes Plantation house, built in 1866 and located on the
north side of the existing roadway (Figure 5). During a field
inspection, TxDOT archeologist, Waldo Troell, observed
an abandoned and very deep road cut through the terrace
overlooking Lawrence Creek. He also noted that the plantation house did not face the current SH 154 roadway, but did
face the alignment of the abandoned roadbed (41HS938).
Geo-Marine, Inc. completed the survey tasks and recorded
the site once access to the area was available.
Waldo found, through archival research, that the abandoned roadbed was the Marshall-Coffeeville Road. From
the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, primarily during the period of westward expansion, cotton plantations, and the Civil
War, this Road served as a supply route for a number of
communities in the area. Before railroads influenced travel
and economics in this area, these communities, including
Marshall, Gilmer, Coffeeville, Ore City, and Jefferson,
benefited from the movement of people and goods along
this route. These communities comprise some of the older
settlements (1840s to 1850s) in East Texas. Information
regarding the roadway and its importance to the area can
be found in The Handbook of Texas articles that describe
the significance of these communities.
Review of several historic maps led to identification
of the Road, which served as a trade loop through the

Figure 6. Stephen F. Austin map from 1829.

area. Although the old Marshall-Coffeeville Road dates to
at least the mid-19th Century antebellum (pre-Civil War)
period, the route could date back to a Caddo, Cherokee, and
Shawnee Trace. The 1829 S. F. Austin map shows a Trace
from the Cherokee villages on Cherokee Lake/Bayou to
the Shawnee Villages on the Red River (Jonesboro) to Fort
Towson in Oklahoma (Figure 6). The Trace travels northwest of present-day Marshall, crossing a tributary of Little
Cypress Creek that could be the Lawrence Creek in this
area. The 1858 Pressler map indicates a crossing in the same
approximate location, leading to Gilmer and Coffeeville.
Based on the information acquired from the archival
review and fieldwork, the Atlanta District made adjustments
to the proposed alignment of the construction easement.
These changes resulted in avoidance of the historic road.

Conclusion
We intend to provide updates on ongoing projects
and reports on new work in future newsletters. We will
also be exploring additional methods for interacting with
people interested in our work. Cultural resource laws
require TxDOT to give due consideration to sites with
data important to understanding prehistory and history,
but input from the broader community will help to focus
those efforts more appropriately. We want to know what
you find interesting and how we can better address those
interests. If you have thoughts to share on those topics,

Horn Shelter
www.texasbeyondhistory.net/horn/index

This remarkably well-stratified site above the Brazos
River holds many stories, including that of a group some
11,000 years ago who buried two of their people, a man and
child, in a double grave in the shelter. With them were placed
an array of special funeral offerings, no doubt signifying the
high regard in which the man was held. Evidence of who
these people were, and their possible connections to other
groups of the time, is detailed in this seven-section exhibit.
Another critical story is the decades-long effort of avocational
archeologists Albert Redder and Frank Watt to systematically
excavate and document this significant site. The two men
dug through nearly 20 feet of deposits, uncovering the fire
hearths and trash left behind by a succession of campers from
Early Paleoindian to more modern times. The interactive
section, “Reading the Layers,” allows viewers to explore
the shelter’s complex stratigraphy and learn about some
of the site’s most significant artifacts and features. Created
in collaboration with the Bosque Museum of Clifton, the
Horn Shelter exhibit was made possible through donations
from the Texas Archeological Society, Friends of TARL, the
Council of Texas Archeologists, and the William P. Clements
Foundation.

Landis Project
www.texasbeyondhistory.net/landis/index
This seven section exhibit by Michael Quigg focuses
on two sites investigated by TRC Environmental Corporation at the edge of the Canadian Breaks of the Texas
Panhandle: the Late Archaic Pipeline site and Protohistoric
Corral site. Only a handful of sites from these time periods
have been intensively excavated in the region, and for that
reason, findings from a suite of technical analyses conducted are all the more important. Of particular significance
is the discovery of wildrye grass starch grains on ground
stone tools and burned rocks, one of the few instances in
which plant seed processing and cooking in a prehistoric
open campsite has been traced; INAA analysis identifying sources of Tecovas Jasper and Alibates Flint used by
toolmakers; and use-wear analysis showing unusual hafting
patterns on bifacial tools. Intensive geoarcheological investigations, also uncommon for the Panhandle, revealed a
complex alluvial history along West Amarillo Creek as well
as a suite of data with which to reconstruct the regional and
local paleoenvironment. In addition to public archeology
open houses conducted at the site, this online exhibit was
sponsored by the Bureau of Land Management as a public
education outreach effort.

Investigations during the Landis Project uncovered a wealth
of dietary and subsistence information at Late Archaic and
Protohistoric sites in the Texas Panhandle.

TAM 2010 is a Big Success
María de la Luz Martínez, Texas Archeology Month Coordinator, Texas Historical Commission

Thousands Flock to Texas Archeology
Month Events
More than 47,000 people in 70 cities and 60 counties across
Texas participated in Texas Archeology Month (TAM) events
and related activities during this year’s celebration in October.
The attendance number (47,253) was reported by TAM hosts
who responded to a survey administered in November by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC).
Despite a few last-minute cancellations due to unforeseen
problems and postponements by groups who moved their
archeology salutes to the spring, the 2010 attendance figure is
much higher than numbers reported in 2009 (24,487) and 2008
(31,842). In addition, a number of TAM hosts did not respond
to the survey, leaving the attendance at a number of TAM
activities and exhibits that appeared in the 2010 TAM Calendar
unaccounted for in this year’s tally.
According to the survey, about half (52.6 percent) of the
respondents hosted and/or sponsored a TAM event without a
partner; 35.4 percent of the events were hosted by two or three
groups; and the rest were hosted by more than three groups. One
group listed more than 12 hosts or cosponsors and three listed
six, showing the level of community involvement required to
organize some of these events.
Rolando Garza, who serves as the integrated resource
manager at the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park
in Brownsville, wrote, “This event (the Fourth Annual International Rio Grande Delta Archeology Fair) is cosponsored
by the Historic Brownsville Museum and Palo Alto Battlefield
National Historical Park. We have up to a dozen archeologists,
museums, and other entities from South Texas and northeastern
Mexico that participate in the event by providing displays and
demonstrations designed to enlighten the visitor about the science of archeology, regional archeological resources, and the
need for resource preservation.”
THC Archeology Division (AD) Director Jim Bruseth and
former THC Development Officer Toni Turner, who retired
recently, were among the presenters at this year’s International
Rio Grande Delta Archeology Fair. Bruseth and Turner organized a display on the archeological investigations of the Belle
shipwreck. Other THC staff members, AD archeologists, and
members of the THC Texas Archeological Stewardship Network
also participated in this year’s TAM observance by organizing
events, giving presentations, consulting with event hosts, and
providing hands-on assistance on the day of the event.
TAM 2010 included diverse events in a number of categories

such as lectures, speakers, presentations, or workshops (44.7
percent); archeology fairs, festivals, or thematic events (35.5
percent); special TAM-related displays (22.3 percent); special
activities such as mock digs (22.3 percent); daylong or weeklong
archeology celebrations (21 percent); permanent exhibits (13.1
percent); open-house events (3.9 percent); and conferences or
annual meetings (1.3 percent). This particular survey question,
which allowed respondents to select more than one category,
provided an open-ended portion that gave interesting insights.
Activities listed here included school tours at various venues,
presentations at schools, archeology site tours, cemetery
walking tours, extended museum hours, and the premiere of
a film on Alibates flint. The event diversity in the TAM 2010
Calendar provided irresistible choices for some families and
individuals—the Houston Museum of Natural Science, for
instance, reported a San Antonio-to-Houston trek by attendees
interested in an evening lecture on Blackbeard’s flagship.
This year, slightly more than one third of the TAM events
lasted less than a day (36.4 percent), 29.7 percent were full-day
events; and 28.3 percent consisted of all-month celebrations.
The remainder of the respondents reported events that took
place over a number of days (for instance, several days across
one week, one weekend, or a full week).
The majority (92 percent) of the respondents indicated they
would sponsor a TAM event next year.
“Having a statewide archeology month (celebration) is a
wonderful idea,” said one respondent. “We know we can visit
other counties, hear and see wonderful speakers, and attend great
events. If only we had time to attend them all!”
TAM is coordinated by the THC in association with the
Texas Archeological Society, the Council of Texas Archeologists, and numerous groups and organizations across the state.

Texas Hisorical Foundation Awards Two Archeology Grants
Continuing its record of supporting archeology in the
Lone Star State, the Texas Historical Foundation approved
two archeology grants during the last quarter. The Friends
of the Texas Historical Commission and the Community
Archaeology Research Institute will both receive funds
from THF’s Joseph Ballard Archeological Endowment.
The Friends of the Texas Historical Commission will
use THF funds for expenses associated with the archeological investigation, excavation, and artifact conservation at
the Bernardo Plantation in Waller County, considered the
first antebellum-style plantation in the state. Archeological
work supported by the THF grant will focus on studying
the area where the plantation’s main house was located and
on discovering more about the lives of the enslaved workers in order to gain further knowledge of the early history
of African Americans in Texas.

CARI was given assistance to help write a “Historic
Context Document” for archeologists to use when con­
ducting African American archeology projects in Texas.
The funds will be used for the professional fees of
researchers who will collect and gather the data needed to
develop a historical framework for archeologists studying
African American sites.
Since 1954, the Texas Historical Foundation has
funded preservation and education projects around the state
and helps promote the cultural legacy of Texas. Among
the group’s main efforts is its award-winning HERITAGE
magazine and a preservation grants program. For more

If Comanche history and culture are of interest to
you, I highly recommend this non-fiction book: Empire
of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and
Fall of the Comanches, the most Powerful Indian Tribe in
American History by S. C. Gwynne, 2010, Schribner, New
York ($27.50 hardback). This is one of the most fascinating
books that I have read about the Comanche and their war
with the Texas Rangers and the U.S. Army. The history of
the Texas frontier at the time was very well researched by
the author, and the reader is entertained by the character
development of some of the central figures, stuff that you
will never get from biased history books.
It is a very balanced account of the conflict between
two cultures. The author begins with the raid on Parker’s
Fort in Limestone County and the capture of Cynthia
Ann Parker. He provides an excellent background of the
Comanche and their culture, their raids, the Anglo expansion into central Texas, the Texas Rangers, and U. S. Army
