ABSTRACT

This report describes the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), for the proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail
Gap Project in Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas. The project is being sponsored by the
City of Round Rock, and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is providing funding
for the project (TxDOT CSJ No. 0914-05-161). The proposed project would involve constructing
2 separate linear segments of nature trail to connect other existing segments of a trail system
located along Brushy Creek and its tributaries, measuring a total linear distance of
3.3 kilometers (km) (2.1 miles [mi]), all of which would involve construction within proposed new
rights-of-way (ROWs). Segment A measures 1,942 meters (m) (6,370 feet [ft]) in length within a
proposed 15-m- (50-ft-) wide ROW, and covers an area of 3.1 hectares (ha) (7.7 acres [ac]).
Segment B measures 1,038 m (3,405 ft) in length within a ROW that ranges from 15 to 30 m
(50 to 100 ft) in width, and covers an area of 2.0 ha (4.9 ac). In addition, a short eastward
extension of Segment A, designated herein as Segment A Extension, was added to the APE
after initial survey activities were completed as a potential alternate to using the proposed
Segment B alignment. The Segment A Extension measures 355 m (1,164 ft) in length by 15 m
(50 ft) in width, and covers an area of 0.5 ha (1.3 ac). Originally, a third proposed trail segment
located west of Segment A was included in the project design; however, this segment is no
longer proposed for development and has been removed from the project by the City of Round
Rock.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were recorded within either the Segment A
or Segment A Extension ROWs on the north side of Brushy Creek. Within the proposed ROW
of Segment B, Horizon investigated 2 new aboriginal archeological sites (41WM1270 and
41WM1271) as well as a portion of 1 previously recorded aboriginal archeological site
(41WM1028). All 3 sites are aboriginal campsites located on the southern bank, terraces, and
adjacent uplands of Brushy Creek on land owned by the City of Round Rock.
Cultural materials observed on these 3 aboriginal sites during the initial 100% intensive
archeological survey of the proposed project’s APE were not collected; rather, they were
described and photo-documented in the field and replaced where they were found. Cultural
materials encountered during subsequent supplemental survey activities, which included
backhoe trenching on 2 of the 3 sites and excavation of hand-excavated 50-by-50-centimeter
(cm) and 50-by-100-cm test units on all 3 sites, were collected and transported to Horizon’s

laboratory facilities for cleaning, sorting, and quantification. Cultural materials collected during
the supplemental survey investigations included lithic debitage, formal and expedient chipped
stone tools, faunal bone, a bone or shell bead, and 1 cranial fragment recovered from a
disturbed context on site 41WM1271 that was subsequently determined to be human. Initially,
the human cranial fragment was collected because it was not identified as human until after
fieldwork was completed. The human cranial fragment was later reburied at the location in
which it was found on site 41WM1271.
Per an agreement with TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission (THC), due to the
redundant nature of the archeological collections resulting from supplemental investigations on
sites 41WM1028, 41WM1270, and 41WM1271, which consist predominantly of lithic debitage,
the archeological collections resulting from the supplemental survey investigations will not be
permanently curated.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Project Description
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), was selected by BWM Group, L.P.
(BWM), on behalf of the City of Round Rock, to conduct an intensive archeological inventory
and assessment for the proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project in Round Rock,
Williamson County, Texas (TxDOT CSJ No. 0914-05-161). The proposed project would involve
constructing 2 separate linear segments of nature trail to connect other existing segments of a
trail system located along Brushy Creek and its tributaries. Segment A is situated on the
terraces of Brushy Creek on the northern bank of the creek, extending from A.W. Grimes
Boulevard eastward to the future right-of-way (ROW) of Arterial A, which is currently under
construction. Segment A measures 1,942 m (6,370 ft) in length within a proposed 15-m- (50-ft-)
wide ROW, and covers an area of 3.1 hectares (ha) (7.7 acres [ac]). Segment B is situated on
the southern bank of Brushy Creek, extending from the future ROW of Arterial A eastward to a
point just north of Vinwood Cove. Segment B measures 1,038 m (3,405 ft) in length within a
ROW that ranges from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) in width, and covers an area of 2.0 ha (4.9 ac).
In addition, a short eastward extension of Segment A, designated herein as Segment A
Extension, was added to the APE after initial survey activities were completed as a potential
alternate to using the proposed Segment B alignment. The Segment A Extension measures
355 m (1,164 ft) in length by 15 m (50 ft) in width, and covers an area of 0.5 ha (1.3 ac). The
proposed Segments A and B ROW segments, together with the proposed Segment A Extension
ROW, collectively measure 3,335 m (10,939 ft) in length, or 3.3 kilometers (km) (2.1 miles [mi]),
and cover an area of approximately 5.6 ha (13.9 ac). Segment A is located on the north side of
Brushy Creek extending to the east and west of the confluence of Brushy and Lake creeks. The
primary proposed ROW of Segment A is located on privately owned land, and the proposed
Segment A Extension ROW is on land owned by the City of Round Rock. Segment B is located
on the south side of Brushy Creek east of its confluence with Dyer Branch on land owned by the
City of Round Rock. Originally, a third proposed trail segment located west of Segment A was
included in the project design; however, this segment is no longer proposed for development
and has been removed from the project by the City of Round Rock.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed project would consist of the
2 segments of proposed nature trail ROWs plus the proposed Segment A Extension ROW,

Management Summary

measuring a total linear distance of 3.3 km (2.1 mi), all of which would involve construction
within proposed new ROWs. The actual proposed trail construction footprint would measure
only approximately 2 m (8 ft) in width; however, the proposed survey area was wider to provide
a buffer to evaluate possible trail reroutes, as necessary. While typical sections and design
profiles were not available at the time of the investigations and reporting, construction of the
proposed nature trail would involve clearing the proposed ROWs of vegetation, possibly some
minimal grading to level the land surface, and constructing the trail. Some segments of the trail
would be constructed by pouring concrete into wood-framed forms. Other segments would
consist of crushed granite pavement, constructed by depositing a thin layer of loose crushed
granite on the modern ground surface. The maximum depth of impacts across the majority of
the APE is anticipated to measure no more than 0.3 to 0.9 m (1.0 to 3.0 ft) below surface. The
current proposed undertaking would also involve construction of a small bridge across a
prominent erosional gully located near the western end of the proposed Segment B ROW.
Typical sections and design profiles for this bridge were not available at the time of investigation
and reporting, but limited areas of deeper impacts within the proposed bridge construction
footprint are expected where shafts for bridge columns may be sunk to depths in excess of 6 m
(20 ft). Following construction, all non-paved and non-graveled areas adjacent to the proposed
trail footprints would be reseeded with vegetation.
Regulatory Background
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Round Rock, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, and some of the land on which the proposed trail segments
would be constructed is owned by the City of Round Rock; as such, the project would fall under
the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the project would be funded by the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), a subdivision of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA); as such, the project would also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Also, the City of Round
Rock may need to apply to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for a Section 404 permit
under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to construct the proposed project facilities adjacent to Brushy
Creek and its tributaries. As the project represents a public undertaking with the potential to
impact significant cultural resources, the City of Round Rock was required to provide for a
cultural resources inventory of the project’s APE to assess the project’s possible impacts on any
cultural resources in the APE.
To meet the City of Round Rock’s responsibilities under state and federal statutes, BWM
contracted with Horizon to secure applicable clearances for archeological resources. Horizon
performed an initial 100% intensive archeological survey of the APE between April 23 and 25,
2012.
Jennifer Cochran served as project archeologist, Jared Wiersema served as
archeological field technician, and Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal Investigator. In
connection with the initial intensive archeological survey of the proposed Brushy Creek Regional
Trail Gap Project, approximately 4 man-hours were expended during the process of scoping the
project, coordinating with regulatory agencies, and obtaining a Texas Antiquities Permit, and
approximately 40 man-hours were expended during the archeological survey fieldwork. The
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6234.

Field Methods
During the initial archeological survey, Horizon recorded 2 new aboriginal archeological
sites (41WM1270 and 41WM1271) as well as a portion of 1 previously recorded aboriginal
archeological site (41WM1028) within the proposed ROW of Segment B. Based on the results
of the initial survey, all 3 sites appeared to possess potential for moderately deep to deep
archeological deposits; cultural features; and/or preserved, datable organic remains. As the
originally proposed Segment B ROW would pass within the documented site boundaries of all
3 sites and the sites appeared to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs),
Horizon initiated informal consultation with the City of Round Rock, TxDOT, and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) to discuss possible requirements for additional investigations.
Based on these consultative discussions, the City of Round Rock, with the approval of TxDOT
and the THC, tasked Horizon with conducting additional intensive survey-level investigations on
the 3 sites, including backhoe trenching and excavation of hand-excavated test units to more
fully evaluate the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the 3 sites. TxDOT and the THC classified these
additional investigations as supplemental intensive survey activities rather than as NRHP/SAL
eligibility testing.
Horizon performed the additional intensive survey activities on sites 41WM1028,
41WM1270, and 41WM1271 between May 14 and 18, 2012. Jennifer Cochran served as
project archeologist; Shana Dooley, Rosemarie Pavel, Briana Nicole Smith, and Jared
Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal
Investigator. During this effort, 264 man-hours were expended during archeological fieldwork,
112 man-hours were expended by laboratory personnel after completion of fieldwork processing
field data; and 104 man-hours were expended compiling this technical report summarizing the
findings of the survey.
Horizon excavated a total of 92 shovel tests during the survey, including 22 in
Segment A, 6 in the Segment A Extension, and 64 in Segment B. Of the 64 shovel tests
excavated in Segment B, 30 shovel tests were excavated in non-site areas during the survey
and 34 shovel tests were excavated on archeological sites. Thus, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) were exceeded for each individual segment of the
APE as well as for the project area as a whole. Furthermore, the TSMASS require a minimum
of 6 shovel tests to define the boundaries of archeological sites. Horizon excavated 6 shovel
tests on site 41WM1028, 11 shovel tests on site 41WM1270, and 17 shovel tests on site
41WM1271, as well as a combination of backhoe trenches and hand-excavated test units,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for site definition.
During the supplemental survey investigations, Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe
trenches, including 3 on site 41WM1028 and 3 on site 41WM1271. Extremely dense vegetation
precluded excavating backhoe trenches on site 41WM1270 as well as more extensive trenching
on site 41WM1271. The goal of backhoe trenching was to obtain information about the extent
and depth of archeological deposits and to aid in identifying productive locations for handexcavated test units. Horizon excavated three 50-by-50-cm test units on site 41WM1028, six
50-by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1270, and four 50-by-100-cm test units on site

Management Summary

41WM1271. Horizon excavated 0.675 m3 of sediment on site 41WM1028, 1.500 m3 on site
41WM1270, and 2.250 m3 on site 41WM1271, for a total of 4.425 m3 of sediment across the
3 sites.
Results
No cultural materials, historic or prehistoric, were observed on the modern ground
surface or in any of the excavated shovel tests in Segment A or the Segment A Extension
ROWs. Archival research conducted prior to the initiation of field activities revealed that the
proposed Segment A ROW passed near the mapped boundaries of 3 previously recorded
archeological sites (41WM12, 41WM467, and 41WM468). No evidence of these sites was
observed within the APE. Furthermore, the vast majority, if not all, of the combined Segment A
and Segment A Extension ROWs were previously surveyed for cultural resources. No cultural
resources were recorded within the APE during either of these 2 previous surveys.
Horizon recorded 2 new aboriginal archeological sites (41WM1270 and 41WM1271) as
well as a portion of 1 previously recorded aboriginal archeological site (41WM1028) within the
Segment B ROW. Site 41WM1028 is located primarily within the existing ROW of Arterial A and
was previously investigated by Frontera Archeology (Iruegas and Tate 2002) and SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) (Lawrence 2007; Lawrence et al. 2009) during previous
cultural resources surveys. SWCA conducted NRHP and SAL eligibility testing on the portion of
site 41WM1028 located within the Arterial A ROW and concluded that that portion of the site
was ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL (Lawrence et al. 2009).
The portion of the site investigated by SWCA has since been destroyed by land clearing and
cutting activities associated with construction of Arterial A, which were underway during
Horizon’s survey. A small portion of site 41WM1028, located along the northeastern boundary
of the overall mapped area of the site, falls within the proposed Segment B ROW.
Sites 41WM1270 and 41WM1271 represent previously unrecorded aboriginal campsites.
Technically, these 2 sites fall within the northern margin of a previously recorded site,
41WM780, the boundaries of which were expanded northwards during a previous cultural
resources survey conducted by Frontera to incorporate aboriginal archeological deposits
located on the terraces of Brushy Creek (Iruegas and Tate 2002). However, Horizon decided to
record sites 41WM1270 and 41WM1271 as separate sites based on a number of differences
between the aboriginal archeological deposits on the Brushy Creek terraces and the
predominantly historic-age cultural manifestations associated with site 41WM780.
Site 41WM1028
Site 41WM1028 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on a high
terrace on the south side of Brushy Creek. This site was originally recorded in 2002 by Frontera
during a cultural resource survey performed for an earlier phase of the current trail project
(Iruegas and Tate 2002). At that time, only a small portion of the site that fell within the project’s
anticipated ROW, measuring approximately 45 by 28 m in size, was investigated.
Subsequently, SWCA conducted additional survey activities on the site during a cultural
resource survey performed in association with the proposed construction of Arterial A, a north-

to-south-oriented roadway that forms the western boundary of the proposed Segment B ROW.
SWCA expanded the site boundaries to measure approximately 160 m north to south by 37 m
east to west within the proposed Arterial A ROW. SWCA conducted archeological significance
testing on the portion of the site located within the Arterial A ROW and concluded that the
investigated portion of the site was ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL based on the overall lack of integrity and extent of prior disturbances. No further
investigations were recommended on the portion of the site located in the Arterial A ROW, and
the Arterial A ROW has since been cleared and cut, and the Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek
was under construction at the time of Horizon’s survey activities.
Horizon investigated a small portion of site 41WM1028, measuring approximately 45 m
north to south by 60 m east to west, that falls within the western end of the proposed Segment B
ROW. Archeological deposits across most of the area investigated by Horizon were relatively
shallow, measuring only 10 to 50 cm in depth, and were found to be associated with a disturbed
plowzone overlying relatively shallow chalky bedrock in most places. Along the western margin
of the proposed Segment B ROW, along an exposed road cut that marks the eastern edge of
the Arterial A ROW, archeological deposits were found to be somewhat deeper, extending to
depths ranging from 70 to 90 centimeters below surface (cmbs). In this portion of the site, a
thin, apparently intact cultural horizon measuring approximately 35 cm in thickness was
identified underneath a 30-cm thick disturbed plowzone. However, the portion of the site
containing potentially intact archeological deposits covers a very small area, apparently
measuring no more than about 10 m east to west by 30 m north to south. Across the rest of the
investigated site area, cultural materials were largely restricted to the surficial plowzone, which
was immediately underlain by culturally sterile sediments and bedrock.
Cultural materials recovered from the site consisted of high densities of lithic debitage,
moderate quantities of burned rocks, 3 small fragments of faunal bone, and a small assemblage
of formal chipped stone tools and expedient tools manufactured from chert flakes. Burned rocks
were relatively abundant throughout the profile, but none of the burned rocks exhibited any
clustering or spatial clustering suggestive of cultural features, and no intact cultural features
were recorded on the investigated portion of the site. Three temporally diagnostic projectile
point fragments indicative of Early to Late Archaic occupations were recovered from Horizon’s
excavations, and diagnostic artifacts associated with Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations were documented during SWCA’s prior test excavations on the portion of the site
located within the Arterial A ROW.
While site 41WM1028 contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative
of generalized campsite occupations extending from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
periods, only a very small area of the portion of the site that falls within the current project’s APE
retains intact archeological deposits. Organic preservation on the site appears to be poor, as
evidenced by the recovery of only 3 small faunal bone fragments and the lack of charcoal
samples. Based on the overall lack of integrity of archeological deposits and the extent of prior
disturbances on the portion of the site located within the current project’s APE, the site does not
appear to possess significant research potential regarding the prehistoric past under Criterion D
of the NRHP. No historic-age cultural manifestations are present on the site that would warrant

evaluating site significance under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The portion of the site
located within the proposed Segment B ROW is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and no further investigations are recommended in
connection with the proposed undertaking. In the event that any future endeavors would have
the potential to impact uninvestigated portions of the site beyond the APE of the current project
to the north along the edge of the terrace overlooking Brushy Creek, additional investigations
would be warranted to determine if any intact archeological deposits that meet the criteria of
significance may be present in that area.
Site 41WM1270
Site 41WM1270 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on a
prominent ridge finger and surrounding terraces on the south side of Brushy Creek. As
delineated during Horizon’s investigations, the site measures approximately 100 m east to west
by 30 m north to south within the proposed Segment B ROW. The site may extend beyond the
current project’s APE northwards as far as the bank of Brushy Creek, but dense vegetation
precluded assessing this portion of the site. The southern boundary is marked by a developed
residential lot and the western boundary is defined by a deep, wide erosional gully that
separates this site from site 41WM1028 to the west. The eastern site boundary was defined
based on the extent of positive and negative shovel tests. The aboriginal occupation on the site
appears to be largely constrained to the top of a prominent caliche ridge, a large portion of
which has been extensively damaged via recent looting activities, located near the western end
of the site. The eastern portion of the site has been disturbed via construction of an existing
sewer line ROW and an access road that has been cut down to chalky limestone bedrock.
The primary locus of aboriginal habitation on the site appears to have been the top of the
triangular ridge finger located near the western end of the site that has been extensively
damaged via recent looting activities.
An exposed cutbank profile located along the
southeastern edge of the looted area suggests that as much as 50 to 60 cm of archeological
deposits may have been impacted by looters. This portion of the site may have once contained
the deepest archeological deposits on the site, though this area has been completely destroyed
by looting. Shovel tests and test units excavated farther up this upland landform to the
southeast revealed between 20 and 60 cm of archeological deposits associated with shallow,
dark brown silty loam sediment that immediately overlies chalky limestone bedrock. Shovel
testing across the remainder of the site to the east revealed even shallower archeological
deposits ranging from 20 to 40 cm in depth,
While site 41WM1270 contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative
of generalized campsite occupations dating to the Middle to Late Archaic periods based on the
presence of 2 temporally diagnostic projectile points, archeological deposits on the site are
relatively shallow and have been extensively disturbed via recent looting and construction of a
subsurface sewer line and access road cut. While archeological deposits in the less-disturbed
western portion of the site appear to be largely intact aside from some degree of bioturbation
and erosion, no intact cultural features were observed, organic preservation appears to be poor,
and the assemblage of cultural materials is rather redundant across the investigated site area.

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

Based on the overall lack of integrity and shallow depth of archeological deposits, the portion of
the site located in the current project’s APE does not appear to possess significant research
potential regarding the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP. No historic-age cultural
manifestations are present on the site that would warrant evaluating site significance under
Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The portion of the site located within the proposed Segment B
ROW is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL,
and no further investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.
Site 41WM1271
Site 41WM1271 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on the
southern terraces of Brushy Creek. As delineated during Horizon’s investigations, the site
measures approximately 120 m east to west by 30 to 40 m north to south and appears to be
associated primarily with the upper terrace of the creek. The site may extend beyond the
current project’s APE northwards as far as the bank of Brushy Creek, though the site is believed
to be constrained primarily to the upper terrace above the creek. The eastern boundary of the
site could not be systematically investigated due to dense vegetation and is therefore somewhat
arbitrary. The southern boundary is marked by the toeslope of the adjacent uplands and an
access road that has been cut adjacent to an existing sewer line.
The primary locus of aboriginal habitation on the site appears to have occurred in the
central portion of the site that has been demarcated as the grayed-out “Avoidance Area” on
Figure 47. Prior construction-related activities on the site were observed associated with the
access road and sewer pipeline along the southern site boundary, 2 old overgrown road cuts
that traverse the site, a box culvert in the southeastern corner of the site, and installation of a
line of silt fencing about 20 m north of the access road. These prior construction activities have
disturbed as much as 50% of the investigated portion of the site, and surficial disturbances
extending to depths of 30 to 50 cm were observed in all subsurface probes, including backhoe
trenches and test units, excavated on the site. While archeological deposits across most of the
investigated site area extend only 5 to 30 cmbs, deeper archeological deposits extending to
depths of up to 120 cmbs were observed in scattered areas in the center of the site. Admittedly,
some of this apparent depth of archeological deposits may be artificially inflated by redeposition
of sediments from the various prior construction efforts that have occurred on the site, but there
do appear to be isolated areas of the site that contain deeper archeological deposits.
The central portion of the site, in which the deepest archeological deposits were
detected, contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative of generalized
campsite occupations dating to the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods based on
2 temporally diagnostic projectile points and 1 accelerated mass spectrometer (AMS)
radiocarbon date that falls within the latter half of the Late Prehistoric period. While abundant
lithic debitage and burned rocks were recovered from test excavations in the central area of the
site, no intact cultural features were identified. However, 2 of the test units (TUs 3 and 4)
contain markedly higher densities of cultural materials, including large quantities of lithic
debitage, burned rocks, and faunal bone, than other investigated areas of the site, and these
2 test units may contain the remnants of mixed prehistoric trash midden deposits. Faunal bone

Management Summary

preservation appears to be excellent in at least some portions of the central area of the site.
Finally, 1 human cranial fragment was found in a disturbed context at the bottom of a looter pit
on the site. While this human bone fragment was found in an unprovenienced context
associated with looter activity, its presence indicates the possibility that human burials or other
disarticulated human remains may occur on the site.
Most of the documented site area has been disturbed by a variety of prior construction
and earth-moving activities and contains only shallow archeological deposits, primarily located
around the periphery of the investigated site area. These shallow, disturbed portions of the site
do not appear to possess significant research potential regarding the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP and are recommended as noncontributing elements to the overall
eligibility of the site, and no historic-age cultural resources were observed on the site that would
warrant evaluating site significance under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The central portion
of the site does contain isolated areas in which intact, deeply buried archeological deposits
appear to be present. This portion of the site may possess the potential to contribute
meaningful information about the prehistoric past, though it was not possible to obtain sufficient
data at the level of investigations allowed under intensive survey to fully assess the eligibility of
this portion of the site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
As a clear determination of eligibility could not be made for the central portion of the site
that appears to contain deeper, intact archeological deposits, Horizon recommended to the City
of Round Rock that the site be avoided. The original proposed trail ROW would traverse this
central portion of the site, however, in the interest of avoiding impacts to the site, the City of
Round Rock rerouted this segment of the proposed trail ROW to run within the previously
disturbed existing ROW of an access road and existing sewer line ROW that had been cut into
the distal edge of the uplands immediately south of the terraces that contain the archeological
deposits. This proposed reroute would pass just south of the southern boundary of site
41WM1271. As such, site 41WM1271 would be almost entirely avoided, including the central
portion of the site in which the deeper archeological deposits occur. The proposed rerouted trail
ROW would pass within the site boundaries only in the site’s southwestern corner, where only
surficial, disturbed archeological resources were observed. Archeological deposits in this small
southwestern corner of the site are recommended as noncontributing to the overall eligibility of
the site. As such, the proposed undertaking would not adversely affect any portion of the site
that has the highest potential for intact archeological deposits. Furthermore, the archeological
data set resulting from Horizon’s investigations on site 41WM1271 was relatively redundant
across the site, suggesting that further investigations within the already investigated portion of
the site likely would not yield a qualitatively different set of archeological data than has already
been gathered. As such, no further investigations are recommended on site 41WM1271 in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
Curation
Per an agreement with TxDOT and the THC, due to the redundant nature of the
archeological collections resulting from supplemental investigations on sites 41WM1028,
41WM1270, and 41WM1271, which consist predominantly of lithic debitage, the archeological

collections resulting from the supplemental survey investigations will not be permanently
curated.
The single human cranial fragment found in a disturbed context associated with a looter
pit on site 41WM1271 was initially collected because it was not identified as human until after
fieldwork was completed. The human cranial fragment was later reburied at the location in
which it was found on site 41WM1271.
Summary and Recommendations
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, sites
41WM1028 and 41WM1270 are recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs. The central portion of site 41WM1271 appears to contain intact aboriginal
archeological deposits that are recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL; however, the surrounding portions of site 41WM1271
contain only shallow, disturbed archeological deposits that are recommended as
noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the site.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify archeological historic properties within the APE. No archeological resources were
identified on 2 of the 3 sites investigated during this survey (41WM1028 and 41WM1270) that
meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs
according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, and no further archeological work is
recommended on these 2 sites in connection with the proposed undertaking. Archeological
resources were identified in the central portion of 1 of the 3 sites investigated during this survey
(41WM1271) that are recommended as being of unknown eligibility for listing on the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4 and for designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26. The City of
Round Rock has rerouted a segment of proposed nature trail that was originally designed to
pass through the central portion of site 41WM1271 that contains the intact archeological
deposits to run within an existing road cut associated with an existing sewer line ROW that runs
just south of the southern boundary of this site. As currently designed, the proposed rerouted
trail ROW would be constructed within a previously disturbed road cut associated with an
existing sewer line and would avoid impacts to archeological resources of unknown NRHP and
SAL eligibility on site 41WM1271. No further investigations are recommended on this site in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
Archeological clearance is recommended for the proposed undertaking as currently
designed. In the event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas or areas recommended for clearance, all work should cease
immediately and TxDOT and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), was selected by BWM Group, L.P.
(BWM), on behalf of the City of Round Rock, to conduct an intensive archeological inventory
and assessment for the proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project in Round Rock,
Williamson County, Texas (TxDOT CSJ No. 0914-05-161) (Figures 1 to 2). The proposed
project would involve constructing 2 separate linear segments of nature trail to connect other
existing segments of a trail system located along Brushy Creek and its tributaries. Segment A is
situated on the terraces of Brushy Creek on the northern bank of the creek, extending from A.W.
Grimes Boulevard eastward to the future right-of-way (ROW) of Arterial A, which is currently
under construction. Segment A measures 1,942 m (6,370 ft) in length within a proposed 15-m(50-ft-) wide ROW, and covers an area of 3.1 hectares (ha) (7.7 acres [ac]). Segment B is
situated on the southern bank of Brushy Creek, extending from the future ROW of Arterial A
eastward to a point just north of Vinwood Cove. Segment B measures 1,038 m (3,405 ft) in
length within a ROW that ranges from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) in width, and covers an area of
2.0 ha (4.9 ac). In addition, a short eastward extension of Segment A, designated herein as
Segment A Extension, was added to the APE after initial survey activities were completed as a
potential alternate to using the proposed Segment B alignment. The Segment A Extension
measures 355 m (1,164 ft) in length by 15 m (50 ft) in width, and covers an area of 0.5 ha
(1.3 ac). The proposed Segments A and B ROW segments, together with the proposed
Segment A Extension ROW,
collectively measure 3,335 m (10,939 ft) in length, or
3.3 kilometers (km) (2.1 miles [mi]), and cover an area of approximately 5.6 ha (13.9 ac).
Segment A is located on the north side of Brushy Creek extending to the east and west of the
confluence of Brushy and Lake creeks. The primary proposed ROW of Segment A is located on
privately owned land, and the proposed Segment A Extension ROW is on land owned by the
City of Round Rock. Segment B is located on the south side of Brushy Creek east of its
confluence with Dyer Branch on land owned by the City of Round Rock. Originally, a third
proposed trail segment located west of Segment A was included in the project design; however,
this segment is no longer proposed for development and has been removed from the project by
the City of Round Rock.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed project would consist of the
2 segments of proposed nature trail ROWs plus the proposed Segment A Extension ROW,
measuring a total linear distance of 3.3 km (2.1 mi), all of which would involve construction
within proposed new ROWs. The actual proposed trail construction footprint would measure

only approximately 2 m (8 ft) in width; however, the proposed ROWs are wider to provide room
to maneuver the trail around obstacles. While typical sections and design profiles were not
available at the time of the investigations and reporting, construction of the proposed nature trail
would involve clearing the proposed ROWs of vegetation, possibly some minimal grading to
level the land surface, and constructing the trail. Some segments of the trail would be
constructed by pouring concrete into wood-framed forms. Other segments would consist of
crushed granite pavement, constructed by depositing a thin layer of loose crushed granite on
the modern ground surface. The maximum depth of impacts across the majority of the APE is
anticipated to measure no more than 0.3 to 0.9 m (1.0 to 3.0 ft) below surface. The current
proposed undertaking would also involve construction of a small bridge across a prominent
erosional gully located near the western end of the proposed Segment B ROW. Typical
sections and design profiles for this bridge were not available at the time of investigation and
reporting, but limited areas of deeper impacts within the proposed bridge construction footprint
are expected where shafts for bridge columns may be sunk to depths in excess of 6 m (20 ft).
Following construction, all non-paved and non-graveled areas adjacent to the proposed trail
footprints would be reseeded with vegetation.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Round Rock, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, and some of the land on which the proposed trail segments
would be constructed is owned by the City of Round Rock; as such, the project would fall under
the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the project would be funded by the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), a subdivision of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA); as such, the project would also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Also, the City of Round
Rock may need to apply to the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for a Section 404 permit
under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to construct the proposed project facilities adjacent to Brushy
Creek and its tributaries. As the project represents a public undertaking with the potential to
impact significant cultural resources, the City of Round Rock was required to provide for a
cultural resources inventory of the project’s APE to assess the project’s possible impacts on any
cultural resources in the APE.
To meet the City of Round Rock’s responsibilities under state and federal statutes, BWM
contracted with Horizon to secure applicable clearances for archeological resources. Horizon
performed an initial 100% intensive archeological survey of the APE between April 23 and 25,
2012.
Jennifer Cochran served as project archeologist, Jared Wiersema served as
archeological field technician, and Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal Investigator. In
connection with the initial intensive archeological survey of the proposed Brushy Creek Regional
Trail Gap Project, approximately 4 man-hours were expended during the process of scoping the
project, coordinating with regulatory agencies, and obtaining a Texas Antiquities Permit, and
approximately 40 man-hours were expended during the archeological survey fieldwork.
During the initial archeological survey, Horizon recorded 2 new aboriginal archeological
sites (41WM1270 and 41WM1271) as well as a portion of 1 previously recorded aboriginal
archeological site (41WM1028) within the proposed ROW of Segment B. Based on the results
of the initial survey, all 3 sites appeared to possess potential for moderately deep to deep

Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

archeological deposits; cultural features; and/or preserved, datable organic remains. As the
proposed Segment B ROW would pass within the documented site boundaries of all 3 sites and
the sites appeared to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), Horizon initiated
informal consultation with the City of Round Rock, TxDOT, and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) to discuss possible requirements for additional investigations. Based on
these consultative discussions, the City of Round Rock, with the approval of TxDOT and the
THC, tasked Horizon with conducting additional intensive survey-level investigations on the
3 sites, including backhoe trenching and excavation of hand-excavated test units to more fully
evaluate the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the 3 sites. TxDOT and the THC classified these
additional investigations as supplemental intensive survey activities rather than as NRHP/SAL
eligibility testing.
Horizon performed the additional intensive survey activities on sites 41WM1028,
41WM1270, and 41WM1271 between May 14 and 18, 2012. Jennifer Cochran served as
project archeologist; Shana Dooley, Rosemarie Pavel, Briana Nicole Smith, and Jared
Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal
Investigator. During this effort, 264 man-hours were expended during archeological fieldwork,
112 man-hours were expended by laboratory personnel after completion of fieldwork processing
field data; and 104 man-hours were expended compiling this technical report summarizing the
findings of the survey. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6234.
This report presents the results of the archeological survey of the proposed Brushy
Creek Regional Trail Gap Project. Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in south-central Williamson County, Texas. Williamson
County is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn
1900; Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of 3 significant
physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland
Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a
narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in
northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams
flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated
with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands
composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In
places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by
a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms
of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230 to 400 m (754 to 1,312 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut Plain forms a
limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries, resulting in
landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad, shallow
valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora, whereas soil
is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and forests.
Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut
Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The segments
of proposed trail ROWs that compose the project area traverse the terraces and adjoining
uplands of Brushy Creek. Lake Creek flows northward and discharges into Brushy Creek
immediately south of Segment A, and Dyer Branch discharges into Brushy Creek just west of

HJN 080151 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Segment B. An intermittent erosional gully cuts through the proposed ROW of Segment B.
Brushy Creek flows generally northeastward to its confluence with the Little River in Milam
County, which in turn flows a short distance eastward and empties into the Brazos River. The
Brazos River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain,
ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.
The project area consists of 2 separate, linear segments of proposed trail ROWs,
designated as Segments A and B, plus a third alternate ROW segment, designated as
Segment A Extension, that are situated on alluvial terrace and upland formations adjacent to
Brushy Creek. The proposed trail segments parallel the course of the creek, and elevations
across the project area are relatively flat, averaging about 207 m (680 ft) above mean sea level.
Drainage within the APE is toward Brushy Creek, primarily via overland sheet flow.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Two geological formations underlie the approximately 3.3-km- (2.1-mi-) long APE of the
proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project (Barnes 1974). The floodplain and lower
terraces of Brushy Creek are mapped as consisting of Holocene-age alluvium (Qal) and the
upper terraces are mapped as Late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt). The surrounding
uplands are composed of Upper Cretaceous Austin Chalk (Kau). Specifically, the segments of
the APE traverse the terraces that overlook Brushy Creek and skirt the edges of the associated
uplands.
Geomorphologically, the various segments of the proposed project area traverse a
mosaic of Late Pleistocene and Holocene terrace environments and associated Upper
Cretaceous uplands (Figure 3; NRCS 2012). Segment A traverses 3 specific soil units—
Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex, rolling (ErE), which consists of residuum weathered from
limestone; Oakalla soils, frequently flooded (Of), which consists of loamy alluvium of Holocene
age; and gravel quarries (QU). A typical profile of the ErE soil unit consists of 28 centimeters
(cm) (11 inches [in]) of extremely stony clay underlain by bedrock; the Of soil unit consists of
deep deposits of silty clay loam extending to depths of at least 152 cm (60 in); and the QU soil
unit is characterized by disturbed gravel quarry pits. The Segment A Extension ROW is situated
on the Of soil unit. Segment B is characterized primarily by Eddy very gravelly clay loam, 3 to
8% slopes (EyD), which consists of residuum weathered from Austin Chalk. A typical profile of
the EyD soil unit consists of 15 cm (6 in) of very gravelly clay loam underlain by Austin Chalk
bedrock. Segment B dips downslope onto the Of soil unit towards its eastern end.
Approximately 75% of Segment A is situated on the Of soil unit, which is composed of
relatively deep deposits of Holocene-age silty clay loam. The western end of Segment A
traverses an old gravel quarry that has subsequently been filled in, and the eastern end of the
segment passes along the southern edge of a similar landform. Thus, the portions of
Segment A that are underlain by Late Pleistocene or Holocene-age silty clay loam alluvial
sediments would appear to possess at least moderate potential to contain intact archeological
deposits. Most of Segment B is situated along the distal edge of an upland landform composed
of Austin Chalk and gravely clay loam sediments derived from Austin Chalk. Based exclusively
on the geological data, this landform appears to lack potential to contain intact archeological

deposits at any depth. However, the eastern end of Segment B dips downslope onto the
terrace and floodplain area immediately below the edge of this upland ridge, which consists of
deep silty clay loam sediments similar to those that characterize Segment A. As such, the
eastern end of Segment B would appear to possess at least moderate potential to contain
intact, buried archeological deposits.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 in) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in) were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with

10

Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 080151 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in
Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the
big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base
composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified
tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in
the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater
diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle
Archaic subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these 3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as
well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic
subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the
Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is
often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation
probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

14

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa
Indians.1 The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the
prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to
a horse-based culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases
and by warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward
the early settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by
the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches
ranged through the western part of present Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions
were established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the
1860s. There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and
Mayeye Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that
would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed
through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was
called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th
century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern
border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively
explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land
grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement
resulted from these grants.

Much of the following discussion of Williamson County history derives from Makemson (1904),
Scarbrough (1973), and the Texas State Historical Association (TSHA 2012).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of
the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on 13 March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1,379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and
subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had
moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent
came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican
in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage
and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850
and 1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found
large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the
market was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county
ranches had more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the
number of sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis,
divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was

16

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas
Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the
secession convention, Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the
ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson
County was one of 19 counties to oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the
war came, most of the citizens of Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at
least 5 companies were raised in the county; an independent “spy” company under James O.
Rice, a company of Texas Rangers for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and
companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of
those who had opposed secession became active Confederate supporters, others remained
loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North, and a number enlisted in the Union army. In
July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught by Confederate troops while traveling to
Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and other Unionists were persecuted during the
war. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following the end
of the war, when several men were arrested for “flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of
Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of the citizens of Williamson County was held
on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the gathering set a general tone of
reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the Reconstruction period in Williamson
County, a period that ended with the return of county government to conservative Democratic
control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new communities, and the county seems to have
been free of much of the political and racial strife that occurred in other Texas counties during
Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the
latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and some of the more famous outlaws of the day,
such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed on the property of citizens, and long-term
family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons in the towns added to the toll of
homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a
major part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record
65,093 cattle. Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its
pre-war level by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then
declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920.
The industry revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds
of wool in 1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak
in 1959, when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom
industry in Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As

HJN 080151 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

early as 1869, the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton,
but do not, by any means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been
insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in
1890, and 80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than
any county in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost
tenfold from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of
cropland used for cotton production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of
77% in 1910, and cotton was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes
in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms,
or 77%, were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners,
and the percentage of owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still
further to 29% in 1930. Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with
the shift away from cotton and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the
county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad,
which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the
county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and
Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson
County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was
eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s
and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor
throughout the county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county
by 1930, and extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in
the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th
centuries. While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in
Williamson County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends,
and Austrians moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in
the county population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration
reached a significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county.
There were 294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930.
In 1980, 9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their
distinctive customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of
other denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran,
Catholic, and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally
diverse population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural;
only 29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year.
While cotton
production was near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already
undergoing a rapid transformation.

The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in
subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used
for cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers
increasingly turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter
20th century. Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a
significant role in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production
of eggs and chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing
from 37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in
population growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The archeological survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record archeological resources occurring within the designated project
area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the
National Park Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
State Historical Association’s (TSHA) Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a program of
intensive pedestrian survey. The assessment of significance, evaluation of NRHP and SAL
eligibility, and recommendations concerning the treatment options for the archeological
resources recorded during this project are presented in Chapter 5.0, Results of Investigations,
and Chapter 6.0, Summary and Recommendations. The rest of this chapter presents the
results of archival research, the methodological background for the current investigations, and
the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing information on the
THC’s online Atlas (THC 2012) and the NPS’s NRIS database (NPS 2012) for information on
previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, and historic properties as well as previous
archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area.
Based on this archival research, 26 previously recorded archeological sites, 2 cemeteries, and
1 historic structure listed on the NRHP occur within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the
proposed project’s APE (Figure 4; Table 1).

The 26 previously recorded archeological sites consist of a mix of aboriginal lithic
scatters and burned rock midden sites, 19th- and 20th-century historic-age farmsteads and
artifact scatters, and multiple-component sites containing both aboriginal lithic scatters and
historic-age farmstead components. Most of the aboriginal sites and components consist of
scatters of aboriginal lithic artifacts and/or burned rocks that have been dated only to
unspecified prehistoric timeframes, though temporally diagnostic artifacts dating to the Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic periods and the Late Prehistoric period have been observed on a few
sites. Eleven of the archeological sites consist of surficial scatters of artifacts in eroded contexts
that were recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs.
Three of the previously recorded archeological sites (41WM2, the “Merrell Site”; 41WM465,
“Kenney’s Fort”; and 41WM740, also known as the “Old Palm House”) have been designated as
SALs, and site 41WM465 has additionally been listed on the NRHP. The remaining
12 archeological sites are either of unknown NRHP and/or SAL eligibility or have not been fully
assessed for their eligibility.
Of the 26 previously recorded archeological sites, 20 sites are located well beyond the
proposed trail ROWs associated with the current project and would have no potential to be
affected by the proposed undertaking. The proposed trail ROWs associated with the current
project pass within the mapped boundaries of 2 of the 26 previously recorded archeological
sites, and the mapped boundaries of 4 additional sites are located in relatively close proximity to
the proposed project area. Specifically, Segment A and the Segment A Extension pass near
the mapped boundaries of sites 41WM12, 41WM467, and 41WM468. Segment B passes within

HJN 080151 AR

25

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

the mapped boundaries of sites 41WM780 and 41WM1028 and near the mapped boundaries of
site 41WM1029. Four of the previously recorded sites, 41WM464, 41WM465, 41WM467, and
41WM470, are located on the south side of Brushy Creek immediately across the creek from
Segment A; while these sites are close to Segment A in terms of geographic distance, Brushy
Creek forms a clear boundary between these 4 sites on the south side of the creek and
Segment A of the project area on the north side of the creek.
Two cemeteries, the Palm Valley Lutheran Church Cemetery and the Anti-Slaveholding
Union Baptist Cemetery (also known as the Smalley Cemetery), as well as a 19th-century
historic structure listed on the NRHP, the Capt. Merrell Nelson House, occur within the archival
research radius. All of these resources are located well beyond the boundaries of the proposed
project ROWs and would not be potentially affected by the proposed undertaking.
Numerous prior cultural resource surveys have been performed in the vicinity of the
current project area, including 3 surveys that appear to have collectively covered the entire APE
associated with the current proposed project. Segment A and the Segment A Extension were
previously surveyed in their entirety in 1986 by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EHA), for a
proposed wastewater inceptor project (Voellinger et al. 1986). The proposed Segment B ROW
was surveyed by Frontera Archaeology (Frontera) in 2002 during an earlier proposed phase of
work for the current proposed trail project that appears to have involved a different proposed
trail ROW (Iruegas and Tate 2002). Finally, a prior cultural resources survey conducted by
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) in 2007 in association with the proposed
construction of the Arterial A roadway clipped the western end of the proposed ROW of
Segment B (Lawrence 2007), and the portion of site 41WM1028 located in the Arterial A ROW
was subsequently tested to determine its NRHP/SAL eligibility (Lawrence et al. 2009).
In Central Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are relatively common on alluvial terraces
adjacent to prominent streams and springs but are somewhat less frequent in upland settings.
The various segments of the proposed project’s APE traverse a mosaic of Late Pleistocene
alluvial terraces, Holocene-age terrace settings, and associated Upper Cretaceous uplands
surrounding the confluence of Brushy Creek and 2 of its prominent tributaries, Lake Creek and
Dyer Branch. A high density of aboriginal campsites, lithic artifact scatters, and burned rock
middens, as well as numerous historic-age farmsteads and artifact scatters, have been
previously recorded in the vicinity of the proposed project area. Segments A and B of the
project area together pass within the mapped boundaries of 2 previously recorded archeological
sites and near the mapped boundaries of 4 additional previously recorded sites.
As such, based on the archival data, the proposed project’s APE is considered to
possess a high potential to contain cultural aboriginal and/or historic-age resources. The Texas
Archeological Data Site Forms on file on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas describe
the landforms on which many of the previously recorded sites occur as having experienced
varying degrees of erosion, and urban development in the form of construction of residential
subdivisions, roads, and subsurface and overhead utilities has been relatively extensive in the
surrounding area. The combined impacts of ongoing erosion and nearby infrastructure
development on the integrity of the previously recorded cultural sites has somewhat reduced the
significance of the archeological resources in terms of their NRHP and/or SAL eligibility.

However, many of the previously recorded sites have not been fully assessed for their NRHP
and/or SAL eligibility.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

The APE of the proposed project consists of 2 separate, linear segments of nature trail
that would connect other, existing segments of a trail system located along Brushy Creek and its
tributaries. Segment A is situated on the terraces of Brushy Creek on the northern bank of the
creek, extending from A.W. Grimes Boulevard eastward to the future ROW of Arterial A, which
is currently under construction. Segment A measures 1,942 m (6,370 ft) in length within a
proposed 15-m- (50-ft-) wide ROW, and covers an area of 3.1 ha (7.7 ac). Segment B is
situated on the southern bank of Brushy Creek, extending from the future ROW of Arterial A
eastward to a point just north of Vinwood Cove. Segment B measures 1,038 m (3,405 ft) in
length within a ROW that ranges from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) in width, and covers an area of
2.0 ha (4.9 ac). In addition, a short eastward extension of Segment A, designated herein as
Segment A Extension, was added to the APE after initial survey activities were completed as a
potential alternate to using the proposed Segment B alignment. The Segment A Extension
measures 355 m (1,164 ft) in length by 15 m (50 ft) in width, and covers an area of 0.5 ha
(1.3 ac). The proposed Segments A and B ROW segments, together with the proposed
Segment A Extension ROW, collectively measure 3,335 m (10,939 ft) in length, or 3.3 km
(2.1 mi), and cover an area of approximately 5.6 ha (13.9 ac). Segment A is located on the
north side of Brushy Creek extending to the east and west of the confluence of Brushy and Lake
creeks. The primary proposed ROW of Segment A is located on privately owned land, and the
proposed Segment A Extension ROW is on land owned by the City of Round Rock. Segment B
is located on the south side of Brushy Creek east of its confluence with Dyer Branch on land
owned by the City of Round Rock. Originally, a third proposed trail segment located west of
Segment A was included in the project design; however, this segment is no longer proposed for
development and has been removed from the project by the City of Round Rock.
Horizon performed an initial 100% intensive archeological survey of the APE between
April 23 and 25, 2012. Jennifer Cochran served as project archeologist, Jared Wiersema
served as archeological field technician, and Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal Investigator.
During the intensive archeological survey, the proposed project’s APE was traversed on foot by
Horizon’s archeologists in parallel, linear transects spaced approximately 5 m (16 ft) apart, and
the modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The proposed project’s APE measures a total of 3.3 km (2.1 mi) in length by 15 m
(50 ft) in width for the most part with short portions along Segment B that widen out to a
maximum width of 30 m (100 ft). For linear projects, the Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 subsurface probes per mile of 30-m
(100-ft) width of ROW; thus, a minimum of 17 to 20 subsurface probes would be required for the
current project. Horizon excavated a total of 92 shovel tests during the survey, including 22 in
Segment A, 6 in the Segment A Extension, and 64 in Segment B (Figures 5 to 6; Table 2). Of
the 64 shovel tests excavated in Segment B, 30 shovel tests were excavated in non-site areas
during the survey and 34 shovel tests were excavated on archeological sites. Thus, the
TSMASS requirements were exceeded for each individual segment of the APE as well as for

the project area as a whole. Furthermore, the TSMASS require a minimum of 6 shovel tests to
define the boundaries of archeological sites. Horizon excavated 6 shovel tests on site
41WM1028, 11 shovel tests on site 41WM1270, and 17 shovel tests on site 41WM1271, as well
as a combination of backhoe trenches and hand-excavated test units, thereby exceeding the
TSMASS requirements for site definition.
Shovel tests were excavated at a maximum interval of approximately 100 m (328 ft),
though shovel tests were clustered more tightly in most areas due to the high potential for
cultural resources. Except for a few isolated areas in which ground surface visibility ranged up
to 100%, extremely dense vegetation reduced ground surface visibility to less than 30% across
most of the APE. Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to a target
depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum
depth practicable. In practice, most shovel tests were terminated prematurely due to the
presence of compact, nearly impenetrable, very gravelly sediments derived from decomposing
limestone bedrock, though several of the shovel tests excavated on archeological sites
extended 1.0 m (3.3 ft) or more in depth. All sediments were screened through 6.35-millimeter
(mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all
shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System
(GPS) devices based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test
data for all 80 shovel tests excavated within the APE are summarized in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The project area is located on
a series of Holocene- and Pleistocene-age terraces and adjacent uplands next to Brushy Creek

30

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

and 2 of its tributaries, Lake Creek and Dyer Branch. Shovel testing revealed relatively shallow
Holocene- and/or Pleistocene-age alluvial sediments overlying local bedrock in most areas (with
the exception of a small area on 1 archeological site containing archeological deposits more
than 1.0 m [3.3 ft]) deep), indicating that shovel testing was capable of penetrating to the bottom
of sediments containing archeological deposits for the most part. As such, backhoe trenching
was not employed as a site-prospecting technique during the initial intensive survey.
During the initial archeological survey, Horizon recorded 2 new aboriginal archeological
sites (41WM1270 and 41WM1271) as well as a portion of 1 previously recorded aboriginal
archeological site (41WM1028) within the proposed ROW of Segment B. Based on the results
of the initial survey, all 3 sites appeared to possess potential for moderately deep to deep
archeological deposits; cultural features; and/or preserved, datable organic remains. As the
proposed Segment B ROW, as originally designed, would pass within the documented site
boundaries of all 3 sites and the sites appeared to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as SALs, Horizon initiated informal consultation with the City of
Round Rock, TxDOT, and the THC to discuss possible requirements for additional
investigations. Based on these consultative discussions, the City of Round Rock, TxDOT, and
the THC approved additional intensive survey-level investigations on the 3 sites, including
backhoe trenching and excavation of hand-excavated test units, to more fully evaluate their
NRHP and SAL eligibility. Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe trenches during the additional
survey investigations, including 3 on site 41WM1028 and 3 on site 41WM1271. Extremely
dense vegetation precluded excavating backhoe trenches on site 41WM1270 as well as more
extensive trenching on site 41WM1271. The goal of backhoe trenching was to obtain
information about the extent and depth of archeological deposits and to aid in identifying
productive locations for hand-excavated test units. The UTM coordinates of all backhoe
trenches were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex GPS devices based on NAD 83.
Specific backhoe trench data for all 6 trenches excavated within the APE are summarized in
Appendix B.
During the supplemental survey-level investigations on the 3 archeological sites
recorded within the proposed Segment B ROW, Horizon also excavated a combination of handexcavated 50-by-50-cm and 50-by-100-cm test units (see Table 2). For this phase of
investigations, Jennifer Cochran served as project archeologist; Shana Dooley, Rosemarie
Pavel, Briana Nicole Smith, and Jared Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and
Jeffrey D. Owens served as Principal Investigator. Horizon excavated three 50-by-50-cm test
units on site 41WM1028, six 50-by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1270, and four 50-by-100-cm
test units on site 41WM1271. Test units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm-deep levels using
hand tools (e.g., shovels, trowels, rock picks) and all sediments were screened through 6.35mm (0.25-in) hardware cloth. All test units were excavated until 1 culturally sterile level (i.e.,
negative for cultural resources) was completely excavated. Standard level excavation forms
were completed for each 10-cm-deep level within each test unit, and information on soil type
and texture, inclusions, observed disturbances, and types and quantities of cultural and noncultural materials was recorded. Horizon excavated 0.675 m3 of sediment on site 41WM1028,
1.500 m3 on site 41WM1270, and 2.250 m3 on site 41WM1271, for a total of 4.425 m3 of
sediment across the 3 sites (Table 3). The UTM coordinates of all test units were determined

During the initial archeological survey of the proposed project’s APE, which involved only
pedestrian walkover and shovel testing, Horizon employed a non-collection policy for
archeological materials. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials
with maker’s marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic
glass, and metal scrap) were described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and

32

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

replaced in the same location in which they were found. During the supplemental survey
activities, which involved backhoe trenching and hand-excavated test units, Horizon collected all
chipped stone cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, bifacial and unifacial tools, lithic
debitage), faunal bone, and charcoal samples. Collected artifacts from each arbitrary 10-cmdeep excavation level within each test unit were placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with
relevant provenience information and transported to Horizon’s laboratory facilities in Austin,
Texas, for cleaning, sorting, and classification. Burned rocks were quantified, weighed, and
subsequently discarded in the field. If mussel shells and/or snail shells were observed in a test
unit level, notes were recorded on the standard level excavation forms regarding the presence
and approximate densities of these materials and the shell materials were subsequently
discarded. No burned rocks, mussel shells, snail shells, or special sediment samples were
collected. Several small samples of charcoal recovered from generalized midden contexts on
sites 41WM1028 and 41WM1271 were collected (no charcoal samples were encountered
during investigations on site 41WM1270). As all 3 archeological sites investigated during this
survey are located on the Segment B ROW on land owned by the City of Round Rock, all
cultural materials collected during the survey derived from publicly owned land.
Per an agreement with TxDOT and the THC, due to the redundant nature of the
archeological collections resulting from supplemental investigations on sites 41WM1028,
41WM1270, and 41WM1271, which consist predominantly of lithic debitage, the archeological
collections resulting from the supplemental survey investigations will not be permanently
curated.
The single human cranial fragment found in a disturbed context associated with a looter
pit on site 41WM1271 was initially collected because it was not identified as human until after
fieldwork was completed. The human cranial fragment was later reburied at the location in
which it was found on site 41WM1271.
For each of the 3 archeological sites investigated during this survey, a standard site
recording form was used to record pertinent information on location, physiographic setting, and
local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and
densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of surface and any
subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn that illustrates site
boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well
as notable features of the landscape. The sites were thoroughly photo-documented using color
digital photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all photographs taken. Based on
the information recorded on the standard archeological site recording forms in the field, a Texas
Archeological Data Site Form (for new sites) or Texas Archeological Data Site Update Form (for
previously recorded sties) was completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most
current version of Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite archeological
data collection software, and the form was submitted to TARL. TARL subsequently provided
site trinomials for newly recorded archeological sites.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

5.1

GENERAL SURVEY RESULTS

5.1.1

Segment A and Segment A Extension

Segment A is situated on the terraces of Brushy Creek on the northern bank of the
creek, extending from A.W. Grimes Boulevard eastward to the future ROW of Arterial A, which
was under construction at the time of the field investigations. Segment A measures 1,942 m
(6,370 ft) in length within a proposed 15-m- (50-ft-) wide ROW, and covers an area of 3.1 ha
(7.7 ac). In addition, a short eastward extension of Segment A, designated herein as
Segment A Extension, was added to the APE as a potential alternative to using the proposed
Segment B route. The Segment A Extension measures 355 m (1,164 ft) in length by 15 m
(50 ft) in width, and covers an area of 0.5 ha (1.3 ac). Together, Segment A and the Segment A
Extension measure approximately 2,297 m (7,534 ft), or 2.3 km (1.4 mi), in length and cover an
area of 3.6 ha (9.0 ac). Segment A is located on the north side of Brushy Creek extending to
the east and west of the confluence of Brushy and Lake creeks. The primary proposed ROW of
Segment A is located on privately owned land, and the proposed Segment A Extension ROW is
on land owned by the City of Round Rock.
The western end of the proposed Segment A ROW would originate at A.W. Grimes
Boulevard (Figure 7) and would pass eastward underneath the Missouri Pacific Railroad bridge,
skirting the edge of an existing playground (Figure 8). Heading eastward from the playground,
the proposed Segment A ROW would be constructed off the northern edge of an existing sewer
line that runs the entire length of the Segment A ROW. The ROW of this existing sewer line
was surveyed for cultural resources in 1986 by EHA (Voellinger et al. 1986), and the proposed
nature trail would be constructed within a cleared linear corridor that runs along the northern
edge of a line of manholes that marks the location of the sewer line (Figure 9). The eastern end
of the proposed Segment A ROW would terminate at the existing ROW of Arterial A, a north-tosouth oriented roadway that crosses Brushy Creek. Specifically, the proposed trail ROW would
end at Arterial A and use the existing Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek to route the trail to the
south side of Brushy Creek, then continue eastwards within the Segment B ROW. The
Arterial A ROW, which was under construction at the time of the field investigations, was
surveyed for cultural resources by SWCA in 2007 (Lawrence 2007) and has been extensively
disturbed via construction activities (Figure 10). As such, the entire proposed Segment A ROW

has been disturbed via prior construction activities, including construction of A.W. Grimes
Boulevard, the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks, and a public playground at its western end; by
construction of the Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek and clearance and cutting activities
within the Arterial A ROW at its eastern end; and by construction of an existing sewer line and
associated cleared access corridor along the rest of its length.
Vegetation within the proposed Segment A ROW consisted primarily of a dense field of
bastard cabbage within the cleared linear corridor that marks the existing sewer line ROW.
Vegetation surrounding the proposed trail ROW consists of a dense riparian fringe environment
composed of oaks, hackberries, chinaberries, cedar, ragweed, poison ivy, greenbrier, and
various shrubs and tall grasses. Visibility of the modern ground surface was below 30% in most
areas, except for areas near the western and eastern ends of the trail where recent construction
had cleared the native vegetation.
The Segment A Extension ROW was identified by the City of Round Rock as a possible
alternative to using the Segment B ROW, which was found during the initial survey to contain
3 aboriginal archeological sites. The Segment A Extension ROW picks up on the eastern side
of the Arterial A bridge, where the main Segment A ROW ends, and continues eastward along
the existing sewer line ROW to terminate at the edge of property owned by the City of Round
Rock. The Segment A Extension ROW was basically identical to the main Segment A ROW,
running within a cleared linear corridor that was overgrown with dense bastard cabbage
(Figures 11 to 12).
Horizon excavated 22 shovel tests within the proposed Segment A ROW and 6 shovel
tests in the Segment A Extension ROW (see Figure 5; see Table 2), thereby exceeding the
TSMASS requirements for a linear project area of this size. Sediments generally consisted of
shallow to moderately deep loamy clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam overlying dense clay
sediments or chalky limestone bedrock (see Appendix A).
No cultural materials, historic or prehistoric, were observed on the modern ground
surface or in any of the excavated shovel tests in Segment A or the Segment A Extension
ROWs. Archival research conducted prior to the initiation of field activities revealed that the
proposed Segment A ROW passed near the mapped boundaries of 3 previously recorded
archeological sites (41WM12, 41WM467, and 41WM468) (see Figure 4). No evidence of these
sites was observed within the APE. Furthermore, the vast majority, if not all, of the combined
Segment A and Segment A Extension ROWs were previously surveyed for cultural resources.
No cultural resources were recorded within the APE during either of these 2 previous surveys.
5.1.2

Segment B

Segment B is situated on the southern bank of Brushy Creek, extending from the ROW
of Arterial A, which was under construction at the time of the field investigations, eastward to a
small city park located just north of Vinwood Cove. Segment B measures 1,038 m (3,405 ft) in
length within a ROW that ranges from 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft) in width, and covers an area of
2.0 ha (4.9 ac). Segment B is located on the south side of Brushy Creek east of its confluence

with Dyer Branch on land owned by the City of Round Rock. The proposed Segment B ROW is
sandwiched between the creek to the north and a residential subdivision to the south.
The western end of the proposed Segment B ROW would originate at the southern end
of the Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek, which was under construction at the time of the
survey (Figures 13 to 14). The existing Arterial A ROW had been cleared and cut, and piles of
garbage and construction materials had been piled on the modern ground surface within the
current project’s APE immediately adjacent to the road cut. The proposed trail ROW would use
the existing Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek to route the trail from Segment A on the
northern bank of Brushy Creek to the south side of the creek, then continue eastwards within
the Segment B ROW. Located immediately east of the western end of the proposed Segment B
ROW is a prominent erosional gully, and the current proposed undertaking would involve
construction of a small bridge to cross this feature (see Figures 1 and 6). Heading eastwards
from this proposed bridge location, a short segment of the proposed Segment B ROW would
traverse a small, densely forested terrace area before articulating with an existing sewer line
ROW and access road that runs along the rest of the Segment B ROW. This existing sewer line
ROW emerges from the northwestern corner of a residential subdivision located immediately
south of the Segment B ROW and then turns eastwards. The sewer line ROW runs along the
southern edge of an access road cut into the edge of the adjacent upland formation to the south
(Figures 15 and 16). The access road was reportedly constructed by a prior landowner (Iruegas
and Tate 2002) by cutting the road deep down to the hard, white, chalky bedrock level, and the
overburden was pushed off the north edge to spill onto the terrace below. The proposed
Segment B trail ROW would be constructed either within or off the northern edge of this existing
access road depending on local topography and associated grading requirements. The eastern
end of the proposed Segment B ROW would exit the sewer pipeline access road via a short,
unimproved gravel path and terminate at a small city park (Figures 17 and 18). This park
represents the western extent of the existing Brushy Creek nature trail system, and the existing
trail heads eastward from this location. Thus, the majority of the proposed Segment B ROW
has been disturbed via ongoing construction activities associated with Arterial A at its western
end; by construction of an existing city park that represents the current trailhead for the Brushy
Creek nature trail system at its eastern end; and by construction of an existing sewer line and
associated access road along most of its length. The only comparatively undisturbed areas
within the proposed Segment B ROW occur near its western end on the eastern side of a wide
erosional gully and in forested terrace areas north of the sewer line access road.
The constructed areas within the proposed Segment B ROW, including the area near the
Arterial A ROW at the western end, along the sewer line access road, and in the city park at the
eastern end, are either largely denuded of vegetation or contain only short, maintained grasses.
Vegetation within the forested area near the western end of the Segment B ROW by the
erosional gully and on the terraces north of the access road cut consists of a dense riparian
fringe environment composed of oaks, hackberries, chinaberries, cedar, ragweed, poison ivy,
greenbrier, and various shrubs and tall grasses. Visibility of the modern ground surface was
below 30% in most areas.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Archival research conducted prior to the initiation of field activities revealed that the
proposed Segment B ROW passes within the mapped boundaries of sites 41WM780 and
41WM1028 and near the mapped boundaries of site 41WM1029. Site 41WM780 was originally
recorded by the Heritage Society of Austin in 1992 prior to construction of the residential
subdivision that now occupies the upland landform on which the site was identified. This site,
also known as the James H. Bell Plantation House, consisted of a Greek Revival style
plantation house built in the late 1850s, a cistern, and an associated scatter of late 19th-century
domestic debris, including coins, buttons, beads, bottle glass, window pane glass, ceramics, doll
parts, cartridge cases, faunal bones, seeds, and construction debris. The site was associated
with James H. Bell, who served as a justice of the Texas Supreme Court during the mid-19th
century. The house was relocated to Pioneer Farm to be used as a living history center, and
excavations conducted under the former house footprint revealed shallow, 10-cm-thick sediment
deposits. A light, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic materials dating from the Early to Late
Archaic periods was also observed on the upland landform that contained the historic-age
occupation. Additional aboriginal cultural materials, including a disturbed burned rock midden,
tool and faunal bone fragments, mussel shell, and lithic debitage, were noted on the terraces of
Brushy Creek to north of the upland landform on which the historic-age component was located.
However, the site boundaries defined at the time only incorporated the portion of the site located
on the upland landform. No further work was recommended on the upland landform following
relocation of the primary residential structure and the excavations below its foundations, and
this area has subsequently been transformed into a residential subdivision.
The proposed Segment B ROW was surveyed in 2002 by Frontera during an earlier
phase of work associated with the current overall trail project (Iruegas and Tate 2002). This
survey resulted in the documentation of 2 new sites, including site 41WM1028 at the western
end of the Segment B ROW and site 41WM1029 located east of the current project’s APE. Also
during this survey, the terraces between Brushy Creek and the upland landform on which site
41WM780 had been recorded were investigated, and the boundaries of site 41WM780 were
expanded northward to incorporate the aboriginal materials located on the terraces of Brushy
Creek. The western end of the Segment B ROW was resurveyed by SWCA in 2007 in
connection with the proposed construction of Arterial A (Lawrence 2007). SWCA’s survey
investigations determined that the site may have 2 intact subsurface cultural Horizons, and the
site was recommended for further investigations. SWCA subsequently conducted archeological
significance testing on the site and determined that the portion of the site located within the
proposed Arterial A ROW was ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL
(Lawrence et al. 2009).
Horizon investigated a previously unstudied portion of site 41WM1028 located along the
northeastern edge of the site off the east side of the Arterial A ROW and also recorded 2 new
aboriginal archeological sites—41WM1270 and 41WM1271 (Figures 19 to 20). The portion of
site 41WM1028 that had been previously surveyed and tested by SWCA has since been
destroyed by land clearing and cutting activities associated with construction of Arterial A, which
were underway at the time of Horizon’s survey. A small portion of site 41WM1028, located
along the northeastern boundary of the overall mapped area of the site, falls within the proposed
Segment B ROW.

Sites 41WM1270 and 41WM1271 represent previously unrecorded aboriginal campsites.
Technically, these 2 sites fall within the northern margin of previously recorded site 41WM780,
the boundaries of which had been expanded northwards to incorporate the aboriginal
archeological deposits located on the terraces of Brushy Creek during Frontera’s 2002 survey of
the Segment B ROW (Iruegas and Tate 2002). However, Horizon decided to record sites
41WM1270 and 41WM1271 as separate, new sites for a variety of reasons. First, site
41WM780 was primarily a mid-19th- to mid-20th-century historic-age plantation (the James H.
Bell Plantation House) that also happened to contain isolated areas in which surficial, mixed
Early to Late Archaic aboriginal cultural components were observed. No historic-age cultural
resources associated with site 41WM780 were observed on the Brushy Creek terraces either
during Frontera’s 2002 survey (Iruegas and Tate 2002) or during the current survey. Second,
sites 41WM1270 and 41WM1271 are located on the terraces of Brushy Creek, whereas site
41WM780 was situated on the upland bluff south of the terraces. Third, a modern residential
subdivision occupies the entire landform on which site 41WM780 was recorded, and the
investigated portion of that site has been entirely destroyed by residential construction. Finally,
there is a sufficient geographic separation between site 41WM1270, which is located toward the
western end of the proposed Segment B ROW, and site 41WM1271, which is located near the
eastern end of Segment B, to warrant giving the 2 sites individual distinction.
Horizon excavated a total of 64 shovel tests in Segment B during the initial survey (see
Figure 6; see Table 2), thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a linear project area of
this size. Of these 64 shovel tests, 30 shovel tests were excavated in non-site areas during the
survey and 34 were excavated on the 3 archeological sites. Horizon excavated 6 shovel tests
on site 41WM1028, 11 shovel tests on site 41WM1270, and 17 shovel tests on site 41WM1271,
as well as a combination of backhoe trenches and hand-excavated test units during the
supplemental survey investigations, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for site
definition. During the supplemental survey-level investigations on the 3 archeological sites
recorded within the proposed Segment B ROW, Horizon excavated a total of 6 backhoe
trenches, including 3 on site 41WM1028 and 3 on site 41WM1271, as well as three 50-by-50cm test units on site 41WM1028, six 50-by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1270, and four 50by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1271 (see Tables 2 and 3).
No cultural resources associated with site 41WM1029, which was recorded by Frontera
in 2002 on the southern bank of Brushy Creek east of the current project’s APE (Iruegas and
Tate 2002), were encountered during Horizon’s survey. The eastern terminus of the proposed
Segment B ROW is located in an existing city park in which the existing trailhead for the Brushy
Creek trail system had been previously constructed. The western boundary of site 41WM1029
is located 91 m (300 ft) east of the eastern end of the Segment B ROW on the other side of an
unnamed, intermittent tributary of Brushy Creek. The proposed undertaking would have no
potential to adversely affect site 41WM1029.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of investigations conducted by
Horizon on the 3 sites located within the proposed Segment B ROW—41WM1028, 41WM1270,
and 41WM1271.

SITE 41WM1028
General Description

Site 41WM1028 represents the remains of an Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric aboriginal
encampment located on a high terrace or bluff overlooking Brushy Creek to the north
(Figure 21; also see Figures 19 to 20). Site 41WM1028 was originally recorded in 2002 by
Frontera during a prior cultural resources survey conducted for an earlier phase of the Brushy
Creek Regional Trail Gap Project (Iruegas and Tate 2002). When it was originally recorded, the
known site size measured only approximately 45 by 28 m, though only the portion of the site
located within the project area was investigated, and the investigated part of the site was
estimated to represent less than 5% of the site’s total size. The investigated portion of the site
had been disturbed by construction of a road cut that had been excavated down to the hard,
white, chalky bedrock level, and the overburden had been pushed northwards to spill down the
toe slope overlooking Brushy Creek. Examination of exposed soil profiles in the road cut and
limited shovel testing revealed that the site contained only about 35 cm of gravelly sediment
overlying chalky bedrock. However, archeological deposits were believed to be deeper in the
vicinity of a burned rock midden feature located along the edge of a steep bluff overlooking
Brushy Creek along the northern margin of the site. As this portion of the site was outside the
project boundaries, the depth of archeological deposits near the reported burned rock midden
was not assessed. Observed cultural materials consisted of a sparse surface and shallow
subsurface scatter of lithic debitage, burned rock fragments, and 1 Travis dart point, suggesting
a Middle Archaic occupation. The research value of the site was thought to be high based on
the assumption that deeper archeological deposits occurred outside the investigated project
area.
Site 41WM1028 was subsequently resurveyed by SWCA in connection with the
proposed construction of Arterial A, a north-to-south oriented roadway that would cross Brushy
Creek. Based on SWCA’s initial reconnaissance survey, the site was described as an
aboriginal campsite with burned rock features, lithic debitage, and tools that appeared to have
2 intact cultural horizons. The site was considered to be possibly significant based on its
research potential, and additional investigations were recommended. SWCA conducted
archeological significance testing on the portion of the site located within the Arterial A ROW to
determine its eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. SWCA
excavated 9 backhoe trenches and 5 hand-excavated 1-by-1-m units. These investigations
documented a broad scatter of cultural materials, primarily lithic debitage and burned rock
fragments, in both surface and subsurface contexts. The cultural materials were found to
extend about 160 m along the north-to-south-trending Arterial A corridor and to extend beyond
the margins of the roughly 37-m-wide road ROW. The majority of the cultural materials were
found to occur within the upper 50 cm of sediments, with the highest frequency occurring at the
northern end of the site along the eastern margin of the Arterial A survey corridor. Several small
burned rock features were identified in trench profiles and subsequently hand-excavated.
These investigations determined that the majority of the archeological deposits retained minimal
integrity as a result of bioturbation and agricultural activities. Temporally diagnostic artifacts
found
within the disturbed plowzone and underlying stratum indicated a mixed assemblage of

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric artifacts. Based on the general lack of integrity and the extent
of previous impacts, the portion of site 41WM1028 located within the Arterial A corridor was
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and no
further work was recommended in that area. However, SWCA recommended that any future
impacts beyond the investigated portion of the site in the Arterial A ROW warranted additional
assessment in the future.
During Horizon’s survey, a small portion of site 41WM1028 was found to fall within the
western end of the proposed Segment B ROW (see Figure 21). This portion corresponds to the
northeastern margins of the overall site area, which SWCA had indicated appeared to contain
higher densities of cultural materials than other parts of the site (Lawrence 2007; Lawrence et
al. 2009). The portion of site 41WM1028 that falls within the proposed Segment B ROW
measures approximately 45 m north to south by 60 m east to west (see Figure 21). The
western edge of the portion of the site in the current project’s APE is defined by a steep road cut
that marks the eastern edge of the Arterial A ROW, which was under construction at the time of
Horizon’s investigations (Figures 22 to 23). The proposed Brushy Creek nature trail would
utilize the Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek to cross over from Segment A on the north side
of the creek to the south side of the creek, then continue eastwards within the Segment B ROW
(Figure 24). The portion of site 41WM1028 located within the current project’s APE is situated
on a relatively flat, high terrace overlooking Brushy Creek to the north. Elevations across the
investigated site area range from approximately 198 to 204 m (650 to 670 ft) amsl. The
northern boundary of the site appears to be coextensive with the edge of a steep slope down to
Brushy Creek, and the eastern margin is marked by the edge of a prominent erosional gully.
The site originally extended to the west into the Arterial A ROW, and a small portion of the site
may extend to the south of the southern boundary of the Segment B ROW. Vegetation across
most of the site area consisted only of short grasses, though a relatively dense fringe of
hardwood forest lines the edge of the toe slope just north and northeast of the proposed
Segment B ROW boundaries.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Horizon excavated 6 shovel tests, 3 backhoe trenches, and 3 50-by-50-cm handexcavated test units on the portion of site 41WM1028 that falls within the proposed Segment B
ROW (see Figure 21; see Tables 2 to 3; see Appendices A, B, and C). Consistent with the finds
of Frontera’s (Iruegas and Tate 2002) and SWCA’s (Lawrence 2007) earlier studies, initial
shovel testing revealed that the site contains relatively shallow archeological deposits for the
most part. Shovel tests excavated during the initial survey revealed disturbed silty loam
sediments, apparently a plowzone, ranging in depth from 20 to 50 centimeters below surface
(cmbs) overlying dense clay and chalky white bedrock. Cultural materials, consisting primarily
of lithic debitage with a few scattered burned rock fragments, were observed within the upper
10 to 50 cm of sediments in 5 of the 6 shovel tests. Artifact densities ranged from as few as 1 to
3 flakes in shovel tests excavated near the northeastern site boundary to as many as 22 to
31 flakes in shovel tests excavated in the approximate center of the portion of the site that falls
within the current project’s APE.

Figure 24. View of Arterial A Bridge under Construction from Site 41WM1028 (Facing N)

The edge of the proposed Arterial A road cut, which defines the western margin of the
Segment B ROW, measures approximately 100 cm in height and was being actively looted, as
evidenced by a more or less continuous pile of looter backfill along the base of the exposed soil
profile (see Figures 22 to 23). During the initial survey, archeological deposits were visible
within this exposed profile extending to a depth of approximately 80 cmbs, suggesting that only
this very small portion of the site contained archeological deposits deeper than 50 cmbs
(Figure 25). A large looter pit, measuring approximately 2 m in diameter, was visible at the
edge of the toe slope north of the APE that had been excavated to a depth of approximately
50 cmbs. Garbage, construction debris, and construction materials had been piled on the high
ground just east of the road cut (see Figures 22 to 23).
During the supplemental survey investigations, Horizon excavated 3 backhoe trenches
on site 41WM1028. Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1 was excavated into the road cut profile and
extended eastwards approximately 10 m (33 ft) (Figure 26; see Appendix C). Toward the
western end of BHT 1, the soil profile consisted of a 30-cm-thick plowzone composed of mixed
very dark brown clay loam underlain by approximately 35 cm of very dark grayish-brown clay
loam to a depth of 65 cmbs, which appears to represent a more or less intact B horizon
containing archeological deposits. Below the B horizon, the sediment transitions gradually
through a dark yellowish-brown silty clay loam from 65 to 80 cmbs. Chalky white caliche
bedrock was encountered at a depth of 80 cmbs. However, the underlying bedrock sloped
upward sharply toward the eastern end of BHT 1 such that only approximately 60 cm of
sediment overlying bedrock was observed at the eastern end of the trench.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

BHTs 2 and 3 were excavated 15 m east of the road cut profile along north-to-southoriented axes. The surficial plowzone was observed in both trenches extending to a depth of
30 cmbs. In BHT 2, the plowzone was underlain by a thin, 15-cm-thick lens of mixed plowzone
and B horizon sediments, and bedrock was encountered at the relatively shallow depth of
45 cmbs (Figure 27; see Appendix C). In BHT 3, the plowzone was underlain by a relatively
deep deposit of dark yellowish-brown loamy sand with abundant, eroded limestone cobbles
extending to 120 cmbs, grading gradually into a dense bed of decomposing limestone bedrock
(Figure 28; see Appendix C). The combined results of backhoe trenching and shovel testing
suggested that archeological deposits on site 41WM1028 are associated primarily with the
upper 65 cm of sediments in the area located adjacent to the road cut at the western end of the
Segment B ROW. In this area, the upper 30 cm of archeological deposits have been mixed into
an agricultural plowzone, but apparently intact archeological deposits appear to extend from
depths of 30 to 65 cmbs. Cultural materials recovered from deeper strata appear to have
translocated downward through the soil profile. However, the apparently intact occupation zone
underlying the plowzone is present in only a very small portion of the site located adjacent to the
road cut, apparently measuring only about 10 m east to west by 30 m north to south. East of
this small area, culturally sterile subsoil and bedrock is relatively shallow, and archeological
materials appear to be constrained largely to the mixed plowzone deposits.
As the relatively small area of the site with the highest potential for intact archeological
deposits was located along the edge of the Arterial A road cut, Horizon selected this area in
which to place the 3 hand-excavated 50-by-50-cm test units (see Figure 21). Test Unit (TU) 3
was excavated off the north side of BHT 1, and TUs 1 and 2 were excavated directly into the
face of the road cut at intervals of 5 to 7 m south of BHT 1. TUs 1, 2, and 3 were excavated to
depths of 100 cmbs, 80 cmbs, and 90 cmbs, respectively, and cultural materials were found to
extend to depths of 90 cmbs, 70 cmbs, and 80 cmbs, respectively, in these 3 test units. A total
of 0.675 m3 of sediment was excavated from the 3 test units. The highest densities of cultural
materials were contained within the upper 60 to 70 cm of sediments, with small quantities of
cultural materials apparently trickling downwards toward the chalky white bedrock, confirming
that the primary aboriginal cultural horizon is reflected in the plowzone (0 to 30 cmbs) and the
immediately underlying B horizon (30 to 60-70 cmbs) (Figures 29 to 30).
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed in shovel tests excavated during Horizon’s initial survey
activities on site 41WM1028 were not collected, though artifact quantities are summarized in
Appendix A. Cultural materials encountered during the subsequent survey investigations,
specifically those recovered from the 3 hand-excavated 50-by-50-cm units, were collected
(Appendix C). The assemblage of cultural materials recovered from site 41WM1028 includes
7 formal chipped stone tools (i.e., bifaces, biface fragments, and projectile points), 13 retouched
flake tools, 88 utilized flake tools, 4 chert cores, 1,456 pieces of lithic debitage, and 3 small
faunal bone fragments (Appendix C). A total of 616 burned rocks and burned rock fragments,
weighing a total of 26.5 kilograms (kg), were also excavated, though burned rocks were
weighed in the field and subsequently discarded. Also, moderate quantities of small freshwater

mussel shell fragments and Rabdotus snail shells were observed throughout the 3 handexcavated test units, though these materials were not collected.
In TU 1, cultural materials were recovered to a depth of 90 cmbs, though artifact
densities were highest from 20 to 70 cmbs, with a pronounced density spike in the 40 to
50 cmbs level. In TU 2, cultural materials were recovered to a depth of 70 cmbs, with moderate
artifact densities being characteristic of the entire sediment profile with a pronounced density
spike from 40 to 50 cmbs. In TU 3, cultural materials were recovered to a depth of 80 cmbs,
with the highest densities occurring in the plowzone from 10 to 20 cmbs and falling off gradually
below that depth (see Appendix C).
A total of 7 formal tools were recovered from the 3 test units, including 3 temporally
diagnostic dart point fragments, 1 unclassified lanceolate dart point blade fragment,
1 unclassified triangular biface fragment, and 2 unclassified biface fragments that appear to
represent fragments of small lanceolate tools (Figure 31). The 3 temporally diagnostic formal
tools consist of a crudely reworked Martindale-like point recovered from the TU 2 plowzone at a
depth of 10 to 20 cmbs, the proximal half of a Marcos- or Lange-type point recovered from just
below the plowzone of TU 2 at a depth of 30 to 40 cmbs, and the blade of a Darl-like point
recovered from the plowzone of TU 1 at a depth of 10 to 20 cmbs. While the integrity of the
archeological deposits from which these 3 dart point fragments were recovered appears to be
somewhat mixed, these artifacts suggest aboriginal occupations dating from the Early to Late
Archaic periods (Turner and Hester 1999). All 7 of the formal tools recovered from the site were
manufactured from medium- to fine-grained light to dark gray Edwards Formation chert.
Lithic debitage was abundant throughout the profiles of all 3 test units and is reflective of
all stages of lithic reduction (Figure 32). Secondary and tertiary flakes were the most common.
A total of 13 pieces of lithic debitage exhibited regular edge retouch patterns and were classified
as retouched flake tools. An additional 88 utilized flakes showed edge wear indicative of use in
a variety of cutting and scraping tasks without prior modification of the flake to create functional
edges. Four small lithic cores were recovered as well. Raw materials consisted predominantly
of medium- to fine-grained Edwards Formation chert, and a very small percentage
(approximately 5%) of the assemblage exhibited signs of thermal alteration and/or burning.
Burned rocks were relatively abundant throughout the profiles of all 3 test units and were
predominantly small in size, with a few scattered medium-sized burned rocks and burned rock
fragments. While the abundance of burned rocks is broadly indicative of a range of cooking and
heating activities, no clear clusters of burned rocks were discerned that gave the appearance of
cultural features. Rather, the burned rocks were scattered and mixed throughout the profile,
with the highest densities tending to co-occur with levels also containing high quantities of lithic
debitage. Natural limestone gravels were also abundant throughout the sediment profile, and
burned rocks probably account for no more than 25% of the total quantity of limestone rocks.
The small assemblage of faunal bone consists of 1 small, unidentified fragment of
burned bone and 2 small longbone fragments apparently deriving from small mammals. No
charcoal samples were observed in any of the 3 hand-excavated 50-by-50-cm test units.

The most unusual artifact recovered from site 41WM1028 was a small, circular bead or
button recovered from TU 2 at a depth of 40 to 50 cmbs (Figure 33). This artifact measures
approximately 1.3 cm in diameter by 0.5 cm in thickness and has a central, slightly oval-shaped
perforation that measures approximately 0.5 cm in diameter. This bead weighs 1.5 grams (g)
and appears to be manufactured from bone, though it seems to be slightly too heavy and dense
to be bone, raising the possibility that it may be manufactured from shell. If the artifact is indeed
manufactured from shell, the material may be marine shell rather than freshwater shell based on
its off-white coloration and apparent density. The exterior surface of the artifact is highly
polished. It is possible that the artifact is historic in origin; however, no other historic-age
cultural materials were found on site 41WM1028 or, for that matter, anywhere else in the current
project’s APE, and the association of the bead or button with demonstrably aboriginal
archeological deposits likely indicates a prehistoric origin.
Cultural Features
While burned rock was abundant in hand-excavated test units, none of the burned rock
exhibited any clear clustering or spatial patterning suggestive of intact cultural features. Rather,
the burned rocks encountered on the site appear to be mixed in generalized midden contexts,
and the 30 cm of sediments closest to the modern ground surface have been churned into an
undifferentiated plowzone horizon by historic agricultural activities. No cultural features were
identified during Horizon’s investigations on site 41WM1028.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

When site 41WM1028 was originally documented in 2002 by Frontera, the recorders
mentioned a burned rock midden located north of the project area being investigated at the
time. If this possible feature is still extant and has not been damaged or destroyed from road
construction, it is likely that this burned rock midden would be located north of the current
project area along the edge of the terrace overlooking Brushy Creek. No evidence of an intact
burned rock midden was observed within the investigated portion of site 41WM1028.
Site Summary
Site 41WM1028 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on a high
terrace on the south side of Brushy Creek. This site was originally recorded in 2002 by Frontera
during a cultural resource survey performed for an earlier phase of the current trail project
(Iruegas and Tate 2002). At that time, only a small portion of the site that fell within the project’s
anticipated ROW, measuring approximately 45 by 28 m in size, was investigated.
Subsequently, SWCA conducted additional survey activities on the site during a cultural
resource survey performed in association with the proposed construction of Arterial A, a northto-south-oriented roadway that forms the western boundary of the proposed Segment B ROW.
SWCA expanded the site boundaries to measure approximately 160 m north to south by 37 m
east to west within the proposed Arterial A ROW. SWCA conducted archeological significance
testing on the portion of the site located within the Arterial A ROW and concluded that the
investigated portion of the site was ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL based on the overall lack of integrity and extent of prior disturbances. No further
investigations were recommended on the portion of the site located in the Arterial A ROW, and
the Arterial A ROW has since been cleared and cut, and the Arterial A bridge over Brushy Creek
was under construction at the time of Horizon’s survey activities.
Horizon investigated a small portion of site 41WM1028, measuring approximately 45 m
north to south by 60 m east to west, that falls within the western end of the proposed Segment B
ROW. Archeological deposits across most of the area investigated by Horizon were relatively
shallow, measuring only 10 to 50 cm in depth, and were found to be associated with a disturbed
plowzone overlying relatively shallow chalky bedrock in most places. Along the western margin
of the proposed Segment B ROW, along an exposed road cut that marks the eastern edge of
the Arterial A ROW, archeological deposits were found to be somewhat deeper, extending to
depths ranging from 70 to 90 cmbs. In this portion of the site, a thin, apparently intact cultural
horizon measuring approximately 35 cm in thickness was identified underneath a 30-cm-thick
disturbed plowzone. However, the portion of the site containing potentially intact archeological
deposits covers a very small area, apparently measuring no more than about 10 m east to west
by 30 m north to south. Across the rest of the investigated site area, cultural materials were
largely restricted to the disturbed plowzone, which was immediately underlain by culturally
sterile sediments and bedrock.
Cultural materials recovered from the site consisted of high densities of lithic debitage,
moderate quantities of burned rocks, 3 small fragments of faunal bone, and a small assemblage
of formal chipped stone tools and expedient tools manufactured from chert flakes. Burned rocks
were relatively abundant throughout the profile, but none of the burned rocks exhibited any

60

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

clustering or spatial patterning suggestive of cultural features, and no intact cultural features
were recorded on the investigated portion of the site. Three temporally diagnostic projectile
point fragments indicative of Early to Late Archaic occupations were recovered from Horizon’s
excavations, and diagnostic artifacts associated with Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations were documented during SWCA’s prior test excavations on the portion of the site
located within the Arterial A ROW.
While site 41WM1028 contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative
of generalized campsite occupations extending from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
periods, only a very small area of the portion of the site that falls within the current project’s APE
retains intact archeological deposits. Organic preservation on the site appears to be poor, as
evidenced by the recovery of only 3 small faunal bone fragments and the lack of charcoal
samples. Based on the overall lack of integrity of archeological deposits and the extent of prior
disturbances on the portion of the site located within the current project’s APE, the site does not
appear to possess significant research potential regarding the prehistoric past under Criterion D
of the NRHP. No historic-age cultural manifestations are present on the site that would warrant
evaluating site significance under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The portion of the site
located within the proposed Segment B ROW is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and no further investigations are recommended in
connection with the proposed undertaking. In the event that any future endeavors would have
the potential to impact uninvestigated portions of the site beyond the APE of the current project
to the north along the edge of the terrace overlooking Brushy Creek, additional investigations
would be warranted to determine if any intact archeological deposits that meet the criteria of
significance may be present in that area.

SITE 41WM1270
General Description

Site 41WM1270 represents the remains of a Middle to Late Archaic aboriginal
encampment centered on a prominent caliche bluff overlooking Brushy Creek to the north
(Figure 34; also see Figures 19 to 20). Site 41WM1270 is 1 of the 2 new archeological sites
recorded by Horizon during the current survey project. This site is located on the terraces of
Brushy Creek and atop a steep caliche bluff near the western end of the proposed Segment B
ROW (Figure 35). As documented within the current project’s APE during the survey, the site
measures approximately 110 m east to west by 30 m north to south. The western boundary is
marked by an extensive erosional gully that runs along the western edge of the caliche bluff and
separates this site from site 41WM1028 to the west. The southern boundary is delineated by
the edge of a residential lot with a modern home that is surrounded by a wrought-iron fence
(Figure 36). The eastern boundary was defined based on the distribution of positive and
negative shovel tests, and the northern boundary was established arbitrarily as the northern
edge of the proposed Segment B ROW. While it is possible that the site extends all the way
northwards to the bank of Brushy Creek, vegetation in the western half of the site and on the
terraces to the north of the proposed ROW was exceedingly thick as a result of unusually heavy
spring rains, rendering these areas almost completely inaccessible for pedestrian survey.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

The western half of the documented site area is located in a densely vegetated upland
and terrace setting, and this portion of the site is primarily associated with an elevated upland
landform overlooking the Brushy Creek floodplain (see Figure 35). Vegetation in this portion of
the site consists of a dense riparian fringe environment composed of oaks, hackberries,
chinaberries, cedar, ragweed, poison ivy, greenbrier, and various shrubs and tall grasses. An
existing sewer line ROW enters the site via an open alley that runs from Ravenwood Drive to
the south between 2 residential lots onto the Brushy Creek terraces (Figure 37). This sewer line
ROW enters site 41WM1270 at its southeastern boundary, then turns northeast and runs along
the edge of the uplands within the remainder of the proposed Segment B ROW. The eastern
half of the site has been extensively disturbed by construction of the subsurface sewer line as
well as by construction of an access road that runs most of the length of Segment B (Figure 38).
This access road was reportedly constructed by a previous landowner by cutting down to the
hard, chalky white bedrock and pushing the spoil northwards over the lip of the toeslope onto
the Brushy Creek terraces (Iruegas and Tate 2002). The eastern half of site 41WM1270 is
dominated by the existing sewer line ROW and the road cut, and vegetation consists primarily of
overgrown grasses (see Figure 38). Elevations across the investigated site area range from
198 to 207 m (650 to 680 ft) amsl.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
The most prominent physiographic feature on site 41WM1270 is a triangular upland
ridge finger located near the western end of the site (see Figure 35; this feature is roughly
defined by the area marked “Area A” in Figure 34). The northwest-facing edge of this landform
is defined by a 6-m- (20-ft-) high, vertical bluff face composed of decomposed chalky bedrock.
The land surface on the top of this bluff has been extensively looted by artifact collectors; in fact,
the entire distal end of this landform has been completely excavated by looters, as evidenced by
a large area measuring approximately 15 m in diameter that has been completely excavated to
the top of the underlying caliche deposits (Figures 39 to 41). The looted area contains a
general scatter of lithic debitage and burned rocks on the modern ground surface as well as
numerous large looter piles composed of discarded artifacts.
Horizon excavated 11 shovel tests, 8 of which produced cultural materials, and six 50by-100-cm hand-excavated test units on site 41WM1270 (see Figure 34; see Tables 2 to 3; see
Appendices A and C). The primary locus of aboriginal habitation on the site appears to have
been the top of the triangular ridge finger located near the western end of the site that has been
extensively damaged via recent looting activities. An exposed cutbank profile located along the
southeastern edge of the looted area suggests that as much as 50 to 60 cm of archeological
deposits may have been impacted by looters. This portion of the site may have once contained
the deepest archeological deposits on the site, though this area has been completely destroyed
by looting. Shovel testing farther up this upland landform to the southeast revealed 40 to 50 cm
of archeological deposits associated with shallow, dark brown silty loam sediment that
immediately overlies chalky limestone bedrock. Shovel testing across the remainder of the site
to the east revealed only shallow archeological deposits ranging from 20 to 40 cm in depth, and
disturbances associated with construction of the existing sewer line and road cut were evident
throughout this portion of the site. Cultural materials observed in shovel tests consisted

primarily of lithic debitage ranging in quantity from as few as 1 to 6 flakes in the 2 lowest-density
shovel tests to as many as 44 to 46 flakes in the 2 highest-density shovel tests, and 1 small
freshwater mussel shell fragment was observed in 1 shovel test.
No backhoe trenches were excavated on site 41WM1270. The eastern half of the site
contains only shallow archeological deposits and had been heavily disturbed via construction of
the existing sewer line and access road cut. While this portion of the site would have been
readily accessible for backhoe trenching, shovel testing was sufficient to evaluate the depth of
archeological deposits. The western portion of the site contained exceedingly thick vegetation
and was inaccessible for the backhoe, so no trenches could be excavated in this area.
During the supplemental survey investigations, Horizon excavated six 50-by-100-cm
hand-excavated test units on the portion of the upland ridge located southeast and uphill of the
extensively looted distal finger to evaluate the context of archeological deposits in the lessdisturbed areas. One of the test units, TU 5, was excavated into the exposed cutbank along the
southeastern edge of the large looted area, and the remaining 5 test units were scattered
across the landform between the looted area and the edge of the residential lot that marks the
southern site boundary (see Figure 34). Test units were excavated to depths ranging from 30 to
60 cmbs, and all test units were terminated at the underlying limestone bedrock (Figures 42
to 44). Archeological deposits were found to extend to depths of 20 to 60 cmbs and were
associated with very dark brown loamy sand and silty clay loam sediments that appear to have
formed in situ from the underlying bedrock.
A total of 1.5 m3 of sediment were excavated from

the 6 test units. The highest densities of cultural materials were generally found to occur within
the upper 30 cm of deposits except for TU 5, the test unit excavated on the edge of the looted
area, in which high artifact densities were found within the upper 50 to 60 cm of sediments. The
sediment deposits overlying the chalky limestone bedrock appeared to be relatively intact,
though some disturbance from rodent activity and tree roots was observed. Also, several
smaller looter pits were scattered across the top of the ridge, though the largest of these pits
measured only 1 m in diameter.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed in shovel tests excavated during Horizon’s initial survey
activities on site 41WM1270 were not collected, though artifact quantities are summarized in
Appendix A. Cultural materials encountered during the subsequent survey investigations were
collected, including those recovered from the 6 hand-excavated test units as well as a few
artifacts from disturbed contexts on the modern ground surface of the large looted area atop the
ridge (Appendix C). The assemblage of cultural materials recovered from site 41WM1028
includes 5 formal chipped stone tools (i.e., bifaces, biface fragments, and projectile points),
11 retouched flake tools, 71 utilized flake tools, 1 large chert core, and 1,574 pieces of lithic
debitage (Appendix C). A total of 335 burned rocks and burned rock fragments, weighing a total
of 24.8 kg, were also excavated, though burned rocks were weighed in the field and
subsequently discarded. Also, moderate quantities of small freshwater mussel shell fragments
and Rabdotus snail shells were observed in all 6 test units, though these were not collected. No

HJN 080151 AR

faunal bones or charcoal samples were observed in any of the excavated test units, suggesting
that organic preservation on the site is poor.
A total of 5 formal tools were recovered from 3 of the 6 test units and from a general
surface collection of the looted area, including 2 temporally diagnostic dart points or point
fragments, 2 large ovate bifaces, and 1 unclassified lanceolate biface fragment that may
represent the distal tip of a dart point (Figure 45). The 2 temporally diagnostic formal tools
consists of the proximal half of a broken Fairland- or Edgewood-type dart point recovered from a
depth of 20 to 30 cmbs in TU 5 and a Pedernales point that had been reworked into a drill or a
perforator tool recovered from a depth of 10 to 20 cmbs in TU 4. The 2 diagnostic dart points
found on the site suggest aboriginal occupations dating from the Middle to Late Archaic periods,
though the Pedernales point may have been reworked during a later site occupation (Turner
and Hester 1999). All of the formal tools recovered from the site were manufactured from
medium- to fine-grained, chalky white to gray Edwards Formation chert.
Lithic debitage was abundant throughout the profiles of all 6 test units, though the
highest densities were recovered from depths of 10 to 30 cmbs (extending to 50 to 60 cmbs in
TU 5, in which the deepest archeological deposits were encountered), and is reflective of all
stages of lithic reduction (Figure 46). Secondary and tertiary flakes were the most common. A
total of 11 pieces of lithic debitage exhibited regular edge retouch patterns and were classified
as retouched flake tools. An additional 71 utilized flakes showed edge wear indicative of use in
a variety of cutting and scraping tasks without prior modification of the flake. One large lithic
core was recovered as well. Raw materials consisted predominantly of medium- to fine-grained
Edwards Formation chert, and a small percentage (less than 10%) of the assemblage exhibited
signs of thermal alteration and/or burning.
Burned rocks were relatively abundant throughout the profiles of most of the test units
and were predominantly small in size, with a few scattered medium- to large-sized fragments.
While the abundance of burned rocks is broadly indicative of a range of cooking and heating
activities, no clear clusters of burned rocks were observed that might indicate the presence of
intact cultural features. Rather, the burned rocks were scattered and mixed throughout the
profile, with the highest densities tending to co-occur with levels also containing high quantities
of lithic debitage. Natural limestone gravels were also abundant throughout the sediment
profiles, and burned rocks probably accounted for no more than 10% of the total quantity of
limestone rocks.
No faunal bone was observed on the site on the modern ground surface in association
with disturbed looter pits or in any of the shovel tests or test units excavated on the site, and
only 1 small charcoal chunk was found in TU 5 at a depth of 30 to 40 cmbs. Overall, organic
preservation appears to be poor on the site. Between 5 and 10% of the faunal specimens
recovered from the site were heavily burned.

Cultural Features
While burned rock was abundant in hand-excavated test units, none of the burned rock
exhibited any clear clustering or spatial patterning suggestive of intact cultural features. No
cultural features were identified during Horizon’s investigations on site 41WM1270.
Site Summary
Site 41WM1270 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on a
prominent ridge finger and surrounding terraces on the south side of Brushy Creek. As
delineated during Horizon’s investigations, the site measures approximately 100 m east to west
by 30 m north to south within the proposed Segment B ROW. The site may extend beyond the
current project’s APE northwards as far as the bank of Brushy Creek, but dense vegetation
precluded assessing this portion of the site. The southern boundary is marked by a developed
residential lot and the western boundary is defined by a deep, wide erosional gully that
separates this site from site 41WM1028 to the west. The eastern site boundary was defined
based on the extent of positive and negative shovel tests. The aboriginal occupation on the site
appears to be largely constrained to the top of a prominent caliche ridge, a large portion of
which has been extensively damaged via recent looting activities, located near the western end
of the site. The eastern portion of the site has been disturbed via construction of an existing
sewer line ROW and an access road that has been cut down to chalky limestone bedrock.
The primary locus of aboriginal habitation on the site appears to have been on the top of

southeast revealed between 20 and 60 cm of archeological deposits associated with shallow,
dark brown silty loam sediment that immediately overlies chalky limestone bedrock. Shovel
testing across the remainder of the site to the east revealed even shallower archeological
deposits ranging from 20 to 40 cm in depth,
While site 41WM1270 contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative
of generalized campsite occupations dating to the Middle to Late Archaic periods based on the
presence of 2 temporally diagnostic projectile points, archeological deposits on the site are
relatively shallow and have been extensively disturbed via recent looting and construction of a
subsurface sewer line and access road cut. While archeological deposits in the less-disturbed
western portion of the site appear to be largely intact aside from some degree of bioturbation
and erosion, no intact cultural features were observed, organic preservation appears to be poor,
and the assemblage of cultural materials is rather redundant across the investigated site area.
Based on the overall lack of integrity and shallow depth of archeological deposits, the portion of
the site located in the current project’s APE does not appear to possess significant research
potential regarding the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP. No historic-age cultural
manifestations are present on the site that would warrant evaluating site significance under

Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The portion of the site located within the proposed Segment B
ROW is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL,
and no further investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking.

SITE 41WM1271
General Description

Site 41WM1271 represents the remains of a Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric
aboriginal encampment on the southern terraces of Brushy Creek (Figure 47; also see
Figures 19 to 20). Site 41WM1271 is 1 of the 2 new archeological sites recorded by Horizon
during the current survey project. The site is located on the terraces of Brushy Creek near the
eastern end of the proposed Segment B ROW. As documented during the current survey, the
site measures approximately 120 m east to west by 30 to 40 m north to south. The southern
boundary of the site is defined by an existing sewer line ROW and raised access road cut into
the edge of the upland landform to the south on which a residential subdivision has been built
(see Figures 15 to 16). The eastern and western boundaries were defined based on the
distribution of positive and negative shovel tests. While the western boundary could be clearly
delineated based on shovel testing, exceedingly dense vegetation characterized much of the
eastern extent of the documented site area that precluded pedestrian access, so the eastern
boundary is somewhat arbitrary. The northern boundary was established arbitrarily based on
the northern edge of the proposed Segment B ROW; however, limited shovel testing was
conducted north of the ROW boundary along the northern edge of the site, allowing the site
boundary to be expanded slightly beyond the ROW boundary in this area. The site may extend
all the way northwards to the Brushy Creek channel; however, the creek is located only 20 to
30 m north of the edge of the project area, and limited exploratory shovel testing conducted
north of the project area suggests the site is associated mainly with the upper terrace of Brushy
Creek. This upper terrace is sandwiched between a lower terrace that parallels the edge of the
creek and the toeslope of the adjacent uplands marked by the elevated access road that defines
the southern boundary of the site (Figure 48). Elevations on the site range from approximately
197 to 199 m (645 to 655 ft) amsl. The natural landscape on the upper terrace containing
archeological deposits is relatively flat, though artificial modifications to the landscape within the
site area have produced a “hummocky” appearance resulting from numerous large looter
backfill piles and pushpiles from 2 old road cuts that cross through the site. Vegetation on the
site is exceedingly dense in many areas, consisting of a dense riparian fringe environment
composed of oaks, hackberries, chinaberries, cedar, ragweed, poison ivy, greenbrier, and
various shrubs and tall grasses (Figures 49 to 50).
Portions of site 41WM1271 have been somewhat extensively disturbed by an array of
prior construction efforts. The southern site boundary runs along the base of the adjacent
upland landform to the south. An access road had previously been cut into the edge of this
upland formation approximately midway between the terrace/uplands interface and the top of
the bluff, and an existing sewer line runs along the southern edge of this road cut (see
Figure 48). The access road was reportedly constructed by a previous landowner by cutting
down to the hard, chalky white bedrock and pushing the spoil northwards down onto the Brushy

Creek terrace (Iruegas and Tate 2002). There is an approximately 3.0-m (10.0-ft) topographic
difference between the elevated road cut and the upper terrace of Brushy Creek that contains
archeological deposits (see Figure 48).
Remnants of 2 parallel old road cuts were observed crossing the site area from east to
west (see Figure 47). These road cuts were also observed by Frontera during a prior cultural
resources survey of this area (Iruegas and Tate 2002) and are noted on the TARL site update
form filed by Frontera for site 41WM780. While these road cuts were not continuously
discernable on the landscape during Horizon’s survey due to exceedingly dense vegetation that
had grown up in response to an unusually wet spring rainy season, abundant large pushpiles
were observed throughout the site area that may have been produced when these old road cuts
were created (Figure 51). Numerous looter pits of varying sizes are scattered across the site as
well, the largest of which measures 2.5 m in diameter (Figure 52), and the mounds of dirt
observed on the site were initially believed to be looter backfill piles. It is likely that the dirt
mounds resulted from a combination of site looting as well as creation of the road cuts. The
function of the road cuts is unclear, though they are currently very overgrown and may simply
represent old field roads created by a prior landowner that were in use before the road cut that
runs along the sewer line ROW was constructed.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

A concrete box culvert has been constructed in the southeastern corner of site
41WM1271 that appears to serve as a storm water outfall for the subdivision to the south
(Figure 53). Also, a linear segment of discarded silt fencing measuring approximately 30 m in
length was discovered extending eastward from one of the backhoe trenches excavated in the
approximate center of the site during Horizon’s survey (BHT 3). This silt fencing appeared to
have been abandoned where it was installed and left to collapse on its own. The silt fencing
was found approximately 20 m north of the southern site boundary, suggesting that
construction-related impacts, likely associated with construction of the subdivision to the south,
may have extended relatively far out onto the Brushy Creek terraces. Collectively, these prior
construction-related impacts have disturbed a sizeable portion (possibly as much as 50%) of the
documented site area.
Looting has been relatively extensive on site 41WM1271. At least 8 large looter pits
were observed scattered across the site, and it is likely that thick vegetative ground cover
masked additional looter pits. The largest looter pit measured 2.5 m in diameter and had been
excavated to a depth of 70 cmbs (see Figure 52). A dense surface scatter of discarded
aboriginal cultural materials from looter pits, consisting primarily of lithic debitage and burned
rocks, was ubiquitous adjacent to looter pits across the portions of the site in which the modern
ground surface was visible (Figure 54).
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Horizon excavated 17 shovel tests, 13 of which produced cultural materials, plus
3 backhoe trenches and four 50-by-100-cm hand-excavated test units on site 41WM1271 (see
Figure 47; see Tables 2 to 3, see Appendices A, B, and C). Exceedingly dense vegetation
precluded standard pedestrian survey activities on some portions of the site, and backhoe
access was similarly restricted to areas in the eastern half of the site that were comparatively
open. Shovel testing across the western half of the documented site area within the proposed
Segment B ROW revealed shallow archeological deposits associated with a disturbed grayishbrown clay loam to silty clay loam sediment extending to depths of 10 to 25 cmbs overlying
gravelly limestone bedrock (Appendix A). Similarly, shovel tests excavated along the southern
site boundary along the terrace margin revealed either shallow (5 cm) deposits overlying
bedrock or culturally sterile sediments. Shovel testing conducted along the elevated access
road cut revealed primarily shallow, disturbed sediments overlying bedrock. Two shovel tests
(JW-22 and JC-18) excavated on the elevated road cut contained shallowly buried cultural
resources within the upper 10 to 15 cm of sediments overlying bedrock, though the remaining
shovel tests excavated on the road cut were negative (see Figure 47). The southwestern site
boundary was extended up onto the road cut to incorporate the 2 positive shovel tests; however,
archeological contexts associated with this road cut are clearly disturbed, and aboriginal activity
on the site appears to be constrained to the upper terrace of Brushy Creek below the road cut
(see Figure 48). While many of the shovel tests excavated in the site center revealed similarly
shallow archeological deposits ranging from 10 to 30 cm in depth, 2 shovel tests (JC-14 and
JW-18) revealed cultural materials extending to depths of 50 to 90 cmbs, respectively. Most
notably, 1 shovel test (ST JW-30) was excavated in the bottom of the largest looter pit on the
site, which measures 2.5 m in diameter and had been previously excavated to a depth of

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

70 cmbs (see Figure 52). This shovel test revealed an additional 40 cm of cultural deposits
extending from 70 to 120 cmbs, though it is possible that the sediment in the bottom of this
looter bit had already been excavated deeper than 70 cmbs and that this shovel test was
excavated through backfill. Cultural materials observed in shovel tests consisted primarily of
moderate to high densities of lithic debitage with scattered burned rocks and abundant natural
limestone gravels derived from decomposing bedrock. Piles of lithic debitage and burned rocks
were also observed piled next to looter pits.
During the supplemental survey investigations, Horizon excavated 3 backhoe trenches
on site 41WM1271 (see Figure 47). Backhoe trenching (as well as the locations of handexcavated test units) was limited to a relatively limited area in the east-central portion of the site
in which vegetation was less dense. The City of Round Rock had requested that Horizon
attempt to minimize damage to the maximum extent possible during backhoe trenching
operations, and creating access corridors to other portions of the site would have required
cutting extensive swaths through the forested landscape. Prior looting had been the most
extensive in this portion of the site, which provided some indication that this was the most
“productive” portion of the site. Furthermore, the original proposed Segment B trail footprint
passed through this portion of the site, so it seemed reasonable to focus backhoe trenching and
test unit excavations in this area. The actual trail footprint has since been rerouted by the City
of Round Rock to run along the elevated access road that forms the site’s southern boundary so
as to avoid impacts to potentially intact archeological deposits in the center of the site (both the
original and rerouted proposed trail footprint are shown in Figure 47).
BHT 1 was excavated at the eastern edge of a meadow that was comparatively free of
forest vegetation, revealing a shallow surface lens of very dark brown clay loam with abundant
limestone gravels extending to a depth of 30 cm (Figure 55; see Appendix B). This surface
horizon contained what seemed to be construction gravels and appeared disturbed.
Immediately beneath this surficial stratum was a mixed, transitional brown silty loam B horizon
mixed with decomposing bedrock extending from 30 to 50 cm, and a dense yellowish-brown
silty loam C horizon with a large fraction of limestone gravels was encountered from 50 to
80 cmbs. An unclassified lanceolate biface fragment manufactured from gray chert was found
in the backfill associated with the uppermost horizon in this trench, though the overall
impression created by the profile of this trench was that this portion of the site had been
disturbed and contained very shallow archeological deposits. Notably, a partially buried length
of abandoned silt fencing was subsequently found just south of this trench.
BHT 2 was excavated about 5 m west of BHT 1 and revealed what appeared to be a
more intact soil profile (Figure 56). The surficial stratum, extending from 0 to 30 cmbs,
consisted of very dark brown clay loam with abundant limestone gravels, contained some
construction gravels and appeared disturbed (similar to BHT 1). The underlying strata appeared
to be essentially intact, consisting of a thick dark grayish-brown to brown silty loam B horizon
with abundant limestone gravels that gradually lightened in color with increasing depth. The
beginnings of a yellowish-brown C horizon appeared at 70 cmbs, and a dense bed of
decomposing bedrock with a small fraction of light yellowish-brown silty loam was encountered
from 80 to 120 cmbs.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

BHT 3 was excavated about 15 m west of BHT 2 near a large looter pit that had been
excavated along the edge of one of the ubiquitous dirt mounds on the site (Figure 57). A
disturbed surficial horizon composed of 50 cm of very dark brown loamy clay with abundant
limestone gravels was detected in this trench. A linear segment of silt fencing was detected at a
depth of approximately 20 cmbs. This silt fencing was determined to measure about 30 m in
length and to run in an east-to-west direction (i.e., against the direction of overland sheet flow),
and appeared to have been abandoned in place and left to collapse on its own. Beneath this
disturbed surface horizon, a dark grayish brown silty clay loam B horizon, gradually lightening to
a yellowish-brown color with increasing depth, extended from 50 to 120 cmbs. A dense
C horizon composed of abundant decomposed limestone bedrock gravels with a small fraction
of dark yellowish-brown clay loam marked the bottom of the trench from 120 to 150 cmbs.
Inspection of the profiles of BHTs 2 and 3 suggested that archeological deposits were
associated with the thick B horizon, and 2 test units were excavated off the walls of these
trenches to obtain quantified data on archeological deposits associated with the observed
stratigraphic profile. TU 2 was excavated off the southeast wall of BHT 2 (see Figure 56) and
TU 4 was excavated off the southeast wall of BHT 3 (see Figure 57). TU 1 was excavated into
the side of a large earthen mound located approximately 8 m northwest of BHT 3 to obtain
information about the internal structure of the ubiquitous earthen mounds observed across the
site (Figure 58). TU 3 was excavated about 25 m southwest of BHT 3 into the eastern edge of a
large looter pit located at the base of the slope up to the road cut that runs along the southern
edge of the site (Figures 59 to 60).

Archeological deposits in TUs 2 and 4, excavated into the walls of BHTs 2 and 3,
respectively, appeared to be relatively intact. Underneath the surficial stratum that apparently
had been disturbed via prior construction activities, extending to depths of 30 to 50 cmbs,
archeological deposits were found to be associated with a deep sequence of dark brown to dark
grayish-brown clay loam. TU 2 contained a relatively low density of cultural materials
throughout the profile extending to a depth of 90 cmbs, typically including no more than a dozen
pieces of lithic debitage and utilized flake tools per 10-cm level, and cultural materials were
distributed evenly throughout the profile (see Figure 56; see Appendix C). Based on the
accompanying quantities of burned rock, the primary cultural horizon appears to be constrained
to depths of 30 to 60 cmbs in TU 2, with some minor downwards percolation of artifacts into
deeper strata. Cultural materials recovered from TU 2 consisted predominantly of lithic debitage
and burned rocks, though 1 piece of faunal bone was recovered from a depth of 30 to 40 cmbs.
TU 4 contained a markedly higher quantity of cultural materials, primarily from 30 to 80 cmbs,
with decreasing densities observed to the bottom of archeological deposits at a depth of
110 cmbs (see Figure 57; see Appendix C). Archeological materials were associated with a
deep, very dark brown to dark grayish-brown B horizon and included abundant lithic debitage,
burned rocks, and faunal bone, and a Travis-like dart point fragment and an unclassified dart
point fragment were recovered from a depth of 40 to 50 cmbs.
TU 1, which was excavated into the northern edge of a large mounded landform, was
found to contain a surficial cap of a lighter brown sandy clay loam with abundant limestone and
a high caliche content, extending to a depth of 40 cmbs, that appeared similar to C-horizon

84

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

sediments observed at the bottom of test units and trenches excavated elsewhere on the site,
suggesting that at least the surficial stratum contained disturbed, redeposited sediments (see
Figure 58). Underneath this disturbed surficial stratum, TU 1 contained a thin B horizon
composed of black to very dark grayish-brown clay loam from 40 to 70 cmbs underlain by a
transitional horizon of brown clay loam from 70 to 90 cmbs. Bedrock composed of brown sandy
clay loam with a high fraction of decomposing limestone gravels was encountered from 90 to
110 cmbs. Cultural materials were recovered to a depth of 100 cmbs, though the highest
densities were limited to the B horizon extending from 40 to 70 cmbs. TU 1 yielded
predominantly lithic debitage and burned rocks, though 2 pieces of faunal bone were recovered
from depths of 50 to 70 cmbs.
TU 3 was excavated off the eastern edge of a large looter pit measuring approximately
1.5 m in diameter located at the base of the slope associated with the raised road cut in the
south-central portion of the site (see Figures 59 to 60). This looter pit had been excavated to a
depth of approximately 1 m below surface, and associated backfill spilled away from the edges
of the pit downslope to the east and south. TU 3 was excavated to a depth of 120 cmbs, and
archeological materials were recovered from depths of 0 to 110 cmbs. Archeological deposits
were associated with a deep B horizon composed of very dark brown, very dense clay to silty
clay loam with abundant limestone gravels and burned rocks, and the primary cultural horizon
with the highest artifact densities was found to occur from 30 to 80 cmbs. Like TU 4, this test
unit contained abundant faunal bone throughout the profile, and an Edwards arrow point was
recovered from a depth of 60 to 70 cmbs.
On the last day of the supplemental survey investigations on site 41WM1271, a small
cranial fragment was observed at the base of the western wall of the looter pit on the opposite
side of the pit from where TU 3 was excavated. Photographs of this cranial fragment were
subsequently sent to a forensic anthropologist, Dr. Jason Wiersema, DABFA, DABMDJ, for
examination. Dr. Wiersema determined, based on the photographs, that this cranial fragment is
likely human. The cranial fragment was recovered from an unprovenienced context at the
bottom of a looter hole, though it was found within 2 m of TU 3, which was found to contain a
high density of faunal bone. No other bone fragments found in this test unit were definitively
human, and much of it clearly derives from small- to medium-sized mammals that likely
represent subsistence remains associated with the prehistoric occupation of the site. No
articulated skeletal remains were observed during the excavation of TU 3; rather, all of the
faunal bones were recovered from mixed midden contexts that lacked any clear internal
structure. Furthermore, TU 3 was excavated at the base of the slope of the nearby uplands
immediately south of the road cut, and some degree of post-depositional disturbance in this
area associated with construction of the road is likely. Nevertheless, the presence of a human
bone fragment on the site indicates the possibility that human burials or other disarticulated
human remains may occur in uninvestigated portions of the site.
One piece of faunal bone and 1 small burned wood charcoal sample excavated from
TU 3 were submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc., for accelerated mass spectrometer (AMS)
radiocarbon dating (Appendix D). Both the faunal bone and charcoal samples were recovered
from the same excavation level of TU 3—the charcoal sample (the largest recovered from the

HJN 080151 AR

85

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

site) was excavated from a depth of 35 cmbs and the faunal bone sample was recovered from
the same excavation level at depths of 30 to 40 cmbs. No intact cultural features were
observed in TU 3, though the density of artifacts in this test unit does suggest that archeological
deposits may derive from a generalized trash midden feature, though the context of the
radiocarbon samples represents, at best, a mixed midden deposit. The charcoal sample (Beta
323535) yielded a conventional radiocarbon age of 146.5 ±0.4% modern carbon (pMC),
indicating that the material was living within the last 60 years. Thus, the charcoal sample was
likely from an intrusive, modern tree root. The faunal bone sample (Beta 323534) yielded a
measured radiocarbon age of 610 ±30 before present (B.P.), indicating a 14th-century
occupation falling within the latter half of the Late Prehistoric period. Notably, the faunal bone
that yielded the Late Prehistoric date was recovered from the same test unit that yielded an
Edwards arrow point, though the Edwards point from recovered from a depth of 60 to 70 cmbs.
A total of 2.25 m3 of sediment was excavated from the 4 test units on site 41WM1271.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed in shovel tests excavated during Horizon’s initial survey
activities on site 41WM1271 were not collected, though artifact quantities are summarized in
Appendix A. Cultural materials encountered during the subsequent survey investigations were
collected, including those recovered from the 4 hand-excavated test units, 1 unclassified dart
point fragment from the backfill associated with BHT 1, and a small human cranial fragment
found in a looter pit adjacent to TU 3. Not counting the dart point fragment and the human
cranial fragments found in disturbed contexts, the assemblage of cultural materials recovered
from site 41WM1271 includes 4 formal chipped stone tools (i.e., bifaces, biface fragments, and
projectile points), 14 retouched flake tools, 83 utilized flake tools, 2 chert cores, 1,963 pieces of
lithic debitage, and 158 pieces of faunal bone (Appendix C). A total of 931 burned rocks and
burned rock fragments, weighing a total of 118.4 kg, were also excavated, though burned rocks
were weighed in the field and subsequently discarded. Also, moderate quantities of small
freshwater mussel shell fragments and Rabdotus snail shells were observed in all 4 test units,
though none of these were collected. Several small charcoal samples were collected from
mixed contexts on the site, and 1 of these charcoal samples returned a modern AMS
radiocarbon date, suggesting that the sparse charcoal fragments on the site are likely derived
from burned tree roots.
A total of 4 formal tools were recovered from 2 of the 4 test units (TUs 3 and 4) and from
the backfill of BHT 1, including 2 temporally diagnostic projectile points and 2 unclassified
lanceolate biface fragments that may represent the distal tips of dart points (Figure 61). The
2 temporally diagnostic formal tools consist of an Edwards arrow point recovered from TU 3 at a
depth of 60 to 70 cmbs as well as a Travis-like dart point fragment recovered from a depth of
40 to 50 cmbs in TU 4. The 2 diagnostic points found on the site suggest aboriginal
occupations dating from the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Turner and Hester
1999). Notably, the Late Prehistoric Edwards point was found in the same test unit from which
a piece of faunal bone that returned a Late Prehistoric AMS radiocarbon date was recovered,

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

Figure 61. Chipped Stone Bifacial Artifacts Recovered from Site 41WM1271

albeit from different levels. All of the formal tools recovered from the site were manufactured
from medium- to fine-grained, chalky white to gray Edwards Formation chert.
Lithic debitage was abundant throughout the profiles of all 4 test units, though densities
were markedly higher in TUs 3 and 4 (Figure 62). Secondary and tertiary flakes constitute the
vast majority of the assemblage, though several primary flakes and nodule decortication flakes
were also found. A total of 14 pieces of lithic debitage exhibited regular edge retouch patterns
and were classified as retouched flake tools. An additional 83 utilized flakes showed edge wear
indicative of use in a variety of cutting and scraping tasks without prior modification of the flake.
Raw materials consisted predominantly of medium- to fine-grained Edwards Formation chert,
and a small percentage (less than 10%) of the assemblage exhibited signs of thermal alteration
and/or burning.
Burned rocks were relatively abundant throughout the profiles of all of the test units and
were predominantly small in size, with a few scattered medium- to large-sized fragments. While
the abundance of burned rocks is broadly indicative of a range of cooking and heating activities,
no clear clusters of burned rocks were observed that might indicate the presence of intact
cultural features. Rather, the burned rocks were scattered and mixed throughout the profile,
with the highest densities tending to co-occur with levels also containing high quantities of lithic
debitage. Natural limestone gravels were also abundant throughout the sediment profiles, and
burned rocks probably accounted for no more than 20% of the total quantity of limestone rocks.

Figure 62. Sample of Lithic Debitage Recovered from TU3 on Site 41WM1271

Faunal bone was abundant in 2 of the 4 test units (TUs 3 and 4), but was comparatively
rare elsewhere on the site (Figures 63 to 65). While the faunal bone was not subjected to a
detailed taphonomic analysis, casual inspection reveals that the skeletal fragments derive from
a range of small- to medium-sized mammals, with a few fragments of larger mammals
represented. One rodent mandible fragment was observed, and 1 tooth fragment of a large
ungulate, likely a deer, was also recovered. Approximately 5% of the faunal bone assemblage
was burned (see Figure 65)
As discussed above, 1 small human cranial fragment was recovered from the bottom of
a looter pit adjacent to the location of TU 3. While this cranial fragment was not positively
identified as human until the day following the completion of fieldwork, the discovery of skeletal
elements in the looter backfill prompted a casual inspection of looter backfill eroding downslope
from the location of the associated looter pit, and a small collection of additional skeletal
materials from similarly unprovenienced contexts was made. None of the other skeletal remains
recovered from the site are definitively human. Since most of the skeletal remains found in test
excavations on the site are clearly derived from small- to medium-sized animals, it is currently
assumed that the single cranial fragment identified as human is the only piece of human
remains in the recovered assemblage. The human cranial fragment was subsequently reburied
on site 41WM1271 at the location in which it was found.
One large limestone boulder was observed on the modern ground surface during the
initial survey that was thought to be a possible nutting stone. However, further inspection of this

boulder during the supplemental survey activities indicated it was simply a limestone boulder
from which a large chip had been removed, probably during prior construction activities that
have occurred on the site.
Cultural Features
While burned rock was abundant in hand-excavated test units, and extensive scatters of
burned rock were observed in backfill adjacent to looter holes across the site, none of the
excavated burned rock exhibited any clear clustering or spatial patterning suggestive of intact
cultural features. No discrete cultural features were identified during Horizon’s investigations on
site 41WM1271. However, based on the markedly high densities of cultural materials recovered
from TUs 3 and 4, it is likely that these 2 test units contain generalized prehistoric trash midden
deposited that may classifiable as cultural features.
Site Summary
Site 41WM1271 represents the remnants of an aboriginal campsite located on the
southern terraces of Brushy Creek. As delineated during Horizon’s investigations, the site
measures approximately 120 m east to west by 30 to 40 m north to south and appears to be
associated primarily with the upper terrace of the creek. The site may extend beyond the
current project’s APE northwards as far as the bank of Brushy Creek, though the site is believed
to be constrained primarily to the second terrace above the creek. The eastern boundary of the

90

080151_arch_report

Intensive Archeological Survey for the
Proposed Brushy Creek Regional Trail Gap Project, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

site could not be systematically investigated due to dense vegetation and is therefore somewhat
arbitrary. The southern boundary is marked by the toeslope of the adjacent uplands and an
access road that has been cut adjacent to an existing sewer line.
The primary locus of aboriginal habitation on the site appears to have occurred in the
central portion of the site that has been demarcated as the grayed-out “Avoidance Area” on
Figure 47. Prior construction-related activities on the site were observed associated with the
access road and sewer pipeline along the southern site boundary, 2 old overgrown road cuts
that traverse the site, a box culvert in the southeastern corner of the site, and installation of a
line of silt fencing about 20 m north of the terrace margin. These prior construction activities
have disturbed as much as 50% of the investigated portion of the site, and surficial disturbances
extending to depths of 30 to 50 cm were observed in all subsurface probes, including backhoe
trenches and test units, excavated on the site. While archeological deposits across most of the
investigated site area extend only 5 to 30 cmbs, deeper archeological deposits extending to
depths of up to 120 cmbs were observed in scattered areas in the center of the site. Admittedly,
some of this apparent depth of archeological deposits may be artificially inflated by redeposition
of sediments from the various prior construction efforts that have occurred on the site, but there
do appear to be isolated areas of the site that contain deeper archeological deposits.
The central portion of the site, in which the deepest archeological deposits were
detected, contains an abundance of aboriginal cultural materials indicative of generalized
campsite occupations dating to the Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods based on
2 temporally diagnostic projectile points and 1 AMS radiocarbon date that falls within the latter
half of the Late Prehistoric period. While abundant lithic debitage and burned rocks were
recovered from test excavations in the central area of the site, no intact cultural features were
identified. However, 2 of the test units (TUs 3 and 4) contain markedly higher densities of
cultural materials, including large quantities of lithic debitage, burned rocks, and faunal bone,
than other investigated areas of the site, and these 2 test units may contain the remnants of
mixed prehistoric trash midden deposits. Faunal bone preservation appears to be excellent in
at least some portions of the central area of the site. Finally, 1 human cranial fragment was
found in a disturbed context at the bottom of a looter pit on the site. While this human bone
fragment was found in an unprovenienced context associated with looter activity, its presence
indicates the possibility that human burials or other disarticulated human remains may occur on
the site.
Most of the documented site area has been disturbed by a variety of prior construction
and earth-moving activities and contains only shallow archeological deposits, primarily located
around the periphery of the investigated site area. These shallow, disturbed portions of the site
do not appear to possess significant research potential regarding the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP and are recommended as noncontributing elements to the overall
eligibility of the site, and no historic-age cultural resources were observed on the site that would
warrant evaluating site significance under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The central portion
of the site does contain isolated areas in which intact, deeply buried archeological deposits
appear to be present. This portion of the site may possess the potential to contribute
meaningful information about the prehistoric past, though it was not possible to obtain sufficient

HJN 080151 AR

91

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

data at the level of investigations allowed under intensive survey to fully assess the eligibility of
this portion of the site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
As a clear determination of eligibility could not be made for the central portion of the site
that appears to contain deeper, intact archeological deposits, Horizon recommended to the City
of Round Rock that the site be avoided. The original proposed trail ROW would traverse this
central portion of the site, however, in the interest of avoiding impacts to the site, the City of
Round Rock rerouted this segment of the proposed trail ROW to run within the previously
disturbed existing ROW of an access road and existing sewer line ROW that had been cut into
the distal edge of the uplands immediately south of the terraces that contain the archeological
deposits. This proposed reroute would pass just south of the southern boundary of site
41WM1271 and would be constructed within the previously disturbed access road and sewer
line ROW (Figures 66 to 67; see Figures 47 and 48). As such, site 41WM1271 would be almost
entirely avoided, including the central portion of the site in which the deeper archeological
deposits occur. The proposed rerouted trail ROW would pass within the site boundaries only in
the site’s southwestern corner, where only surficial, disturbed archeological resources were
observed.
Archeological deposits in this small southwestern corner of the site are
recommended as noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the site. As such, the proposed
undertaking would not adversely affect any portion of the site that has the highest potential for
intact archeological deposits. Furthermore, the archeological data set resulting from Horizon’s
investigations on site 41WM1271 was relatively redundant across the site, suggesting that
further investigations within the already investigated portion of the site likely would not yield a
qualitatively different set of archeological data than has already been gathered. As such, no
further investigations are recommended on site 41WM1271 in connection with the proposed
undertaking.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of
Texas, archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory
process.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under
Section 26.8 of Part 2 of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may
designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

No cultural materials, historic or prehistoric, were observed on the modern ground
surface or in any of the excavated shovel tests in Segment A or the Segment A Extension
ROWs. Horizon excavated 22 shovel tests within the proposed Segment A ROW and 6 shovel
tests in the Segment A Extension ROW, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a
linear project area of this size.
Horizon documented 3 aboriginal archeological sites in the proposed Segment B ROW,
including a previously unstudied portion of a 1 previously recorded site, 41WM1028, located
along the northeastern edge of the site off the east side of the Arterial A ROW, as well as 2 new
aboriginal archeological sites—41WM1270 and 41WM1271 (Table 4). Horizon excavated a
total of 64 shovel tests in Segment B during the initial survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS
requirements for a linear project area of this size. Of these 64 shovel tests, 30 shovel tests

were excavated in non-site areas during the survey and 34 were excavated on the
3 archeological sites. Horizon excavated 6 shovel tests on site 41WM1028, 11 shovel tests on
site 41WM1270, and 17 shovel tests on site 41WM1271, as well as a combination of backhoe
trenches and hand-excavated test units during the supplemental survey investigations, thereby
exceeding the TSMASS requirements for site definition. Horizon also excavated a total of
6 backhoe trenches, including 3 on site 41WM1028 and 3 on site 41WM1271, as well as three
50-by-50-cm test units on site 41WM1028, six 50-by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1270, and
four 50-by-100-cm test units on site 41WM1271.

6.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, sites
41WM1028 and 41WM1270 are recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs. The central portion of site 41WM1271 appears to contain intact aboriginal
archeological deposits that are recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL; however, the surrounding portions of site 41WM1271
contain only shallow, disturbed archeological deposits that are recommended as
noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the site.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify archeological historic properties within the APE. No archeological resources were
identified on 2 of the 3 sites investigated during this survey (41WM1028 and 41WM1270) that
meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs
according to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, and no further archeological work is
recommended on these 2 sites in connection with the proposed undertaking. Archeological
resources were identified in the central portion of 1 of the 3 sites investigated during this survey
(41WM1271) that are recommended as being of unknown eligibility for listing on the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4 and for designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26. The City of
Round Rock has rerouted a segment of proposed nature trail that was originally designed to
pass through the central portion of site 41WM1271 that contains the intact archeological

deposits to run within an existing road cut associated with an existing sewer line ROW that runs
just south of the southern boundary of this site. As currently designed, the proposed rerouted
trail ROW would be constructed within a previously disturbed road cut associated with an
existing sewer line and would avoid impacts to archeological resources of unknown NRHP and
SAL eligibility on site 41WM1271. No further investigations are recommended on this site in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
Archeological clearance is recommended for the proposed undertaking as currently
designed. In the event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered
at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in
previously surveyed areas or areas recommended for clearance, all work should cease
immediately and TxDOT and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
