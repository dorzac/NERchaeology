ABSTRACT
At the request of Berg-Oliver Associates, Inc., HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas,
conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 16 kilometers (10
miles) of the Blue Water Highway (County Road 257) proposed for reconstruction in Brazoria
County, Texas. The project begins near Surfside and extends along Follets Island to its
termination at San Luis Island. Reconstruction efforts will include corrections to roadway
slope, restoration of base materials, reconstruction of roadway, and dewatering berms and
revetments placed parallel to the roadway. The proposed project would take place completely
within existing Brazoria County right-of-way which defines the area of potential effect for this
project.
The Lead Agency for this project has been identified as the Texas Department of
Transportation, Houston District (CSJ Number 0912-31-236). The goal of this study was to
assist Berg-Oliver Associates, Inc., their client, Brazoria County, and the Texas Historical
Commission in determining whether or not intact cultural resources are present within the
project area, and if so to provide management recommendations for these resources.
Field investigations were conducted from September 22 to 25 of 2009 and required
approximately 112 person hours to complete. The project is located on county-owned lands
which required permitting for archaeological fieldwork. All fieldwork and reporting activities
were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5411, issued by the Texas Historical
Commission in September of 2009. Fieldwork was completed with reference to Texas survey
standards and the Potential Archaeological Liability Map developed for the Texas Department
of Transportation which displays the project area as containing areas with both a high and low
probability for intact buried cultural materials. These are represented by Units 1 and 3,
respectively. Survey consisted of walkover, subsurface testing, and photo-documentation
within the project area. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC investigated the entire project length at the
reconnaissance level. Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 143 shovel tests in
previously disturbed and undisturbed areas. Total acreage surveyed for the project amounted to
approximately 59 hectares (145 acres).
In general, the entire project length displayed a right-of-way with high surface visibility
composed of sand and shell mix with sparse grasses and brush. Surface and subsurface
inspection of the Area of Potential Effect showed portions of it to have been disturbed by a
combination of hurricane redeposition and past activities associated with road construction
and resurfacing. Evidence of disturbance was visible at the surface and extended into
subsurface test soil profiles. Visible disturbances included asphalt and gravel rubble, drainage
ditches, culvert installation, private drives, and buried utilities within residential areas. Nearly
all subsurface tests contained modern trash that included glass bottle fragments, plastic,
asphalt, and aluminum cans within their upper strata. Testing beyond disturbed levels revealed
no evidence of cultural materials.
As a result of the archaeological survey, no new archaeological resources were identified.
Therefore, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further archaeological investigation and
that the proposed project be allowed to proceed as planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
At the request of Berg-Oliver Associates, Inc., (Berg-Oliver), HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA
Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of
16 kilometers (10 miles) of the Blue Water Highway (also known as County Road 257 [CR
257]). Brazoria County is proposing to reconstruct portions of the highway. The current
project covers an area extending from near Stanek Road to San Luis Boulevard.
On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike impacted the Texas coast, making landfall on
Galveston Island. The wave action, storm surge, and outwash associated with the hurricane
destroyed portions of the Blue Water Highway, crumbling the asphalt and pavement in some
places and covering the road with sand and debris on others. In the aftermath, emergency
procedures were enacted to initially create detours around damaged portions of the road and
eventually restore those sections of the highway to working condition. This archaeological
investigation was conducted in order to determine if the initiation of further reconstruction
activities would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), or
historic properties with the potential for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) (36 CFR 60), and to assess the potential for previously unidentified cultural resources
to be located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE).
The project is located on land owned by Brazoria County and thus required a Texas antiquities
permit prior to fieldwork. The Lead Agency for this project is the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT), Houston District. The project CSJ Number is 0912-31-236. All
fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state standards (the
Antiquities Code of Texas 13 TAC 26) under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5411 (issued
by the Texas Historical Commission [THC] in September of 2009) and federal law and
guidance for conducting cultural resources surveys pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA
(NHPA 1966, as amended [36CFR 800, 36 CFR 60]; Secretary or the United States
Department of the Interior, National Park Service [Interagency Resources Division] 1981,
1983) (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation [ACHP] 2004). The goal of this study was
to assist TxDOT, Brazoria County, and the THC in determining whether or not intact cultural
resources are present within the project area, and if so to provide management
recommendations for these resources.

1.1 Project Area Description
The project area is located in Brazoria County on the Christmas Point, Christmas Point OE S
and Freeport United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
maps. It is situated between Surfside Beach and San Luis Pass along Follets Island (Figure 1).
The proposed project will take place completely within an existing public road right-of-way
(ROW) with a width of 30 to 37 meters (100 to 120 feet). The existing roadway consists of a
two-lane road with unpaved shoulders. Reconstruction efforts would include grading,
corrections to roadway slope, restoration of base materials, reconstruction of roadway, and

plans can be seen in Appendix A.
Depth of impacts range and may be as limited as the placement of fill on the surface. A series
of revetments are also planned to be installed along portions of the project to unknown exact
depths. These revetment sections combine to total approximately 32 kilometers (20 miles)
along the north and south sides of the project length. The APE for this project entails the
existing ROW. Total acreage surveyed for the project amounted to approximately 59 hectares
(145 acres).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The following section provides a discussion of general geomorphological and environmental
characteristics found in Brazoria County. This is followed by discussions of soil morphology
and wildlife typical of the area.

2.1 Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north
as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland
areas, which includes Brazoria County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by
the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
region’s rivers. Locally, Brazoria County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks
and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001;
Van Siclen 1991). Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (Abbott
2001; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the project area consist of Barrier-island deposits.
Deposit formations along the peninsula include beach ridge, spit, tidal channel, tidal-delta, and
sand dune. These consist mostly of sand but include some silt and clay. Shells and shell
fragments are numerous. The inland side of the island includes inter-fingers of clay and silt
(Fisher 1982).
Proposed roadwork will take place on Follets Island which, along with Galveston Island,
forms the barrier island system of this section of the Gulf Coast. Although once an island,
natural processes have caused the inlets that separated Follets Island from the mainland to
become silted in thus creating a peninsula. The peninsula is bordered on the east by the Gulf of
Mexico and to the west by Christmas Bay. This strip of peninsula lies within Fenneman’s
(1938) Coastal Prairie and Marsh physiographic province. The Coastal Prairie and Marsh zone
runs along the coast stretching inland approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles), and is
characterized by 10 major geomorphological features. These include upland prairies, rivers,
floodplains, freshwater streams, freshwater marshes, meander belt ridges, saltwater marshes,
saltwater lagoons, gulf beaches, and the open gulf. The project extends through areas
composed of a mix of beach and coastal flats adjacent to coastal marsh to the north
interspersed with recent commercial development on the flats. The location contains very
slight topographic variation and a considerable amount of washover has been recorded in
recent times as the beach erodes and “rollsover” into the marshes on the inland side (Anderson
2007; Watson 2009). The peninsula contains many buried inlets that date to the Pleistocene
that have since been silted in by more recent Holocene sediments (Fielder et al. 2005). As the
project approaches San Luis Island it encounters a relative increase in elevation. Vegetation
typically consists of marshay cordgrass and gulfdune paspalum with surface visibility near
100% for the entire length of the project.

4

2.2 Soils
The peninsula is composed of barrier sands that overlay clay sediments that were deposited by
the Brazos River when it traveled through the location in antiquity (Anderson 2007). Three
soil map units have been identified in the project area. The project area contains soils
consisting primarily of Galveston fine sand, undulating (Map unit 18), Mustang fine sand
(Map unit 30), and Mustang fine sand, saline (Map unit 31). Added to these mapped soils are
beaches (Map unit 5) which are generally considered to be miscellaneous areas along the
coast. Mustang fine sand comprises the bulk of the project area. Soil descriptions provided
below were derived from Crenwelge et al. (1981), the United States Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Soil Survey Division (USDA-NRCSSSD) (2009), and the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Soil Survey Geographic (USDA-NRCS-SSURGO) database for
Brazoria County, Texas (2007).
Beaches and Galveston fine sand comprise the seaward side of the barrier island. Galveston
fine sand is composed of deep eolian sands of Holocene age found on foredunes of barrier
islands. It typically consists of a surface of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand
containing marine shells and fragments to a depth of 15.24 centimeters (6 inches). The subsoil
contains a 15.24-centimeter (6-inch) layer of pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand containing
marine shells and fragments followed by a layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand
to a depth of 76.2 centimeters (30 inches). Beyond that is a 76.2-centimter (30-inch) subsoil
layer of very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand with yellowish brown mottles.
The Mustang soil series is composed of deep eolian sands and storm washover sediments of
Holocene age found on nearly level barrier flats or shallow depressions between dunes and
low mounds on barrier islands. The series generally consists of a surface layer of brown
(10YR 5/3) fine sand containing prominent gray (2.5Y 5/1) iron depletions, olive yellow (2.5Y
6/6) masses of oxidized iron, and shell fragments to a depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches). This
is followed by a subsurface layer of pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand containing light
brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) iron depletions, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) and strong brown
(7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron, and fine shell fragments to a depth of 28 centimeters (11
inches). This is followed by several subsoil layers of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish
brown (2.5Y 5/2), and gray (5Y 5/1) fine sands with iron staining to depths of 203 centimeters
(80 inches). Mustang saline soils are much the same as their alkaline counterpart however as
the name implies include a salinity to the fine sands that comprise the soils.

2.3 Flora and Fauna
The project area is located on the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic province, and is
situated in the Coastal Prairie/Gulf Coast Marsh Regions. The primary vegetation community
in the Gulf Coast area is associated with the Gulf Prairies and Marshes, which, in Brazoria
County, is dominated by salt tolerant grasses such as Bluestem, as well as water-tolerant
hardwoods such as dewberry, live oak, water oak, magnolia, hackberry, mesquite, and other
trees (Abbott 2001; Blair 1950; Story et al. 1990; United States Army Corps of Engineers
[USACE] 1999).

5

The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum, raccoon,
skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the Texas rat
snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and turtle species. Aquatic species include a
variety of fish, including Spanish mackerel, red snapper, flounder, pompano, spotted sea trout,
redfish, tarpon, oysters, and shrimp (Jones 1982; Story et al. 1990; USACE 1999).

3.0 CULTURE HISTORY
The Upper Texas Coast (UTC) includes the area that extends from the Colorado River to the
Louisiana state line. Between the San Bernard River and Sabine Lake, most prehistoric sites
near the coast consist of shell middens found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams
(Aten 1983a; Patterson 1985). Inland sites are more similar to generalized open campsites. In
both areas, sites are found near stream channels. Historic sites tend to reflect farm or
homesteads, generally dating to the mid-nineteenth century.

3.1 Prehistoric Period
The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by Aten (1983a), Pertulla (2004),
Ricklis (2004), and Story et al. (1990). This information is merged with the archaeological
data here to give a complete picture of life on the UTC. The dating chronology used here for
the UTC is derived from Perttula (2004: Table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004: Figure 6.1.1). They list
dates of prehistoric time periods as Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian
(8000-6000 B.C.), Early Archaic (6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late
Archaic (1500-200 B.C.); Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late
Prehistoric (A.D. 700-1250), Final Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D.
1500-1700), and the Early Historic (A.D. 1700-1800) periods.
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation; much of what is known about the period in the
area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state of Texas and
across North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed the Bearing
Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson 1993;
Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993) and were
mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from mammoths,
mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried with them an easily
recognizable stone tool material culture, though admittedly, little is known about their wooden
or bone tools or their clothing types. Diagnostic points such as fluted Clovis, Folsom, and
Plainview points can be used to identify the Paleoindian component of a site and the nature of
these points demonstrate the nature of the hunting style. The above points are large and
designed to be attached to a spear. No evidence of bow and arrow hunting has been found
associated with this period (Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961).
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna, upon which the
Paleoindian peoples depended, gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply is seen as
the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Culberson 1993; Biesaart
et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961). There are 3 progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic
period: Early, Middle, and Late.
Currently, research indicates that Early Archaic peoples were small, isolated bands of huntergatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984). With the loss of the mega­
fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the hunting of smaller game such as
bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging (Culberson 1993). The material record

7

fits the transitional makeup of this period because there was a dramatic shift from the large
spear points of the Paleoindian period to a reliance on smaller “Dart” type points. Diagnostic
designs for this period are Dalton, San Patrice, Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff,
Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde, Martindale, Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester
1993). These points are relatively crudely made compared with the Paleo precursors, but
remain designed for use on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of stone
tools used. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs (Culberson
1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and procurement. Gravers,
scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone tools, also known as ground
stone tools, began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb 1961). Diagnostic points such as
Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere, Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, and Lange
dominate the spectrum of dart points from the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester
1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect [Newcomb 1961]). The advent of the atlatl also
seems to be placed within this period (Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as did
the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became socially more
complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups. Culberson (1993: 55) states that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in
which stone artifacts were made from exotic materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate,
etc.) acquired from sources great distances away. These materials were fashioned into an
increasingly complex array of household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones,
mortars and pestles, and pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the occurrence
of sandstone bowls (Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are difficult to
distinguish from those of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain prevalent in
southeast Texas, while other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel, Mahomet, Fairland,
and Castroville also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a period
marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester (1993) see
the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary stages of
Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by most (Aten
1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993) to be from this period,
though some place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations, the first
evidence of pottery began to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and variety
of pottery intensified during the Late Prehistoric, pottery is an excellent way of determining
the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora
intensifies beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no
sufficient data to demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic points
of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).

8

The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from the end of
the Archaic period to the historic period brought in by the Spanish Missions and AngloAmerican settlers. During this period there is a shift to a near total use of arrow points such as
Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993). At the time, the majority of groups had pottery.
According to Aten (1984), approximately 18 different types of pottery from this period are
currently identified for the east Texas Coast based on temper, paste, and design. It is during
this period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapan, and Bidai, are identifiable both
culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the historical sources of the seventeenth
through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.

The project occupies a location that has been suggested to represent a particular cultural
tradition largely based on the dominant pottery classifications found there. Because of the
predominance of sandy paste pottery across the region, Story et al. (1990) has suggested the
Mossy Grove Tradition as an encompassing cultural tradition for the area. Within the allencompassing region of the Mossy Grove Tradition are smaller and better defined boundaries
of distinct coastal archaeological areas defined by Aten (1983a). The project falls into an area
referred to as the Brazos Delta-West Bay Area. Unfortunately, this area has not been as
intensively researched as its neighboring area to the east, the Galveston Bay Area.
The most intensively studied region is the Galveston Bay Area. A chronological framework
covering the cultural history of the Galveston Bay Area has been developed by research efforts
of Aten, investigations around Wallisville Reservoir and the Trinity River, and cultural
resource management (CRM) projects undertaken by the USACE and the Houston
Archeological Society (Story et al. 1990). Aten (1983a) has divided the Galveston Bay Area
into chronological periods based on a change in ceramics, artifact type or a change in artifact
proportion within the archaeological record. These periods include Clear Lake (100-425
A.D.); Mayes Island (425-650 A.D.); Turtle Bay (650-1000 A.D.); Round Lake (1000-1350
A.D.); Old River (1350-1700 A.D.); Orcoquisac (1700-1810 A.D.); and an unnamed late
historic period (1810-1840 A.D.) (Story et al. 1990). These chronological periods can be used
for the neighboring archaeological areas but with some variation specific to each.
Much of the information on the UTC comes from the investigation of shell middens on or near
the coast. These middens are often identified by the presence of the brackish water clam
Rangia cuneata, which was an important seasonal food resource from the Archaic to the
Historic Periods along the UTC (Story et al. 1990). In some cases enough information
gathered from shell middens has been used to determine the season and duration of occupation
of sites (Aten 1983b). Another important source of information on the prehistoric occupation
of the UTC is derived from mortuary sites. Two of the most significant of these are the
Jamaica Beach Site (41GV5) and the Mitchell Ridge Site (41GV66). Sites such as Mitchell
Ridge and Jamaica Beach utilized ridges overlooking inlets leading into Galveston Bay and
were important seasonal destinations for the Rangia and other resources they provided. The
mortuary tradition found in the Galveston Bay region of Southeast Texas dates to the Late
Prehistoric/Protohistoric periods (Patterson 1995; Aten et al. 1976; Ricklis 1994). Burials in
this tradition are often flexed or semiflexed and are associated with locally manufactured
grave goods. Red ochre is associated with some burials. The local grave goods found in these
9

interments include marine shell beads and pendants, bird bone flutes, bone dice and awls,
fishhooks, and projectile points. In the Protohistoric and Historic periods, burials are typically
extended, with some graves being enclosed within stone structures. Included with Historic
period burials are trade goods such as glass beads, iron tools and nails, and mirror glass
fragments (Ricklis 1994).

3.2 Historic Period Brazoria County
Before European colonization, 5 different subgroups of Karankawa Indians with the northern
most tribe, called the Cocos, lived in the area of modern day Brazoria County (Aten 1983a;
Ricklis 2004). Some of the information on indigenous peoples that occupied the coast comes
from the records of Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, who in 1528 was shipwrecked on one of the
barrier islands and traveled west along the coast, crossing the Brazos River in the area that
would become Brazoria County. De Vaca identifies peoples called the Capoques and Hans,
who are thought to be the Karankawas, as the occupants of the barrier islands (Ricklis 1996).
The Karankawas are believed to have extended from Galveston Bay southwestwards as far as
the present site of Corpus Christi Bay (Aten 1984). De Vaca notes that the islands were
occupied on a seasonal basis, specifically from October to the end of February, before the
people moved inland (Covey 1983; Ricklis 1996). The Karankawas were recorded by many
others, such as French explorer Robert Sieur de La Salle who sailed into Matagorda Bay in
1685, Enrique Barroto in 1687, Alonso De León in 1689, Jean Beranger in 1720, and Joaquin
de Orobi y Basterra in 1727. The coastal islands and bays as well as other areas traditionally
home to the Karankawas were repeatedly visited by European, Mexican, and American
explorers and later colonists, creating conflict and ultimately a negative reputation of the
indigenous inhabitants. By 1820, the Karankawas experienced a decline in population and by
1840, or shortly after, abandoned their traditional homelands and most likely joined other
native groups elsewhere (Ricklis 1996).
Stephen F. Austin and 89 of Austin’s Old Three Hundred settled the area in 1824. Some of the
earliest communities were Velasco, Brazoria, and Columbia. It was in Velasco, soon after the
Battle of San Jacinto, that General Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco with the
Republic of Texas on May 14, 1836. Under this newly formed provisional government came
the formation of the first counties in Texas, among them Brazoria County, taking its name
from the Brazos River. Between 1849 and 1859, the county of Brazoria flourished. The county
became the wealthiest in Texas due in part to its largely southern society based on plantation
life and slavery. Agriculture was the foundation for the county’s economy based primarily on
sugar and cotton (Kleiner 2008a).
Prior to the Civil War, the majority of residents favored secession, which paved the way for
new industries to be organized to help the Confederate Army, such as the Dance Brothers gun
works manufacturing shop. Up until the time of the Great Depression, most Brazoria County
residents made their living from agriculture with a maximum number of farms in 1940
reaching 3065. A major boom for the economy came from the greater production of rice. By
1940, the total acreage for rice had risen from 6000 acres to approximately 16,000 acres and
became the nation’s number one rice producing area (Kleiner 2008a).

10

Brazoria County established its first school in 1827, followed by the Brazoria Academy in
1839. Academia became an integral part of the county around 1900 with the introduction of
eight independent school districts employing 200 teachers to educate the county’s 6,000
students. The results of the county’s educational efforts can be seen in the statistics of 1950
where only 23% of the population had completed high school, but in 1982 more than 65%
percent had graduated from high school (Kleiner 2008a).
Now Brazoria County offers an assortment of recreational activities, everything from fishing,
hunting, boating, water skiing, surfing, and an array of other water sports. In conjunction, they
also offer access to historic sites such as the Varner-Hogg Plantation State Historical Park.
3.2.1

Surfside Beach, Follets Island, and San Luis Island

The peninsula was once known as Velasco Peninsula, drawing its name from the city of
Velasco located to the west along the east bank of the Brazos River. The peninsula is one of
the possible locations where De Vaca ran aground in 1528, although other possible locations
include San Luis Island to the east and Galveston Island. With the exception of indigenous
groups such as the Karankawa, the peninsula was generally uninhabited by those of EuroAmerican descent. However, the locations at either end became important to the development
of the area and to the establishment of Texas.
San Luis Island, located at the eastern end of the peninsula is thought to derive its name from
Spanish explorer Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, who after De Soto’s death in 1542, commanded
the remainder of the Soto’s entrada along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas to reach Mexico
in 1543. The area remained largely devoid of non-indigenous habitation until Stephen F.
Austin was granted a league of land on San Luis Island in 1832 and surveys showed the waters
surrounding the island were deep enough to accommodate passage of sailing vessels (Jones
2008). With the idea that the island could operate as a shipping port, plans were made for
methods of transporting goods from plantations located on the Brazoria River the island.
Between the time of the initial surveys in 1832 and 1836, 40 houses were constructed on the
island in what became the town of San Luis. A ferry and a halfway house were put into
operation by the family of John Baldbury Follett in 1836 to take passengers, commodities, and
livestock from San Luis to Galveston Island. These ferries navigated two passes, a wider pass
known as Big Pass to the east separating San Luis from Galveston and a narrower pass known
as Little Pass to the west separating San Luis from the peninsula.
The population of San Luis eventually reached 2000 by 1840 and eye-witness accounts
describe hotels, 2 general stores, cotton press, a local newspaper titled the Advocate, and a
post office. A developer by the name of George Hammeken successfully marketed San Luis
Island’s potential as a shipping mecca and a shipyard was constructed sporting a 1000-foot
long wharf along with many warehouses. The prosperity that the island enjoyed was short
lived as traffic into the harbor became limited due to the infilling of silt, storms repeatedly
ravaged the area, and a financial depression swept through the Republic of Texas. By 1853,
only 400 to 500 residents remained of a town that once boasted a population of 2000. A
hurricane that year drove away most of those who remained. Although the island was largely
abandoned by the late 1800s, the Folletts continued to operate the halfway house, which was
reported to have been swept away in a storm according to the Galveston Daily News on
11

September 21, 1875. Little Pass eventually filled with silt and joined the island to the
peninsula some time after 1885. The final blow to the island was the great storm of 1900
which destroyed what remained of the town of San Luis. Much of the original town is now
underwater due to shoreline erosion but a modern residential area exists. Developers in the late
1960s and 1970s pushed for a water system on the peninsula and created the Treasure Island
Municipal Utility District (TIMUD). Since then the population has steadily grown and with a
new water system installed in 1992, the quality of life in the area was greatly improved.
Recently, 25 residents were reported to occupy the tract of land that was once San Luis Island.
The western portion of the peninsula is occupied by the town of Old Velasco on the Brazos
River. This location was instrumental to the immigration of American colonists into Texas and
an important site in the battle for Texas Independence from Mexico (Weir 2008). The western
end of the current project nears a resort area known as Surfside Beach. This resort was popular
until the hurricane of 1900 destroyed it. The area encountered a renewed growth after it was
brought into the Brazosport industrial community in the 1940s (Kleiner 2008b). Since then the
area has encountered modest growth with a reported population of 763 people in 2000.

3.3 The Blue Water Highway and Hurricane Ike
The push for construction of the Follets Island portion of the Blue Water Highway began in
the mid 1950s. It was stated that the road was crucial for increased tourism for Surfside as well
as commercial development of the area (The Galveston Daily News 1957). Previous to that
time, it seems that only shell roads on private land were available for traffic (The Galveston
Daily News 1955, 1958). As originally planned the highway was to entail a 7.3-meter (24­
foot) wide paved surface atop a flexible base with 1.2-meter (4-foot) shoulders on either side
and built to an elevation of 1.5 meters (5 feet) (The Galveston Daily News 1957). The road
was eventually built and opened for traffic in 1967.
On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall at Galveston Beach, Texas. The storm
surge reached over 3 meters (10 feet) above sea level in some locations along the upper coast.
Photography of the project APE taken before and soon after the hurricane shows the amount
of damage to some sections of the road (see USGS 2008; http://www.houstonfreeways.com/
modern/2008-10-19 fm3005 destroyed.html). It appeared that damage to private property and
residences along the project area was far less severe than at other locations along the coast,
however the damage to the stretch of highway in the project area was perhaps the most
extensive of anywhere along the coast. What affect the hurricane had on the population of the
peninsula is unknown.

4.0 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Site File Research and Literature Review
The site file research and literature review was performed in order to identify all previously
recorded archaeological sites and previous investigations within 0.8-kilometers (0.5-miles) of
the project area. This work was conducted by reviewing online data available on the Texas
Historical Commission Online Archaeological Sites Atlas (THC-OASA), an online resource
maintained by the THC, as well as an online database of the NRHP
(http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com). Historic maps from the collection of David
Rumsey (2003) were also consulted in cooperation with Google Earth (Burr 1839; United
States General Land Office 1867) and researching maps maintained by the Texas General
Land Office (GLO) (2009).
Cultural resources identified during this literature search included previously recorded
archaeological sites and previously conducted cultural resources surveys. This work was used to
provide a historic context to the archaeological survey and additional documentary research
was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development and history of the
APE and the surrounding area in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview
history of the area and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Brazoria
County’s prehistory and history.

4.2 Field Survey
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were designed to
identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic, within the
defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the collection of data needed
in order to determine whether additional investigations would be required to evaluate the
potential eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for inclusion on the NRHP or as a
State Archaeological Landmark (SAL).
Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface reconnaissance and subsurface testing on
linear projects call for 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), within a 30-meter (100-foot)
wide corridor or 2 shovel tests per acre for projects between 4.45 and 40.47 hectares (11 and
100 acres) in size. Our survey strategy used THC standards as a guide, while focusing survey
efforts on sections of the road reconstruction that would be subjected to a greater degree of
subsurface impact.
Survey of this project area consisted of shovel testing, photo-documentation, and pedestrian
reconnaissance. To facilitate record keeping and to measure survey progress, the project length
was divided into mile-long segments. Subsurface testing, photos, and field notes were all
referenced to these mile segments. One to 2 transects were placed on each side of the existing
road within the ROW. For recording purposes, Transect A was located on the south side of the
road and Transect B was located on the north side of the road. Surface inspection was
performed by walking 2 transects in all areas where surface visibility allowed for an
13

examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than 30%). For the current
project, this entailed the entire 16-kilometer (10-mile) length of the proposed reconstruction.
Walkover transects were spaced approximately 7 meters (24 feet) apart and covered an area
extending from the road pavement to the edge of the ROW. These were recorded as Transects
A1 and A2 on the south ROW and Transects B1 and B2 on the north ROW.
Subsurface testing was performed along the entire length of the project. This was done along a
single transect within each ROW, designated as Transect A on the south ROW and Transect B
on the north ROW. Subsurface testing was accomplished by shovel and performed at a
combination of regular intervals and judgmental basis. Areas planned for revetment were at
the greatest risk of subsurface impacts, thus these areas were tested more intensively.
Revetment areas were typically shovel tested at 100-meter (320-foot) intervals unless visible
signs of previous subsurface disturbances were evident. Areas planned for shallow, near
surface impacts, or where visible signs of previous subsurface impacts were evident were
subsurface tested on a judgmental basis. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing
standing water or areas directly above where underground utilities had been installed. A
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver capable of sub-meter accuracy data
recording was used to assist in mapping survey results.
Shovel testing consisted of 30 by 30-centimeter (11 by 11 inch) diameter tests excavated to a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39.3 inches) into the underlying substratum. Vertical
control was maintained by excavating each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One
wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected
for color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features. Soils
were screened through ¼ inch wire mesh and descriptions of soil texture and color followed
standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional information
concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each excavation.
Photographs of the project APE and adjacent areas were taken with a Kodak digital camera and
information for each photo recorded on a photo log form.
Despite the high potential nature of the soils themselves, the impacts that have occurred in the
proposed APE reduce the potential for locating intact cultural deposits within the proposed
project depth of impact. The proposed project area has been subjected to numerous natural and
cultural disturbances. Natural disturbances include shore erosion, tropical storms, and
hurricanes such as Ike. Cultural disturbances include leveling, grating, installation of buried
cable and utilities, and possibly bringing in fill from an off-site source.

4.3 TxDOT’s Houston-PALM
The Texas Department of Transportation’s Houston-PALM (Abbott 2001) covers Brazoria
County and other counties in the greater Houston area. These maps are based on a
combination of data, including soil associates, landform types, cultural and natural resource
distribution, and historic and modern land use data. The Houston-PALM is a cultural resource
management tool that predicts the likelihood of detecting intact prehistoric cultural resources
in various topographic settings around Houston and its vicinity. The model recommends the

14

type of archaeological survey strategy that should be implemented for a given PALM Unit, of
which there are 4 major groupings. For Houston-PALM Unit 1, surface survey is
recommended and deep reconnaissance is only recommended if deep impacts are anticipated.
For PALM Unit 2, only surface survey is recommended. Potential Archaeological Liability
Map Units 3 and 3a are similar and recommend no surface survey, although Map Unit 3
recommends deep reconnaissance if deep impacts are anticipated, while Map Unit 3a
recommends deep reconnaissance only if severe impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 4, no
survey is recommended.
The majority of the project area is classified as PALM Unit 1, although the southwestern and
northeastern ends are located within areas classified as PALM Unit 3a. No deep or severe
impacts are anticipated for this project. Impacts will be within the existing ROW. Therefore,
shovel testing was conducted to depths equal to those of known archaeological sites in the
vicinity and equal to anticipated construction impacts, which are likely to be shallow and
typical of road construction projects. For areas designated as PALM Unit 1 and those areas
including planned revetments, shovel tests were placed at 100-meter (300-foot) intervals and
at additional judgmental locations depending on observed environmental conditions. For areas
classified as PALM Unit 3a, the same methods were applied since portions of these areas are
also planned for the installation of revetments.

4.4 Site Definition
Cultural resources, if located, were to be defined according to THC standards (as referenced in
13 TAC 26.20). However, no sites were located during survey and thus a discussion of site
definition is not included within this report.

15

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The primary purpose of this investigation was threefold; 1) determine if any previously
identified cultural resources or National Register properties were located within a 0.8kilometer (0.5-mile) radius of the proposed project APE; 2) to determine if any previous
cultural resource investigations had been conducted in or near the project area, and; 3) to
determine if previously unrecorded cultural resources are located within the current APE.

5.1 Results of Site File Research and Literature Review
The Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC, indicates
that 2 previous investigations have been conducted within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the
project area (Figure 1). One previously recorded archaeological resource has been identified
within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project area (Figure 1). Other nearby resources include
three historical markers, 2 SALs, and 6 shipwrecks.
5.1.1

Previous Investigations

Two previously conducted cultural resources investigations have been conducted within 0.8
kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project area. Both of these come into contact with the project
APE. An area survey conducted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) in 1984
covered approximately 30 hectares (76 acres) along the beach south of the highway and the
marsh north of the highway. No information was found concerning this survey, but it appears
that no cultural resources appear to have been located as a result. A previously conducted
linear survey was also performed by the TPWD in 1984. This project area extends from the
beach to the Old Intracoastal Waterway and along its edge for a total distance of
approximately 2.2 kilometers (1.4 miles). During the course of that survey’s alignment, it
crosses the Blue Water Highway. Again, no information was found concerning this survey but
it appears that no cultural resources appear to have been located as a result. It is possible that
these surveys were part of a state-wide effort to inventory cultural resources within the Texas
Parks System (see Ralph 1984) undertaken from 1976 to 1981 but this is unclear.
5.1.2

Known Archaeological Resources

Only 1 previously recorded archaeological site is recorded within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of
the project APE. This consists of Site 41BO157, a shipwreck located in the Gulf of Mexico.
The ship was the S.S. Acadia, a blockade runner during the Civil War. The Canadian ship
became grounded in heavy fog off the beach of the peninsula. It was later shelled by the
U.S.S. Virginia but not before its cargo had made it to shore. While much of the ship itself has
deteriorated over time, some of its contents are housed at the Houston Natural Science
Museum (Arnold 1985). The site was designated as a SAL in 1986 (THC-OASA 2009a). It
was also dedicated with a historical marker in 1977 (THC-OASA 2009b). While the
shipwreck itself is within the current project’s study radius, the marker is located outside of
the study area in the community of Surfside.

16

Two areas dedicated with historical markers are located within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of
the project APE. One of these is the shipwreck Acadia discussed above. The second is the site
of Titlum-Tatlum, a small island off of San Luis that was used as a crucial base for blockade
runners during the Civil War (THC-OASA 2009c). A third marker is located outside of the
study radius but pertains to the town of San Luis, once located on San Luis Island. The town
was once a thriving community in the mid-1800s but several storms, an economic depression,
and silting of the shipping lanes caused it to eventually become abandoned. Much of what was
the original townsite is now underwater due to shoreline erosion. A historical marker
dedicated to the town was erected in the year 2000 (Jones 2008; THC-OASA 2009d).
Two resources designated as SALs are located within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project.
Both of these are shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico. One of these is the shipwreck Acadia,
mentioned above. The other is the shipwreck Admiral Foote. This is a steamship that was lost
off the coast in 1867. It was designated as a SAL in 1983 (THC-OASA 2009e).
Six shipwrecks are recorded within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project APE. These are
listed in Table 1 below.

5.2 Results of Fieldwork
Based on photos of the ROW taken immediately after Hurricane Ike (Plate 1), it is obvious
that much of the project has been restored (Plate 2). White pylons used to mark detours around
washed out sections of road were still visible in places along the road. Many sections of the
road have been resurfaced with asphalt due to emergency procedures authorized after the
storm. Scour pits / outwash channels that are characteristic of hurricane activity can be seen
just outside of the APE to the south along many sections of the project length (Nummedal et
al. 1980; Watson 2009). Heavy rains that occurred before and during fieldwork may have
contributed to the inundation these scour pits. The project APE, subsurface test locations, and
the most extensive resurfaced portions of road are shown on Figures 2 through 6. Note
however that aerial imagery showing current field conditions were not available for figures so
plates have been included within this report that should be consulted for the present conditions
of the APE.
It was apparent that restoration of the road ROW and resurfacing activities have involved the
removal or bulldozing of old road rubble and sand. For sections of the road where rubble has
been bulldozed, most appear to have been pushed to the seaward (south) side of the ROW,
perhaps to replace protective dunes that were washed away by the hurricane or to create new
protective measures. Clay was visible as linear piles along the south side of the ROW for some
stretches of the project and also witnessed in some shovel tests. It is unclear if this material
was from the original road construction, if it was brought in for emergency road restoration, or
if it was from a natural deposit such as an abandoned inlet (Israel et al. 1987). In one section
of restored road, riprap and silt screens could be seen eroding out from beneath the surface.
As with the clay material, it is unclear if this material was from the original road construction
or if it was part of the emergency road restoration construction. What follows is a mile by mile
assessment of the APE with descriptions of current conditions and representative subsurface
tests. Although representative subsurface tests are described within the text below detailed
descriptions of all subsurface tests are provided in Appendix C of this report.
5.2.1

Mile 0-1

This section of the project contained intermittent areas of inundated scour pits that abutted the
south ROW. Much of the mile contained a line of tall grass and shrub-covered sand dunes
along the south side of the ROW. The surface was clearly visible and shell fragments and
modern trash were abundant. The north side of this mile of project contains buried fiber-optic
cable. Approximately 0.2 kilometers (0.1 mile) of this mile includes plans for a proposed
revetment located on the south side of the road. A total of 12 shovel tests were placed within
this mile segment. Most of these were placed near the start of the project near the planned
revetment area. These tests gave the first indication of the overburden that was likely caused
by storm surge. A representative shovel test for the section of project can be seen in Test A5
(see also Figure 7). This test displayed a damp dark brown (10YR 3/3) sand containing shells
and shell fragments to a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches). This was followed by a 5­
centimeter (2-inch) thick layer of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy soil to a depth of 30
centimeters (12 inches). This appears to be the pre-hurricane buried surface. Beyond that was

a continuous layer of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand containing shell fragments and
iron staining to a depth of 100 centimeters (39 inches). Water seepage into the test was not
visible in this test but was often encountered at the 90-centimeter (35-inch) mark. The north
side (Transect B) of this segment displayed the same buried surface horizon although overall
soils were more disturbed, likely due to the buried cable located within the north ROW. A
single judgmental test placed near the center of the segment on the A transect (Test A8)
displayed a different profile from that seen near the start of the project. Test A8 displayed
damp dark brown (10YR 3/3) sand and shell mix to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches)
followed by a layer of dense reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay to a depth of 55 centimeters (22
inches) (Figure 7). This reddish brown clay would be seen later along the project. Tests on
both sides of the road often included fragments of broken bottle glass, plastic, aluminum cans,
and gravel and asphalt.
5.2.2

Mile 1-2

This section of the project contained a long section of residential area with housing on both
sides of the road (Plate 3). Private drives, beach access roads, culverts, and buried utilities
allowed few subsurface testing along this segment. The line of tall dunes that were present
along the south side of mile segment 0-1 continued until within 100 meters (328 feet) of the
residential area. Approximately 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) of the south side of the road and 0.1
kilometer (0.06 miles) on the north side of the road are planned for revetment installation. A
total of 7 shovel tests were placed within Transect A of this mile segment. Five of these were
placed within the planned revetment portions but outside of residential areas. Two judgmental
tests were also undertaken. These were placed outside of revetment locations on Transect A.
Tests displayed soils similar to those in mile segment 0-1 with damp dark brown (10YR 3/3)
sand to depths of 35 centimeters (14 inches) with modern trash diminishing with depth and
iron staining increasing with depth and shell fragments throughout.
5.2.3

Mile 2-3

This section of the project continued the residential area of the previous segment. Buried fiberoptic cable was evident within the north ROW. Dunes were no longer present along the
seaward side of the road but grassy maintained ROW existed along both sides. Revetments are
planned for both sides of the road along this entire mile segment. However, subsurface tests
were not performed until clear of residential areas. A total of 17 shovel tests were placed
within this mile segment. Tests within this segment showed more evidence of disturbance than
those near the project start. They typically exhibited a clay-sand mottling at the surface. A
representative test of this segment is A8. This test contained lumps of reddish brown (5YR
5/4) clay mixed with yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 to 5/6) sand to a depth of 40 centimeters (16
inches). Shell and modern trash fragments were contained throughout but lessened with depth
with iron staining increasing. Water seepage often began at a depth of 75 centimeters (30
inches).
5.2.4

Mile 3-4

Mile 3 to 4 of the project covered an extensive part of landscape devoid of residential areas.
Although grassy maintained ROW was visible on both sides of the road, several inundated

scour pits were located outside the southern ROW. Small sections of road have been
resurfaced. Buried fiber-optic cable was evident within the north ROW. Revetments are
planned for the entire south side of the mile segment and for approximately 1 kilometer (0.6
miles) along the north side. A total of 29 shovel tests were placed within this mile segment.
Tests within this segment showed a range of profiles. Tests showed profiles similar to those
recorded previously with yellowish brown (10YR 5/4-5/6) sand mixed with shell, glass
fragments, and modern trash to a depth of 90 centimeters (35 inches). Water seepage began
filling the test. Continuing the test another 10 centimeters (4 inches) produced saturated gray
(10YR 5/1) coarse sand. Several tests contained a similar profile, however many tests on both
sides of the road (but more so on the north side) contained the buried sandy organic dark
brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/3 to 3/4) layer previously seen in other tests buried
approximately 10 to 20 centimeters (7 to 8 inches) below the surface.
5.2.5

Mile 4-5

Half of Mile 4 to 5 of the project is similar to that of the previous segment with grassy/sandy
ROW. However, the eastern half of the mile segment appears to have been severely damaged
during the hurricane. This is based on the extensive modification of the landscape that has
taken place. As in the previous segment, there are several inundated scour pits coming right up
to the southern edge of the south ROW. The east half of the segment has been resurfaced.
Further, rip rap and silt screens have been installed on the south ROW. These were clearly
visible through surface cracks of the silty clay sand that appears to have been used as fill.
What appears to be the former road has been dozed along the seaward edge of the south ROW
to create a line of rubble approximately 1 meter (39 inches) or more high (Plate 4). As in
previous segments, the buried fiber-optic cable continued along the north ROW. A revetment
is planned for the entire mile along the south ROW but this appears to already have been in
place on the east half of the survey segment. For this segment, subsurface tests were
performed at a steady interval along the south ROW until reaching the resurfaced and
modified portion of the south ROW. Judgmental tests were placed along the north ROW to
confirm previous disturbance. A total of 13 shovel tests were placed within this mile segment.
Tests within this segment began with profiles similar to those of the last segment, with
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 to 5/5) sand and shell mix to nearly 1 meter (39 inches) in depth.
A buried sandy organic (surface) horizon continued to be seen primarily on the north ROW
(Transect B). This changed upon reaching the resurfaced section of ROW. From that point
eastward, the soils consisted of black (5YR 2.5/1) clay mixed with reddish brown (5YR 4/3)
clay with fragments and large pieces of asphalt mix in. The rest of this segment was subjected
to walkover with inspections of the subsurface visible through cracks in the fill which clearly
displayed the riprap and silt screening below.
5.2.6

Mile 5-6

Segment Mile 5 to 6 of the project continued the resurfaced portion of road that began in the
previous segment. However the clay fill and riprap that extended below surface on the south
ROW stopped near the beginning of this segment and gave way to heavy vegetation on both
sides of the road. Buried fiber-optic cable was evident within the north ROW. A revetment is
planned for approximately 1.2 kilometers (0.8 miles) along the south ROW. A total of 18
shovel tests were placed within this mile segment. Tests within Transect A of this segment

28

continued to show the clay and asphalt fill that was present in the previous segment, although
to a lesser extent. As survey progressed east, the subsurface profiles became more sandy but
still contained clay nodules and asphalt fragments. Shovel Test A8 displays what may be
considered a representative test from the south ROW of this segment. This test contained
yellowish-brown (10YR 5/4) sand mixed with shell, glass fragments, asphalt, and modern
trash to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) followed by a thin layer of reddish brown (5YR
4/3) clay to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches). After the clay lens, the yellowish-brown
(10YR 5/4) sand and shell mix continues to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) at which
point water seepage began filling the test. Continuing the test another 10 centimeters (4
inches) produced saturated grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sand (Figure 7). Judgmentally
placed tests on the north ROW were similar to those examined previously with a buried dark
brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/3 to 3/4) organic layer buried approximately 10 to 20
centimeters (7 to 8 inches) below the surface.
5.2.7

Mile 6-7

This survey segment of the project curves to the south and makes a close approach to the
beach. Perhaps due to the hurricane, this segment now appears to be on the beach with beach
sand on both sides of the ROW (Plate 5). It is presumed that much of this portion of the
highway was washed out as the half-mile section that curves toward the gulf has been
resurfaced. Not surprisingly, a revetment is planned for approximately 1.3 kilometers (0.8
miles) of the south ROW. A total of 16 shovel tests were placed within this mile segment. As
recorded previously, the predominant soil profile seen in Transect A of this segment showed
light yellowish brown to yellowish brown (10YR 6/4 to 10YR 5/4) sand and shell mix with
iron staining at greater depths. Few tests displayed dark gray (5YR 3/1) clay beneath the sand
as well as fragments of asphalt. Also witnessed were traces of a buried organic surface layer at
shallow depths. This was predominantly seen on the north ROW.
5.2.8

Mile 7-8

This survey segment of the project curves back away from the beach. It begins near some
condominiums at the intersection of CR 257 and Amigo Lane. The ROW on both sides
appeared grassy and maintained. However, there were many stretches of inundated scour pits
to the south of the south ROW. Traces of trenching undertaken for buried fiber-optic cable and
other utilities were most evident along the north ROW of this segment (Plate 6) and short
sections of old utility conduit were exposed on the south ROW. A small portion of resurfacing
has taken place on this segment. The south ROW also appears to be highly compressed along
this mile and perhaps was used for detour access or had a widened shoulder at some point. No
tests were undertaken near the residential areas. Revetments are planned for both sides of the
road totally approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.4 miles) of length. A total of 14 shovel tests were
placed within this mile segment. Tests within this segment showed light yellowish brown to
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4 to 10YR 5/4) sand and shell mix with iron staining at greater
depths. Few tests displayed dark gray (5YR 3/1) clay beneath the sand as well as fragments of
asphalt. Also witnessed were traces of a buried organic surface layer at shallow depths. This
was predominantly seen on the north ROW.

5.2.9

Mile 8-9

This survey segment of the project curves toward the beach, which contained many inundated
scour pits beyond and on occasion in the south ROW (Plate 7). As in Segment Mile 6 to 7
much of this section has been resurfaced. It is presumed that much of this portion of the
highway was washed out due to the hurricane. The area is quite low and appears to be on the
beach. The north ROW borders a marshy area that contained a large amount of standing water,
which is characteristic of the area but also due in part to recent heavy rains. Buried fiber-optic
cable is evident on the north ROW. A revetment is planned for installation along the entire
1.6-kilometer (1-mile) south ROW. Much of this mile was subjected to walkover with
judgmental shovel testing. A total of 10 shovel tests were placed within this mile segment.
The predominant soil profile seen in this segment showed yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand
and shell mix as well as fragments of asphalt to a depth of 35 centimeters (14 inches) mottled
with and followed by dark gray (5YR 3/1) clay beneath the sand. This profile was seen on
both sides of the road.
5.2.10 Mile 9-10
This survey segment of the project curves north toward what was once the island of San Luis
and terminates at San Luis Boulevard. Approximately half of this segment has been
resurfaced. This portion of the highway has clearly been built up to rise above the marshy
ground which borders the north and south ROWs (Plate 8). Buried fiber-optic cable is evident
on the north ROW. Revetments are planned for installation along the north and south ROWs
for a length of approximately 0.5 kilometers (0.3 miles) on each. The area planned for
revetments has been resurfaced. Much of this mile was subjected to walkover with judgmental
shovel testing. A total of 7 shovel tests were placed within this mile segment. Shovel Test B2
displays what may be considered a representative test from this survey segment. This test
contained a dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy silt, shell, and gravel mix mottled with dark gray
(5YR 3/1) clay to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) (Figure 7). This profile was seen on
both sides of the road.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an archaeological survey conducted on 16 kilometers (10
miles) of property proposed for the reconstruction of the Blue Water Highway (CR 257) in
Brazoria County, Texas. The APE for the project consists of exiting public road ROW.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, initial investigation consisted of a background literature and
site files search to identify the presence of recorded cultural resources in close proximity to the
project area. No previously recorded resources are located adjacent to or within the current
project’s APE, and will not be affected by construction. One previously recorded
archaeological resource, a shipwreck located off shore, has been identified within 0.8
kilometers (0.5 miles) of the project area.
Field investigation took place in September 2009 and included visual reconnaissance,
subsurface testing, and photo-documentation of the entire APE. Subsurface testing involved
the excavation of 143 shovel tests to depths between 35 and 100 centimeters (14 and 39
inches). Total acreage surveyed for the project amounted to approximately 59 hectares (145
acres).
During this investigation, no new or previously identified archaeological sites were recorded
during the investigation. The recent age and well-drained nature of these soils typically put
them in a class considered to have a high probability for containing buried cultural remains
(Abbott 2001). However, in the context of the current project this must be re-evaluated. The
location of the current project is within previously constructed and recently modified and
disturbed ROW. Surface and subsurface inspection of the APE showed portions of it to have
been disturbed by a combination of hurricane redeposition and past activities associated with
road construction and resurfacing. Other disturbances include drainage ditches, culvert
installation, private drives, and buried utilities. Testing results displayed soils those that are
mapped for the area. Nearly every test showed evidence of disturbance extending to depths of
approximately 50 centimeters (20 inches). This was seen as modern trash, asphalt and gravel
rubble, nodules of clay within the sand, and dense layers of clay. Testing below disturbed
layers produced no evidence for cultural materials.
Many sections of road have been resurfaced as an emergency response to damage caused by
Hurricane Ike in September of 2008. On at least one section of road riprap and silt screening
was visible below the surface of the ROW. The water table was often reached at a depth of 90
centimeters (35 inches) or less in some locations. The exception to this was areas where the
ROW was clearly built up by fill, mainly near the end of the project as it approached San Luis
Island.
During this investigation, no new or previously identified archaeological sites were recorded.
In regards to 36 CFR 800, the results of this survey specifically fall under section § 800.4(d.1):
No historic properties affected. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological
work is required and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
