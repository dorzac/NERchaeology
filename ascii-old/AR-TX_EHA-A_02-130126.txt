Abstract
Between July 8 and November 10, 2013, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted a Phase I
cultural resources survey for the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project on behalf of the City of
Brownsville Public Utilities Board. The proposed project consists of 49.89 miles (80.29 kilometers)
of new 24-inch natural gas pipeline located in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, Texas. The survey
was conducted within a corridor that measured approximately 300 feet (91 meters) wide and
included examination of some areas in addition to the current proposed pipeline alignment. A total
area of approximately 3,076 acres (1,245 hectares) was surveyed this project. As the survey
corridor is located on publicly owned and/or controlled lands, compliance with the Texas
Antiquities Code is required, and work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit 6643. A
total of 141 labor days were worked associated with the fieldwork.

The survey resulted in the documentation of two newly recorded sites (41CF218 and the modernage La Feria de las Flores Cemetery), components of four historic-period irrigation districts, two
isolated finds (prehistoric lithic artifacts), and revisits to two previously recorded archeological
sites (41CF196 and 41HG82). The two isolated finds are recommended not eligible for inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. The
eligibility of site 41HG82, the historic Cementerio de las Burras, for inclusion in the NRHP and
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark is unknown based on survey-level data alone.
Nonetheless, Atkins recommends the proposed pipeline construction avoid impacts to 41HG82 by
maintaining a 75-foot buffer between the proposed impacts and the presumed boundary of site.
Although located within the initial survey corridor, sites 41CF196, 41CF218, and the La Feria de las
Flores Cemetery will be avoided by the proposed construction due to revision of the current
proposed alignment and therefore no adverse effects to these resources are anticipated. A number
of irrigation resources documented during the survey are associated with NRHP-eligible irrigation
districts; however, proposed construction activities at each of these locations do not appear to
constitute an adverse effect to the resources under Section 106. As a result, no further
consideration of impacts to the resources in connection with the proposed pipeline construction is
anticipated.
Based on results of the pedestrian survey and background review, Atkins conducted exploratory
archeological trenching in several high probability areas within the survey corridor along the
current proposed alignment. Additionally, several workspaces were not surveyed during this effort.
If any additional cultural resources are found in these locations an addendum report will be
provided summarizing the findings. Three proposed trench sites were not excavated due to
landowner issues at the time of both field sessions. It is recommended that these three areas be
monitored by a qualified archeologist at the time of the pipeline excavation for the presence of
buried archeological remains and to complete the geoarcheological study of these areas. These

Abstract
trenching and survey activities took place between January 30 and February 1 and again between
April 29 and 30, 2014 and are reported in Addendum D.

Once consultations with the Texas Historical Commission are complete, Atkins recommends that
construction activities be allowed to proceed without further consultation. Should evidence of
archeological sites be encountered during construction, work in the immediate area should cease,
and a qualified archeologist should be called upon to evaluate the evidence and provide
recommendations for how to manage the resource under the Stateâs Historic Preservation Plan.

I. INTRODUCTION
Between July 8 and November 10, 2013, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted a Phase I
cultural resources survey for the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project on behalf of the City of
Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB). The City of Brownsville Public Utilities Board is
proposing construction of 49.62 miles (79.86 kilometers [km]) of new 24-inch natural gas pipeline
in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed project begins near Brush Line
Road 5 miles (8 km) east of Faysville and continues in an east-southeast direction to its termination
near the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 511 and Old Alice Road in Brownsville, Texas.
As the survey corridor is located on publicly owned and/or controlled lands, compliance with the
Texas Antiquities Code is required, and work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit
6643.

Based on maps available at the time of Texas Antiquities permit application and estimated typical
construction design, anticipated construction impacts for the majority of the project are limited to a
corridor approximately 300 feet (ft) (91 meters[m]) wide stretching the entire length of the project
that includes the proposed permanent easement as well as all temporary and permanent work
space to a depth of approximately 8 ft (2.4 m) below ground surface. The proposed project will
bisect two floodways under the jurisdiction of the United States International Boundary and Water
Commission (USIBWC) in Cameron County, Texas. At each crossing, the proposed pipeline will be
installed by horizontal directional drill (HDD). This technology will avoid surface impacts to each
floodway. HDD entry/exit points will be a minimum of 300 ft (91 m) outside of the north and south
levees demarcating the USIBWC boundary at the North Floodway and 300 ft (91 m) outside of the
USIBWC regulated floodway at the Arroyo Colorado. The proposed project location west and east of
each floodway has been heavily disturbed by intensive agricultural activities. No new access roads
will be constructed at the proposed project locations.

In total, an area of approximately 3,076 acres (1,245 hectares) was surveyed during this project,
which includes areas in addition to the current proposed pipeline alignment. Although the original
scope of work for this project exempted the two USIBWC jurisdictional areas from this survey, as no
archeological or historic properties would be adversely affected by the proposed project at these
locations based on the nature of the soils, historic disturbances associated with agricultural
activities at HDD entry/exit locations, and review of previously documented sites recorded at these
locations, Atkins completed pedestrian survey of these areas at the clientâs request.

This investigation was performed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (PL 89-665), as amended, and the Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resources Code of
1977, Title 9, Chapter 191) (Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6643); and in accordance with the
Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800), the Rules of
Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code [TAC], Title 13, Chapter 26), and guidelines set
forth by the Council of Texas Archeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

I. Introduction
Compliance with provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Section 711) was also required as
cemeteries were encountered in the vicinity of the project survey corridor.

The objectives of the survey were to (1) locate cultural resource sites (both archeological and
standing structures), if any, within the survey corridor, (2) delineate the vertical and horizontal
extent of any identified sites, (3) assess site integrity, and (4) provide a preliminary evaluation of
each identified siteâs potential eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and/or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). Dale Norton served as
Principal Investigator for the investigation. Field personnel included Don Badon, Karissa Basse,
Rhiana Casias, Steven Cummins, Virginia Hatfield, Mel Nichols, Mike Smith, and James P.
Washington under the direction of Project Archeologists Michael Nash and Darren Schubert. A total
of 141 labor days were worked associated with the fieldwork. Robert A. Rowe, Maximilian Jewett,
and Jonathan Oliver conducted the trenching and geoarcheology study.

This report is divided into seven sections and four appendices. Following this introduction, Sections
II and III discusses the general environmental setting and cultural background information
pertinent to the project. Section IV is a summary of the purpose of the investigations and the
methods used for the literature and records review and for conducting the fieldwork. Section V
summarizes the results of the investigation. Section VI provides conclusions and recommendations.
Section VII lists references utilized to compile this report. The appendices contain overview maps of
the project area showing the areas surveyed and locations of cultural resource sites and identified
isolated finds; a copy of the Notice of Existence of a Cemetery as submitted to the Hidalgo County
Clerk; photographs of the historic irrigation resources identified during the survey; and the results
of the test trenching and geoarcheological study.

II. NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
This section provides an overview of the natural environment surrounding the proposed Cross
Valley Pipeline Project. Specific relevant information for such an overview consists of the regionâs
geology, soils, and terrestrial resources (flora and fauna). Characteristics of the natural
environment that affect the nature and preservation of cultural resources are also noted.

The project area lies within the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf
Coastal Plain ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004). The Western Gulf Coast Plain maintains a relatively
flat topography with predominantly grassland vegetation adjacent to the coast. Moving inland, the
regionâs plains are older, more irregular, and have mostly forest or savanna-type vegetation. The
Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the ecoregion predominantly consists of Holoceneaged alluvial sands and clays of the Rio Grande. Historically, the floodplain ridges once had
abundant palm trees, and early Spanish explorers called the river âRio de las Palmasâ (Griffith et al.
2004). However, most large palm trees and floodplain forests had been cleared by the early 1900s.
Currently, the region is dominated by cropland with rice, grain sorghum, cotton, and soybeans as
the principal crops. In addition, urban and industrial land uses have expanded greatly in recent
decades, and oil and gas production is common. Channels for irrigation and urban use have mostly
diverted the waters of the Rio Grande with little or no flow reaching the Gulf of Mexico.
Elevations throughout the region range from sea level to approximately 100 ft (30 m) above mean
sea level. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 35 inches (40 to 89 centimeters [cm]),
occurring mostly in the spring and fall. Summers are often characterized by drought conditions that
are frequently of sufficient duration to depress crop growth.

GEOLOGY

The current Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mix of riverbank, shore, marsh, and lake settings with
the amalgamation of silty and sandy flat floodplain giving rise to shifting stream channels. This
system of altered steam channels results in the resacas and oxbows and meander scars that
are found throughout the region. These structures are perpetually affected by wind-borne
sediments (Butzer 1982).

Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), the river valley has changed dramatically.
Ocean levels had risen approximately 100 m causing the course of the Rio Grande to shorten
with the influx of the rising sea water, which caused an increase in valley aggregation (Brown et
al. 1980). After the last glacial maximum by the middle of the Holocene, the Rio Grande was
depositing alluvial soils and ultimately flooding the valley several times (Boyd et al. 1994).
These flooding episodes created an estuarine environment (Brown et al. 1980). The filling of
the valley ceased between 10,000 and 7000 B.P., resulting in additional soil aggregation
manifested as prograding delta lobes over earlier Holocene deposits. Sea level reached its
100033612/130126

4

II. Natural Environment
present level at around 3000 B.P., and due to the rising water, the lobes were reworked, eroded
away, and redeposited.

The geology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley consists of Holocene (>10,000 years),
Pleistocene (10,000â2 million years [my]), and Pliocene (12.5â4.5 my) fluvial and deltaic deposits
(Brown et al. 1980). Multiple high, level Pleistocene terraces border the Holocene floodplain and
delta complex. These terraces were formed by fluvial-deltaic deposition during maximum sea
level periods and under glacial minimum conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene (Paine
2000). Overlying the terraces are extensive windblown deposits of sand and clay dunes,
interspersed with sand sheets and localized wind deflation areas. Holocene stabilized sand
dunes occur as broad, segmented expanses of northwestward-trending aeolian deposits (Mallouf et
al. 1977:9â10). These deposits usually have a height of 1 to 9 m. The surface relief of the
stabilized sand dunes is typically undulating with occasional aeolian depressions of varying size
and shape (Mallouf et al. 1977:9â10). Because of the active nature of these windblown deposits,
archeological sites may be repeatedly buried and eroded. In addition, the depressions that can
occur in them possess the capability of retaining water for a limited time after rains and, given
the importance of water in the arid landscape, would have been attractive to prehistoric animals
and people.

The oldest bedrock deposit within the project area is the Pliocene epoch Goliad Formation (12.5â
4.5 my). It is exposed in eastern Hidalgo County and manifested as fluvial deposits composed of
clay, sand, sandstone, caliche, chert, limestone, and dark siliceous granules and pebbles in a caliche
matrix (Brown et al. 1980). This formation is the source of much of the locally obtained raw
materials used for prehistoric stone tools within the region (Bousman et al. 1990).

The Lissie Formation overlays the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation as an unconformity
in eastern Hidalgo County. The formation was deposited during the Oligocene into the middle
Pleistocene and ended at 14,000 B.P. and included at least 14 continental glacial advances
interspersed by warmer periods (Day et al. 1981). The Lissie Formation consists of gray to
brown to pale yellow clay, silt, sand, siliceous gravel, and sandy caliche. Pockets of stabilized
sand dune deposits characterized by dense live oak copses and scrub vegetation occur within
the formation (Brown et al. 1980).

Within eastern Hidalgo County and northwestern Cameron County is the Beaumont Formation of
the Late Pleistocene, which is exposed as matrices of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to a depth to 270 m.
The sediments composing the Beaumont Formation were primarily deposited by rivers and
include natural levees and deltas that coalesced through shifting of the river mouths as they
reached the coast. The marine element of the formation is much less pronounced and includes
marine and lagoonal waters in the embayments between the stream ridges and delta plains
(Sellards et al. 1966). Archeologically, the age of these deposits precludes the presence of deeply
buried sites, but may contain megafaunal remains.

SOILS
The soils of 17 soil series have been mapped within the survey corridor from USDA soil maps of
the area (Table 1) (Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture [NRCS]
2013). These soils can be grouped into five soil orders: Vertisols, Mollisols, Inceptisols, Entisols, and
Aflisols. Soils in the project vicinity date from the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Holocene; the age of the
soils roughly correlates with their position relative to the Arroyo Colorado. In general, soils north of
the Arroyo Colorado are Pliocene and Pleistocene in age, although there are some Holocene-aged
soils within the floodplain north of the Arroyo Colorado. South of this water body, the soils are
Holocene in age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976), and so could have the potential to harbor
archeological deposits.

TERRESTRIAL RESOURCES
The native flora of the Lower Rio Grande Valley is a mixture of elements from diverse geographic
origins (Correll and Johnston 1970; Gould 1975). Blair (1950) includes south Texas and adjacent
northern Tamaulipas in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation
in this province. Because of more luxuriant growth in Cameron, Starr, Willacy, and Hidalgo
Counties, Blair (1950) separates this area from the rest of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province by calling
100033612/130126

II. Natural Environment
it the Matamoran District. The immediate project area is principally a mixture of coastal prairie
grasslands, thorn-scrub and cultivated fields. Plant species that occur in the area include black
mangrove, buffalograss, curly mesquite, saltcedar, sumpweed, mesquite, yucca, and prickly pear
cactus (Hatch et al. 1990).

Extreme southern Texas has a very diverse faunal assemblage. Wildlife typical of the Tamaulipan
Biotic Province includes many species of the Neotropical, Texan, and Kansan Biotic provinces and a
few species common to the Austroriparian and Chihuahuan provinces (Blair 1950). Animals
common in the region are Virginia opossum, nine-banded armadillo, longtailed weasel, striped
skunk, hog-nosed skunk, coyote, bobcat, black-tailed jack rabbit, cottontail, javelina, and whitetailed deer (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Thirty-six species of snakes and numerous species of
rodents also live in the area (Blair 1950).

III. CULTURAL SETTING
This section presents information concerning the cultural setting of the proposed project area by
providing a chronological summary of human occupation in the region. The chapter summarizes
the prehistoric setting and different prehistoric and historic time periods followed by a brief
description of the results of the review of previous archeological investigations and recorded sites
within 0.5 mile (0.8 km) of the project location.

PREHISTORIC PERIODS

Paleoindian Period (11,500â8000 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period in South Texas is recognized by the presence of projectile points such
as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura. These points coupled with
spears aided in the pursuit of large game animals. Although intact deposits containing evidence of
Paleoindian occupations are unknown in South Texas, evidence from sites in adjacent regions
suggests the period was characterized by low population density, small bands, and large
territorial ranges of nomadic groups that subsisted by hunting Late Pleistocene megafauna. During
this period, great expanses of land were inundated by the rising sea levels. Temperatures may
have been 10â15.4 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than today (Bousman et al. 1990:94).

The scant evidence of Paleoindian occupations in the South Texas region includes Clovis
points found at archeological sites in Wilson, Dimmit, and Atascosa Counties as well as at the
Southern Island site on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande at Falcon Reservoir (Hester 2004).
Folsom artifacts have been found on the Rio Grande Plain, such as preforms and failures in
Webb County and near Falcon reservoir, and isolated finds such as a Folsom projectile point
base recovered from 41CF54 near Laguna Atascosa in Cameron County (Terneny 2005).
However, no Folsom camp or kill sites have been found in the region (Hester 2004). Later
Paleoindian projectile points have been recovered mostly from the northern extent of the region,
such as Golondrina, Plainview, Angostura, and Scottsbluff types from Uvalde, Bexar, Victoria, and
Williamson Counties (Terneny 2005). Noted Paleoindian sites in the South Texas Archeological
Region include Berger Bluff (41GD30) in Goliad County, 41WY140 in Willacy County, and the
Johnston-Heller (41VT15), J2 Ranch (41VT6), and Willeke (41VT16) sites in Victoria County.

Archaic Period (8000â1200 B.P.)

The Archaic period witnessed a shift to an exploitation of a wider range of plant and animal
species, coupled with a decrease in mobility that was probably associated with climate change.
Perennial steams existed in some areas of the local draws, but extensive freshwater ponds
producing diatomaceous muds also began to appear where discharge declined. Water in the lakes
and ponds fluctuated, sometimes completely drying up. By the end of the period, many of the
100033612/130126

8

III. Cultural Setting
streams ceased to flow and the diatomite lakes evolved into muddy marshes. The transition from
flowing water to standing water represents a dramatic hydrologic change in the area. The
widespread decrease in water was the result of decrease in regional effective precipitation from
the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene. This decrease affected both runoff and spring discharge.
Paleontological data (Graham 1987; Johnson 1986) document this environmental change as well
as sedimentologic and stratigraphic information (Holliday 1995), which caused streams that
formerly flowed year-round to dry up.

Such a drastic, though perhaps gradual, loss of primary food sources exploited in the
Paleoindian period would have caused considerable cultural stress. It was probably this stress
that caused a shift of attention to previously unexploited plants and animals. Throughout the
Americas, the Archaic was a time of increasing technological (and probably social) complexity.
Toolkits become larger, and through time the many regional differences slowly coalesced into
more-homogenous forms. This includes an emphasis on the exploitation of marine resources in
coastal zones (Terneny 2005). The Archaic period is often divided into the Early, Middle, and Late
periods with additional divisions such as complexes and horizons attributed to the Archaic
throughout the region. These include the Repelo (4000â2000 B.P.) and Abasolo (4000â2000 B.P.)
complexes identified by MacNeish (1947) and the early corner-notched horizon (circa 8000â
5500 B.P.) and the early basal-notched horizon (circa 5600â4500 B.P.) outlined by Hester (2004).
However, overall the period is also poorly understood in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and
sites dating to this time, especially Early and Middle Archaic sites, are rarely encountered and
are limited to surface finds. Late Archaic sites are more common, but are often mixed with Late
Prehistoric-aged deposits (Kibler and Freeman 1993).

Early Archaic (6000â2500 B.C.)

Like the Paleoindian period, sites associated with the Early Archaic are rare in South Texas, and
areas such as the Rio Grande Delta and Sand Sheet have no representative sites for this time
(Terneny 2005). Hesterâs distinction between the early corner-notched and the early basal-notched
horizons is primarily derived from data generated from Central Texas and the Lower Pecos areas
with stronger cultural chronologies (Hester 2004). Representative artifacts associated with the
early corner-notched horizon include early expanding-stem (Bandy, Martindale, and Uvalde) dart
points and the Guadalupe distally beveled tool (Terneny 2005). The subsequent early basalnotched horizon includes Bell and Andice points, early triangular bifaces, and Clear Fork tools
(Hester 2004; Terneny 2005). The Mackenzie site (41VT17) in Victoria County produced Bell
points and radiocarbon assays indicating an Early Archaic occupation and thus became the oldest
shell midden in South Texas (Ricklis 1986).

Middle Archaic (2500â400 B.C.)

The Middle Archaic is identified by an easily recognized change in material culture patterns.
This includes assemblages in South Texas consisting of triangular dart point forms, known as
100033612/130126

III. Cultural Setting
Tortugas, Abasolo, and Carrizo. In addition, smaller unifacially distally beveled tools and
stemmed projectile points have been recovered in the northern part of South Texas. These points
include Pedernales, Lange, Langtry, and Morhiss (Hester 2004). Information on settlement
patterns during this period is sparse. However, substantial data from Choke Canyon and
Chaparrosa indicate that open campsites were located along former stream channels early in the
period before relocating to floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees later in the period
(Hester 2004). Survey work in Willacy and Hidalgo Counties has yielded dart points that may
be Archaic (Mallouf et al. 1977). However, work at Falcon Reservoir showed that some of these
types continue into the Late Prehistoric period (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Investigations at the
cemetery site Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County yielded detailed information on Middle
Archaic burial practices derived from 205 burials, which included interments with dart points,
stone pipes, shell ornaments, and deer antlers (Taylor and Highley 1995).

Late Archaic (400 B.C.âA.D. 800)

Dart points associated with the Late Archaic are small, with corner or side notches. Examples
include Shumla, Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Montell, Fairland, and Ellis. Tools diagnostic of this period
in South Texas include Olmos bifaces, Nueces scrapers, and corner tang bifaces (Black 1989:51).
Examples of Late Archaic sites include Choke Canyon (41LK201), the Johnson site, the KentCrane site (41AS3), and a site at Ingleside Cove. At Choke Canyon, hearths, earth ovens, and
manos and metates have been found, which illustrate exploitation of plant resources. Also
recorded at the site were faunal remains of deer, rabbit, turtles, fish, and other species, as well as
evidence that peoples were exploiting Rabdotus snails and mussel species (Hall et al. 1987).
Additional data from Choke Canyon illustrate that favored locales for open campsites are on
stream channels and their adjacent sloughs.

Late Prehistoric Period (circa A.D. 800â1600)

The Late Prehistoric occupation of the area by hunter-gatherer inhabitants has been often
referred to as the âBrownsville Complex.â This complex has been defined on basic analysis and
characteristics observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number
of cultural resource surveys. However, Terneny (2005:225) argues that the â. . . [Brownsville
Complex] artifact sets thought to be present only in the Late Prehistoric burial situations were
present in the Archaic as well.â She goes on to say: âAs such, the âBrownsville Complexâ must be
redefined in terms of its presence in the Archaic and Late Prehistoric; cemeteries and burials
that contain âBrownsville Complexâ artifacts cannot automatically be assumed to belong to the
Late Prehistoricâ (Terneny 2005:225).

Therefore, this Late Prehistoric section provides a summary of the Late Prehistoric period of
South Texas by Hester (2004) and a summary of the Brownsville Complex. However, the
Brownsville Complex summary should be understood as needing further research to determine a
100033612/130126

III. Cultural Setting
more precise temporal affiliation (see Terneny 2005 for a more-in-depth discussion). Although
a hunting and gathering lifeway continues in the Late Prehistoric as in the Archaic, the material
culture, hunting patterns, settlement types, and other facets of the era mark a fairly distinctive
break with the past (Hester and Turner 2010). In this time period, the bow and arrow and pottery
are introduced, along with other distinctive types of stone tools (Hester and Turner 2010). As
with any time period distinction, there is limited evidence to suggest that a new phase of
cultural history was launched by the immigration of new peoples into the region as opposed to
cultural diffusion or by the coming of a radically new mode of subsistence such as agriculture.
The mode of organization of the Late Prehistoric people appears to mirror the full expression of
traits already in existence. Therefore, it appears the Late Prehistoric societies took certain
practices begun in the Archaic period and refined them to various degrees, which ultimately
transformed the whole way of life.
The Late Prehistoric in southern Texas shares cultural patterns with Central Texas (Hester 2004).
This includes transitional Archaic âdart pointsâ such as Ensor and Matamoros, and Late
Prehistoric Scallorn arrow points found at Blue Bayou (41VT94) in Victoria County and a burial
site in Frio County. The main marker for the Late Prehistoric in the region is the occurrence
of the Toyah horizon. Artifacts associated with the Toyah horizon include the Perdiz arrow
point, small end scrapers, flake knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators,
shell ornaments, and assorted ornamental beads and objects (Hester 2004). These have been
found at sites in Jim Wells County (41JW8) and Live Oak County (41LK201) and at other sites
closer to central Texas. Although sites closer to the project areas in Zapata and Webb Counties
often yield Perdiz points and some combination of Toyah-trait artifacts, the whole assemblage is
not present, with bison often absent (Hester 2004).

The bulk of our knowledge of the archeology of the Late Prehistoric in South Texas is from
MacNeishâs (1958) definition of two closely related complexes, the Brownsville and Barril, for
the Lower Rio Grande area. This cultural complex has been defined on basic analysis and
characteristics observed from small surface collections, salvage excavations, and a small number
of cultural resource surveys. Common to both complexes are shell disks, pierced shell disk
beads, plugs made from a columella that are round in cross section, rectangular conch shell
pendants, mollusc shell scrapers, and Starr, Fresno, and Matamoros projectile points. Intrusive
artifacts include pottery of Huastec origin from southern Tamaulipas, which appears in occupation
sites and in burials (Anderson 1932; MacNeish 1947; Mason 1935), as well as obsidian and
jadeite used in pendants. Burials of individuals are tightly flexed and located away from living
areas.
The largest known Brownsville/Barril site near the p r o p o s e d project area is located
approximately 19 miles ( 3 0 km) southwest of the western end of the survey corridor and is
known as the Ayala site (41HG1); the site is located on a bluff of a resaca and consisted of at
least 45 flexed burials with associated burial materials. The site has been heavily looted, but it

has also been subjected to an archeological excavation (Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and
Ruecking 1969).

Protohistoric Period (circa A.D. 1600â1800)

The Protohistoric period is described as the transition period between the prehistoric and
historic periods. The beginning of the period is attributed to the arrival in the early 1600s of
Europeans (Spanish) to South Texas (Hester 2004). Native American sites from the final period are
distinguished by the presence of European and nonaboriginal American trade goods that date
from the sixteenth through mid-eighteenth centuries. Debris on Protohistoric sites indicates a
continuation of the nomadic hunting and gathering existence that was begun during the Archaic
period. The best account of the native peoples of Texas comes from the chronicle of Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez
Cabeza de Vaca, a survivor of a Spanish shipwreck in 1528 (Covey 1972). These first Spaniards
encountered as many as 50 different groups living in the immediate area. Many of these
indigenous people were identified as speaking the Coahuiltecan language of southern Texas and
northeastern Mexico (Salinas 1990).

The Coahuiltecan language is similar to the Karankawan, which was spoken by coastal
peoples north of Corpus Christi up to the west side of Galveston Bay (Swanton 1940). From
Corpus Christi, the Coahuiltecan area extended northwestward to San Antonio, westward to just
below the confluence of the Pecos River and Rio Grande, and southward into Nuevo Leon,
northeast of Coahuila, northern San Luis Potosi, northeastern Zacatecas, and northern Tamaulipas.
Coahuiltecan peoples were originally considered to be linguistically related to the Hokan groups
of languages in California (Ruecking 1955; Sapir 1920; Swanton 1940). The theory of linking the
prehistoric languages of Texas and California was known as the âHokan Hypothesesâ (Lyle
1997). Current studies suggest that Coahuiltecan was an isolated language (Lyle 1997).

Research has indicated that the Coahuiltecans probably never existed as a single tribe.
Rather, groups with similar language were identified by the Spanish as Coahuilteco, presumably
because the native homeland of many groups was Coahuila, Mexico. By the 1850s, a combination
of European-introduced diseases and tribal wars stimulated by Europeans had decimated the
Indians of South Texas (Campbell 1958). There is no extant Coahuiltecan tribe today; however,
there is a group based in the San Antonio area that calls itself the Tap Pilamâthe Coahuiltecan
Nation. They are not a federally recognized tribe at this time, but the tribe has filed a petition for
recognition by the Secretary of the Interior that the group exists as an Indian tribe (Federal Register
1998).
There are no indigenous tribes extant in the area. Modern tribes that in the past have been active
in this part of Texas include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. The Comanche and Kiowa,
who both were mobile Southern Plains tribes, came into South Texas following herds of wild
mustangs and bison as well as to raid Mexican towns near the present-day international border.

III. Cultural Setting
The traditional homeland of the Lipan Apache included the area between the Texas Panhandle
and the Hill Country of Central Texas; however, they conducted incursions into South Texas.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT IN HIDALGO AND CAMERON COUNTIES

The Lower Rio Grande Valley, with its rich and diverse history, has long played a pivotal role in the
history of the vast territories that extend on either side of the river. Because of its strategic location
upstream from the mouth of one of the great waterways of North America, the region has been an
important center of activity since the sixteenth century.

Colonial Contact and Early Settlement Period

Spain was the first European nation to lay claim to the region including present-day Hidalgo and
Cameron Counties and to make contact with the Native American groups living in the region.
Spanish exploration in the Rio Grande Valley may have occurred as early as 1528 when Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez
Cabeza de Vaca reportedly traveled through the area following his shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico;
however, this theory remains unsubstantiated. After a series of attempts to settle other areas in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley by Gonzalo de Ocampo (1523), Sancho de Canielo (1528), and Pedro de
Alvarado (1535) proved unsuccessful, Spanish activity in the area centered on maintaining their
sovereignty over the region rather than on encouraging colonization. As a result, subsequent
exploration of what became Hidalgo and Cameron Counties was only initiated in response to feared
encroachment by other European nations (Dixon et al. 2003).

For example, in 1638, Jacinto GarcÃ­a de Sepulveda crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico (then
Spanish territory) in search of Dutch sailors reported to be in the current Hidalgo County area. The
expedition âmarched down the north bank of the river as far as the site of present Brownsvilleâ
(Garza and Long 2013b). Other excursions into modern Hidalgo and Cameron Counties were made
by Alonzo de LeÃ³n in 1687 in search of a French fort on the Texas coast and in 1747 by Miguel de la
Garza FalcÃ³n, who traveled north of the Rio Grande in search of an area in which to establish a
settlement. FalcÃ³n was unimpressed and characterized the land north of the river as unfit for
settlement or for stock raising (Garza 2011a).
Despite FalcÃ³nâs opinion, the Spanish crown was determined to settle the region and tasked JosÃ© de
EscandÏn with colonizing the area along the Rio Grande. In 1746, he was appointed âconquistador
and governor of Nuevo Santander,â the larger region containing the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and
began the process of settling the area that continued throughout his 23-year-long career. He
founded 23 settlements in all (Dixon et al. 2003), four of which were located south of the river in or
near present-day Hidalgo County. These settlements, including Reynosa (1749), Camargo (1749),
Mier (1750), and Revilla, or present-day Guerrero (1752), were different from traditional Spanish
colonization efforts in that they were not centered on a strong military and/or religious presence,
but relied instead on civil defense and governance (Dixon et al. 2003). Some of these settlers

100033612/130126

13

III. Cultural Setting
migrated and settled north of the river, forming communities âalong the river as well as in the
northern reaches of the future countyâ (Garza 2011a).

In 1753, residents of the area requested official, individual land allotments from the Spanish Crown.
Spain did not begin surveying and granting land possessions until 1767, at which time land was
granted on the basis of merit and seniority. Colonists were classified as âoriginal,â âold,â and
ârecentâ settlers, with the original settlers receiving the perceived best porciones. Riverfront
acreage was most valuable, as river access gave settlers the ability to irrigate their land and
provided a shipping channel. Thus, surveyors laid out riverfront porciones in long, narrow strips
extending several miles to the north. Larger grants were made north of the riverfront porciones and
were usually composed of significantly more acreage. These grants were typically intended for
livestock grazing, and many were granted to influential citizens of EscandÏnâs original settlements
(Lang and Long 2011).

Early settlement in present day Cameron County during the Spanish Colonial period was initiated
with the establishment of the community of San Juan de los Esteros (or present-day Matamoros)
along the southern banks of the Rio Grande. Ranchers there often used the lands along the northern
bank of the river as pasture for their livestock. In 1781, the Spanish government âgranted fifty-nine
leagues of land . . . on the north bank of the river (including all of the site of Brownsville) to JosÃ©
Salvador de la Garza.â He established a ranch in the area, and though several other grants were
issued in present day Cameron County during the Spanish and Mexican periods, it was still sparsely
settled at the advent of the Texas Revolution (Garza and Long 2013b).

Early landowners found the land conducive to livestock ranching, and several large-scale ranches
formed in the Lower Rio Grande area. Small communities of ranch workers and their families soon
developed in association with these ranches. Ranching continued to characterize the regionâs
economy through the remainder of the eighteenth century and into the period of Mexican
sovereignty. As original grantees died and passed their lands to their heirs, the large ranches began
to be subdivided. Through these subdivisions, new communities developed, and settlement
expanded to more remote parts of the region.

Mexican Sovereignty and the Texas Republic Era

Mexico received its independence from Spain in 1821, and the new government continued the
practice of encouraging settlement in the lower Rio Grande Valley, âespecially along the navigable
stretch of the river between the Gulf and Roma in Starr Countyâ (Dixon et al. 2003). During this
period, scattered ranching enterprises continued to characterize the local landscape. The key shift
in local development that occurred during the brief period of Mexican ascendency involved the
increasing importance of trade to the regional economy, which was a result of and in turn prompted
an influx of American and European entrepreneurs and settlers âseeking economic opportunitiesâ
(Dixon et al. 2003).
100033612/130126

14

III. Cultural Setting
It was also during this period that steamship service was inaugurated along the Rio Grande. Henry
Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, arrived with his steamer Ariel from New York on June 29,
1829. Despite Austin's grand intentions, the operation of the steamboat was not profitable. The
difficulty of navigation on the river and the lack of cooperation and participation among Mexican
merchants were prime factors for its abandonment in September 1830. Austin then took the vessel
to the Brazos River (Graf 1942). Although its impact on commercial trade was hardly noticeable,
the arrival of Austin's steamboat ushered in an era that gained considerable significance in
subsequent decades.

Texas' struggle for independence, for the most part, bypassed the Lower Rio Grande Valley, as most
military and political events took place farther north. Following the war's conclusion, 4,000 soldiers
of Santa Anna's defeated army converged on Matamoros and depleted much of the available food
supplies. Commerce and trade in the town and nearby areas diminished with this sudden influx, but
its effects were only temporary. Soon, the economy rebounded and residents went on about their
business (Thompson 1965).

After the Republic of Texas was officially formed and was truly independent of Mexico, territory
between the Rio Grande and Nueces River was claimed by both countries. The inability of each
government to effectively control or exert much influence in this area left many residents
vulnerable to attack by Indians and roaming bands of "soldiers" of both countries. Another event
that increased tensions occurred in 1839 when Francisco Viadaurri and others declared that a new
nation, the Republic of the Rio Grande, was being formed from the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon,
Chihuahua, Coahuila and Tamaulipas, including the Lower Rio Grande. Laredo, a settlement
established in 1755 by Jose de Escandon was selected as the capital of the newly-formed republic.
Unlike the Texas war for independence, this rebellion was successfully quelled by Mexican forces
(Webb 1952).

The Mexican War

Disputes between Mexico and the United States erupted into full-scale warfare over the location of
the boundary between the two countries. The United States recognized the Rio Grande as the sole
boundary, while Mexico recognized the Rio Grande only to the headwaters of the Nueces River and
from that point following the Nueces to its mouth near Corpus Christi. Present day Hidalgo and
Cameron Counties were part of the disputed territory during the Mexican War. The dispute reached
an impasse and President James Polk, in an effort to reinforce the American position, ordered
General Zachary Taylorâs army to the disputed areas. Taylorâs infantry, artillery, and support units
arrived in Corpus Christi via steamer from New Orleans, while his dragoons traveled overland from
San Antonio. Personnel from his army surveyed the area across for Matamoros, selecting a site for
the armyâs encampment.

100033612/130126

15

III. Cultural Setting
Taylorâs army arrived at the Rio Grande following a brief skirmish with Mexican irregulars at
Arroyo Colorado. Taylor immediately began receiving dispatches from the Mexican commander
General Mejia ordering the Americans to withdraw from the Rio Grande. When Taylor refused, the
Mexican army placed artillery along the riverbank south of the fort. Taylor responded by placing his
own heavy artillery in position to fire on Matamoros and ordered his chief engineer, Captain Joseph
K.F. Mansfield to construct defensive works. Mansfield constructed a six-sided earthen bastion,
800 yards in circumference, with walls 8.5 to 9 ft in height and surrounded by a ditch 20 ft wide and
9 to 10 ft deep. The fortâs earthen ramparts were topped by wood and mud parapets and the
bastions were protected by sandbag merlons between gun embrasures (Mahr-Yanez and Perttula
1995). Before the fort could be completed, Taylor was informed by Captain Walker of the Texas
Rangers that Mexican General Arista, now commanding the Mexican forces, had crossed the Rio
Grande downstream from the American army and was marching towards the American base at Port
Isabel. Taylor, in a night march, beat the Mexican army to Port Isabel and secured his supply line. In
his absence, he left Major Jacob Brown in command of the newly constructed fort, along with the
7th U.S. Infantry.
On May 3, the Mexican artillery opened fire on the fort. Major Brown responded with his artillery,
destroying one Mexican gun and forcing the Mexicans to reposition the others. The Mexican
infantry next attacked, but were repulsed. In an artillery bombardment on May 6, Major Brown
received a mortal would, dying on the afternoon of May 9.
After securing his supply base at Port Isabel, General Taylor returned to relieve the fortâs defenders.
On the return march, his forces encountered those of General Arista at Palo Alto and Resaca de la
Palma and inflicted severe casualties, forcing the Mexican army to retreat. Upon learning of Major
Brownâs death, Taylor ordered the fort named after him and pursued the Mexican army into
Matamoros.

All subsequent fighting took place within Mexico, thus, the battles at Palo Alto and Resaca de la
Palma were the only ones north of the Rio Grande. Hostilities ceased with the signing of the Treaty
of Hidalgo on July 4, 1848. Provisions of this agreement established the Rio Grande as the boundary
between the two countries, but also recognized land titles issued by the Spanish and Mexican
governments. All public lands, however, were granted to the State of Texas (Thompson 1965).
At the conclusion of the war with Mexico, counties were formed throughout southern Texas.
Cameron County was created by the Texas legislature and originally included 3,308 square miles
âincluding parts of Hidalgo, Willacy, Kenedy, and Brooks Countiesâ (Garza and Long 2013b).
Hidalgo County was formed in 1850 and named for Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Mexican patriot
(Dixon et al 2003).

Another significant event during this period was the designation of the Old Military Road. Zachary
Taylor oversaw the laying out of this road that connected Brownsville and Rio Grande City. The
100033612/130126

16

III. Cultural Setting
route, roughly paralleling the Rio Grande, became a major transportation artery through the area,
linking many established communities and providing the impetus for the foundation of more
communities along its reach during the antebellum period. The route likely paralleled or followed
established trails linking area ranches and associated communities. Following the MexicanAmerican War, the road continued to serve as a shipping route for cotton and other goods and as
the Rio Grande valleyâs main travel artery. The road was paved and improved by the 1960s and still
serves as a major transportation thoroughfare for the region (Jones 2011).

Nineteenth-Century Ranching and the Transition to Commercial Cultivation

By 1850, a number of large ranches were operating in present-day Cameron and Hidalgo Counties.
The ranches not only served as the economic mainstay for residents, but also influenced local
community development during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. For example, some of the
first communities established in Hidalgo County were developed in support of large ranches. La
HabitaciÏn, at the site of present-day Hidalgo, formed in association with Rancho San Luis in 1749
(Garza 2011b). The city of McAllen owes its roots to the McAllen Ranch, originally known as the
Santa Anita Ranch, founded circa 1797 by JosÃ© Manuel GÏmez, an original Spanish grantee (Garza
2011c). Present-day PeÃ±itas originally served as the âcommon grazing groundsâ for EscandÏnâs
Villa de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de Reynosa located south of the Rio Grande in the mideighteenth century. After 1850, the community was associated with numerous populous ranches in
the area, including those of RÏmulo MartÃ­nez and JesÃºs Chapa CantÃº (Garza 2011d).
Ranching continued to be an important part of the local economy during the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries; however, the advent of irrigation and increased Anglo-American
migration to the area increased the significance of commercial agriculture during the period. One
example of an early commercial agricultural operation located in Hidalgo County was the San Juan
Plantation, named by owner John Closner. Closner began acquiring land in the area in 1884, and his
plantation eventually contained 45,000 acres. He was an innovator in the area and transformed the
land through a system of irrigation canals and a water pumping plant, creating the first irrigation
system from the Rio Grande. These efforts inspired the extensive irrigation systems now present in
both counties. Diverse crops were grown on the plantation, including sugarcane, alfalfa, tobacco,
vegetables, fruits, melons, and nuts, and he traded on both sides of the river. Many families worked
on the plantation, and a community developed in the area with a school and general store
(McKenna 2011a; Texas Historic Sites Atlas 1964). George Paul Brulay introduced irrigation on a
small scale near Brownsville in 1876, but irrigation remained limited in both counties through the
turn of the twentieth century (Garza and Long 2013b).

Railroad Era and Early-Twentieth-Century Development

The arrival of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway to the Rio Grande Valley in 1904
dramatically affected regional development patterns and increased the significance of commercial
100033612/130126

17

III. Cultural Setting
agriculture further. New communities sprang up along the railway and subsequent lines that
intersected this route, and old settlements originally founded around ranches grew into sizable
communities. Notable examples in Hidalgo County include the community of Pharr, which was
originally part of lands granted to Juan JosÃ© Hinojosa in 1767 by the Spanish government. The
Hinojosa family resided in the region through the 1880s during which time the area remained
predominantly undeveloped. In 1909, partners John Connally Kelley Sr. and Henry N. Pharr
purchased 16,000 acres containing the future community. Pharr, a Louisiana sugarcane farmer and
founder of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company, became the namesake of the community.
Pharr became a stop on the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway by 1911 (Garza 2011e;
Meyers [Myers] and Weitze 1995) and was the center of an agricultural boom that characterized
development in the area during the early twentieth century.

McAllen, which was a small community associated with the McAllen/Santa Anita Ranch established
circa 1797, also experienced a period of growth with the arrival of the railroad. In 1904, when the
Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the site,
members of the BallÃ­ and McAllen families, proprietors of McAllen Ranch, donated land to allow the
railroad to cross their property. The McAllen Townsite Company formed later that year and named
the new townsite McAllen. McAllen grew at a steady, yet somewhat slower rate than other railroad
towns in the area due to competition from neighboring communities. However, the town
incorporated in 1911 and experienced a population boom during the late 1910s as a result of
federal troops being stationed in the area during World War I (Garza 2011c).
Similarly, the communities of Harlingen and Brownsville in Cameron County grew significantly
after the arrival of the railroad. Harlingen was founded in 1904, the same year the railroad arrived
in the area. Early promoters thought the nearby Arroyo Colorado could be used as a commercial
waterway; however, like other communities in the region, the cityâs economy was based almost
solely on agriculture during the early twentieth century (Gilbert 2013).

Brownsville already existed prior to the arrival of the railroad, though development there had
stagnated dramatically during the postbellum period due to lack of railroad access and a deep
water port facility. After the construction of the railroad, not only did the agricultural economy of
the area diversify with the planting of the first citrus crop in 1904, but rail access also initiated
dramatic infrastructure improvements in the community as the city sought to make itself appealing
to the influx of new immigrants from the American Midwest. Growth continued through the first
decades of the twentieth century, and in the 1930s, the Port of Brownsville and associated shipping
channel opened, making the city an international trading port (Garza and Long 2013a).

Irrigation and the Creation of the âMagic Valleyâ

Contemporaneous with the emergence of the railroad and its influence on local community and
economic development patterns, irrigation was also advancing in Hidalgo and Cameron Counties.
100033612/130126

18

III. Cultural Setting
Advances in irrigation technology and the development of major irrigation systems increased both
large-scale commercial farming and small-scale irrigated farming in the area. As previously
mentioned, the first irrigation system in Hidalgo County was developed in 1895 to serve the San
Juan Plantation located on the banks of the Rio Grande. This private system was composed of
pumping stations, canals, and laterals (McKenna 2011b). The American Rio Grande Land and
Irrigation Company, incorporated in 1905, constructed a massive system of pumping stations,
canals, laterals, and settling basins in Hidalgo County. This system, like many others, was a public
system in that it sold water to private landowners, allowing an increase in irrigated farmland (Goza
2011).
Between its inception and the 1920s, irrigation was the impetus for a steady pattern of AngloAmerican land promotion that altered the demographic, physical, political, and economic character
of the entire Rio Grande Valley. The recruitment procedures for new residents became formulaic
during this period. The process is described in detail in the NRHP nomination for the Louisiana-Rio
Grande Canal Company Irrigation System:
Valley land promotion from 1904 through the 1920s followed an elaborate, highly
orchestrated procedure. A group of private investors obtained a large parcel of land
with access to the Rio Grande where they established an irrigation system. Using
cheap, primarily Mexican American labor, they financed the construction of
pumping plants and irrigation canal systems. These systems extended throughout
their property, which was subdivided into 20- to 80-acre farm plots. Simultaneously,
the consortiums promoted their farms through mass distribution of glossy
brochures that extolled the valleyâs many virtuesâboth real and imaginedâ
particularly to midwestern [sic] farmers. . . . Interested parties contacted sales
agents who enticed them to the valley on excursion trips that land companies either
partly or wholly subsidized. (Meyers [Myers] and Weitze 1995)

Many of the new settlers considered themselves civilizers and pioneers and tended to alienate or
suppress the political and civil rights of the Mexican and Mexican-American residents who had lived
in the area for centuries. Tension between the groups erupted into violence or unrest at various
times during the twentieth century, particularly as the number of Mexican citizens seeking asylum
from the unrest at home and/or economic opportunities in the United States increased during the
early twentieth century. Many found work as underpaid farm labor on the newly irrigated lands of
the Anglo immigrants or even as workers constructing the elaborate irrigation systems that made
the regionâs transition into the âMagic Valleyâ possible.
The trend of increased irrigated farming and railroad expansion continued through the 1930s as
more railroad companies built lines through the area and irrigation improvements continued to
multiply. The areaâs transition from a ranch-based economy to one based on truck farming was
complete by 1930, when there were 4,321 farms in Hidalgo County and 2,936 in Cameron County,
100033612/130126

III. Cultural Setting
âmore than double the number in 1920.â As in other areas of the state, the majority of the farms
engaged in cotton cultivation during the early twentieth century (Garza 2011a; Garza and Long
2013b), although truck farming was also significant to economic development in both counties
during the period.

Concurrent with the implementation of irrigation in the region, steps were taken to control periodic
flooding along the Rio Grande that, along with periods of drought, had plagued agricultural
development in the area. In 1892, W.H. Chatfield was the first to propose development of a levee
system for the Lower Rio Grande Valley that would address irrigation needs and flood control. His
plan included a series of levees, canals, and floodgates built around the resacas to collect water
during times of flooding and to distribute it in times of need (Matthews 1938:53â54). His plan was
not directly implemented, but may have influenced John Closnerâs development of an irrigation
system on his sugarcane plantation in 1895. Nevertheless, early canals did little to alleviate flooding
in the area, and flooding concerns were confronted in 1924 and again in 1925 when bond issues
were passed to build levees along the Rio Grande from Donna to Brownsville (Borunda 2007).

Though the levees were a limited success, the 1933 Brownsville Hurricane caused severe flooding
that resulted in a massive realignment of the Rio Grande. As a result of this and many other river
realignments, the original levees roughly follow the course of the river as it ran in 1903, with the
riverâs current position Â½ mile to the southwest. Historic map research suggests that the
1924/1925 levee system was subsequently adapted for irrigation purposes and is now located
around resacas. The 1933 flood also demonstrated that a levee system located only on the American
side was insufficient to control flooding in the area. In 1932, the International Boundary
Commission (IBC) recommended that floodways be constructed on either side of the river. These
recommendations led to the construction of â300 miles of river and floodway levees,
improvements, and control worksâ (Borunda 2007). The work was completed in 1951. The
proposed survey corridor follows portions of the larger IBC (now International Boundary and
Water Commission [IBWC]) floodway, and many of the existing canals recorded as part of the
irrigation districts are also used for flood control.

Mid- to Late-Twentieth-Century Development

Unlike other areas in Texas and the country as a whole, the population and number of farms in the
Rio Grande Valley increased during the Great Depression. This was due in part to the discovery of
oil in 1934, which continued to represent an important part of the local economy through the
remainder of the twentieth century (Garza 2011a). Besides its economic impact, the success of the
oil and gas industry also resulted in significant alterations to the local built environment, as oil and
gas wells and related roadways became a common interruption in the agricultural landscape. Other
extractive industries, such as sand and gravel quarrying, also aided the regionâs economic
development and altered the local landscape.
100033612/130126

III. Cultural Setting
In the 1960s, a decline in the cotton market resulted in a dramatic reduction in land values in the
region, and many farmers sold all or portions of their land to developers. Some of these developers
platted new subdivisions near cities, where employment opportunities were available in processing
and other fields. In more-rural areas, some sold small plots at exorbitantly low rates to low-income
families. These areas, known as colonias, were located outside of city limits on unfavorable
farmland and were largely unregulated and without public services. These communities were
characterized by squalid living conditions and a lack of public works services. Many of the houses
were constructed by hand of scrap material, and residents obtained water from tainted wells or
brought water in from incorporated areas, often in contaminated containers. By the 1980s, activists
began urging officials to act regarding the high rates of disease in border colonias, but despite these
efforts, no legislation was passed (GarcÃ­a 2011). Many of these colonias remain in the area and are
home to low-income farm laborers and their families.

Hidalgo and Cameron Counties continue to depend heavily on large-scale agricultural production,
processing, and transportation, though commercial agricultural corporations have replaced the
independent growers as the biggest producers. The Old Military Road is now part of U.S. Highway
(US) 281, which links several international border-crossing points along the Rio Grande and
continues north to the Oklahoma-Texas state line. Since the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement in 1994, truck-transport traffic along the highway has increased in the region as
more imports from Mexico are brought to the United States (Vigness and Odintz 2011). Other
important facets of the areaâs economy and development at present include oil and gas extraction
and tourism.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND SITES

Atkins conducted a records search to locate recorded cultural resource sites within 0.5 mile
(0.8 km) of the survey corridor. Atkins consulted the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) online
Restricted Archeological Sites Atlas, maps and records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the National Park Service NRHP database and GIS Spatial Data, and the
Geographic Resources Program National Historic Trails Map Viewer as well as the National Historic
Landmarks Program for locations of previously-recorded cultural resource sites. Sites designated
as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official Texas Historical Markers, and records of previously
conducted cultural resource surveys were also researched.
Results of this review indicate that seven previously recorded archeological sites, 41HG134,
41CF192, 41CF193, 41CF196, 41CF197, 41HG82, and 41HG84, as well as and two modern
cemeteries (El Azadon and Monte Mesa), are located within 0.5 mile of the survey corridor (see
Appendix A, Sheets 9, 11, 12, 25, and 27).

Sites 41HG134, 41CF192, 41CF196, 41CF197, and 41HG84 are all described as prehistoric open
campsites, while site 41HG82 is a historic cemetery, and 41CF193 is described as an early-

twentieth-century farmstead. Records also indicate that portions of the survey corridor were
previously surveyed by Horizon in 2005 (Brownlow and Clark 2006) and SWCA in 2007 (Galindo et
al. 2012).

The project survey corridor also crosses four historic period irrigation districts: Cameron County
Irrigation District No. 1, also known as the Harlingen Irrigation District, Cameron County Irrigation
District No. 2, Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6, and Delta Lake Irrigation District (Figure 2).
Two of these districts are currently assumed eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by the THC pending
additional studies and one has been determined eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by the THC.
Resources such as canals and standpipes that extend from any of these historic irrigation districts
into the survey corridor would be considered part of the district and by association may be
considered potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

IV. FIELD METHODS
The survey corridor was assessed for high probability areas (HPAs) and low probability areas
(LPAs) for containing archeological deposits (see Appendix A). HPAs were defined areas within
300 ft of a floodplain or within 1,000 ft of a major natural water source, resaca, abandoned channel,
previously recorded site, and/or a cemetery (whichever was greater). Survey methods followed the
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas established by the THC with transects spaced 30 m apart
and shovel tests excavated at intervals of 30 m within HPA and judgmentally placed in areas of LPA.
The entirety of the survey corridor was pedestrian surveyed in an effort to identify surface scatters
and above-ground, non-archeological cultural resources. Shovel testing was conducted in areas
with less than 30 percent ground surface visibility that did not show clear evidence of heavy
disturbances. Shovel tests were excavated to a depth where pre-Holocene sterile substrates were
encountered, when possible. Where clay soils are encountered, the shovel tests were excavated to a
depth of 30 cm. All soil matrices were sifted through 6.3-millimeter (Â¼-inch) mesh hardware cloth
unless the matrix was dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was finely divided by trowel and visually
inspected.

For each of the shovel tests, the following information was recorded on Atkins shovel test logs:
location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness, texture,
color, and the presence or absence and nature of cultural materials will be recorded. No collection
of surface or subsurface artifacts was proposed, so all potentially diagnostic artifacts were
photographed to determine their cultural affiliation. All artifacts were identified in the field by the
crew chiefs or Project Archeologist, recorded by provenience (site, unit, layer, level, content, and
date), and reburied in the shovel test unit. All shovel tests were backfilled upon completion.
Documents associated with the field effort will be submitted to TARL for curation.

V. RESULTS
Atkinsâ cultural resources survey covered a total of approximately 3,076 acres (1,245 hectares) and
50 miles (80_km) of the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project. Appendix A maps reflect previously
proposed and surveyed alignments as well as the current proposed pipeline alignment. Atkins
surveyed a corridor approximately 300 ft (90 m) in width. Approximately 21.7 miles (34.84 km) of
HPA were recognized near streams or in floodplains, as described in Section IV, a total of
approximately 775 acres (313 hectares) of HPA.

A total of 365 shovel tests were excavated within the survey corridor to an average depth of
11 inches (30 cm) below ground surface (see Appendix A). Much of the soils encountered were clay
loam extending from surface. The majority of the survey corridor consists of agricultural fields and
some improved pasture, affording excellent ground surface visibility within much of the survey
corridor, averaging 60 percent. Noted disturbances included agricultural plowing, and construction
related to canals, levees, roads, transmission lines, and pipelines. Within the HPA mapped along the
final alignment, 302 shovel tests were excavated, resulting in an average of one shovel test per
2.6 acres (1.05 hectares) of HPA. In total, one shovel test was excavated per 8 acres (3.24 hectares)
of surveyed area.

Two newly recorded sites (41CF218 and the La Feria de las Flores Cemetery) and two isolated finds
were recorded during the survey, and two previously recorded archeological sites (41CF196 and
41HG82) were revisited (see Appendix A). Atkins also recorded components of four historic-period
irrigation districts (see Appendix A). Based on survey results, Atkins also conducted exploratory
trenching within portions of the current survey corridor where alluvial deposits retain the potential
to harbor deeply-buried archeological remains. Additionally, several workspaces were not
surveyed during this effort. If any additional cultural resources are found in these locations an
addendum report will be provided summarizing the findings. The results of these trenching and
survey efforts are reported in Appendix D.

RECORDED SITES
41CF196 Revisit

Site 41CF196 is a prehistoric open campsite of unknown temporal affiliation that is approximately
45 m east-west by 75 m north-south (Figure 3; see Appendix A, Sheet 25). The site is located 500 m
north of FM 1595 and 1,600 m west of State Highway (SH) 106 in a cultivated cotton field on gently
sloping ground near Abbott Reservoir (Figure 4). Soils at the site are mapped as Raymondville clay
loam, less than 0.5 percent slopes. Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was
50 percent.
Originally recorded in 2005 by Horizon Environmental Services, Inc., the site consists of a surficial
scatter of prehistoric artifacts (a distal dart point fragment, small bone fragment, and daub) in a

plowed agricultural field. Despite excavation of six shovel tests, Horizon Environmental, Inc., found
no subsurface artifacts or intact features and recommended the site not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or designation as an SAL (Brownlow and Clark 2006).

Atkins archeologists revisited the plotted location of site 41CF196 during the current survey and
excavated six additional shovel tests (see Figure 3). Each shovel test was excavated to a terminal
depth of 30 cm. No cultural materials or evidence of any intact features were observed either on the
ground surface or within any of the shovel tests. The site appears to have been impacted by
agricultural plowing as well as a pipeline and a transmission line. Subsequent to survey, the
proposed pipeline alignment was modified away from the site such that no impacts to the site are
anticipated in conjunction with the proposed construction (Appendix A, Sheet 25).

41CF218

Site 41CF218 is a scatter of historic artifacts dating to the mid-twentieth century that is
approximately 130 m east-west by 45 m north-south within the survey corridor (Figure 5; see
Appendix A, Sheet 25). The scatter extends to the north outside of the survey corridor. The site is
located in a plowed field east of an unnamed drainage that has been dammed downstream to create
the Abbott Reservoir (Figure 6). FM 1595 runs along the southern boundary of the site. Soils at the

site are mapped as Mercedes clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes and 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2013).
Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was nearly 100 percent. Investigators
excavated 11 shovel tests at the site to an average depth of 31 centimeters below surface (cmbs). Of
these, four were positive for cultural materials, and artifacts were recovered as deep as 30 cmbs.
Artifacts observed on the surface and in the shovel tests include domestic and architectural debris.
Domestic artifacts consist of glass vessels and bottles of various colors and morphologies including
solarized, pressed glass; colorless, bottle shards with commercial embossing; aquamarine shards;
dark olive and dark amber bottle glass shards; opaque white glass shards from a cosmetics jar;
cobalt rim shards exhibiting an external continuous thread finish from a small jar; a Dr. Pepper
bottle fragment; and a Vicks Vapo-Rub jar fragment. Ceramic artifacts include Bristol-glazed
stoneware sherds, and decorated and undecorated ironstone sherds. Brick fragments, flat glass
shards, wire nails, roof shingles, PVC pipe fragments, and assorted other construction debris
comprise the architectural remains observed. Gravels suggestive of a driveway were encountered
in one of the shovel tests. The bulk of these materials date from around the early to mid-twentieth
century with some more modern intrusions.
Inspection of historic aerial photographs suggests a farmstead occupied the site area in the 1950s,
and was gone by 1962. A later farmstead near the eastern edge of the site is depicted on a 1996
aerial and is razed by 2003. Since the razing and removal of the buildings, the site has been subject
to repeated plowing. The entire site has been heavily disturbed by past and present agricultural
100033612/130126

V. Results
practices. Given the extensive disturbances to the site, there is very little potential for intact cultural
features or deposits, and thus, it is very unlikely that more intensive investigation will yield any
significant additional information. Subsequent to survey, the proposed pipeline alignment was
modified away from the site such that no impacts to the site are anticipated in conjunction with the
proposed construction (see Appendix A, Sheet 25).

41HG82-Cementerio de las Burras

Site 41HG82 is the historic Cementerio de las Burras, also known as the Los Burros Ranch
Cemetery, which is approximately 60 m east-west by 50 m north-south and is located
approximately 1 km south of the intersection of FM 491 and the Willacy Canal (Figure 7; see
Appendix A, Sheet 9). Soils at the site are mapped as Willacy fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes.
Ground surface visibility at the site at the time of survey was 0 to 10 percent. The cemetery is
located on an intact rectangular-shaped portion of land in the middle of a cultivated agricultural
field (Figure 8). It appears overgrown with tall grasses, cacti, and thorn brush beneath a canopy of
mature mesquite trees (Figure 9).

Online records suggest Cementerio de las Burras is a private family cemetery on the Las Burras or
Los Burros Ranch containing at least 32 interments (Find a Grave 2013a). Originally recorded in
1980 by Prewitt & Associates, site 41HG82 contains of over 20 grave markers ranging from wooden
crosses to concrete and tile markers (Day et al. 1981). Observed surface artifacts at the site
associated with grave tending activities included glass bottles and jars, plastic flowers, and marine
shells. One family plot is surrounded by a chain-link fence. Death dates on the grave markers
indicate the cemetery dates between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. Family
surnames observed on the markers suggest a Mexican-American cultural affiliation for this
population. Many more unmarked graves are likely present at the cemetery given the age of
interments and present unkempt condition.

The cemetery is not fenced, there is no signage, the property is not maintained, and appears
abandoned. The eligibility of site 41HG82 for inclusion in the NRHP and as a SAL is unknown.
Nonetheless, Atkins recommends the proposed pipeline construction avoid impacts within 75 ft
(23 m) of the presumed boundary of site 41HG82 outlined on Figure 7 due to the potential for
unmarked graves in this area. In accordance with the Texas Health and Safety Code Section
711.011, as amended, and 13 TAC 22.4, Atkins has filed a Notice of Existence of a Cemetery with the
Hidalgo County Clerk (see Appendix B).

La Feria de las Flores Cemetery
The La Feria de las Flores Cemetery, also known as Los Cantu Cemetery and Muniz Family
Cemetery, is located on private property approximately 1,075 ft (327 m) northeast of the
intersection of FM 506 and 472nd Road near Santa Rosa in Cameron County, Texas (see Appendix
A, Sheet 14). Online records indicate this is a private family cemetery on the Muniz Ranch with two
sections: one for the Muniz Family and the other for the Cantu Family (Find a Grave 2013b).
Surveyors noted indications of up to 17 currently marked graves at this site with interment dates
ranging from 1974 to 2013 (Figure 10). The oldest marked interment appears to be that of Luis
Muniz, Jr., died 1974. No site trinomial was sought due to the modern age of the cemetery (i.e., not
older than 50 years).

Figure 10. Overview of La Feria de las Flores Cemetery, facing northwest.
Although not fenced and without signage, the La Feria de las Flores Cemetery appears maintained
and well known. It does not appear abandoned but also does not appear to be a perpetual care
cemetery. Subsequent to the survey, the proposed alignment was rerouted northward to avoid the
site such that the southern edge of the survey corridor is now approximately 300 ft (91 m) away
from the cemetery (Appendix A, Sheet 14). Therefore, no adverse effects to the cemetery are
anticipated as a result of the proposed pipeline construction.

HISTORIC IRRIGATION DISTRICTS
During the field survey efforts, archeologists photographed any aboveground irrigation resources
within or extending into the survey corridor, including canals, ditches, and standpipes, and mapped
their locations. The data was compared to irrigation district maps prepared by Texas A&M
Universityâs Irrigation Technology Center to determine what features were components of
established irrigation districts. This review resulted in the identification of additional sections of
underground pipeline that were not recorded during the field survey effort. As three of the four
irrigation districts within which the project passes are considered eligible for NRHP inclusion,
Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the locations of associated resources, and Tables 2â4 identify each
component, its resource type, and provide a preliminary Section 106 effect assessment based on
the construction specifications currently available.

Irrigation Resources

Irrigation features associated with the four irrigation districts crossed by the proposed pipeline
represent the predominant resource type recorded during the current survey. Archeologists
documented 38 resources related to irrigation within or extending into the survey corridor,
including canals/ditches, sections of underground pipeline, and aboveground standpipes. These
components were recorded within four historic-age irrigation districts, including Cameron County
Irrigation District No. 1 (Harlingen Irrigation District), Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2
(San Benito), Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6 (Los Fresnos), and Delta Lake Irrigation
100033612/130126

V. Results
District. The THC determined that the Harlingen Irrigation District was not eligible for NRHP
inclusion in 2009. In contrast, Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6 was determined to be NRHP
eligible in 2009, and both Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 and the Delta Lake Irrigation
District are currently assumed eligible for the purposes of project coordination pending additional
studies.

Tables 2â4 list the individual resources within the three NRHP-eligible irrigation districts and
include their resource types and preliminary Section 106 effect assessments. Photographs of the
resources where available are included in Appendix C, and the locations of all of the resources were
mapped and are depicted on Figures 13 and 14, as well as Appendix A.

In general, all pipeline crossings at irrigation feature locations will be underground and will be
constructed by one of three methods: open-cut, conventional boring, or HDD. For the open-cut
construction method, a trench line will be excavated through a given canal/ditch section. After the
pipeline is installed, the open-cut will be backfilled. Any excess material that may result from
backfilling a pipeline installed by open-cut will be removed from the floodplain and disposed of
according to specifications included as part of construction plans as signed and sealed by a
professional engineer. The canals/ditches will be returned to existing section within the limits of
the open-cut after backfilling. All riprap or other slope protection shall be installed according to
construction plans as signed and sealed by a professional engineer. This method is not preferred
with regard to irrigation crossings and will only be used if conditions or permit requirements
mandate its implementation.

The conventional boring method involves boring beneath an irrigation feature in order to install the
proposed pipeline crossing. No surface excavation or fill between the bore entry and exit locations
results when this method of construction is utilized. Thus, there are no post-construction physical
changes to the irrigation resource, and as a result, there will be no impacts to its conveyance or
storage capacity. Typically, a 250-x-250-ft entrance/exit workspace will be located outside the
banks of each canal/ditch or other feature that is to be crossed. The workspace is required for the
placement of temporary bore pits utilized to drill the pipeline tunnel. This process produces drill
cuttings from the bore hole, which will be distributed through landfarming. Landfarming is an
activity regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas for oil and gas activities. It involves the
process of spreading and incorporating drilling spoils material into the top soil layer. BPUB will
landfarm the spoils generated from the bore process in accordance with the Railroad Commission
of Texas guidelines, which state, among other things, that landfarm sites may not be located within
the 100-year floodplain. This is one of the two preferred methods of construction favored by
Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 and the Delta Lake Irrigation District.
The HDD construction method involves drilling beneath an irrigation feature in order to install the
proposed pipeline crossing. No surface excavation or fill between the HDD entry and exit locations
results when this method of construction is utilized. Thus, the construction results in no physical

100033612/130126

36

V. Results
changes to the canal/ditch or other irrigation resource. As such, the pipeline crossing does not
induce impacts to the storage or conveyance capacity of irrigation system components. Typically,
250-x-250-ft entrance and exit workspaces are located outside the banks of each feature to be
crossed. The workspace is required for the drilling rigs, mud circulation pits, and pipe stringing.
The HDD process produces drill cuttings from the bore hole, which will be distributed through
landfarming in accordance with the Railroad Commission of Texas guidelines. This method and
conventional boring are the preferred construction methods at irrigation resource locations as
specified by the respective irrigation districts and the project engineers.

Cameron County Irrigation District No. 1 (Harlingen Irrigation District)

Archeologists recorded seven components of the Cameron County Irrigation District No. 1 within
the survey corridor (Figure 13). The THC determined that this district does not meet the
qualifications for NRHP inclusion under any of the applicable criteria in 2009 in association with a
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)-sponsored project (CSJ# 2094-01-038). As a result,
construction of the proposed pipeline at each of the locations would not result an adverse impact to
any NRHP-listed or -eligible resource within this district. Thus, no further consideration of the
resources or of the irrigation district under Section 106 is anticipated in connection with the
current project.

Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 (San Benito Irrigation District)

Ten features associated with the Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 were documented within
the survey corridor (Table 2; see Figure 13). As per communication between TxDOT and the THC,
this irrigation district is currently assumed to be NRHP eligible for the purposes of project
coordination. Documented features included one lined canal, seven unlined canals, one segment of
underground pipeline, one canal associated with a segment of underground pipeline, and one
standpipe. As per an agreement with the irrigation district, pipeline construction within the
boundaries of the district will have to comply with the following standards:
â¢

â¢
â¢
â¢

The pipeline will have to be constructed a minimum of 5 ft below the flow line of any
canal.
Required angles will be approved on a case-by-case basis depending on any other
infrastructure or other existing utilities.

Casing is required; it may be concrete or steel.

The preferred method of construction is boring, although open cut is permissible only
with specific authorization through the license agreement. All canals would have to be
returned to their original form and functionality.

For many of the irrigation canal and underground pipeline crossings, right of way (ROW) data are
not currently available, so the exact crossing locations and methods have not been finalized.
Resources CCID2-01, CCID2-03, and CCID2-04 are preliminarily planned to be bored under using
HDD; however, this may change as project plans are finalized. If the canals or segments of pipeline
are bored under, there is no possibility for direct or other adverse impacts to the resources that
would affect their historic integrity. If open cut is selected at any of the canal locations, construction
practices for this method include returning the canals to their original dimensions and function. As
a result, there would be no permanent physical alteration to the canals. Similarly, any materials
replaced will be those that are typically replaced during regular maintenance. As neither the
appearance nor functionality of the structures will be impacted by the proposed project regardless
of the selected construction method, there should be no adverse effect to the resources under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, any aboveground standpipes
within the proposed ROW will be avoided by project construction. As a result, no impact to this
resource is anticipated, and no further consideration of it is recommended in relation to the current
project.

Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6 (Los Fresnos Irrigation District)

Archeologists documented two features of Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6 within the
survey corridor (Table 3; see Figure 13). The resources include an unlined canal and an
aboveground standpipe. The THC determined this district qualifies for NRHP inclusion under
Criterion C for its engineering qualities in 2009. At present, the district has not provided
construction requirements to the project engineers. As a result, specific construction methods at
the canal crossing location are not currently available. In general, project plans include construction
of a pipeline via bore (conventional or HDD) or open cut. If the pipeline is installed via boring, there

will be no direct impact to the resource nor will its historic integrity be compromised. Furthermore,
any portion of the canal that is open cut for pipeline construction will be repaired to its original
condition and functionality. Finally, project planners have indicated that all aboveground concrete
standpipes within the proposed ROW will be avoided during pipeline construction. As a result, no
adverse impact is anticipated to resources within Cameron County Irrigation District No. 6, and no
further consideration of the district or its associated resources is recommended under Section 106.

Delta Lake Irrigation District
Archeologists documented 19 features associated with the Delta Lake Irrigation District within the
survey corridor (Table 4; Figure 14). As per communication between TxDOT and the THC, this
irrigation district is currently assumed to be NRHP eligible for the purposes of project coordination
under Section 106. Documented features included 4 lined canals, 1 lined canal associated with a
section of underground pipeline, 2 unlined canals, and 12 sections of underground pipeline. As per
an agreement with the irrigation district, pipeline construction within the boundaries of the district
will have to comply with the following standards:
For conventional bore crossings, the following is required:
â¢

â¢
â¢

Pipeline must be installed a minimum depth of 5 ft below all Delta Lake Irrigation
District facilities (i.e., canals, drainage ditches, pipelines, and ROW).

If the gas pipeline pressure is greater than 200 pounds per square inch, the pipeline
must be cased throughout the total ROW length.
No angle restrictions.

For HDD crossings, the following is required:
â¢

â¢

If casing is not used, a minimum depth of 10 ft below all Delta Lake Irrigation District
facilities is required, including canals, drainage ditches, pipelines, and ROW).
No angle restrictions.

Though ROW data for all of the components are not currently available, meaning construction plans
at each of these locations has not been finalized, the canals and pipeline sections will either be
bored under using conventional or HDD boring methods or open cut. Regardless of which
construction method is employed, construction of the pipeline will not constitute an adverse effect
to any of the contributing features of the irrigation system. In particular, boring under the
resources would avoid both direct impacts and other adverse impacts that would affect their
integrity or functionality. Additionally, open-cut methods specify that the resource will have to be
returned to its original dimensions and capacity. As a result, any temporary impacts to a particular
resource during construction would not constitute a permanent or otherwise adverse effect to the
irrigation system or its components. Therefore, no further consideration of impacts to the district
under Section 106 is recommended in connection with the proposed project.

Conclusions

Though 31 of the 38 irrigation-related resources recorded within the proposed ROW are associated
with NRHP-eligible irrigation systems, proposed construction plans at the locations would not
constitute adverse effects to any of the resources. Specifically, aboveground standpipes will be
avoided by project construction, and construction specifications maintained by at least two of the
irrigation districts suggest that conventional boring or HDD will be used to construct sections of the
100033612/130126

42

V. Results
proposed pipeline under canals/ditches and sections of irrigation pipeline. If bored under, the
project would not result in any direct or otherwise adverse impacts to irrigation features in the
eligible districts. Alternatively, some canals may be open cut. Though not the preferred construction
method with regard to impacting significant irrigation features, specifications require that all open
cut canals be returned to their original form, function, and capacity. As a result, any impacts would
be temporary and would not result in alterations to any of the resourcesâ character-defining
features. As a result, the proposed project does not appear to represent a potential adverse effect to
any NRHP-eligible irrigation feature and no further consideration of the resources under Section
106 is recommended.

EXPLORATORY TRENCHING

As a result of the cultural resources survey and background review, Atkins determined that
portions of the current proposed pipeline alignment cross floodplain deposits that possess the
potential for harboring deeply-buried prehistoric archeological remains. Soils within these settings
are composed of deep, modern alluvium that extend below a depth that standard archeological
shovel tests can penetrate and required mechanical excavation to effectively assess the likelihood of
buried archeological materials. Therefore, Atkins conducted a program of exploratory trenching to
further examine alluvial deposits within the survey corridor considered to be potentially attractive
to prehistoric occupation, including topographic rises within the floodplain, remnant natural levees,
abandoned meander scars, and adjacent fossil channels. Each trench was excavated to a depth
commensurate with the depth of pipeline construction or terminated once pre-Holocene substrates
are reached. Three proposed trench sites were not excavated due to landowner issues at the time of
both field sessions. It is recommended that these three areas be monitored by a qualified
archeologist at the time of the pipeline excavation for the presence of buried archeological remains
and to complete the geoarcheological study of these areas. The results of the trenching are detailed
in Appendix D.

100033612/130126

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As a result of the cultural resources survey, Atkins recorded two sites, a scatter of mid-twentiethcentury domestic and architectural artifacts (41CF218), the La Feria de las Flores Cemetery,
components of four historic-period irrigation districts, and two isolated finds (prehistoric lithic
artifacts). Atkins also revisited two previously recorded archeological sites, a surface scatter of
prehistoric artifacts (41CF196) and the historic Cementerio de las Burras (41HG82).

Based on survey results, Atkins recommends that neither of the two isolated finds meets the
eligibility criteria for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL. Atkins further recommends
that no further work is required and that pipeline construction be allowed to proceed in the area of
these finds.

The eligibility of site 41HG82, the historic Cementerio de las Burras, for inclusion in the NRHP and
designation as a SAL is unknown based on survey-level data alone. Nonetheless, Atkins
recommends the proposed pipeline construction avoid impacts within 75 ft of the presumed
boundary of site 41HG82 outlined in this report due to the potential for unmarked graves in this
area in deference to the Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 711.035 (d). If impacts to the site
cannot be avoided within this 75-ft buffer zone, further consultation with the THC may be
necessary.

Due to a modification in the proposed pipeline alignment, sites 41CF196, 41CF218, and the La Feria
de las Flores Cemetery are no longer within the proposed pipeline alignment, and therefore, no
adverse impacts to the sites or cemetery associated with the proposed construction are anticipated.
Atkins recommends that pipeline construction be allowed to proceed in the vicinity of these sites.

With regard to the irrigation resources, planned construction activities within the NRHP-eligible
districts do not appear to constitute adverse effects to any of the resources under Section 106.
While not finalized, construction of the underground pipeline via boring methods would avoid all
impacts to the resources, including to their integrity and functionality. Similarly, if the pipeline was
constructed via open cut methods; impacted sections of aboveground canals would be returned to
their original dimensions and function. Project engineers have specified that aboveground
standpipes within the ROW will be avoided by project construction. As no adverse impacts to any
NRHP-eligible irrigation features are anticipated in association with the proposed project, no
further consideration of the resources under Section 106 is recommended.

Atkins conducted exploratory trenching within several portions of the survey corridor that featured
floodplain deposits that retain the potential to harbor deeply buried archeological remains (defined
as HPAs) beyond the reach of shovel testing in accordance with state survey guidelines (results are
reported in Appendix D). Three proposed trench sites were not excavated due to landowner issues
at the time of both field sessions. It is recommended that these three areas be monitored by a

100033612/130126

VI. Conclusions and Recommendations
qualified archeologist at the time of the pipeline excavation for the presence of buried archeological
remains and to complete the geoarcheological study of these areas. Additionally, several
workspaces were not surveyed during this effort. If any additional cultural resources are found in
these locations an addendum report will be provided summarizing the findings.
Once consultations with the THC are complete, Atkins recommends that construction activities be
allowed to proceed without further consultation. Should evidence of archeological sites be
encountered during construction, work in the immediate area should cease, and a qualified
archeologist should be called upon to evaluate the evidence and provide recommendations for how
to manage the resource under the Stateâs Historic Preservation Plan.

Abstract
Based on the results of the pedestrian survey and background review, Atkins recommended that
exploratory archaeological trenching be conducted in several high probability areas with the survey
corridor along the current proposed alignment. This appendix reports the results of that
archaeological trenching activity and the results of additional surveys that were conducted as a
result of right of way adjustments or areas that could not be accessed during the initial cultural
resources surveys. These trenching and survey activities took place between January 30 and
February 1 and again between April 29 and 30, 2014.

I. INTRODUCTION
Between July 8 and November 19, 2013, Atkins North America, Inc. (Atkins) conducted a Phase I
Cultural Resources survey for the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline Project on behalf of the City of
Brownsville Public Utilities Board (BPUB). The BPUB is proposing construction of 49.62 miles
(79.86 kilometers [km)] of new 24-inch natural gas pipeline in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties,
Texas (Figure D1). The proposed project begins near Brush Line Road 5 miles (8 km) east of
Faysville and continues in an east-southeast direction to its termination near the intersection of
Farm-to-Market Road 511 and Old Alice Road in Brownsville, Texas. As the survey corridor is
located on publicly owned and/or controlled lands, compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code is
required.

This investigation was performed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (PL 89-665), as amended, and the Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resource Code of
1977, Title 9, Chapter 191) (Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6643); and in accordance with the
Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800), the Rules of
Practice and Procedure (Texas Administrative Code [TAC], Title 13, Chapter 26), and guidelines set
forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Compliance with provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Section 711) was also required as
cemeteries were encountered in the vicinity of the project survey corridor.

Based on the results of the initial pedestrian surveys and background review, Atkins recommended
that exploratory archaeological trenching be conducted in several high probability areas (HPAs)
within the survey corridor along the current proposed alignment (Burden et al. 2013). This
addendum reports the results of the testing conducted within the HPAs as well as additional survey
areas that were added after the initial due to refinement of the right of way (ROW). These trenching
and survey activities took place between January 30 and February 1 and again between April 29
and 30, 2014. The trenching was conducted by Strike and the studies were conducted by Robert
Rowe (Project Archaeologist), Maximilian Jewett, and Jonathan Oliver (Crew). A total of 10 person
days were worked associated with the field work. Dale Norton served as Primary Investigator.

II. NATURAL ELEMENT
This section provides an overview of the natural environment surrounding the proposed Cross
Valley Pipeline Project. Specific relevant information for this Addendum consists of an overview of
the regionâs geology and soils. Specific information of the terrestrial resources (flora and fauna) can
be located within the initial cultural resources survey (Burden et al. 2013).

The project area lies within the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain portion of the Western Gulf
Coast Plain ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004). The Western Gulf Coast Plain maintains a relatively flat
topography with predominantly grassland vegetation adjacent of the coast. Moving inland, the
regionsâ plains are older, more irregular and have mostly forest or savanna-type vegetation. The
Lower Rio Grande alluvial flood plain portion of the ecoregion predominantly consists of Holoceneaged alluvial sands and clays that are/were transported by the Rio Grande. Historically, the
floodplain ridges once had abundant palm trees, leading the early Spanish explorers in the area to
call the river âRio de las Palmasâ (Griffith et al. 2004). However, most large palm trees and
floodplain forest had been cleared by the early 1900s for agricultural purposes. Currently, the
region is dominated by cropland with rice, grain, sorghum, cotton, and soybeans as the principal
crops. In addition, urban and industrial land uses have expanded greatly in recent decades, and oil
and gas production is common. Channels for irrigation and urban use have mostly diverted the
waters of the Rio Grande resulting in little or no flow actually reaching the Gulf of Mexico.

Elevations throughout the region range from sea level to approximately 100 feet (ft) (30 meters
[m]) above mean sea level. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 35 inches (40 to
89 centimeters [cm]) occurring mostly in the spring and fall. Summers are often characterized by
drought conditions that are frequently of sufficient duration to depress crop growth.

GEOARCHAEOLOGY STUDIES
Geology

The current proposed project ROW is located within the broad Lower Rio Grande Valley. The valley
is a mix of riverbank, shallow marsh, and lake settings with the amalgamation of silty and sandy flat
floodplain giving rise to shifting steam channels. This system of altered stream channels results in
the resacas (oxbows) and meander scars and belts that are found throughout the region, which are
perpetually affected by aeolian sediments (Butzer 1982). The resacas are former channels of the
Rio Grande and formed after the Gulf of Mexico rose to about its present level.
The geology of the Lower Rio Grande Valley consists of Holocene (>10,000 years), Pleistocene
(10,000â2 million years [my]) and Pliocene (12.5â4.5 my) fluvial and deltaic deposits (Brown et al.
1980). Multiple high level Pleistocene terraces border the Holocene floodplain and delta complex.
These terraces were formed by fluvial-deltaic depositions during maximum sea level periods and

under glacial minimum conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene (Paine 2000). Overlying
these terraces are extensive windblown deposits of sand and clay dunes interspersed with sand
sheets and localized wind deflation areas. Holocene stabilized sand dunes occur as broad,
segmented expanses of northwestward-trending aeolian deposition (Mallouf et al. 1977). These
depositions usually have a height of 3.2 to 29.5 ft (1 to 9 m). The surface relief of the stabilized sand
dunes is typically undulating with occasional aeolian depressions of varying size and shape
(Mallouf et al. 1977). Because of the active nature of these aeolian deposits, they have been
repeatedly buried and eroded creating a series of transgressions and regressions of soil deposits
(Rapp and Hill 1998). In addition, the depressions that can occur in them possess the capability of
retaining water for a limited time after rains. Given the importance of water in the arid landscape,
this would have made this area attractive to prehistoric animals and people.

After the last glacial maximum, by the middle of the Holocene, the Rio Grande had deposited alluvial
soils and ultimately flooded the valley several times (Boyd et al. 1994). These flooding episodes
created an estuarine environment (Brown et al. 1980). The filling of the valley ceased between
10,000 and 7,000 before present (B.P.), resulting in additional manifestations of soil aggregation as
prograding delta lobes over earlier Holocene deposits. Sea level reached its present level at around
3,000 B.P., and due to the rising water, the lobes were reworked, eroded away, and redeposited.
Since the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 B.P.), the river valley had changed dramatically. Ocean
levels had risen approximately 390 ft (120 m) causing the course of the Rio Grande to shorten with
the influx of the rising sea water eventually causing an increase in valley aggregation (Brown et al.
1980).

The portion of the project located in Cameron County, is on the coastal plain region. Typical
landscape features for this area are depressions, tidal flats, levees, point bars, back swamps,
meander belts, barrier islands, and an old subdelta of the Rio Grande. Some major meander belts
that are found in Cameron County are Resaca de Rancho Viejo, Resaca de La Palma, and Resaca de
los Fresnos. The Resaca de los Fresnos meanders northeast through San Benito and approximately
18 miles (28.9 km) beyond. The resaca banks are slightly higher in elevation than the surrounding
lands. In all, there are 32.5 miles (52.3 km) of canals and resacas that run through Cameron County.
Several of the resacas in the region have been modified into permanent water storage areas by the
addition of man-made levees.

The oldest bedrock within the project area is that of the Goliad Formation that was deposited
during the Pliocene Epoch (12.5â4.5 my). It is exposed in eastern Hidalgo County and manifested as
fluvial deposits composed of clay, sand, sandstone, caliche, chert, limestone, and dark siliceous
granules and pebbles in a caliche matrix (Brown et al. 1980). This formation is the source of much
of the locally obtained raw materials used for prehistoric stone tools within the region (Bousman et
al. 1990).

II. Natural Element
The Lissie Formation overlays the eastern edge of the Goliad Formation as an unconformity in
eastern Hidalgo County into western Cameron County. The formation was deposited during the
Oligocene into the middle Pleistocene with the deposit episode ending approximately 14,000 B.P.
This period included at least 14 continental glacial advances interspersed by warmer periods (Day
et al. 1981). The Lissie Formation consists of gray to brown to pale yellow clay, silts, sand, siliceous
gravel, and sandy caliche. Pockets of stabilized sand dune deposits characterized by dense live oak
copses and scrub vegetation occur within the formation (Brown et al. 1980).
Within eastern Hidalgo County and northwestern Cameron County is the Beaumont Formation of
the Late Pleistocene, which is exposed as matrices of clay, silt, sand, and gravel to a depth of 886 ft
(270 m). The sediments composing the Beaumont Formation were primarily deposited by rivers
and include natural levees and deltas that coalesced through shifting of the river mouths as they
reached the coast. The marine element of the formation is much less pronounced and includes
marine and lagoonal waters in the embayments between the stream ridges and delta plains
(Sellards et al. 1996). Archaeologically, the age of these deposits precludes the presence of deeply
buried sites but may contain magafaunal remains.

Unnamed formations create the base of most of Cameron County, which instead of being like the
aeolian dominated surface deposits of Hidalgo County; these are alluvial in nature and are under
the influence of erosion form the land and dunal deposits from the Gulf of Mexico. These deposits
are Holocene (11,700 B.P. to Present) in age and create large areas of mud deposits covered with
sand sheets (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1976). It is these areas where deeply buried
archaeological sites may be located primarily near stable water sources.

The last 10,000 years or so of the Pleistocene made up the Wisconsinan glacial age, the last and
most extensive episode of the Pleistocene glaciations. Wisconsinan glaciers reached their maximum
extent 18,000 B.P., a time when continental glaciers extended to central Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.
Although glacial ice was several thousand kilometers north of the project area, the advances and
retreats of glaciers during the Pleistocene had dramatic effects on the biota, climate, and
geomorphology of south Texas (Wornardt and Vail 1991).

During these glacial episodes, when sea level fell as much as 393 ft (120 m), rivers carved out their
valleys and carried sediment to the shoreline, which was at the edge of the present-day continental
shelf. During interglacial periods, sea level rose and river and coastal deposition occurred on the
continental shelf. Glacial episodes were not times of uniformly falling sea level and erosion of river
valleys. During interstadials, relatively warmer intervals, there were minor rises in sea level and the
rivers filled in their valleys with terrace deposits. Some authorities believe that the Beaumont
Formation was deposited during the Sangamonian integlaical (or perhaps the Peorian Interstadial),
the last highstand of sea level (Wornardt and Vail 1991).

II. Natural Element
During the Wisconsinan period, the lower Rio Grande carved out its present valley, which is over
200 ft (60 m) deep and 20 miles (32 km) wide. It is during the late Wisconsinan interstadials that
the five alluvial units that currently fill the lower Rio Grande Valley formed at progressively lower
elevations. These are incised terraces and valley fill deposits that range in age from perhaps 50,000
to 12,000 B.P. They are capped by Holocene stream deposits of the modern flood plain. During this
late Pleistocene lowstand of sea level the continental shelf was exposed, as a result, mammoth,
mastodon, and bison bones and teeth have been recovered from the Seven and One-half Fathom
reef in the Gulf of Mexico off of South Padre Island (Thayer et al. 1974).
South Texas has an excellent record of several areas of late Pleistocene fossil deposits. The majority
of fossils occur mainly in the river channel and floodplain deposits of the Beaumont Formation and
in the terrace deposits that cut into the Beaumont Formation. During the Pleistocene, south Texas
was a mosaic of grassland and woodland environments that supported a much greater diversity of
mammals than at present. There were probably extensive woodlands along the rivers. The majority
of fossil mammals from south Texas are grazers, such as various species of horses and mammoths
(which are the two most commonly fossil species found in this area of Texas). Grazers live in
savannas and grasslands and feed mainly on grasses. They often have high-crowned cheek teeth, in
which the enamel extends below the gum line and the roots are frequently open. Browsers are less
common. Browsers are typically forest-dwelling animals that feed mainly on stems, twigs, and
leaves. Browsers can be recognized by their low-crowned cheek teeth in which the enamel extends
to the gum line and the roots are closed. Extinct species identified from finds within 100 miles of
the project area are listed below in Table D1 (Baskin 2009).

Soils

The soils of the Laredo-Olmito association and 4 lesser soil series have been mapped within the
study areas in Cameron County from United States Department of Agriculture soils maps of the area
(Table D2) (Jacobs 1979; Natural Resources Conservation Service 2014). These soils can be
grouped into five soil orders: Calciustolls, Arguistolls, Argiaquolls, Haplustolls, and Haplusterts. In
general, soils west of the Arroyo Colorado are Pliocene and Pleistocene in age, although there are
some Holocene-aged soils within the floodplain north of the Arroyo Colorado. South of this water
channel, the soils are Holocene in age (BEG 1976, 1992), and so could have the potential to harbor
archaeological deposits.

The Laredo-Olmito association is irregularly shaped. It follows generally the pattern of the resacas
on a low terrace of the Rio Grande. Laredo soils occupy the higher, well-drained areas adjacent to
the resacas, and Olmito soils occupy the level or slightly concave areas away from but parallel to the
resacas (Williams et al. 1977). This association makes up about 19 percent of Cameron County. It is
about 65 percent Laredo soils, 20 percent Olmito soils, and 15 percent of soils of minor extent.
These minor soils of this association are in the Cameron, Racombes, Rio, Bonito and Harlingen
series (see Table D1). Laredo soils have a surface layer of dark grayish brown, calcareous silty clay
loam about 8 inches (20.3 cm) thick. The next layer, to a depth of 41 inches (104.14 cm), is silt loam.
It is dark grayish brown in the upper part and light brownish gray in the lower part. The underlying
material is stratified silt loam and silty clay loam. These soils are well drained and moderately
permeable. Olmito soils have a surface layer of dark gray, calcareous silty clay about 16 inches
(40.64 cm) thick. The next layer, to a depth of 34 inches (86.36 cm), is silty clay that is grayish
brown in the upper part and dark brown in the lower part. The underlying material is mottled silty
clay. These soils are moderately well drained and slowly permeable (Williams et al. 1977).

Geoarchaeology Reconnaissance

For centuries, the Rio Grandeâs waters would find their way from their headwaters in the Rocky
Mountains in modern day Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico. The spring snow melt flowed into the Rio
Grande and would be joined by other river flows (Rio San Juan, Rio PesqerÃ­a, Pecos River, and
others) along the way and bring seasonal flood waters to the most southern tip of Texas. The Rio
Grande would inevitably physically move during large flood events, shifting its position, leaving its
formal channel to become a series of distributary channels, eventually forming the resacas. During
the spring floods, the river overflowed its main and distributary channel banks, inundating the Rio
Atkins 100033612/130126

II. Natural Element
Grande delta with slow moving water and spreading rich nutrients. As the river retreated, the
newly formed resacas and rich soils deposited by the flooding would remain, creating a lush
environment for natural vegetation. Trees such as Texas ebony (Ebenopsis ebano), anacua (Ehretia
anacua), tepeguaje (Leucaena pulverulenta), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), and Rio Grande ash (Fraxinum berlandieriana), made up the majority of the floodplain
natural progressive forest community.

With increasing intensive human settlement in the lower Rio Grande Valley came the need to
control the annual flooding. This need was coupled to the need to access fresh river water as much
of the natural water table in the area is saline. Soon after, an engineered system of irrigation canals
and levees allowed people to prosper on the farming of the rich soils of the valley. The earliest
irrigation recorded in the valley was conducted by John Closner and other early land developers in
1889 in order to promote this part of Texas for agricultural purposes (McKenna 2014). In 1953,
Falcon Dam near Zapata was constructed to control the lower Rio Grande and prevent flooding in
the lower delta area of the river valley. It was one of many structures and agreements that would
dam and divert river waters further upstream. Today many the remnant resacas have been
modified to serve as storm water reservoirs, irrigation district reservoirs, irrigation channels,
residential lakes and farm land (McKenna 2014).

Many of the soils in the county formed from sediments deposited by the Rio Grande floods. These
sediments are primarily clay and sand with some silt deposits closer to the river. Drainage and
salinity are a management problem with the soils of the county. The nearly-level soils are often
seasonally wet and, with the underground water supply, are too saline for practical use, making
man-made drainage systems taking water from the Rio Grande necessary to continue high crop
production.

The geoarchaeological investigations conducted to support the Cross Valley Pipeline Project
represents an integration of methods and concepts borrowed from geomorphology, stratigraphy,
sedimentology, and pedology. The recovered data were subsequently interpreted within the
context of the known archaeological record; that is, the record as represented by site forms and
reports of file with the Texas Archaeological Society. The preliminary conclusions drawn from these
investigations are based on a number of assumptions that are integral to contextual archaeology in
general and to geoarchaeology in particular.

These assumptions, which are by no means new to archaeologists, are as follows: (1) extant
archaeological sites, particularly those associated with prehistoric hunter-gatherers, consist of
material remains that are not static after they are discarded, but are instead part of a highly
dynamic natural environment (Schiffer 1987; Wood and Johnson 1978); (2) as such, the spatial,
temporal, and material distribution of these sites rarely retain or reflect the entire range of their
original behavioral context (Schiffer 1987); (3) most sites therefore require an understanding and
reconstruction of site formation processes before the drawing of meaningful archaeological
Atkins 100033612/130126

9

II. Natural Element
inferences may be undertaken (Waters 1992); (4) formation processes can impact the
archaeological record at both the intra-site and inter-site levels; (5) at both levels, the preservation
and completeness of the buried archaeological record has a tendency to parallel the preservation
and completeness of the associated sedimentological record (Waters 1992); (6) of the myriad
processes and agents active in archaeological site formation, none are as spatially widespread or as
potentially damaging to the drawing of archaeological hypotheses as are large-scale changes in
landscape (Waters and Kuehn 1996); (7) while landscape change can, and does, occur under most
climatic and geomorphic regimes, some of the more severe consequences take place in highly
dynamic erosional settings; and finally (8) the types and scale of geological/geomorphic processes
in riverine settings are significant to the point of hindering, or even precluding, the development of
testable hypotheses about such basic archaeological resource topics as local and regional cultural
chronology, settlement patterns, seasonal land use, and subsistence behaviour (Waters and Kuehn
1996).
It is these basic assumptions that created the need for preliminary geoarchaeological investigations
for this project. The resultant investigations, albeit limited in scope and tentative in their
conclusions, were documented for the specific purpose of aiding in the development of a research
design for the proposed project.

Field Methods

During the course of the fieldwork of the test trenching component, two main avenues of research
were employed. First, a detailed reconnaissance was undertaken in selected localities whose
sedimentological and pedological characteristics appear more compatible with the preservation of
archaeological sites. This level of research relied heavily on a number of sedimentological
principles basic to the identification and interpretation of former environments of deposits (Boggs
1987; Rigby and Hamblin 1972). Primary among these is the concept that depositional sedimentary
environments include those dynamic processes and static elements of any particular landscape that
are responsible for the production, transportation, and deposition of identifiable bodies of
sediment (Boggs 1987). These bodies of sediment have distinctive sets of physical, chemical, and
stratigraphic characteristics (Boggs 1987; Reineck and Singh 1980). By recognizing these
characteristics, particularly lithology, grain size, sorting, and primary sedimentary structure, the
investigator can identify under which type of environment a body of sediment was deposited (be it
alluvial, colluvial, lacustrine, aeolian, or marine).

The potential for site preservation is greatest when the sites are formed and subsequently quickly
buried in environments where sediment deposition occurs under relatively, low-energy conditions
(Water 1992). These types of settings include floodplains subjected to fine-grained overbank
deposition, many kinds of ponded environments (resacas), and any number of low-energy aeolian,
colluvial and alluvial environments such as those represented in certain type of sand dune, alluvial
fan, and channel fill deposits (Butzer 1982; Stein and Farrand 1985; Waters 1992). Finally, after
Atkins 100033612/130126

10

II. Natural Element
completion of the second level, or reconnaissance, attention focused on the analysis of the
trenching localities considered representative of the range of depositional environments with
higher archaeological potential.

At each of the study areas, data collection included (a) the identification and description of extant
stratigraphic units on the basis of physical characteristics (i.e., color [via Munsell Color charts],
texture, sedimentary structure) and bounding disconformities; (b) the identification and
description of buried and surface soils and corresponding horizons; (c) the preparation of a scale
profile map of each trench; and (d) photographic documentation. Soil horizon nomenclature
followed the American Geological Institute Data Sheets (Dutro et al. 1989) with master and
subordinate horizon designated in the field.

The second portion of the field investigations addressed the question of natural site formation,
particularly those variables related to landscape stability, erosion, and aggradation. For example,
stratigraphic units, which were defined on the basis of bounding disconformities and other criteria
established by the North American Commission of Stratigraphic Nomenclature (1983), are
interpreted as representing discreet episodes of sediment deposition (Boggs 1987). Erosional
events, on the other hand, were recognized primarily of the basis of the topography and abruptness
of unit contacts (Boggs 1987; Waters 1992), while both buried and surface soils served as
indicators of periods of past and present landscape stability (Birkeland 1984). Other evidence of
post-depositional disturbance include the recognition and description of rodent holes, insect
activity, root penetration, shrink-swell soil cracking, and human aspects such as road and canal
construction.

April 29 to 30, 2014. A total of 16 areas were identified for excavation (numbered 1â16 north to
south) (Figure D2). Although 16 areas were designated for trenching, 3 of the areas were not
trenched. Areas 11 and 12 were not excavated due to landowner issues and the flooding of these
fields by the landowner. Area 16 was not excavated due to landowner issues at the time of the
trenching fieldwork. Each of the excavated trenches were 1 m (3 ft) wide, 5 m (17 ft), long, and
1.5 m (5 ft) deep (255 ftÂ²). Each trenching area was recorded with detailed descriptions of the soil
column, the locations of the trenches were recorded with a Trimble Geo XH, and the trench profiles
and setting were photographed. All data were recorded on Atkinsâ geoarchaeological logs.

Trench 1

Trench 1 is located in an open field located within a sharp bend of Resaca de los Fresnos, which
borders the field to the north, east, and west. The field in which the trench was located had been
cleared natural progression vegetation for livestock grazing; at the time of excavation, the field was
covered with grasses and stunted silver thorn acacia. To the east and west of the field was stands of
natural progression of vegetation that presents a hint of what the field looked like before clearing
with thick stands of acacia and scrub oak being present. The location and historical movement of
the resaca to the north indicated that the soils in this area are lateral accretion deposits. The soil
column consists of an A horizon and is a moist sandy-loam approximately 20.32 cm thick (7.5YR
4/3) (Figure D3). As depth increases, an At layer appears to a thickness of 60.96 cm (7.5YR 4/3). In
this layer the clay exhibits moist ribbons, but no slickensides and roots reach their terminal depth.
The underlying 60.96-cm-thick B horizon is a compact dry sandy-loam (7.5YR 5/4). The bottom
12.2 inches (31 cm) of the trench consists of an Et deposit of dry, flaky clay consisting of several
layers with calcite threads (7.5YR 7/3). The Et was deposited by a gentle stream and may be an
upper expression of the Beaumont Formation. This soils material equates to the Harlingen clay
soils. Harlingen clays are hyperthermic sodic haplusterts that formed from calcareous clayey
alluvium. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

flakey clay in the bottom of the trench)

Trench 2
Trench 2 is located 606 ft (185 m) east-southeast of Trench 1 in the southern edge of the same field.
As a result it has similar environmental characteristics. In the upper A horizon, a disturbed surface
zone is visible extending to a depth of 2.7 ft (88.2 cm) (5YR 4/2) (Figure D4). No rocks or inclusions
were noted; however, the layer does have heavy root disturbance. There is an unconformity in the
soil column with missing horizons observed in Trench 1. These could be the result of when the
resaca cut through the area to its current location. Underlying the A horizon is the Et horizon from
Trench 1 that consists of dry, powdery, compact clay, exhibiting numerous episodes of deposition
(7.5YR 7/3). This horizon begins at 2.7 ft (88.2 cm) of the surface and continues to the bottom of
the trench at 5 ft (152.8 cm). The transition between these two soils creates a very sharp horizon.
This horizon was deposited by a gentle stream and may be an eroded upper expression of the

Beaumont Formation. The soils in this area are identified as Harlingen clay soils. Nothing of cultural
resource interest was located within this trench.

(Note sharp transition between the A [darker upper soils] and Et layers)

Trench 3
Trench 3 is located 742 ft (226 m) southeast of Trench 1 within a fallow cornfield currently covered
with thin grasses. The field physically looks to remain wet most of the time and has several liner
earthen trenches to route excess water off the field into the resaca. The surface zone, Ap (7.5YR
5/3), is a plowzone of 1 ft (30.5 cm) in thickness (Figure D5). The Ap zone is underlain by an At
horizon and is 1 ft (30.5 cm) in thickness. This horizon consists of solid clay that has slickensides;
however, no rocks, inclusions, or calcite are observed. This At horizon is the undisturbed soil that
creates the disturbed Ap layer. The base Bt horizon (7.5YR 5/2) is 3 ft (91.4 cm) thick and is a
continuation of clays. This zone is slightly moist with some calcite nodules. The prominence of clays
suggests that this area was once a backswamp of the resaca. These soils are identified as Harlingen
clay soils. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

(Besides the upper Ap zone, the soil column consists of solid clays of close color)

Trench 4
Trench 4 is located 888 ft (270.8 m) southeast of Trench 3 within a ranch road ROW with areas of
low grass and bare ground. Immediately to the east is natural progression of vegetation and beyond
that the resaca. To the west are fallow agricultural fields and paddocks for cattle. The A horizon
(7.5YR 4/4), which is 1.2 ft (36.6 cm) thick, is silty clay and appears to have been disturbed,
possibly due to being located directly beside a buried irrigation pipe immediately on the northern
edge of the road (Figure D6). The B horizon consists of dry, very fine silt with no clay (10YR 7/3)
that is 2 ft (60.9 cm) in thickness. The sharp contrast between the A and B horizons is possibly due
to the disturbance in the area, especially considering that this is the only area where such a contrast
was observed. The base soil of this trench, B1 (10YR 6/4) appears to be the original deposit of siltclay, which has not been disturbed by mixing of the soils. This zone is dry and looks very similar to
material that makes up the Et horizon of Trenches 1 and 2. The soils in this area are identified as
Laredo silt-clay-loam deposits. Laredo soils are hypertheric torrifluventic haplustolls that formed
from calcareous silty alluvium. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

(The top two layers appear to be disturbed soils. The bottom layer of the trench is undisturbed.)

Trench 5
Trench 5 is located approximately 1,525 ft (464 m) southeast of Trench 4 in an agricultural field on
the north side of a built-up section of Resaca de los Fresnos. The recently plowed agricultural field
appears to be used for the growing of corn, with some wild muskmelons (Cucumis melo) also
observed. In spite of the recent rains, this soil column was drier than other soil columns observed in
the area. Ap (5YR 4/2) is 1 ft (30.5 cm) thick with some small quartzite river cobbles (Figure D7).
These cobbles probably originate from soils that were brought in to build up the resaca levees.
Horizon B (7.5YR 5/4) is a clay-loam, 2 ft (61.2 cm) thick, crumbly, with no inclusions. Beneath the
B is a BE horizon made of a mottled area indicated by a linear mixing of horizons B and C. This type
of mottling usually indicates that the area was inundated for an extended period of time. The base
soil of the trench is an E horizon (10YR 5/4) that is fine and compacted silt with no clay present.
These soils are identified as Cameron silt-clay deposits. Cameron soils are hyperthermic vertic
haplustolls that formed from calcareous clayey alluvium. Nothing of cultural resource interest was
located within this trench.

(Note the dryness of the soils within this trench in comparison with the earlier trenches)

Trench 6
Trench 6 is located approximately 470 ft (143.4 m) to the south of Trench 5 within the same
recently plowed agricultural field. Like that of Trench 5, the soil column, in spite of the recent rains,
was dryer than the soil columns observed earlier (Trenches 1â4). The Ap horizon (5YR 4/2)
consists of moist silt-loam, 1 ft (30.5 cm) deep containing some quartzite cobbles, which probably
originate from a nearby resaca (Figure D8). Beneath the Ap horizon is an At horizon (7.5YR 5.4)
(same as Ap but below the plowzone) that contains occasional pedogenic threads of calcite. The
base soil within Trench 6 is a B horizon (10YR 5/4) of dry silt with no clay or any other inclusions;
this may be the remnant flow area of the resaca. These soils are identified as Laredo silt-clay-loam
deposits. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

(Note the sharp change between the upper silt-loam and the bottom layer of silt)

Trench 7
Trench 7 is located approximately 902 ft (275 m) south of Trench 5 immediately south of the
southern man-made levee of Resaca de los Fresnos. The trenching area itself is located within a
recently plowed sorghum field. The upper 3.5 ft (106.7 cm) consists of a deposit of clay-silt (Figure
D9). This layer is split to an upper Ap horizon (7.5YR 4/3), which is 11 inches (27.9 cm) thick, and a
lower A horizon (7.5YR 4/4) that is 31 inches (78.7 cm) thick. The difference between the two
layers is due to plowing activities that have disturbed the Ap. These soils are crumbly and difficult
to ball due to the amount of silt in the soil. The lower 6 inches (15.2 cm) of the A horizon contains
small calcite nodules. The base soils within this trench consist of a Bt horizon (7.5YR 4/3) that
consists of moist clay-silt that is easy to ball. Besides the calcite nodules at the base of the A horizon,

no inclusions were observed within this trench. These soils are identified as Cameron silt-clay
deposits. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

(Note the narrow deposit of calcite nodules between A and B)

Trench 8
Trench 8 is located approximately 229 ft (70 m) south of Trench 5, south of the southern man-made
levee of Resaca de los Fresnos. The trenching area itself is located within a recently plowed
sorghum field. The upper 3.5 ft (106.7 cm) consists of a deposit of clay-silt (Figure D10). This layer
is split to an moist upper Ap horizon (7.5YR 4/3), which is 11 inches (27.9 cm) thick, and a lower
dry A horizon (7.5YR 4/4) that is 31 inches (78.7 cm) thick. The difference between the two layers
is due to plowing activities that have disturbed the Ap. These soils are crumbly and difficult to ball

due to the amount of silt in the soil. The base soils within this trench consist of a Bt horizon (10YR
5/3) that consists of moist clay-loam that is very compact. There are no indications that the
construction of the levee for the resaca disturbed these soils. These soils are identified as Laredo
silt-clay-loam deposits. No inclusions or anything of cultural resource interest was located within
this trench.

(Note the dryness of soils under the Ap horizon)

Trench 9
Trench 9 is located approximately 1,522 ft (464 m) south of Trench 8 within a recently plowed
sorghum field. The tract is bordered to the west by an irrigation canal that marks an abandoned
paleochannel of the resaca. To the east of the tract is an area of thick natural vegetation

progression. The soil column of this trench reflects the crossing of the resaca during the formation
of the current channel due to the various deposits of clay and mixing of the clay within the column.
The surface Ap (10YR 3/2) indicated the plowzone of the agricultural field (Figure D11). This
horizon is 11 inches (27.9 cm) thick; the clay is crumbly and prismatic. Under the plowzone is a BE
horizon of mottled clays, made up a mix of the Ap and B horizons. This 24-inch (60.96-cm)-thick
layer is heavily moist solid clay with no slickensides or inclusions. Under the BE horizon is a Bt
horizon that is 24 inches (60.96 cm) thick and consists of solid moist clay. The bottom 6 inches
(15.2 cm) of the trench contains occasional calcite nodules. These soils are identified as Laredo siltclay-loam deposits. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

Trench 10
Trench 10 is located on the south side of a field access road in an area of open fields located within
a bend of Resaca de los Cuates, which borders the field to the west and south. The fields in between
which the trench was located had been cleared natural progression vegetation for agricultural
purposes at the time of excavation; the field to the south was knee-high corn, and the field to the
north was covered with newly sprouted melons. The Resaca de los Cuates is lined with stands of
natural progression of vegetation that presents a hint of what the field looked like before clearing
with thick stands of acacia and scrub oak being present. At the time of the trenching activities, the
southern field was under heavy irrigation, which has flowed out that field into northern field and
partially flooding the access road and trenching area (Figure D12). The location and historical
movement of the resaca to the south indicated that the soils in this area are lateral accretion
deposits that were deposited as the resaca moved to the north and then retreated to the south. The
soil column consists of an Ap horizon (10YR 4/2) and is a moist sandy-clay-loam approximately
8 inches (20.3 cm) thick (Figure D13). As depth increases an A layer (10YR 4/2) appears to a
thickness of 10 inches (25.4 cm) sandy-loam. The underlying Bw horizon (10YR 6/2) is 22.9 inches
(58.4 cm) thick and consists of compact sandy-loam. The bottom 12.2 inches (31 cm) of the trench
consists of a Bk deposit of sandy-clay (10YR 6/2). These soils are identified as Laredo silt-clay-loam
deposits. Laredo soils are hypertheric torrifluventic haplustolls that formed from calcareous silty
alluvium. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

Trench 13
Trench 13 is located on the south side of Resaca de los Cuates, which borders the field to the west
and north. The fields in between which the trench was located had been cleared natural
progression vegetation for agricultural purposes at the time of excavation; the field was covered
with a thick growth of knee-high corn. The Resaca de los Cuates is lined with stands of natural
progression of vegetation that presents a hint of what the field looked like before clearing with
thick stands of acacia and scrub oak being present. Soils within this trench are moderately moist;
however, the soil remains chunky. The soil column consists of an Ap horizon (10YR 4/2) is a moist
sandy-clay-loam approximately 8 inches (20.3 cm) thick (Figure D14). As depth increases, an A
layer (10YR 4/2) appears to a thickness of 10 inches (25.4 cm) sandy-loam. Calcite nodules appear
within the upper portion of the A layer and steadily increases with depth. The underlying Bw
horizon (10YR 6/2) is 23 inches (58.4 cm) thick and consists of company sandy-loam. The bottom
12.2 inches (31 cm) of the trench consists of a Bk deposit of sandy-clay (10YR 6/2) that displays
light slickensides and polish. These soils are identified as Laredo silt-clay-loam deposits. Nothing of
cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

Trench 14
Trench 14 is located approximately 600 ft (183 m) south-southwest of Trench 13 and within the
same agricultural field of knee-high corn (Figure D15). Soils within this trench change drastically
from Trench 13 and may be the result of a buried backswamp that was created as the Resaca de los
Cuates meandered northward and has since dried and filled-in. The soil column consists of an Ap
horizon (10YR 4/1) is a moist sandy-clay approximately 7 inches (17.8 cm) thick (Figure D16). As
depth increases an A layer (10YR 4/1) appears as a sandy-clay layer with a thickness of 9 inches
(22.9 cm) this soil is very friable. An Ak layer (10YR 5/2) follows with a thickness of 7 inches
(17.8 cm) and consists of sandy-clay that is blocky and hard. Calcite nodules appear within the
bottom portion of the Ak layer and steadily increases with depth. The underlying Bk horizon (10YR

increasing calcite nodules. The remaining soil column consists of Ck deposit of sandy-clay (10YR
7/3), which is hard and firm with yellow mottles and a few thin strata of sand-loam. These soils are
identified as Olmito silt-clay soils. Omito soils are hyperthermic vertic calciusolls that formed from
calcareous clayey alluvium. Nothing of cultural resource interest was located within this trench.

Trench 15
Trench 15 is located approximately 800 ft (244 m) northwest of the remains of a meander channel
of Resaca de las Flores within an agricultural field of knee-high corn. Soils within this trench change
drastically from the other trenches to the north as this trenchâs entire soil column is clay deposits.
The surface of the soil column consists of an Ap horizon made of blocky, firm clay (10YR 5/2)
approximately 11 inches (27.9 cm) thick (Figure D17). As depth increases an A layer (10YR 5/2)
appears as a sandy-clay layer with a thickness of 11 inches (27.9 cm); this soil is very hard and very
firm with moderate moisture. A Bss layer (7.5YR 5/2) follows with a thickness of 12 inches
(30.48 cm) and consists of clay that is blocky and hard with slickensides. The underlying Bnss
horizon (7.5YR 6/3) is at least 26 inches (66.04 cm) thick and consists of clay, which is moist, very
hard, and firm with predominant slickensides. These soils are identified as Harlingen clay soils.
Harlingen clays are hyperthermic sodic haplusterts that formed from calcareous clayey alluvium.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Atkins conducted geoarchaeological test trenching in support of the proposed Cross Valley Pipeline
Project located in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, Texas, from January 30 to February 1, and from
April 29 to 30, 2014. A total of 13 backhoe trenches were excavated with HPAs near Resaca de los
Fresnos, Resaca de los Cuates, and Reseaca de las Flores. These areas were located within active
agricultural fields and open fields for used for grazing livestock. No cultural resources,
paleontological, or inclusions were observed in the sidewalls or back piles of any of the 13
excavated trenches. Three proposed trench sites were not excavated due to landowner issues at the
time of both field sessions. It is recommended that these three areas be monitored by a qualified
archaeologist at the time of the pipeline excavation for the presence of buried archaeological
remains and to complete the geoarchaeological study of these areas.

Due to the absence of observed cultural resources in the HPAs during trenching, it is Atkinsâ
professional opinion that the installation of the Cross Valley Pipeline within the trenched areas will
have no effect on potential cultural resources within the project area. If cultural resources are
encountered during the pipeline construction, the project should ease activities at that location
until a qualified professional archaeologist can assess the significance of the findings.
