PROJECT BACKGROUND
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (U.S. Army COE), Albuquerque District, is examining the
feasibility of constructing five floodwater detention structures in El Paso County, Texas, near the
unincorporated community of Sparks (Figure 1). Sparks is located approximately 15 miles eastsoutheast of the city of El Paso, Texas, between the towns of Socorro and Horizon City, Texas.
The five proposed dam sites are located north and south of the Sparks community (Figure 2 and
Figure 3). The U.S. Army COE project is a feasibility study authorized by the Flood Control Act
of 1941 (as amended) and funded with federal and El Paso County monies. The proposed
projects are located on private, state, and county lands.
The purpose of this cultural resource survey was to assist the U.S. Army COE in fulfilling federal
and state responsibilities regarding cultural resources in compliance with federal and state cultural
resources laws and regulations, Executive Orders, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Regulations. These include the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (PL 89-665
et seq.), National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (PL 90-190), and the Antiquities
Code of Texas. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5508.

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI) conducted intensive pedestrian survey and global positioning system
(GPS) site documentation of the five survey parcels. The total area surveyed within the five
parcels was approximately 309 acres. Two previously recorded historic sites and one previously
recorded prehistoric site, one new historic site, and 35 isolated occurrences were documented
during the survey. The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) eligibility of each site was evaluated based on surface observations of cultural
features and materials and geomorphic observations regarding the context and integrity of cultural
deposits. The research potential of the single prehistoric site was evaluated with reference to a
comprehensive series of research issues based on the current state of knowledge of the prehistory
of the Jornada Mogollon region of west Texas and southern New Mexico. This information will
assist the U.S. Army COE in its consultations with the Texas Historical Commission (Texas
SHPO) to determine if the proposed undertaking will have an adverse effect on historic properties
or SAL and thus if mitigation treatments such as avoidance, data recovery excavations, or
architectural documentation will be required prior to construction.

REGIONAL CULTURE HISTORY
A cultural historical review of the prehistory and history of the Jornada Mogollon region of west
Texas and southern New Mexico is provided in Appendix A. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004)
provide a more detailed review of regional prehistory.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND ANTICIPATED CULTURAL RESOURCES
Large areas of the Hueco Bolson to the north were the subject of some of the first cultural
resources surveys of the region conducted during the early 1970s (Lynn et al. 1975; Whalen
1977, 1978). One such survey â the Texas Public Lands survey of Texas General Land Office
(GLO) properties - included the Upper Sparks survey parcel (Lynn et al. 1975). The GLO survey
documented one prehistoric archaeological site (41EP52) within the current survey parcel. The
GLO Public Lands survey recorded a total of 246 archaeological sites. All consisted of lowdensity scatters of chipped stone and/or ceramics, many associated with fire-cracked rock or
burned caliche hearth features. Many of these sites were described as heavily eroded at the time
of the survey in 1974.
Surveys along the lower terrace of the Rio Grande valley were first conducted by the University
of Texas at El Paso under the direction of Rex Gerald in 1978 (El Paso Centennial Museum files
and Texas Site Atlas). Several prehistoric and historic sites were documented during these
surveys. Survey and testing projects for proposed flood control projects were conducted at a
parcel to the northwest of the present project area (Earls and Newton 1987; Tanner and Acklen
1986). One prehistoric site (41EP2611) was tested and chronometric dating identified Middle
Archaic and late Formative period (El Paso phase) components.
Another intensive survey of the valley margin was conducted in 1995 as part of San Elizario Field
School sponsored by the University of Texas at El Paso (Peterson and Green 1995). This survey
revisited 11 previously recorded sites (41EP 426-432, 41EP 3017, and 41EP 4689) and identified
49 new sites (41EP 5206-5234 and 41EP 5236- 5256). The majority of the sites were small
prehistoric artifact scatters and camps but several historic period refuse dumps and farmsteads or
ranch houses were recorded. Much of the terrace setting of the sites had been disturbed by
agricultural and ranching settlements. Another small survey completed between Parcels A4 and
A5/A6 of the current project identified several pithouse villages (Graves and Peterson 1996).

3

Finally, two sites (41EP432 and 41EP 5251) were tested for the proposed Mission del Paso
Campus of the El Paso Community College (Thompson et al. 1998). This project identified
several hearth features and one pithouse structure dating to the Formative period (A.D. 200/400 to
1450).

SURVEY METHODS
An intensive archaeological survey of the five parcels (265.47 acres of 308.7 total acres) under
consideration for water detention structures was conducted. The unsurveyed acreage included
areas that have been developed or for which landowner access could not be obtained.
Survey methods included systematic survey transects spaced 15 m apart. The transects were
oriented according to the variable shapes of the five survey parcels. Archaeologists walked
zigzag transects to ensure full coverage. The survey was conducted over the course of five days
by two professional archaeologists.
Prehistoric and historic archaeological sites and isolated occurrences were documented in the
field. Sites were defined as concentrations of 10 or more artifacts within a 10-m radius and/or
multiple features. Isolated occurrences were classified as nine or fewer artifacts within a 10-m
radius of each other, or an isolated feature with no potential for dating. All cultural materials
considered historic (prior to 1960) by Texas SHPO standards were recorded.
At each site, GMI conducted armâs-length, transect survey, individually flagging all artifacts and
features. Photographs were taken of all survey parcels, sites, major features or structures, and
examples of exposed stratigraphy. Datum points, artifacts, features, and site boundaries were
recorded with a GPS unit with sub-meter capabilities. No artifacts or cultural materials were
collected during the survey. Important chronologically and technologically diagnostic artifacts
were described and plotted using the GPS.
In-field artifact recording was conducted. Attributes recorded on debitage included flake size,
thickness, material type, platform type when present, dorsal scar patterns, completeness, and
percent of cortex. For groundstone, cores, and lithic tools, the artifact type (e.g., mano, projectile
point, core, metate, biface, etc.), maximum length, width, and thickness, completeness, material
type, percent cortex, number of utilized edges, length of utilized edge, edge wear patterns and
shape of utilized edge were recorded. Ceramic attributes included the general ceramic ware,
ceramic type, vessel form, portion, and length. GMI also recorded basic information on historic
artifact types and basic diagnostic information (e.g., makerâs mark, date on bottle).
All prehistoric features were shovel tested to assess integrity and potential for organic deposits.
These tests were 25-cm by 25-cm in size. The stratigraphy of exposed arroyo cut banks was
recorded within the five survey parcels.
An overview of the geomorphology of the parcels was conducted by the Field Supervisor (who
has completed a formal training course in aeolian geomorphology conducted by Dr. David
Kuehn, former staff geomorphologist for GMI). Particular attention was given to defining
geomorphic-topographic zones. Surface inspection of each zone and parcel was conducted to
obtain a first-order impression of the integrity and extent of Holocene-aged deposits. Arroyo and
road cuts and other exposures were examined to determine the depth of deposits in selected areas.

RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
One previously recorded prehistoric site (41EP52), two previously recorded historic sites
(41EP5252 and 41EP5255), one new historic site (41EP6418), and 35 isolated occurrences (IO)
were recorded during the survey.

Four of the five proposed survey parcels are situated on the first terrace above the Rio Grande
Valley floodplain. Previous surveys of these parcels (Peterson et al. 1998) identified both small,
low-density settlements and larger and more intensively occupied camps and possible pithouse
villages. Some degree of alluvial deposition is present on the floodplain terraces and buried
cultural deposits could be present. Portions of two of the parcels extend into the valley floodplain
and contain deep alluvial and fluvial deposits. These areas are presently utilized for irrigated
cropland and have a very low potential for cultural resources.
The fifth parcel (Upper Sparks) is located at the beginning of the larger arroyo to the west of the
floodplain and is situated on the second Rio Grande terrace landform. This topographic setting is
largely an erosional landform and the preservation of cultural deposits is poor. Areas within and
around this parcel were surveyed in 1974 as part of the inventory of Texas General Land Office
properties in El Paso County (Lynn et al. 1975). One small previously recorded site (41EP52)
was present within the parcel.

UPPER SPARKS PARCEL
The largest of the five survey parcels is situated on the second terrace of the Rio Grande terrace.
It is adjacent to recent urban developments in Horizon City. The southern portion of the parcel is
covered by deep loamy fine sands with a trace of Rio Grande gravels (Figure 4). This parcel
consisted of two survey blocks separated by Ellsworth Drive (Figure 5). The northern area has
been heavily impacted by recent housing developments where at least 6 acres is covered by
recently built houses (Figure 6). Several drainage channels are present in the northern portion.
Flora is dominated by creosote with a few mesquite, fourwing saltbush, soaptree yucca, grasses,
and prickly pear. Surface visibility in this area ranges from 80 to 90 percent.

Figure 6. The northern portion of the Upper Sparks survey parcel showing new residential
developments of Horizon City.
Sites and cultural materials recorded in the Upper Sparks parcel include one previously recorded
prehistoric site (41EP52) and 17 isolated occurrences (IO 1 â 14 and IO 17 â 19; see Figure 5).
Most of the isolated occurrences consisted of modern and historic trash deposited along Texas
Farm-to-Market-Road 1281.

A1/A3 PARCEL
The westernmost of the four parcels along the lower Rio Grande terrace covers 39 acres and
includes a small area of irrigated agricultural fields. The majority of surface deposits in this
parcel has been disturbed by historic and modern farming and by impacts associated with the
construction of Eastlake Road. Eastlake Road follows the course of the historic Old Hueco Tanks
Road. The only remaining undisturbed areas are along the edge of the terrace and a small area at
the northwestern edge of the parcel (Figure 7). The terrace consists of alluvial and aeolian
sediments that may reach several meters in depth (Figure 8). Flora is diverse and includes
mesquite, fourwing saltbush, creosote, dropseed, soaptree yucca, littleleaf sumac, and broom
snakeweed. Dense communities of weeds and other annual plants are present in the disturbed
areas. Surface visibility varies from 40 percent in areas of high density of flora to 80 percent
along the escarpment edge.
Cultural materials recorded in this parcel include a previously recorded historic site (41EP5255),
several prehistoric isolated occurrences along the terrace edge (IO 21-28), and a historic corral
and associated fence line near the valley margin (IO 16; Figure 9). The historic site consisted of
materials left or discarded along Old Hueco Tanks Road. Many of these materials had been
displaced and exposed during the recent construction of Eastlake Road.

A4 SURVEY PARCEL
The A4 survey parcel is southeast of Eastlake Road and borders the El Paso Community College
Mission del Paso Campus (Figure 10). The survey parcel covered 21.07 acres. This parcel has
been impacted by numerous dirt roads, modern trash dumps, and the development of the Mission
Early College High School. A portion of the parcel is presently utilized as a parking lot near
school campus. Only the eastern margins of this parcel were intact.

Figure 10. Overview of survey parcel A4.
Soil deposits are exposed in arroyo channels and include surface deposits of recent eolian sands
of up to a meter in depth deposited over alternating layers of sandy silts and gravels and aeolian
sands (Figure 11). Recent trash deposits are exposed in some arroyos. Flora consists of creosote,
mesquite, fourwing saltbush, dropseed, soaptree yucca, and broom snakeweed.
Cultural materials recorded in the A4 survey parcel include one previously recorded historic
farmstead or ranch house (41EP5252) and six historic isolated occurrences (IO 20, 29 â 31, 33,
and 35 (Figure 12). The historic isolated occurrences included small scatters of historic trash,
fence lines, a utility pole, and a concrete foundation with scattered pieces of metal trash.

A5/A6 PARCEL
The A5/A6 parcel is situated along the valley terrace edge to the southeast of El Paso Community
College Mission del Paso Campus. This parcel covers 24.74 acres. About half an acre of the
northeastern edge of the parcel has been developed through the construction of several classroom
buildings associated with the campus (Figure 13). A portion of the parcel extends into the valley
floodplain and contains irrigated and plowed agricultural fields. A large arroyo nearly 3 m in
depth passes through the northern part of the parcel, exposing the alluvial stratigraphy underlying
the parcel. Flora consists of creosote, prickly pear, soaptree yucca, and mesquite. Cultural
resources identified in the A5/A6 survey parcel include only two isolated occurrences (Figure
14): a lithic flake and utilized flake.

VALLEY RIDGE PARCEL
The integrity of the 29.39-acre Valley Ridge parcel was almost entirely destroyed in the late
1950s and early 1960s. Only a very small portion in the west-central area of the parcel retains
any intact sediments and natural flora (Figure 15). Modern impacts include a half-acre asphalt lot
and an abandoned truck stop (41EP6418) that covers nearly three acres of the southern part of the
parcel. The remainder of the parcel has been mechanically stripped and bulldozed and presently
serves as an illegal dumping ground for tires, construction material, and other trash. Cultural
resources recorded in the Valley Ridge survey parcel include the aforementioned truck stop that
was in operation during the 1950s and 1960s (41EP6418) and a historic corral (Figure 16).

Figure 15. View of the extent of historic and modern disturbances to the Valley Ridge survey
parcel.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
The survey documented three previously recorded sites (41EP52, 41EP5252, and 41EP5255), one
newly recorded site (41EP6418), and 35 isolated finds. The sites include one prehistoric site in
the Upper Sparks survey parcel (41EP52), one historic dump in the A1/A3 survey parcel
(41EP5255), one historic farmstead/ranch site (41EP5252) in the A4 survey parcel, and a modern
commercial site (41EP6418) in the Valley Ridge survey parcel. The isolated occurrences include
historic and prehistoric artifacts. The GPS-recorded UTM coordinates for the site datum markers
are listed in Appendix B.

41EP52
Site 41EP52 is a small prehistoric campsite situated on a sandy ridge of the second Rio Grande
terrace and north of the Sparks Colonia. Elevation of the site is 1,198 m (3,930 ft) above mean
sea level (amsl). The site measures 74 m east/west and 65 m north/south for a total area of 1,626
square meters (0.402 acres1). Vegetation consists of fourwing saltbush, broom snakeweed, and
creosote. Soils in the area have been classified as Bluepoint Association and described as loamy,
fine sands (Jaco 1971). Flora covers roughly 10 to 20 percent of the site surface.
The site was originally recorded in 1974 during the survey of GLO lands in east El Paso County
(Lynn et al. 1975). The report states the site contained three, single-facet, platform flakes, one
unifacially trimmed tool, one thick biface, one miscellaneous altered pebble, and one unspecified
ceramic associated with a disturbed hearth feature on a ridge (Lynn et al. 1975:69). A review of
the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) site form found that the site covered a 20
square meter area and was classified as an open camp. Two sandstone bifaces and two ceramics
were collected (note that the counts do not match the survey report). One of the ceramics is
described as painted (likely a decorated variety of El Paso brownware).
The present survey recorded the site as a concentration of 10 pieces of burned caliche in a 2-m by
2-m area (Feature 1), a scatter of roughly 15 pieces of burned caliche located 30 m to the west, a
single flake, and an isolated piece of burned caliche (Figure 17). Feature 1 was shovel tested and
found to consist of a 1-m concentration of approximately 50 pieces of burned caliche. The
feature was reported as heavily eroded in 1974 and testing during the current project confirmed
this since no organic deposits or charcoal were observed.
The site is in very poor condition. Aeolian and sheetwash erosion and all terrain vehicle (ATV)
use have affected the feature and integrity of deposits. Artifacts and burned caliche have been
displaced for distances of 20 m or more downslope. The site likely represents a single
component, Formative period occupation.

41EP5252
Site 41EP5252 is the remains of a historic farmstead previously recorded during the San Elizario
Field School (Peterson and Green 1997:327-329). The historic farmstead was recorded as an
abandoned adobe house 40-m long by 28-m wide and 8-m high. Associated structures include a
corral, pump house, water trough, and several areas of modern and historic trash. The debris
covers a 6,700-square meter area. The house was constructed of adobe bricks with plaster over a
chicken wire base. A porch on the west side of the house and a patio on the east side extended
the length of the house. The house contained five doors and four windows, with a flat tarshingled board roof. Traces of paint were still present that suggested that the house was painted
white on the exterior with pink interior walls. A single stovepipe hole in a standing wall was
evidence of a wood burning stove. A pump house and a water trough were present, but no
evidence of a privy was noted. The trash present included a variety of bottle glass with bottle
manufacturing dates ranging from as early as 1941 to as late as 1973. Other trash included cans,
ceramics, wood, cloth, and pieces of building materials. The site dates to the early 1940s through
the 1970s, based on the type of trash and artifacts present in association with the house.

Site areas in square meters and acres for this and subsequent site descriptions are based on GIS shapefiles

Figure 17: Map of site 41EP52.

During the current investigation, the site was found to have severely deteriorated over the decade
since it was first recorded. Only a part of the north wall remains intact and erect (Figure 18). The
water trough is still present but some cemented foundation bricks are all that remain of the pump
house. Two concentrated trash areas were recorded. As previously noted, the bulk of the trash is
fairly recent. Bottling manufacturers such as Empire Bottling, Vess, and Coca-Cola were noted.
Also present were hole-in-top cans, ceramics, milled wood, cloth, and building materials such as
bricks and nails. The materials and trash deposits cover a 123-m by 72-m area, encompassing
7,233-square meters (1.787 acres).

Figure 18. View of the primary structure at 41EP5252 showing the lack of integrity of
architectural remains.
Manufacturing dates for bottles recorded at the site range from 1941 to 1955 (Peterson and Green
1997: 328). The site has potential for intact, buried deposits, perhaps including privy deposits, as
noted in the arroyo wall where trash deposits were observed at depths of 40 to 50 cm.

41EP5255
Site 41EP5255 consists of several historic and modern trash and landfill deposits displaced by
construction of Eastlake Road. The site was originally documented during the San Elizario Field
School in 1995 (Peterson and Green 1997). The bottle dump/landfill site originally extended
along much of the length of Old Hueco Tanks road between the valley escarpment and Interstate
10 (Peterson and Green 1997:333-335). The site was interpreted as a series of trash dumps and
discards along the historic road. The scattered dumps included many breaker bottles from various
bottling companies in El Paso, Texas, from as early as the WWI to the late 1970s.

18

The current survey found that most of the deposits and materials from this site had been displaced
by the construction of Eastlake Road and redeposited downslope. The materials were
concentrated within a 63-m by 25-m area encompassing a 1,645-square meter (0.406-acre) area.
The site has recently been further disturbed by a drainage channel. The redeposited trash can be
seen exposed in this arroyo wall at depths up to 1.5 m (Figure 19). The integrity of the deposits
has been compromised by having been displaced, concentrated, and mixed together in the present
dump location. The site no longer retains any stratigraphic or horizontal spatial integrity.

Figure 19. Exposed trash lenses at 41EP5255.

41EP6418
41EP6418 is newly recorded site consisting of an abandoned truck weigh and rest station. It is
located along Stockyard Drive, 768 m west of the present course of Interstate 10. The site
measures 151-m east/west and 125-m north/south wide for a total area of 11,241-square meters
(2.777 acres). Eight features were recorded during this investigation (Figure 20), including five
buildings constructed of concrete, cinder block, and stone. Additional structures include a truck
weigh scale, truck wash, and a swimming pool. The buildings were stripped of interior items and
thus it is difficult to determine their function or role in the truck stop. The standing structures
have been extensively vandalized and covered with graffiti and trash.
Feature 1 is a 5-m by 13-m cinder block structure with a concrete slab foundation, flat roof of
concrete, and a low parapet. The structure has three rooms and three doors. A curved rock wall
approximately 1.5-m high created a small courtyard behind the building. A wooden addition was
constructed to the northeast end of Feature 1. The wooden section of the building was burned in
the past. A large area (~ 30 m by 28 m) of concrete pavement (courtyard) lies in front of this
main building, and is bound by a cinderblock wall with a drive-through gate. There are concrete
troughs on each side of the gate.

Feature 2 is an octagonal-shaped structure constructed of concrete walls, a foundation, and a roof
(Figure 21). It measures 13-m in length from wall to wall, with each side measuring 5-m in
length and 2.5-m in height. The interior is supported by steel columns and two short walls
creating partitions. The roof is smooth and surrounded by a steel pipe railing with the horizontal
rails now missing.

Figure 21. View of Feature 2, the primary structure at 41EP6418.
Feature 3 is a truck scale with a sloping approach ramp at the southeast end. It is attached to the
large paved courtyard area next to Feature 1. The structure is of concrete with the scale itself
made of steel. The ramp is 13-m long and 5-m wide. The scale is 22-m long and 5-m wide.
Feature 4 is a kidney- shaped swimming pool, 12-m in length, approximately 4-m wide, and 2-m
deep. It is constructed of concrete and trimmed with tile. A textured concrete walkway 1-m wide
surrounds the pool.
Feature 5 is a stone building, approximately 5-m by 5-m and 2.5-m high, with a flat plywood roof
supported by six, 4 inch by 6 inch, milled lumber roof support beams that extend the width of the
building. The front door is metal framed and the back door is of wood. The interior is gutted
with some large pipes in the concrete floor and three PVC pipe holes in the southwest wall.
Feature 6 is a wash station for trucks. It is a concrete pad measuring 36-m by 17-m. It slopes
from both ends with a center section serving as drainage through a stone wall into the quarry. All
associated wash equipment is missing. Adjacent to Feature 6 are two concrete supports for a
large tank and a 2-m diameter concrete ring.

21

Feature 7 is a stone building similar in style to Feature 5. It measures 3-m on either side with a
flat plywood roof supported by four, 4 inch by 6 inch, milled lumber roof braces that extended the
width of the building. Its proximity to the swimming pool suggests that it was associated with the
pool and may be a changing room.
Feature 8 is similar in style and construction to Features 5 and 7. This stone building is 8-m by 3Â­
m in size and 2.5-m high. The roof (missing) was supported by ten, 4 inch by 6 inch, pieces of
milled lumber that had extended the width of the building. It had two wood frame doors at either
end with two metal casement windows in the front. There is a concrete stall in the interior
southeast corner. Associated with Feature 8 is a 24-m long wall oriented southwest to northeast
that borders a gravel quarry drainage area aside the site to the southeast.
Cultural materials on the site are dominated by 1950-1960s bottle fragments, bottle caps, and a
large amount of modern trash and debris. The integrity of the standing structures has been
compromised by vandalism and graffiti.

ISOLATED OCCURRENCES
Thirty-five IO were documented during the survey (Table 1). These include 24 prehistoric IO
that range from burned caliche scatters to isolated chipped-stone, groundstone, and ceramic
artifacts. In-field analysis was completed on all prehistoric artifacts and this information is
provided in Appendix C. The remaining 11 IO represent materials and/or features of historic age.
Most of the IO are items of trash discarded along historic and modern roads. Several isolated
corrals and fences associated with ranching and farming were found along the valley margin.

DISCUSSION
An archaeological survey was conducted of five parcels for proposed water retention and flood
control structures near the Sparks Colonia in East El Paso County, Texas. One previously
recorded prehistoric site (41EP52), two previously recorded historic sites (41EP5252 and
41EP5255), one new historic site (41EP6418), and 35 isolated occurrences were recorded during
the survey. The integrity of all of these sites has been compromised due to a wide range of
factors, including natural aeolian and sheetwash erosion and off-road vehicle damage. The most
extensive impacts have been caused by modern construction impacts, vandalism, neglect, and
natural deterioration.
23

NRHP AND SAL EVALUATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
41EP52: This is a small, low-density prehistoric site. The site has minimal assemblage content
in association with an eroded hearth. The site has been severely degraded by erosion and off-road
vehicles and was recorded in this deteriorated state in 1974. Subsurface testing during the present
survey determined that the hearth has no chronometric potential. Accordingly, this site does not
meet Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4 and is not recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP,
nor does the site merit formal nomination as an SAL.
41EP5252: This site consists of a farm or ranch settlement dating to the 1940s through the
1970s. The site has deteriorated significantly since first recorded in 1995 and the architecture and
buildings have no integrity. In accordance with the policy of the Texas Historical Commission
regarding twentieth century sites, the site will not provide significant information on the history
of the region beyond what could be obtained through archival research. Accordingly, this site
does not meet any of the criteria of 36 CFR 60.4 and is not recommended as eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP, nor does the site merit formal nomination as an SAL.
41EP5255: This site consists of displaced and redeposited historic and modern trash along a
historic road. The site lacks integrity and has no research significance. Accordingly, this site
does not meet any of the criteria of 36 CFR 60.4 and is not recommended as eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP, nor does the site merit formal nomination as an SAL.
41EP6418: This site is a modern, truck weigh and rest station. The architecture and buildings
are basic modern constructions and retain little to no integrity given the combined impacts of
neglect, vandalism, and natural deterioration. In accordance with the policy of the Texas
Historical Commission regarding twentieth century sites, the site will not provide significant
information on the history of the region beyond what could be obtained through archival research.
Accordingly, this site does not meet any of the criteria of 36 CFR 60.4 and is not recommended
as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, nor does the site merit nomination as an SAL.
In summary, no prehistoric or historic sites eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or warranting
nomination as SAL are present in the five survey parcels examined during this project. Should
one or more of the five parcels be selected for construction of dams and other flood control
structures, it is recommended that the proposed undertaking proceed without further
archaeological work.

The following discussion of the prehistoric and protohistoric culture history of the project region
up to A.D. 1680 is adapted and modified from an overview of the Jornada Mogollon region by
Miller and Kenmotsu (2004). The prehistory of this area is divided into several periods,
beginning with the Paleo-Indian and continuing through the Historic period (Table A.1).

Pre-Clovis Tradition (~50,000 TO 10,000 B.C.)
The existence of pre-Clovis occupations in North America, or a "Pre-Projectile Point Horizon" as
it is occasionally referred to, has been the subject of considerable debate since Alex Krieger first
suggested that pre-Clovis lithic traditions (40,000 to 15,000 B.C.) existed in Texas and elsewhere
throughout the United States (Krieger 1953, 1962, 1964).
Claims of pre-Clovis manifestations in the Jornada Mogollon region continue to create a
substantial amount of controversy (Chrisman et al. 1996; MacNeish 1993a; MacNeish and Libby
2003; MacNeish et al. 1993). MacNeish and Libby (2003) claim that a pre-Clovis occupation
exists based on excavations at Pendejo Cave, a deeply stratified rock shelter located on McGregor
Range east of Orogrande, New Mexico. Zones C1 through O exhibited a well-stratified sequence
of radiocarbon dates ranging between 12,000 and ~50,000 years in age. These strata contained
26

large quantities of Pleistocene faunal material, well-preserved plant remains, and other eco-facts
that were purportedly in association with hearths, stone artifacts, modified animal bones, human
skin impressions, and human hair.
Middle and Late Holocene occupation of the shelter by human groups is not contested.
Arguments for a human presence in the cave during the Late Pleistocene, prior to 10,000 B.C. and
up to 50,000 years in age, are established on less conclusive findings. Claims of pre-Clovis
occupations have been based primarily on the presence of a small quantity of crudely
manufactured stone artifacts, a very small number of bones with fractures or marks that could be
suggestive of human modification, hearth features constructed of stones differing petrologically
and chemically from the limestone rock formations comprising the natural setting of the cave, and
the presence of hair and skin imprints claimed to be of human origin.
An independent evaluation of the site conducted in 1995 by Fort Bliss archaeologists and Tom
Stafford of the University of Colorado resulted in a revised interpretation of the stratigraphic
sequence. In addition, 15 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) radiocarbon dates were obtained
from rodent pellets collected from well-documented columns in two exposed profiles in the
shelter. The results of this study have not been reported, but preliminary analyses suggest that the
stratigraphic sequence and assumed integrity of the layered deposits may require substantial
reconsideration (Stafford 1995). Extensive packrat middens are present throughout the shelter
and preliminary results of the radiocarbon dating suggest that the degree of disturbance in the
deposits is greater than previously assumed (Stafford 1995).
If proven that valid cultural occupations exist in the lower strata, such findings would contribute
to a reevaluation of pre-Clovis cultures in North America. The series of independent studies
conducted so far, however, do not support the argument for a Pleistocene human presence in the
region.
Paleo-Indian Period (10,000 to 6000 B.C.)
The earliest conclusively documented evidence of prehistoric human occupation in the Jornada
region occurs during the Paleo-Indian period. Paleo-Indian adaptations have been viewed as a
tradition of small, highly mobile bands with a subsistence economy centered on hunting large
game animals such as mammoth and bison (Judge 1973). The period is subdivided into three
sequential traditions marked by functional and stylistic differences in tool kits that are thought to
reflect changing hunting and settlement adaptations: the Clovis and Folsom complexes of the
early Paleo-Indian period, and the Plano/Cody complex of the late Paleo-Indian period.
Recognition of Paleo-Indian sites in the Jornada region has been accomplished principally
through cross-dating distinctive lanceolate projectile point forms with those found at
chronometrically dated habitation and kill sites in adjacent regions of the Great Plains. PaleoIndian culture is represented primarily by isolated finds of projectile points and by a small
number of open-air sites located within the Tularosa Basin and Hueco and Mesilla bolsons.
Substantial numbers of Paleo-Indian artifacts have been documented across the Jornada region;
however, the number pales in comparison with the number of sites from later time periods.
Several sites have been investigated, but few have been fully reported. At the present time, no
absolute chronometric dates have been obtained from contexts or features in secure association
with Paleo-Indian materials in the Jornada. The only radiocarbon dates falling within this period
were obtained from deposits of charred material deeply buried in floodplain alluvium of the Rio
Grande Valley north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. The samples were collected during
geomorphic studies of Quaternary surfaces in the valley (Gile et al. 1981) and the deposits from
which the samples were obtained were not described. Additional early dates have been obtained
from Fresnal Shelter, Burnett Cave, and Hermit Cave in the Sacramento-Guadalupe mountain

27

chain; although in each case, the association of the date and any human occupation or material
culture remains inconclusive (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The environment during this time is characteristic of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition:
moist woodlands and continual stream flow in mountains and other high elevation settings and
standing lakes and marshes throughout the interior basins. Evidence from packrat middens
suggests juniper-oak woodlands along with grassland savannahs in the basins during the early
part of the period. Increasingly drier conditions prevailed until 6000 B.C. when woodlands were
displaced by Chihuahuan, desert scrub communities and large game animals became extinct (Van
Devender 1990).
Early Paleo-Indian - Clovis Complex
Knowledge of Clovis occupation in the Jornada Mogollon region has been obtained almost
entirely through rare isolated finds of the distinctive, fluted, lanceolate projectile points
characteristic of the period. However, few Clovis points and even fewer Clovis sites have been
documented (Meltzer and Bever 1995). Two habitation sites of this period have been reported
from the Jornada Mogollon region. Beckett (1983) notes the presence of Clovis tools mixed with
later Paleo-Indian materials at a site in Rhodes Canyon, located in the southern Tularosa Basin of
New Mexico. Weber and Agogino (1997) reported a substantial Clovis occupation at
Mockingbird Gap in the northern Tularosa Basin. The excavators noted the presence of several
suspected living surfaces; approximately one hundred, whole and partial Clovis points were
recovered during the investigations, as well as a substantive quantity of small mammoth bone
fragments. Otherwise, very few artifacts or occupations attributable to this period have been
recorded during the course of numerous professional archaeological surveys on Fort Bliss and
many other areas of the region; it appears that Clovis manifestations are exceptionally rare within
the Jornada Mogollon region. The nature of Clovis settlement types, hunting and subsistence
adaptations, mobility patterns, or technological organization in the Jornada remain almost entirely
unknown.
Early Paleo-Indian - Folsom Complex
Folsom manifestations in the Jornada region are much better known than their Clovis
predecessors. Numerous Folsom points and occupation sites have been recorded during
archaeological surveys. Although they have been found in many topographic zones, including
mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, most Folsom materials have been documented near playa
basins, major and minor drainages, and the margins of the Rio Grande Valley, which may
indicate an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources. Several excavations of
Folsom components have been undertaken during the past decade, including at a site in Fillmore
Pass on Fort Bliss (Stiger n.d.), Boles Wells in the Tularosa Basin (Mauldin and OâLeary 1994),
and Padre Canyon sites 41HZ504 and 41HZ505 in the Hueco Bolson southeast of El Paso
(Mauldin and Amick 1998; Mauldin and Leach 1997). The nature of Folsom tool forms,
subsistence adaptations, and mobility patterns in the region has also been the subject of serious
investigation (Amick 1994a, 1995, 1996).
Due to the absence of stratigraphically ordered deposits, most Folsom components are mixed with
later occupations, making inferences concerning Folsom technological adaptations tentative.
Most analyses have focused on tool forms and debitage attributes characteristic of the period.
Lithic assemblages typically contain very high proportions of high quality, fine-grained materials
including chert, chalcedony, and obsidian. Raw materials such as nonlocal obsidians, Chuska
Chert, Edwards Plateau Chert, and Alibates Chert (Amick 1994b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004),
obtained from sources up to 450 km away, have been identified in Folsom assemblages from the

28

Tularosa Basin and Hueco Bolson. The presence of these materials suggests either long-term
population movements or trade with other groups.
Through the analysis of tool forms and detailed studies of raw material types, important insights
into regional mobility patterns of Paleo-Indian groups and functional aspects of their settlements
are beginning to emerge. The common presence of nonlocal raw materials among discarded tool
assemblages suggests that the tools had been manufactured elsewhere and transported to the sites
in final form. Likewise, debitage collections often consist of predominantly local materials,
indicating that the inhabitants were manufacturing tools, or âgearing upâ for the next round of
group movement and hunting forays.
Based upon the distribution of distant and local raw material sources, assemblage content, and the
relative scarcity, but large size, of Folsom components in the Jornada region, Amick (1994a,
1996) has argued that Folsom sites in the region were residential or âhome baseâ localities
oriented toward hunting game animals other than bison. This pattern differs from the Southern
Plains where sites were more logistically organized and oriented towards the hunting of bison.
Unfortunately, the nature of any contemporaneous, supplemental foraging activities of Folsom
hunters within the Jornada region is not well understood.
Late Paleo-Indian - Plano and Cody Complexes
A variety of tool traditions have been recognized for the late Paleo-Indian period and are
collectively referred to as the Plano and Cody complexes (Wheat 1972). Meserve, Golondrina,
Angostura, Eden, and Scottsbluff projectile points characterize the period. Isolated Plano/Cody
projectile points and tools are common in the Hueco Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). Plano/Cody components are found in many topographic zones, including
mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, but most finds have been documented near playa basins,
major and minor drainages, and the margins of the Rio Grande Valley, which also may indicate
an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources.
One of the largest Paleo-Indian sites in the region, LA 63880, is located 2 km from a large playa.
The site covers 78,000 square meters and consists of four distinct artifact concentrations and
several diffuse scatters. Transverse end scrapers, side scrapers, and bifaces were common and
projectile point fragments were noted. All of the materials were high-quality cherts. Elyea
(1988) describes the site as a base camp rather than a kill site because most tools were worn or
reshaped, suggesting extractive tasks. Based on the low diversity of tool forms and presence of
low-density artifact clusters, Elyea (1988) suggests the site was the subject of repeated
occupations.
Environmental changes during the Early Holocene brought about several changes in human
adaptation at the close of the Paleo-Indian period. The persistent drying trend continued, with a
resultant demise of large game mammals, expansion of plant communities adapted to drier
conditions, and constriction of perennial water sources. These changes undoubtedly contributed
to large-scale changes in subsistence strategies, requiring a diversification of the Paleo-Indian
subsistence base, with a greater focus on exploitation of plant foods. Such changes, and
accompanying shifts in settlement and technology, mark the onset of the Archaic period at circa
6000 B.C.
Archaic Period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200/400)
The Archaic period represents the longest span of human occupation within the Jornada region.
This period is better represented archaeologically than the Paleo-Indian period, with an
impressive array of evidence from rock shelters and open sites found in all environmental zones.
Notable developments during the Archaic period include the first archaeological evidence for
29

agriculture, the habitation of residential pit house or hut structures, and the widespread use of
rock or caliche in the construction and use of thermal features. An increase in the range of plant
materials utilized, as well as technological changes reflecting the processing of these foods,
indicate a greater diversification of subsistence practices over the preceding Paleo-Indian period.
The Archaic period is characterized as an adaptation based on seasonally mobile, broad-spectrum
hunting and gathering; this characterization is based on data from surveys in the Hueco Bolson
and Tularosa Basin (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978), excavations at cave locales
(Cosgrove 1947), and open-air site excavations (Fields and Girard 1983; Mauldin et al. 1998;
O'Laughlin 1980). Population is thought to have increased throughout the period, leading to
increasingly restricted home-range territories, and ultimately, the adoption of agriculture (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004).
The 6000-year interval of the Archaic period has been conventionally divided into Early (6000 to
4000/3000 B.C.), Middle (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.), and Late (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200) subperiods
that have been defined on the basis on projectile point styles and stratigraphic data from rock
shelters.
Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic is one of the least understood time periods of the entire Jornada prehistoric
sequence. Early Archaic occupations have been defined primarily based on projectile point styles
and a few insubstantial deposits or features. The overall number of projectile points does not
greatly outnumber those of the preceding Paleo-Indian period. Few firmly dated Early Archaic
contexts have been identified in the Jornada, and have primarily involved deeply buried features
or rock shelter deposits. However, these deposits have yielded little data concerning subsistence,
settlement, and technology (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Projectile technology emphasizes a change from the lanceolate forms of the preceding PaleoIndian period to stemmed forms such as Jay, Bajada, and Uvalde. Along with the adoption of
these stemmed projectile point forms came a noticeable change in the use of coarser-grained raw
materials for the manufacture of projectiles. Additional technological changes include the
utilization of rock or caliche for heating elements in thermal features and the use of ground stone.
The factors causing such changes are still unknown, although, they may be related to changes in
prey selection and hunting practices, restricted home ranges that caused an increase in local raw
material use, reduced emphasis on tool maintenance and an increase in tool reliability, or a
combination of these factors. Though speculative, the settlement and subsistence of the Early
Archaic can be characterized by an absence of structures, use of larger burned-rock features on
the alluvial fans and other hearth features in all environmental zones, use of artifacts, and changes
in projectile point technology and raw material utilization. These data suggest an adaptation of
seasonally mobile, small band hunter-gatherers (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)
Fundamental subsistence, settlement, and technological adaptations established in the Early
Archaic tend to be maintained through the Middle Archaic, although, they may have become
intensified throughout the latter part of this 2,000-year-long interval. This inferred intensification
of subsistence and settlement adaptations is based on an overall increase in the number of sites
and an increase in feature use based on a significant increase in the number of radiocarbon dates
available for this period. Fifty-one radiocarbon dates are known from sites of this time period in
the Jornada area; the majority of these are from open sites located in the central Hueco Bolson,
Tularosa Basin, and Mesilla Bolson. Middle Archaic sites also tend to be found along drainages,
are generally larger, and contain more features than Early Archaic sites. Such sites also have

30

more substantial artifact assemblages and clustered radiocarbon dates suggestive of larger social
groups (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Recently, several Middle Archaic occupations have been identified at 41EP155 along the Rio
Grande Valley terrace in east El Paso (Willis and Peterson 2003), at several sites near Old Coe
Lake Playa (Lowry et al. 2003), and at the Orogrande Site I on alluvial fan toe slopes of the
Jarilla Mountains (Railey 2002). The topographic setting of these sites indicates some Middle
Archaic settlements were tethered to permanent and semi permanent water sources and others
were not.
House structures are noted for the first time in the Middle Archaic. House structures were found
at Keystone Dam (OâLaughlin 1980), which has an occupation spanning the period between
2500-1800 B.C. These were small, shallow brush structures or "huts", as termed by Carmichael
(1985), Hard (1983a), and Miller and Kenmotsu (2004). They are shallow (15 to 20 cm), circular
(less than 2 square meters), and have unprepared floors and few internal features, suggesting
short-term occupation. The presence of thermal features and ground stone artifacts at Middle
Archaic sites suggests a focus on plant foods in addition to hunting.
Late Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200/400)
In terms of settlement, subsistence, and technological adaptations, the Late Archaic - particularly
the latter half of the period - represents a true break in the long Archaic sequence of the previous
4,000 years.
Several technological innovations and changes in settlement adaptations
characteristic of this period presage developments during the Formative period.
An important aspect of Late Archaic settlement is the dramatic increase in sites, features, and
material culture attributable to this period. Basin landforms experience a peak in intensity of use,
although, Late Archaic sites are found in all environmental zones. The diversity and quantity of
artifacts increases greatly compared to preceding periods. The presence of such items as nets,
basketry, atlatls, wood implements, and hide containers is common. Small circular structures are
also common during this period.
Hunting is still a very important subsistence factor, with rockshelter locations near, or in, the
mountains containing sizeable amounts of large mammal bone (e.g., deer), while other locales are
dominated by rabbit species (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Projectile points change to cornernotched and side-notched forms in the latter half of this subperiod.
Among the most important developments during the Late Archaic in the Jornada region is the
first conclusive evidence for the use of cultigens. Upham and MacNeish (1993) date the
inception of cultigens at 2500 B.C. based on corn pollen found at Keystone Dam (OâLaughlin
1980). This date should be considered provisional due to the poor preservation of the pollen and
the wide range of 14C dates for the same strata. More conclusive evidence of cultigens comes
from Tornillo Shelter (Upham et al. 1987) where a date of 2030-830 B.C. was recovered from
corn, and from Fresnal Shelter (Tagg 1996), which yielded a suite of dates ranging from 1390Â­
940 B.C. to 1200 B.C.-A.D. 600; beans were dated to ca. 350 B.C.
Cultigen dates from Fresnal and other sites correspond with other early corn dates in the greater
Southwest (ca. 1050-850 B.C.), including southern New Mexico (Tagg 1996; Wills 1988),
southern Arizona (Fish et al. 1986; Matson 1991; Minnis 1992), and northern Chihuahua (Hard
and Roney 1998; Wills 1988). The causal factors for the adoption of cultigens are still poorly
understood. The prevailing view in the Jornada Mogollon region is that domesticates were part of
a large and diverse subsistence base during the Late Archaic and that its addition provided a
stable and predictable resource (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Measures of agricultural
dependence provide contradictory data, with rock shelters containing abundant evidence of

31

cultigens, while open sites contain none. Analyses of N14/N15 and C13/C12 ratios on human
bones indicate no evidence of a high maize diet. The apparent difference in rock shelter versus
open sites may be a function of preservation, or may be due to seasonal differences in site
occupation.
Because the causal factors underlying the adoption of corn, beans, and other cultigens during the
Late Archaic period are not well known, the origins of agriculture in the Jornada Mogollon region
are best viewed within the larger perspective of developments across the Southwest. Many view
the use of cultigens as part of an increasing diversification of plant foods exploited during Late
Archaic times, one that also provided additional stability, buffering, and/or predictability to the
subsistence base (Matson 1991; Minnis 1992; Wills 1988). Whether or not this process may have
been a cause or effect of increasing population levels, and in turn, reduced territories available for
population movements, is not well understood.
General Trends of the Archaic Period
A general correlation exists between the appearance of cultigens and an increase in the number of
radiocarbon-dated contexts that could suggest a linkage between changing demographic patterns
and the adoption of cultigens. Whether the appearance of cultigens is a cause or effect of
increasing population levels and/or land use intensity as represented by much higher numbers of
dated features and components is uncertain. Projectile technologies undergo several drastic
modifications during the latter half of the Late Archaic and early part of the Formative period.
These include the shift to corner-notched and side-notched forms, a significant decrease in size,
and a much-reduced emphasis on blade modifications. An increase in the use of locally abundant
raw materials for manufacture of projectiles also takes place during this time.
The design and raw material characteristics of these projectile points reflect less intensive
maintenance and reduced durability or versatility. When considered in light of the dramatic
increase in the numbers of radiocarbon-dated thermal features and structures present across
several environmental zones, these changes in projectile technology indicate a more intensive
land-use pattern and a concomitant decrease in either group mobility, in terms of the number and
duration of group moves across the landscape, or perhaps a reduction in territorial ranges
available for exploitation by Late Archaic populations that resulted in a more intensive use of
smaller areas.
A critical research question is whether increasing levels of feature construction, changes in
projectile technology, and occupational intensity represent population growth within the Jornada
region, or reflect extraregional population factors resulting in reduced territorial ranges available
for exploitation. That is, population growth per se may not have occurred, but instead increased
intensification of land use within the region, resulting from increasingly restricted territorial
ranges, took place while population levels may have remained relatively stable. Pronounced
changes in regional territories and dynamics occurred during, and particularly near the end of, the
Archaic period (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
At a more restrictive spatial scale, or site level perspective, these regional changes should also
have influenced patterns of resource exploitation and land use, as well as various modes of social
organization. Such trends and transitions should be evident in the archaeological record via
changing site layouts and occupational histories.
Formative Period (A.D. 200/400 to 1450)
The Formative period encompasses several important transitions in settlement adaptations. These
include a relatively rapid succession of changes in architectural form, settlement structure,
subsistence, and technology, including a trend of decreasing mobility coupled with increasing
32

agricultural dependence and specialization that culminated in puebloan occupations between A.D.
1300 to 1450. These developments have almost universally been perceived in terms of increasing
agricultural dependence. However, evidence from the Jornada region also suggests that
prehistoric populations may have become more agriculturally specialized between A.D. 1300 and
1450.
The Formative period sequence has recently been revised (Miller 2005) and now includes four
subperiods: the Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000), the early DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to
1150), the late DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1150 to 1300), and the El Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450).
In the following discussion, normative characteristics of each phase are presented first, followed
by a more detailed review of specific adaptive trends that occurred throughout the Formative
period. It should be noted that in many instances, adaptive trends crosscut phase boundaries and
that the phase system often masks such variability in the archaeological record.
Mesilla Phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by the appearance of the El Paso brownware ceramic tradition
with Alma plain as a rare intrusive ware. Other intrusive ceramics (predominantly Mimbres
white wares and other Mogollon wares) appeared in the region after A.D. 600, but were not
common. Painted pottery (El Paso Bichrome) also made its first appearance late in this phase.
Pit houses were constructed during this period (Lehmer 1948), but were generally similar to the
huts of the Archaic period (Hard 1983a). Structures become increasingly formal after A.D. 600.
Sites generally are larger and more numerous, and contain more artifacts than sites from the
earlier Archaic period.
Whalen (1977, 1978, and 1994) uses survey data for the region to propose a site typology based
on site size, number of features, and the presence of ceramics, chipped stone, and ground stone.
Though the characteristics change through time, Whalen (1994) suggests that artifact variety and
site size distinguish residential sites from camps. Mesilla phase sites for all environmental zones
show a slight association between sites and playas in the central basin. Because all types of sites
are found in all zones, Whalen (1994) believes that the subsistence practices of the Mesilla phase
were based primarily on hunting and foraging supplemented by agriculture and that occupation of
the bolson was residential in nature.
Other archaeologists see the Mesilla phase as a continuation of the subsistence and settlement
practices of the Late Archaic (Carmichael 1986; Hard 1983b; O'Laughlin 1979, 1980).
Carmichael's (1986) work in the area differs in some respects from Whalen's (1994), especially in
defining the role of the Hueco Bolson in cultural development. Carmichael (1986) believes that
the basins of the region could not have been the whole area utilized by prehistoric groups. These
basin areas were nonresidential in nature rather than being used by sedentary peoples.
Residential sites were probably located outside of the basins, most likely near the Rio Grande,
and were defined as sites containing trash middens.
Hard (1983b) proposes a settlement-subsistence model in which differences in environment
influence choices for seasonal rounds and activities. Hard (1983b) believes that winter and spring
sites were located on the mountain alluvial fans, while the central basin was used for foraging.
The summer and fall seasons saw the central basin used for temporary residences. More recent
work by Mauldin et al. (1998) suggests that Mesilla phase peoples may be characterized as
residential foragers. The central basin and alluvial fans are thought to have been components in a
residential foraging strategy in which groups lived throughout the region as hunter-gatherers.
After A.D. 600, feature-related activities in the central basin drastically decreased. Mauldin and
others (1998) believe that this may indicate a shift in the settlement and subsistence practices of
prehistoric groups to a less intensive, logistical use of the central basin.

33

In summary, research by Carmichael (1986), Hard (1983b), and Whalen (1994) characterizes the
Mesilla phase population as increasing over the previous Archaic period, utilizing all
environmental zones, and showing trends toward sedentism. Pottery was introduced, and may
have been important for cooking and storage of wild plant resources as well as cultigens. Ground
stone inventories indicate increasing use during this phase. Settlement is thought to have been
seasonal, with huts utilized as summer abodes and deeper pit houses used as winter residences.
Subsistence was based on generalized hunting (rabbits and small game) and the foraging of wild
plant resources. Early in this phase agriculture may have been more opportunistic, with
increasing reliance coming later in order to offset environmental variability that increased the risk
of not having enough food to survive the winter (Wills 1988).
Early and Late DoÃ±a Ana Phases (A.D. 1000 to 1150 [Early] and A.D. 1150 to 1300 [Late])
The DoÃ±a Ana phase was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) and was further characterized by
Carmichael (1986). DoÃ±a Ana phase sites, as defined by Lehmer (1948), are characterized by the
presence of El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome pottery associated with adobe surface
construction. Debate continues about the ability to distinguish DoÃ±a Ana phase occupations
within the archaeological record (see Carmichael 1985, 1986; Hard et al. 1994; Mauldin 1993;
Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 1989, 1990).
Early DoÃ±a Ana phase occupations have been described at the Gobernadora, Ojasen, and North
Hills sites (Miller 1989, 1990; Shafer et al. 1999). These sites have informal pit houses and
burned-rock activity areas. Scarborough (1986) excavated a late DoÃ±a Ana phase, pit house
village. Data from this site indicate the use of deep, square-shaped formal pit houses and the
utilization of discrete trash middens, suggesting a more sedentary existence than earlier time
periods. Cultigens such as corn, squash, and beans were recovered, as well as large amounts of
rabbit bone.
One other site from this period has been excavated in the region (Kegley 1980). The site
contained evidence of formal pit structures with plastered hearths, as well as evidence for
changing social organization defined by the presence of a very large pit structure, believed to be a
communal house. Research by Whalen (1977, 1978, 1981) indicates that this period (which he
defined as the Transitional Pueblo period) is characterized by increasing population levels and a
shift of settlement areas to runoff zones located on lower alluvial fans of the Franklin, Hueco, and
Organ mountains.
Overall, the changes that occurred during the DoÃ±a Ana phase include the introduction of
polychrome pottery, rapid population increase, artifact changes that included larger manos and
metates, decreased projectile point sizes with larger forms still in use, and changes in intrusive
ceramic types from Mimbres to Chupadero and Chihuahuan wares. The increasingly formal pit
structures eventually led to later pueblo architecture of the El Paso phase. Another crucial change
that occurred during this time was the shift from a general use of all areas within the region to
concentrated use of specific environmental zones. These areas included the Rio Grande and the
distal alluvial fans of local mountain ranges (transition zone) that are notable for their abundance
of water and arable land for growing cultigens.
El Paso Phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450)
The final and most intensive prehistoric use of the region occurred during the El Paso phase (also
referred to as the Pueblo period). This phase is characterized by an increase in the number of
large and small residential sites, increased artifact densities, and a clustered settlement pattern
(Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978), as well as the introduction of small triangular projectile

34

point forms. Larger projectile point styles are regularly found on the floors of rooms, indicating
the possible continuing use of the atlatl in conjunction with the bow and arrow.
Several excavated El Paso phase sites provide data on subsistence and settlement. Varied
settlement patterns and different structure types are suggested by data from Hot Well Pueblo, a
100-plus room village located near the eastern edge of the Hueco Bolson (Bentley 1993; Brook
1970; Lowry 2005); La Cabrana, a small pueblo located near the Rio Grande (Bradley 1983);
Firecracker Pueblo (O'Laughlin 2001), located on the alluvial fans of the Franklin Mountains; and
other pueblos throughout the region (Brook 1980; Gerald 1988; Lehmer 1948). In addition,
individual surface room structures are a common feature of El Paso phase settlements (Batcho et
al. 1985; Browning et al. 1992; Dering et al. 2001).
Hueco Bolson survey data outline important changes that occurred during the El Paso phase.
Whalen (1977, 1978, 1980), who documented a cluster of large sites along the alluvial fans of the
Franklin and Hueco mountains, suggests that a shift in settlement patterns from earlier phases
may indicate increased use of the lower alluvial fans for farming activities. Carmichael (1986)
documented similar areas in the northern Hueco Bolson that he suggests were established during
the DoÃ±a Ana phase. He argues that the sites are part of a larger regional exchange network
related to Casas Grandes in Mexico (Carmichael 1986).
Mauldin (1986) developed a settlement-subsistence model for the El Paso phase based on Hard's
(1983a) work with the Mesilla phase, but assumed more dependence on agriculture. Mauldin
(1986) suggests a division between primary villages and secondary villages. Primary village
locations were near reliable water sources on mountain slopes but populations and intensity of use
fluctuated during the year. Subsistence at these sites was based primarily on agriculture.
Secondary villages, which were located on both mountain slopes and in the central basin near
playas, were associated with late summer residential occupations based on hunting and foraging.
Small sites (e.g., campsites and limited activity sites) were not included in this, or other models of
settlement and subsistence for the region. The debate over the role of agriculture and its
importance to subsistence for this period is unresolved, as is the degree of sedentism.
Thus, the El Paso phase is characterized by peak population levels, diverse artifact assemblages,
use of pit structures, individual surface rooms, above-ground pueblos, and dependence on
agriculture, but not to the exclusion of hunting and foraging. Residential permanency at sites
during wet years and seasonal movement during periods of dryness or lean years is postulated.
Alternatively, a seasonal sedentary lifestyle alternating between the desert floor, alluvial fan, and
riverine habitation may have been the norm.
The Precontact Period
The Precontact period (A.D. 1450-1581) is defined here as the relatively brief (approximately 130Â­
year) span between abandonment of the region by Pueblo groups and the first documented
encounter between Native Americans and Spanish explorers. Several cultural groups may have
used the study areas during the Precontact period. According to Beckett and Corbett (1992), the
Chinarra, Concho, Jano, Jocome, Manso, Suma, Piro, and Tarahumara may have occupied the
local region. Unfortunately, archaeological evidence representing these groups has not been
found or at least has not been recognized.
The Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric period (A.D. 1581-1659) represents the temporal span between first
European/Native American contact and the Historic or settlement period. Many of the aboriginal
groups inhabiting the region during the Precontact period also may have been present during the
Protohistoric period. Contact between Native Americans and Europeans, however, undoubtedly
wrought changes to aboriginal lifestyles. Not only did the introduction of new materials such as
35

metals revolutionize subsistence activities, but a defensive (and offensive) posture was initiated
among some Native American groups. This posture often resulted in a changed campsite
preference (i.e., defensive overlook), which, along with the changes in material culture, is
potentially visible in the archaeological record. The Mescalero Apache represent the only
documented aboriginal Protohistoric inhabitants of the region.
The project area is located within the aboriginal lands of the Manso and Suma Indians who
exploited the flora and fauna of the region prior to the 1680 Pueblo Rebellion. These tribal
groups shared the region, although the Manso may have had greater use of the area because their
primary territory ranged from Las Cruces to Presidio. It is not known if the pre-mission Mansos
practiced irrigation agriculture. They minimally relied on agricultural products and depended
more on hunting and gathering. The region was rich in bosques, ox-bow lagoons, river channels
and pools that were an abundant source of food (waterfowl, fish and some edible river plants).
Reeds along the river were utilized for making fishing weirs and for baskets.
Early Historic Period to the Pueblo Revolt
On April 28, 1598, Juan de OÃ±ate with a party of colonists, soldiers, wagons, and livestock,
forded the river in the San Elizario area on their way northward to New Mexico (Brown et al.
1994). Near this ford thirst crazed men and animals drank from the river and later rested and
made the formal declaration that all the lands, minerals and Indians as property and subject to the
royal crown.
By 1659, a permanent settlement (MisiÃ³n de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe) was established at the
Pass of the North by Fray Garcia de San Francisco y ZÃºÃ±iga El Paso del Norte for the Manso and
Suma Indians. Several Manso and Suma Missions were developed within the region and were
later abandoned or relocated. With few exceptions, the specific locations of these missions is not
known. The Suma Mission (abandoned in 1745) was located north of the old river channel at the
edge of the Valverde Hacienda at Palo Clavado at the boundary of the Ysleta and Socorro Grants.
On August 10, 1680 the Pueblo Revolt erupted in Northern New Mexico, which resulted in the
abandonment of that province and the arrival of Spanish and Indian refugees at El Paso del Norte.
At first the newcomers were dependent on the Manso mission and resided in the area surrounding
the outpost. By 1684, a fixed settlement was established for the Spanish refugees at El Paso del
Norte with the creation of four Indian communities in the region at San Lorenzo (mixed village of
Mansos, Sumas, Mexican Indians and some Spanish), SenecÃº (Piro), Ysleta (Tigua) and Socorro
(Piro). By 1692, these communities became permanent villages associated with outlying fields.
At this time, the nearest settlement to the present day location of Fabens and San Elizario was the
Piro village, which was located several leagues farther down river until 1684.
