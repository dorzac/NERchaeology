ABSTRACT
In October 2012 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of a 4.9-acre tract for Long Cove Development,
Inc. as part of a land exchange with TxDot along State Highway 198 north of Malakoff,
Texas. The tract is in property owned by the Malkoff mine; several features of the mine
have the potential for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Long Cove Development, Inc. will clear the land as part of the exchange. The cultural
resources survey included a historical documentation review of the property, a visual
inspection of building foundations, and shovel testing in a pasture under Texas
Antiquities Permit #6366. The historical documentation review included examining
maps and air photos of the area from 1940 to 2010 as well as examining previous
research for the property to determine if the building foundations were associated with
the Malakoff lignite mine. The visual inspection documented the extent of the
foundations and examined them for physical evidence of when the buildings were in use.
The historical research found the buildings were not built until after the mine closed. The
visual inspection found modern debris around the foundations. A total of 18 shovel tests
were dug across the property; all of the shovel tests were negative. No archaeological
sites were documented, and no artifacts were collected. No further investigations are
recommended; however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials
are discovered during construction, then the project activity will immediately cease.
DETAC, TxDot and the Texas Historical Commission shall be notified of the discovery.
DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” to NRHP
eligible properties for the proposed land exchange.

INTRODUCTION
On 25 October 2012, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resources survey of a 4.9-acre tract of land for Long Cove Development, Inc. north of
Malakoff, Texas (Figure 1). Long Cove Development will clear the land of vegetation and existing
building foundations as part of a transfer of the land to the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDot). Cultural resource management was required because the parcel will be dramatically
impacted at the request of TxDot as part of the transfer. The goals of the investigations were to
determine if the building foundations were originally part of the Malakoff mine and if any new
cultural resources could be found on the property. Texas Antiquities Permit #6366 was obtained
for this project; all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant of the Texas Antiquities Code and
the National Historic Preservation Act.
Historical maps, air photos, soil maps and previous research on the property show no
improvements while the mine was in operation. The NRCS (1979) soil survey air photo shows
the area in pasture while the 1996 air photo shows several buildings on the property; therefore,
the building foundations observed during the site visit are the foundations of buildings
constructed after 1965 when Cedar Creek Lake (visible in the NRCS air photo) was completed.
Debris observed in the area confirms the later construction date. No prehistoric artifacts were
found in shovel tests. No cultural resources were recorded during the survey.
Victor Galan, Ph.D. served as the Principal Investigator. The field work was completed
in six hours by the Principal Investigator. The report was written by the Principal Investigator
in 14 hours. No artifacts were collected or curated.

The report was prepared using the short

report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) (2005a) with additions
suggested by the Texas Historical Commission (Martin 1999) and TxDot (2012). No previously
recorded sites will be impacted and no new archaeological sites were recorded during the survey.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The project area is a 2.0 hectares (ha) (4.9 acres (ac)) parcel of land east of State Highway
198 roughly 900 meters (m) (2,950 feet (ft)) north of the Malakoff, Texas city boundary. Corners
of the project area are marked with white and red surveyor stakes. The parcel will be cleared of all
vegetation and building foundations. Topographically, the project area is on the shoulder of an
upland ridge. Surface geology on the ridge is dominated by the Wilcox formation (undivided).
The Wilcox formation is a bedded siltstone and ironstone deposited during the Eocene. Soils are
described as Axtell loam and Freestone fine sandy loam (NRCS 2012).

Both soil series soils

consist of roughly 20 to 30 centimeters (cm) (8 to 12 inches (in)) of very fine sandy loam over a
clay loam Bt horizon. Pasture grass dominates the northeastern portion of the project area.
Vegetation includes a mixture of mature and immature trees with a dense understory of bushes,
shrubs, and vines in the western portion of the project area and pasture grass in the eastern
portion of the project area.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Henderson County has been studied in numerous small surveys and larger
investigations. The closest large-scale investigations to the project area were conducted for the
Cedar Creek (TASP 1961) and Tennessee Colony (Richner and Lee 1977) reservoirs.
Combined, these two surveys examined over 50,000 acres and documented several hundred sites.
Other large area surveys were conducted for recent mine areas, e.g., Hays and Larson (1978),
for the Cayuga-Malakoff Mining area. The large area surveys documented a variety of sites
ranging from the Paleo-Indian to historic periods in a variety of landscapes. Prehistoric sites
were generally found on landforms near surface water and Historic period sites were found
further from water and closer to modern transportation systems and communities. Smaller
surveys, e.g., Espy, Huston & Associates (1982), Corbin (1984), and Galan (2000) investigated
smaller utilities and parks but were less successful in documenting archaeological sites because
of the isolated locations and smaller survey areas.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The project area is part of the
area D.A. Story (1990) and J.A. Guy (1990) discuss as part of the Gulf Coastal Plain, Perttula and
Kenmotsu (1993) include Henderson County in the Eastern Planning Region of the Texas State
3

Plan, but Perttula (2004:7 Figure 1.1) includes the western portion of Henderson County in the
North Central Archaeological Region which is part of the Prairie-Savanna archaeological study
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993:6 Figure 1.1.2). Prikryl (1993:191-204) and Fields (2004:347369) describe the Prairie-Savanna Archaeological Region which includes much of the area between
the Brazos and Trinity Rivers between Gainsville and Maisonville, Texas.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleo-Indian (ca. prior to 6500 B.C.), Archaic
foraging cultures (6500 B.C. –A.D. 700), Late Prehistoric (700–1700 A.D.), to the historic
period (A.D. 1700 – present) (Prikryl 1993:199). The Paleo-Indian period is characterized by
small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and
animals (Story 1990; Prikryl 1993:199). The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherers who
implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story
1990:213). The Archaic was further divided into Early, Middle, and Late divisions (Prikryl
1990:199) with specialized tools that changed form between the periods and an increasing
population. The Late Prehistoric in the region showed the gradual adaptation of the bow and
arrow, horticulture/agriculture, and the spread of ceramics. Projectile points found in the region
are similar to Austin and Toya phases described by Prewitt in 1981 and 1983 (Prikryl 1990:201);
however, there are several strong ties to the Caddo culture (Fields 2004:368).
The Historic period describes both the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and marks a transition from the native population’s domination of the area, to the American
immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and counties. American settlement in the area did not
begin in earnest until the 1830’s along the Trinity River. Henderson County was formed in 1846,
but it was reduced to it’s current boundary in 1848. The county seat shifted from Buffalo, on the
Trinity River, to Athens in 1850. Rural agriculture dominated the economy through the Civil War
(Faulk 1929). Recovery from Reconstruction was not until the 1880’s when the railroad came
through the county and the discovery and extraction of good clay for pottery gave the county a
needed boost. Agriculture, lumber, and limited industry continued through the beginning of the
20th century until the discovery of lignite in 1911 and the establishment of the Dodd lignite mine in
1912 near Malakoff. As more companies began lignite mining, the county population and industry
tripled due to mining villages and associated services in the 1920’s. Malakoff grew rapidly
between 1925 and 1943 as a result of open pit strip mining and shaft mining to produce lignite
for steam powered electric plants and local industry (Smith 1980; Long 2012). In addition to the
4

city population growing, roughly 600 miners lived in villages constructed by the Malakoff Fuel
Company in 1927. The decline in the early 1940’s was the result of a change to natural gas at
the power plants. Since that time, the population has remained low although industry has
continued to grow through oil/gas extraction, lumber, and ranching.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); the guidelines set forth by the
CTA (2005b); the Texas Antiquities Code and the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological
Society and the Society of Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining eligibility of a
cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric or historic cultural resources sites within the
survey area. If sites were found, then the investigations were to delineate the vertical and
horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary
evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2012) and using historic period maps with air photos. The
atlas contains an updated database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource
surveys, location maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records show State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.

This

information was combined with maps and air photos of the mine to understand how the property
was used and if any structures associated with the mine were built in the vicinity.
DETAC conducted a pedestrian survey of the area using visual examination and shovel
testing. The visual examination included observing the ground surface (overturned trees, rodent
disturbances, mechanical disturbances) and making notes on modern features or topographic
features (micro-topography, berms, and pits) not visible on the topographic map. Shovel testing
included excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the
clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm
(0.25 in) wire mesh screen. According to the THC guidelines, project areas between 3 and 10
5

acres require a minimum of two shovel tests per acre. Following these guidelines, the pedestrian
survey of the 2.0 ha (4.9 ac) project area included a surface inspection focusing on documenting
modern features and in areas with exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with
a minimum of ten shovel tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with an Ashtech GPS with 1 to
3 m accuracy and notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.
RESULTS
The results of the archaeological investigation relied on a Literature Search of previous
archaeological investigations, a Map and Photo Comparison of air photos and maps of the
Malakoff mine, the NRCS (1979) soils survey, and color infra-red air photos from 1996 to 2010
(TNRIS 2012) to determine the historic use of the property, and a Site Visit which included a visual
examination and shovel testing of the property to document any modern cultural features and
archaeological sites.

Literature Search
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2012)
found five surveys within 1.6 kilometers (km) (1.0 miles (mi)) of the project area (Appendix A).
These investigations documented three archaeological sites. There is one historical marker for the
First Baptist Church on Walker Street 1.6 km (1 mi) southwest of the project area. The marker
(#10356) commemorates Rev. Monroe F. Jackson’s 1894 founding of the Good Hope Baptist
Church. The closest NRHP property is in Athens, Texas roughly 10 km (6 mi) to the east.
The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas shows surveys for the Malakoff Mine Administrative
buildings by the National Park Service, two private surveys documenting the miner’s housing
(41HE194), the Malakoff Cemetery (41HE197), and two surveys for Long Cove Development, Inc.
by Halff and Associates, Inc. (Voellinger 2006) and DETAC (Galan 2007).

Site 41HE194

recorded the miner’s housing as an Industrial Village site with cement pylons, concrete slabs, and
scattered historic period ceramic, metal, and brick fragments (Smith and Adams 1980). The village
was built in 1925 and was used until 1943 during the mining boom. Site 41HE197 is the Malakoff
Cemetery which contains internments as early as 1850 (Guderjan 1981). The Haliff survey
documented 41HE356 as the Malakoff Mine (Baletti 2006) which includes 1,864 acres
encompassing sites 41HE193, 41HE194, 41HE195, 41HE196, and 41HE197 along with the
overburden piles near Cedar Creek Reservoir, railroad berms and structural remains. Voellinger
6

concluded that the Malakoff Mine may be eligible for inclusion to the NRHP under Criteria A
(association with historical events) as the mine employed up to half of the population of Malakoff
during the time of operation. Additionally, the mine altered the land scape both during production
and after its closure. Since closing the mine, the mine property was sold to individuals and
businesses. No information was found on the National Park Service web site of the nomination of
the mine to the NRHP as either a site or a historic district. Finally, the DETAC investigations
focused on shovel testing and backhoe trenching three areas on the Long Cove Ranch
recommended for deeper testing by Voellinger. No archaeological sites were found in the shovel
testing effort and no buried soils were found in the backhoe trenches (Galan 2007).

Map and Photo Comparison
The examination of historic maps and photos include a 1940 air photo, a 1942 property map
of the mine, the air photo in the 1979 NRCS soil survey, and TNRIS air photos from 1996, 2004,
and 2010. All six resources show the current project area and physical features; however, the 1940
air photo and 1942 property map were not geo-referenced so the approximate project area is used.
The 1940 photo of the Malakoff mine shows the road that would become SH198, railroad
spurs and the miners village (Figure 2a). Voellinger (2006:Figure 12) labels mine shafts, the
Miner’s Village and the Administrative buildings on the photo. Using these references, the current
project area is covered in pasture grasses southeast of the open pit mine. The railroad spur is
roughly 700 m (2,300 ft) to the east, and the mining camp is east of the spur. No buildings or other
structures are visible on the photo in the project area.
The 1942 Malakoff Fuel Co. Property Map labels several features visible on the 1940 map
(Figure 2b). SH198 is labeled as a “County Road” and other features like the railroad spurs,
administration buildings, machine shops, etc. are all labeled. The closest feature to the current
project area is the “Negro Village” southwest of SH 198 and scattered houses on the J.K. Derden
property south of the current project area. The project area is in an open space with what appears
to be the corner of the mine pit nearby. The 1942 map and 1940 air photo are the best evidence for
the use of the property during mine operations. No structures or improvements are visible on either
the

and 1942.

The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Terracon 2012) for the project area

includes interviews with three individuals who state the property was vacant land for most of their
memory.
The 1979 NRCS soil survey maps rely on air photos to show the location of soils. Sheet 37
of the soil survey shows SH 198 in its current configuration and Cedar Creek Lake. Cedar Creek
Lake was complete in 1965; therefore, the air photo used for the soil survey dates no earlier than
1965 and no later than 1977 when the field work was complete for the soil survey. The entire
project area is in pasture in the photo.
The 1996 color infra-red air photo shows seven buildings on the property near SH 198 with
paved and gravel surfaces between the buildings (Figure 3a). The eastern portion of the project
area is pasture. Vegetation is limited to grass over most of the project area. The fence line is a
clear, straight boundary between the business (west) and the pasture (east).
The 2004 photos show the buildings were removed and vegetation was encroaching on the
paved surfaces (Figure 3b). Tree lines are in their current configuration and the powerline right-ofway makes the southern border of the project area. The fence line is overgrown but clear. The
2010 photo shows more vegetation encroachment on the gravel and paved surfaces along with
further over growth along the fence line.
In summary, the map and air photos show land use between 1940-1942, 1965-1977, and
1996-2010. The project area was inside the mine boundary, but no buildings, roads, or other
features are visible on the photo or drawn on the map from the 1940’s. Between the 1940’s and
1990’s interviewed individuals do not remember any noteworthy use of the property (Terracon
2012). The air photo for the NRCS soil survey confirms the property was in pasture at least until
the air photo was taken between 1965 and 1977. The air photos from the 1996 shows several
buildings on the property near SH 198, but by 2004 the buildings were removed and the area
became over grown. The eastern portion of the property remained in pasture throughout the photo
documentation.

Site Visit
The site visit included examining the remains of the buildings in the western portion of the
project area and shovel testing the pasture in the eastern portion of the project area. Examining

the building remains included photographing the foundations, looking for evidence to date the
construction and collecting GPS data to compare the observed foundations to the historical
record (Figure 4). The investigation revealed the western portion of the project area was paved
with cement with and a pile of cement rubble next to a loading dock in the central portion of the
area. Few exposed areas were present; all were gravel. The area was searched for cultural
material that would refine the date of construction, but the cultural material included a wide
range of items from crushed metal cans to Pepsi cans and a 1998 Nintendo circuit board. Glass
items were non-descript beyond a few pop-top beer bottles and several screw-top beer bottle
fragments. Push piles of debris continued east from the cement into the headwaters of a drainage
with similar kinds of modern debris to include vehicle’s drum break housing and a cordless drill.
The three shovel tests excavated in the western portion of the project area contained disturbed
gravelly soil over clay loam (Figure 5). Surface disturbance was obvious and appears to extend
to the clay subsoil in the western portion of the project area. No new archaeological sites were
documented as a result of the visual inspection of the project area.
Shovel testing in the pasture included 15 tests focusing on the summit of a low ridge in
the middle of the area (Figure 5). Eight tests on the ridge summit found light brown to brown
fine sandy loam between 40 and 60 cm (16 and 24 in) deep over sandy clay. The seven tests on
the slopes of the ridge found light yellowish brown to light brown fine sandy loam 30 to 70 cm
(12 to 28 in) deep over sandy clay (Table 1). Shovel testing in the project area found soils similar
to the NRCS series descriptions.

No cultural material was found in shovel testing.

No

archaeological sites were documented as a result of the shovel testing.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed 2 ha (4 ac) land exchange between Long Cove Development, Inc. and
TxDot requires Long Cove Development, Inc. to clear the land of all vegetation and remaining
building foundations. The property is inside the 1920’s – 1940’s Malakoff mine area. The
Malakoff mine is potentially eligible for inclusion to the NRHP under Criteria A (associated with
events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history). These
investigations were conducted to determine if the structure foundations on the property could be
associated with the Malakoff mine and if any undocumented cultural resources could be found
on the property.

Previous investigations along with air photos of the area from 1940, 1942,

1965-77, 1996, 2004, and 2010 show buildings on the property in 1996 only. Those buildings
were removed before 2004. Examination of the debris around the remaining foundations was
most similar to modern trash from the late 1990’s. The foundations found in the project area are
not part of the Malakoff Mine, but is associated with the use of the land in the 1990’s. Shovel
tests across the less disturbed portions of the property did not find any additional cultural
material. No new cultural resources were documented, and no cultural material was collected
during the survey.
Based on the shovel test results, the visual examination and the historical maps, there is
little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources in the project area; however, in the
event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during construction,
then the project activity will immediately cease. DETAC, TxDot and the THC shall be notified
of the discovery. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed land exchange as defined by the National Historic
Preservation Act.
