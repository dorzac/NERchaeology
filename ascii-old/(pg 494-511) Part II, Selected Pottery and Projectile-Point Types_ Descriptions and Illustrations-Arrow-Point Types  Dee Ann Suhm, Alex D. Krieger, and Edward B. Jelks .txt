Outline: Slender triangular blade with edges usually straight
but sometimes slightly concave or recurved; occasionally,
slightly convex. Shoulders sometimes squared but usually
have small barbs. Stem very narrow and parallel-edged.
Base straight or slightly convex. Blade edges sometimes
finely serrated.

DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Roughly triangular blade, crudely chipped, often
modified on only one face, or on one face more than the
other. Shoulders may project at right-angle but often are
difficult to distinguish from the short, pointed stem. Blade
edges may be fairly straight but often convex, concave, or
asymmetrical.

1.5 to 2 cm., seldom more or less. Stem varies from barely
visible to about 0.5 cm. in length.
CULTURAL A~FFILIATIONS
A common type of Henrietta Focus. also occurring in Central
Texas Aspect and possibly Rockport Focus, all in NeoAmerican Stage.
DISTRIBUTION
Primarily a broad "north-south belt across Texas from upper
Red River to central Gulf coast. Most frequent in north,
decreasing toward south.

I~RESNO POINTS
(Plate 128, rows C-E)
DESCRII~ION
Outline:
Simple triangles with straight to slightly convex
edges, bases usually straight but may be concave or slig.htly
convex. Usually finely flaked on both faces but occasionally one face is smooth fracture plane of original chip, only
slightly modified if at all. Rarely, edges are finely serrated.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 3.5 cm., seldom more or less.
Width 1 to 2 cm., occasionally a little more.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Central Texas Aspect, Bravo Valley Aspect; Galveston Bay,
Rockport, Brownsville, Mier, Henrietta, Wylie, and probably other foci in Neo-American Stage. Occurs at Spanish

HARRELL POINTS
(Plate 129)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular points with edges straight to slightly convex. Bases straight to deeply concave. Two small side
notches occur, from I/4 to ~i:z the distance from base toward
tip. Two sub-groups or sub-types may be recognized:
those with a third notch in center of base, whether this is
straight or concave (rows A-C); and those without a base
notch (rows D-F). In Texas, at least, there appears to be
no difference in distribution or time between these two
sub-types, although a wider study in the Plains and Southwest United States may show significant differences.
Dimensions: Length 1.5 to 3.5 cm. Maximum width about
to 2 cm. Notches (both at sides and at base) usually 0.2
to 0.3 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type in Antelope Creek Focus; one of several types in
Henrietta and Wylie Foci.

Occurs widely in Panhandle-

Plains area where no definite complexes have been recognized. Also of general distribution in Great Plains from
northern Texas to Canada, east to Mississippi valley, and
west to Southwest, always associated with agriculture and
pottery-making. In far western states and Northwest, occurs in late horizons without agriculture or pottery.

DISTRIBUTION
See above paragraph. In Texas the type occurs across the
northern parts, extending southward to the upper Brazos
and Trinity River drainages, with occasional specimens
farther south. Unknown in East Texas except for rare,
probably intrusive, specimens.
ESTIMATED AGE
In Texas, perhaps 1100 to 1500 A. D., not known to be associated with historic complexes. Elsewhere, may be considerably older.

HAYES POINTS
(Plate 130, rows A-C)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Slender triangular blade with edges usually concave
or recurved, occasionally straight, rarely convex. Some
are square-shouldered without real barbs, but others have
barbs sweeping out laterally rather than pointing downward. Sterns are bulb-shaped in some cases, but are often
featured by a diamond shape from which tiny protrusions
emerge on one or more edges. Blade edges sometimes~
finely serrated, and tips may be sharply incut (row B,
second from right; row C, first and fourth from left).
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 cm. Maximum width
about 1.5 to 2 cm. Stems quite uniform in width and
length, 0.5 to 0.8 and 0.6 to 1 cm., respectively. Stems
about 1/4 to 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Characteristic only of Haley Focus in Gibson Aspect, but may
occur as minor type or intrusion in late phases of Alto,
Gahagan, and Spiro Foci. Similar to Alba points (Plate
126) except for stem shape and incut tips, and to Bonham
points (Plate 127) except for stem shape and general proportions.
DISTRIBUTION
Common only in area of great bend of Red River, in adjacent
corners of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and possibly Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
Same as Haley Focus, possibly 800 to 1200 A. D. or part thereof.
REFERENCES
Newell and Krieger, 1949, p. 162 and Fig. 56, I-L. These authors point out the near-identity of Hayes points and the
common form of the classic Teotihuacan culture in central
.Mexico, the only real difference being that the Mexican
specimens are almost always obsidian rather than flint.
LIVERMORE POINTS
(Plate 130, rows D, E)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: More or less of a cross, due to very slender, incur
blade, widely flarin~ shoulders, and narrow stem° Base
pointed or rounded. Blade edges frequently serrated, often
some teeth considerably longer than others.

sometimes recurred with constriction near middle. Bases
deeply concave to deeply V-shaped. Commonly very finely
chipped, thin, flat, with edges minutely serrated.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 5.5 cm. Maximum width quite
uniform at 1 to 1.5 cm. Basal ~concavity 0.3 to 0.7 cm.

CULTURAL

PERDIZ POINTS
(Plate 131, rows C-E)

DESCRIPTION

Outline: Triangular blade with edges usually quite straight
but sometimes slightly convex or concave. Shoulders sometimes at right angles to stem but usually well barbed. Stem
contracted, often quite sharp at base, but may be somewhat rounded. O~ccasionally, specimen may be worked on
one face only, or mainly on one face. More variation in
size and proporhons than in most arrow-point types in
Texas. Workmanship generally good, sometimes exceedingly fine with minutely serrated blade edges.
Dimensions: Total length about 1.5 to 6 cm,. the longer specimens overlapping several dart point types in length but
much thinner and lighter than specimens classified as dart
points. Max*mum width about 1.2 to 3 cm. Stems 0.5 to 1.5
cm. long, generally ½ to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in many Neo-American complexes in Texas,
surh as Bravo Valley and Central Texas Aspects; Henrietta,
Wylie, Frankston, Galveston Bay, and Rockport Foci.
Frankston Focus, at the western limits of the Caddoan area,
is the only focus in the Gibson and Fulton Aspects in which
this type occurs, where it is the only arrow-point type.
DISTRIBUTION
Most of Texas from Rio Grande in extreme west to Neches
River valley on the east; from Red River valley in both
Texas and Oklahoma southward ~to eastern and central
parts of Gulf coast.
ESTIMATED AGE
Formerly regarded as quite late; now estimated at about 1000
to 1500 A. D.

PIEDRAS TRIPLE-NOTCHED POINTS
SAUCIA SPLIT-BASE POINTS
Mentioned by Kelley (1947b, p. 122) as types belonging to Bravo
Valley Aspect in extreme western Texas, also occurring at
Lehmann Rockshelter in Gillespie County, Central Texas.
No descriptions published, both seem similar to Toyah
points (Plate 133).
$CALLORN POINTS
(Plate 132, rows A-C)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Broad to slender triangular blades with edges straight
to convex, o~casionally concave. Shoulders may be squared
but usually well barbed. Stem formed by notching into
corners at various angles, making it expand from a broad
wedge shape to rounded extremities as wide as the shoulders. Base straight, concave, and convex. Possibly should
be divided into two or more types, but these features of
stem shape and base intergrade in every possible manner
where found in Texas. Blade edges often finely serrated.
Dimensions: Tdtal length about 2°5 to 4.5 cm., rarely longer
or shorter. Maximum width at shoulders or base fairly
uniform at 1.5 to 2 cm. Stems ’~{~ to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in Central Texas Aspect; occurs in Henrietta Focus
and probably Rockport Focus.
DISTRIBUTION
More or less a broad central belt through Texas from Red River
valley to Gulf coast, but absent in East Texas and eastern
and southern extremities of coast. Said to be fairly abundant throughout Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhat older than Perd~z points; possibly 700 to 1500 A. D.
REFERENCES
Kelley (1947b, p. 122) mentions "Scallorn Stemmed" type as
diagnost~ of Austin Focus (of Central Texas Aspect) but
provides no description; Krieger, 1946, pp. 97, 115 and Fig.
7, T, U; Miller and Jelks, 1952, pp. 176-177 and Plate 24,

SHAFTER SPLIT-BASE POINTS
A type recognized by Kelley in the Bravo Valley Aspect in extreme
western Texas, which appears very similar to that described
herein as Turney (Plate 134). As the Turney points have
been definitely associated only with the historic Allen Focus in the central part of East Texas. and are not recognized
so far in the area between East and Trans-Pecos Texas,
this similarity needs to be investigated more fully.
STARR POINTS
(Plate 132, rows D, E)
Simple txiangular points with both edges and base concave. Possibly variants of Fresno type (Plate 128) but the basic pattern
of three concave edges has, in general, a more southern distribution in Texas. While Fresno points are found widely ]n
central, northern, and western Texas, Start points are more
common in the coastal portion and in Southwest Texas, especially in Brownsville and Mier Foci. The basal concavity also
is usually considerably deeper than that of Fres~m points. The
time span is probably about the same as Fresno.

TALCO POINTS
(Plate 133, rows A-C)

DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Slender triangular points with edges occasionally
almost straight but usually recurred with constriction ap~
proximately in middle.
Bases almost always concave.
Workmanship extremely fine, blades thin and flat. Edges
commonly minutely serrated, tips often slimmed down to
needle-like point.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 5.5 cm. Maximum width 1 Io
1.8 cm. Basal concavity 0.1 to 0.4 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in Titus Focus, Fulton Aspect, large number~
being found in burials. Overlaps somewhat with Maud
points (Plate 131) but bases not so deep and edges much
more consistently recurved; distribution more restricted.
Some overlap also with Turney points (Plate 134).
DISTRIBUTION
Northern part of East Texas, especially in upper drainage systems of Sabine and Sulphur Rivers, extending to Red
:River.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200 to 1500 A. D., possibly continuing with minor changes into
Turney type in early historic times, 1600 to 1700 A. D.
REFERENCES
None.
TOYAH POINTS
(Plate 133, rows D, E)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small triangular blades with two side notches anywhere from near base to about middle. Bases originally
straight to concave but strongly modified in most cases
with a large third notch in ~center of base. Blade edges
often strongly serrated and narrowed above notches.
Dimensions: Length about 1.5 to 2.5 cm. Maximum width 1
to 1.5 cm., or slightly more or less.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Apparently another name for "Piedras Triple-Notched" points,
which Kelley (1947b, p. 122) assigns to Toyah Focus, a division of the Central Texas Aspect which he relates to the
Sumano Indian occupation of west-central and Trans-Pecos
Texas. Similar to Harrell points (Plate 129) but smaller
and more modified in the blade and around corners by
notching, incutting, and serration.
DISTRIBUTION
Parts of Trans-Pecos Texas, possibly extending rarely into Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Late prehistoric; early historic?
REFERENCES
None published. Considerable confusion as to what features
distinguish Piedras and Toyah points, and how they are
distinguished from "Saucia Split-Base", "Sarago.sa. No.t~ch..edSerrate", and "Frisco Base-Notched", all namea Dy ~elley
but undescribed.

TURNEY POINTS
(Plate 134, row A)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Slender triangular blade, edges cut inward just
above base, then straight to tip. Base a broad V rather than
concave, so that basal tips somewhat like barbs rather
than ordinary corners. Very finely !chipped, thin, flat, with
edges serrated in most cases.
Dimensions: Length about 3 to nearly 6 cm., thus longer than
some dart points but much lighter. Maximum width at base
about 1.1 to 1.8 cm. Basal concavity 0.3 to 0.5 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A diagnostic type of Allen Focus in Fulton Aspect, Historic
Stage, not known to occur elsewhere. The shorter specimens are very similar to Talco points (Plate 133) but are
constricted above base rather than recurved with constriction near middle, and bases more V-shaped. The longer
specimens (four in middle of row A) are clearly distinct
from Talco and other triangular types.
DISTRIBUTION
Central part of Neches River valley, East Texas, principally in
northern Cherokee County.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of span 1600 to 1800 A. D.
REFERENCES
None.
YOUNG POINTS
(Plate 134, rows B-D)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Crudely triangular to leaf-shaped, edges occasionally
almost straight but usually strongly convex and often
asymmetrical. Made from thin, curved flakes with little
modification on either side, usually not enough to flatten
the artifacts. Bases straight to convex, seldom concave,
often crooked.
Dimensions: Length about 2.5 to 4.5 cm, Maximum width 1.5 to
2.5 cm.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in Henrietta Focus, rard in Central Texas Aspect.
DISTRIBUTION
Concentrated in Young County, upper Brazos River valley,
North-C~n~ral Texas, with a few in northern part of Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200 to 1500 A. D.
REFERENCES
Described but not named by Krieger, 1946, p. 115 and Fig. 7,

GAR SCALE POINTS
(Plate 134, row E)
These are merely the bony scales of the alligator-gar fish, found
in many archeological sites of the Texas coastal plain and on
lower reaches of rivers entering the Gulf. Due to the shape of
these scales, they could have been hafted to arrow shafts without mooffication. Some, however, have the natural stem slimmed down somewhat, as shown by tiny cutting marks.
