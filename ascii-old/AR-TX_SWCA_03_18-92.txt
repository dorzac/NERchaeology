MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Report Title. A Cultural Resources Investigation for the Canyon Communication Tower, Randall
County, Texas
Report Date. February 9, 2018
SWCA Project Number. 48581
Agency Name. Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
Permit No. N/A
Project Description. SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
background review and intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed Canyon Communication Tower
to determine whether the undertaking will impact any significant archaeological resources.
Project Location. The project area is located approximately 2.0 miles east of the City of Canyon,
Randall County, Texas. ADW Communications (ADW) proposes to install a 250-foot-tall
telecommunications tower. The project area may be found on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
Canyon, Texas, 7.5-minute quadrangle (34101-H8).
Number of Acres Surveyed. 2.0 acres of privately owned land
Principal Investigator. Cherie K. Walth
Field Personnel. Antonio De Cunzo, Field Lead, Survey Hours: 1.
Dates of Work. January 16, 2018
Purpose of Work. ADW proposes to install a 250-foot-tall telecommunications tower in Randall
County, Texas. The work location would include 250-foot-tall tower constructed within a 13,225-squarefoot lease area located east of the City of Canyon, Texas, on lands owned by Southwestern Public Service
Company. As specified by the FCC nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA) for the review of effects
to historic properties (FCC-04-22), proposed new tower locations are subject to a cultural resources
review for the 1) area of potential effects (APE) for direct effects, defined by the extent of disturbance
directly associated with the tower construction, and 2) a visual effects APE defined as the area within
which historic properties may have their settings or viewshed impacted by the proposed tower. This report
details archaeological work done for both those APEs.
Number of Sites. No cultural resources were observed.
Eligibility of Sites. No sites were recorded.
Curation. No artifacts were collected.
Comments. N/A

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
AWD Communications (AWD) proposes to install a 250-foot-tall telecommunications tower in Randall
County, Texas. The project area is located approximately 2.0 miles east of the City of Canyon, Texas
(Figure 1 and Figure 2). All work will take place on property owned by Southwestern Public Service
Company. The proposed work location would consist of a 250-foot-tall tower constructed within a
13,225-square-foot lease area.
The total area of potential effects (APE) for direct effects was estimated to be approximately 1 acre
in size; an additional buffer was surveyed, bringing the total area surveyed to approximately 2 acres.
As stipulated by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) nationwide Programmatic Agreement
(PA), for towers greater than 200 feet and less than 400 feet in height, the APE for visual effects is
defined as a 0.75-mile radius around the antenna location.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Background Review
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) performed a cultural resources file records search on
January 8, 2018, to determine whether the project area has been previously surveyed for cultural
resources and whether any archaeological sites have been recorded in or near the APE. To conduct this
review, SWCA project manager Cherie Walth accessed the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Canyon,
Texas 7.5-minute quadrangle at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and searched the
Texas Historical Commission Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database and site files at TARL.
These sources provide information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological
surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), Official Texas Historical
Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

Field Methods
The goal of the archaeological survey was to locate all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in the
defined APE, establish site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any
sites recorded for designation as an SAL. The proposed APE consists of a 13,225-square-foot lease area;
an additional buffer was surveyed, bringing the total area surveyed to approximately 2 acres. This survey
was conducted as an intensive pedestrian survey with 100 percent ground coverage. The survey was
conducted at 15-m intervals in parallel transects within the project area. In accordance with Texas
Historical Commission standards, shovel tests were conducted in areas where surface visibility was less
than 30 percent. Shovel tests would also have been conducted if there was high potential for buried
cultural deposits. In addition, if any archaeological sites are discovered, a minimum of six shovel tests
are required per site to delineate site boundaries when visibility is less than 30 percent of the total surface
area. Shovel tests are implemented in order to determine the presence or absence of buried cultural
deposits deeper than 10 cm, or deeper than depths normally accessible through trowel testing, and
therefore, to support or negate recommendations of eligibility. Temporally diagnostic artifacts, if present,
were to be described in detail and photographed in the field. Only especially rare artifacts or discoveries
were to be collected.

PROJECT RESULTS
Background Review
The background literature review determined that one cultural resource is within a 1-mile radius of the project
area and no cultural resource surveys have taken place within that 1-mile radius (Atlas 2018). Site 41RD103
is 0.8 mile from the project area and is outside of both the direct APE and indirect APE for the Canyon Tower.

Field Survey
On January 16, 2018, SWCA archaeologist Antonio De Cunzo conducted an intensive pedestrian survey
of the project area. Ground visibility was nearly 100 percent, though this was due to the fact that the
entire survey area had been graded. Topsoil was placed in several spoil piles throughout the project area.
No artifacts were exposed on the graded surface and none were observed in the backdirt piles. It appears
that prior to disturbance, vegetation would have consisted of sparse, low grasses along with mesquite.
Sediments are loamy in nature and likely alluvial and eolian in origin.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the request of ADW, SWCA conducted a cultural resources survey of the proposed Canyon
Communication Tower in Randall County, Texas. The project is subject to review under Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (16 United States Code 470) and implementing regulations

(36 Code of Federal Regulations 800). The work was performed to determine whether the proposed use
of the area would significantly affect cultural resources. The archaeological investigation included an
archaeological background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey.
As stipulated by the FCC PA, for towers greater than 200 feet and less than 400 feet in height, the APE
for visual effects is defined as a 0.75-mile radius around the antenna location. The pre-field search of the
Atlas database did not show any historic properties listed in the NRHP, or eligible for listing in the NRHP
within that radius.
The background literature review determined that no cultural resources have been identified within the project
area, and one is documented within a 1-mile radius of the project area (Atlas 2018). During the SWCA field
investigation, no new archaeological sites were encountered. SWCA recommends a finding of no historic
properties affected for use of the survey area for the proposed Canyon Communications Tower
workspace. No further management is recommended.
