PENDANTS AND THEIR USES
BY A.

T. JACKSON

One hesitates to discuss a class of problematical artifacts about
which so much has been written. Jones, l Holmes,2, 3 Fowke, Z~
Moore,5 Peabody, Moorehead,6, 7 and various other writers have
made valuable contributions to the subject of pendants. Apparently, however, further facts are needed which may shed even a
small measure of additional light on this hazy subject.
Moorehead in a map accompanying his book on "Stone Ornaments" shows the ovate fo~-m of pendant as occurring in only the extreme eastern part of Texas. The gorget form he indicates as reaching only into the northeastern tip of Louisiana and eastern part of
Arkansas--missing Texas completely. It, therefore, seems desirable
to put on record the fact that these forms occur over a wide area
in Texas.
Nomenclature
One of the apparent needs in connection with the study of this
subject is a uniform nomenclature. Different writers use dissimilar
terms for the same type of specimen. Among those used in the
literature are gorgets, shuttle gorgers, pendants, perforated plates,
pierced tablets, plaques, pendant ornaments, ovate ornaments and
problematical objects.
The names more often applied are gorgers and pendants.

In a

few cases there seem to have been attempted-though rarely so
stated---to apply the word pendant to specimens containing only
one perforation, while those with two or more holes are called
gorgets. But even this distinction often is ignored; as, for example,
when Moorehead~ speaks of "gorgers or pendants having one hole."
The Handbook of the American Indians9 states:
* * * "Gorgers may have one or two marginal perforations for suspension, or they may be piel’ced centrally or otherwise for attachment * * * The name gorget is also applied to composite ornaments
of various kinds suspended on or fixed against the chest." * * *
In this paper the meaning of the word gorget has been restricted
to include circular, and in rare cases triangular and rectangular
specimens that have two or more holes in horizontal line at or near
the edge.

The term pendant will be used to include oval, triangular

Texas Archeolol~ical and Paleontological Society

or rectangular specimens--of any material--that have a single perforation, or more than one when in a longitudinal line. When a
specimen is broken and has a row of horizontal small perforations
along the broken edge, it is assumed that the latter holes were
drilled after the breakage occurred. The specimen, therefore, is
classed as a pendant and not a gorget. Even with these distinctions
an occasional questionable case may arise.
Stone Pendants in Graves

There have been a few cases in Texas where perforated stone pendants were in graves. These discoveries will be reviewed briefly.
Outstanding among such finds are some reported by Ray.lo

In

this connection he states in part as follows:
* * * "A rock structure of circular form * * * was found. * * * Below the stones was 1 ~/~ feet of hard dry earth filled with small stones.
* * * We came to * * * bed rock and apparently projecting out of the
center of this were some large rough stones. * * * When these were
removed more black earth was found beneath. * * * A round hole
three feet across, which had been cut down into the solid bed rock for
about a foot in depth, we found * * * to be full of small burned bone
and shell fragments. * * * The writer unearthed the largest stone
pendant that he ever saw, an oval gray stone pendant, with an hourglass-shaped hole at one end. It was 5% inches long and slightly over
two inches across. * * * The fragments of bones were quite small and
fire-blackened, and the finding of two very small milk teeth showed
that the cremation was that of a very young child. * * * In addition
to the large pendant, there were four other oval stone pendants. * * * A
smaller pendant of shell * * * and a shell bead * * * were found." * * *

Among the numerous other artifacts accompanying the burial were
fragments of polished bone tubes, quartz pebbles from what may
have been rattles, and "three thick, roughly made, stemmed and
shouldered flint projectile points"--all of which later may be helpful in placing the burial and the associated pendants in their proper
age group.
In writing of another burial Ray11 says:
* * * "This * * * mound consisted of only one burial slab cist con°
taining one skeleton, * * * the shallowe~st long-headed flexed cist burial
found in the Roberts site. * * * Closely against anal on the outside of
the two right forearm bones * * * were two artifacts lying flat on
the bones and touching each other. One of the artifacts measures 2~
inches across and has a hole drilled through its center and dot decora-

tion~ in one edge.

It is concave on the inner side and formed so as to

fit one’s wrist perfectly. * * * The other object is 1% inches long and
1 5/16 inches wide. * * * The surface lying agains~ the wrist was fla~
and the other surface was rounded." * * *

Dr. Ray kindly sent the two last mentioned specimens to Austin
for examination. The one containing the biconically drilled hole
is made of a thick section of conch shell, probably Fulgur perver.
sum. The convex side, highly polished, shows the remains of a
shallow groove extending from the hole to the adjacent broken edge,
where there remains on the concave side the edge of another perforation. The unbroken edge of the concave side is bevelled exactly like
many shell "celts" from the Texas coast. It seems that when the
proximal end of the original implement was broken the specimen
was converted into an ornament or possible wrist guard. Still later
the ornament was broken through one of its central holes.

The stone speci~nen, found
the shell one, apparently is

it as a caIcareous stone, and verified
specimen as conch shell.

The fact that both specimens are broken, and one has no perforation, suggests that they may have been placed on the wrist, after
burial, as ornamental offerings--rather than bracers or wrist guards,
which usually were on the left wrist instead of the right. They
accompanied a small adult. The bones, in bad condition, perhaps
were those of a woman.
The position of these specimens on tim wrist is much like that of
a bone "gorget" reported by Webb and Dodd~z from Louisiana,
as well as certain shell specimens found by Duffen in South Texas
and mentioned elsewhere.
A. C. Stearns and wife report finding a rock-covered burial, on
the tip of a narrow high ridge, about 14, miles west of Robert Lee,
Coke County. There were three individuals, "one large and the other
two much smaller." With one of the smaller skeletons were two
stone pendants (Plates I, 4 and III, 1) and a conch shell gorget.

The shell gorget, some 4x3~ inches and slightly rectangular with
rounded corners, was on the right chest. It has two worn holes near

12

the edge of the narrow end, two other holes near the center and a
fifth at the edge of the wide end.
The smaller oval stone pendant, 4~,A2x11~ inches, and without
decoration, has a single perforation very near one end. It was at
the right wrist.

The larger stone pendant, also oval, is 6x25~ inches,

has three holes in a longitudinal row--two near one end and the
other spaced one-third length from the opposite end. It, decorated
with carved designs, "was at the center and slightly below the chest."
In June, 1936, Woolsey~3 exhumed several burials at a site near
Moran, Shackelford County.

In one of these graves was a large

undecorated stone pendant in a poor state of pre~rvation and with
fragments missing from one edge.
"The grave was located by a pile of rocks scattered over an area
eight feet in diameter. Rocks were around and over the body. The
skull was covered by a stone 23x17 inches and only eight inches deep.
The space occupied by the skeleton was 27x17 inches. The head,
badly crushed, was to the south. * * * The teeth were somewhat worn ;
the legs were flexed ~vith the body on the left side. It seemed to be
a small adult, probably a woman.
"On the chest, just below the chin ~vas an a~’tifact made of slate or
black shale. It measures about 5~/.,x3½ inches, and has a hole in
each end. The wider end, with the smaller perforation, was toward
the head; the narrow end, with a larger hole, pointed toward the hips.
T~here were no other artifacts in the grave."
J. J. Howard gives a verbal account of the finding of a "butterflyshaped" pendant of Eltenberger limestone in a shelter burial on
Cave Creek, Coryell County. He reports that a metate was on edge
along one side of the grave, with several limestone slabs that formed
a eist-like enclosure.

A large slab was over the flexed skeleton,

which he thinks was that of a young woman.

The grave floor was

at a depth of about 5:t/,~. feet below the surface.
He states that the well worked pendant was on the chest in a
horizonal position, slightly beneath the chin, and was broken across

the short axis when found. Despite the old break, the two pieces
were together; and five small perforations near each edge of the
break suggests that the holes were used in mending the specimen.
Any sinew or cord that may have been laced through the small holes,
to hold the pieces together, had completely decayed.
Two larger drilled holes, in the approximate center of the ornament, apparently were the first perforations. The break occurred at
the edge of one of these holes, and may have resulted from the drilling operations. The stone, with a thickness of scarcely a~ inch, has a
length of about five inches; wing width of some three inches and a
neck width of less than two inches.
Around the neck were many lithospermuln seed beads, possibly
strung with the pendant. Other artifacts in the grave included two
smal! bone "pins," sharpened at one end and rounded at the other.
Russell1 z~ reports the finding of a stone pendant, with three perforations, in a grave eight riffles west of Behon, Bell County.
"The site is in a very rocky country, on a hillside near an enormous
spring. The burial was about 18 inches under the surface and was an
accidenfml find.
The thrce-holer was with eight projectile points,
buried with the adult remains of two males. All artifacts were with
the skull, over which hillside stones had been placed. * * * Near this
same site I found a soapstone gorget about five inches long by two
inches wide and very thick, with three holes in it. I also found a
piece very similar, but broken across at one of the holes.

It originally

had three holes."

Unfortunately Russell does not illustrate nor give detailed information concerning the eight projectile points reported from the
grave in which the pendant was found.
Shell Ornaments in Graves

For the purpose of showing what may be significant similarities
between the uses of stone and shell pendants in graves, a few additional cases of the finding of shell specimens will be briefly mentioned.
Pete Wiseman gives a verbal account of finding, in 1933, a shell
di~ on the chest of a skeleton in a grave on Owl Creek, some 16
miles north of Belton, Bell County. The center of the disc is cut
away, leaving a circular hole about a/~ inch in diameter. There

16

Texa~ Archeological and Pa2eon~ological Society

are seven shallow dots or punctations forming a lhm across the
disc--which is scarcely two inches in diameter. There are no perforations other than the large central hole.
Wheat1~ reports the finding of a large abalone shell pendant
associated with a bundle burial of a woman and a child in a small
shelter, some 16 miles southeast of Lubbock.
E. D. Smith verbally states that several years ago he found a triangular shell pendant in a grave one mile west of New Braunfels,
Comal County. The specimen, 4 3/10 inches long, has a drilled
hole near the edge in each end. The ornament was on the chest of
an adult.
In burial M-1 at the Oso site,16 Nueces County, were eight small
triangular shell pendants. They were just to the south and partly
beneath the skull. The sizes of the specimens range from
to 1 13/16"xll/s". The edges are covered with many small notches.
There is a single perforation in the small end of each specimen.

In a child’s grave in Val Verde County cave~7 were three complete shell pendants and part of another, all made from large fresh
water mussel shells. An unbroken projectile-point-shaped specimen,
with notched edges and remains of a knotted leather thong in the
two stem-end holes, was near the right shoulder between two groups
of reed tubes. A broken pendant, almost identical except for having
only one perforation, was beneath the chin. A diamond-shaped
pendant, with two closely spaced central perforations, was near the
right femur. A third specimen was just above the hip.
Stone Pendants in Middens

The vast majority of the stone pendants are found in the rubbish
beaps of village sites. Although the specimens are widely .distributed, the available data indicates that they are much more numerous in certain areas.
In this connection two facts must be taken into consideration:
(1) Many parts of Texas are little known archaeologically. (2) In
some cases locally known facts regarding artifacts have not been
published and, therefore, are not available for incorporation in
comparative studies. It thus is evident that the present picture
may be materially changed in some areas. The following statistics

concerning the regional distribution of stone pendants in Texas are
given with the full understanding that many parts of the state are
represented by very inadequate samplings. No pretense is made of
an exhaustive study in any section.

The above figures suggest that Central Texas may easily rank
first in the distribution of stone pendants. East Texas, where much
intensive field work has been carried on for a number of years,
seems to fall far behind as regards this particular type of artifact.
Too much dependence cannot be placed on the percentages for the
other areas.
Certain counties in Central and Southwest Texas run high in the
percentage of broken specimens. These are the areas where burntrock middens predominate.

*Eleven specimens are not completed and have no perforations.
If these are eliminated, we find that only 4~) per cent of the perrotated specimens in these areas have not been broken; while 60 per
cent bf them were in a fragmentary condition when uncovered in the
middens.
Other Texas counties in which stone pendants have been reported
include Bastrop, Burner, Falls, Gillespie, Kerr, Limestone, McLennan, Navarro, Real, Cass, Cherokee, Gregg, Harrison, Henderson,
Lamar, Red River, Sabine, Shelby, Titus, Van Zandt, Wood, Clay,

The above statistics suggest that very few perforated stone pendants were made by the first occupants of these sites; that the culture
trait flowered during the middle period of occupancy; and at most
sites had started a definite decline in the latest period.

Pendants and Their Uses

21

A few outstanding cases bearing on the comparative chronology
of the specimens in various areas will be cited.
In a large burnt-rock ~nidden at Cedar Park, Williamson County,
Pearce and the writer found a number of stone pendants. Eight of
the specimens were at depths ranging from one to !8 inches, thus
falling in the so-caIled upper level. Five were at depths of 25 to 48
inches, coming in the middle level.

The midden had a maximum

depth of approximately seven feet, but no pendants were found
deeper than 48 inches.
In the fall of 1932 two perforated stone pendants were found in
a large rock shelter on the Fate Bell ranch, Val Verde County.~a
One of these, in a fragmentary condition and with the remains o~ a
large perforation, was in an ash deposit at a depth of 36 inches.
The other, with three holes partly drilled, also was in the ash deposit 27 inches deep. In the same level were many flint artifacts,
manos, bone beads, etc.

Above tim ash was a "trash" deposit ex-

tending from the surface to a depth of about 18 inches. In that
level were basketry, matting, sandals, cordage, etc. Two stratified
levels were beneafl~ the ash deposit and extended to 82 inches,
where bedrock was struck. Nearly two-thlrds of the midden depth
thus was beneath, and older than, tim deposit in which the pendants
occurred.

The seven stone pendants from the Fall Creek sites,~9 Llano and
San Saba Counties, in most cases were at depths of i2 to 36 inches
and seem to be prehistoric.

One specimen, however, was on rite

surface and another at a depth of only a few inches in association
with potsherds that suggest mission influence.
Still another specimen, almost identical in shape to many stone
pendants, was made of lead apparently ’:mohted in an ordinary
tablespoon."

Eliminating this doubtful specimen, there remains

evidence that the inhabitants used pendants from about the middle
o~ their prehistoric occupancy down into the bisto.rie period.
In a rock shelter on the Lehmann ranch, Gillespie County, Woolsey
in January, 1936, found a stone pendant with two perforations at a
depth of 32 inches. Despite the depth the specimen seems to be
comparatively recent.

There were two sterile layers above: nine

inches at the top containing loo~ sand and sheep droppings, with

22

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

five inches beneath made up entirely of creek-deposited ~and. The
pendant thus was only 18 inches beneath the sterile layers. The
occupational level itself contained much gravel and sand from flood
periods, suggesting that the deposit may have been laid down in a
relatively short time. Some 30 inches beneath this upper habitation
level was another with much ash but few artifacts.
In the spring of 1934 the writer excavated five rock shelters on
the Craig ranch, Edwards County. In shelter No. 2 a fragmentary,
well-polished pendant was found at a depth of 16 inches, and another small piece at 14 inches. One shows the remains of two perforations and the other is broken through a single hole. The midden deposit in the square from which these specimens came ranged
in depth from 30 to 45 inches. It thus seems that the pendants are
comparatively recent. At depths of 10 and 18 inches in adjacent
squares were small arrowpoints confined to the upper level. At
the deeper levels in this shelter were only large projectile points.
This association of the pendants with the small points seems significant.
Stone pendants were plentiful at the Law Brothers site, Travis
County, and were confined largely to the middle period of occupancy. The depth range of the pendants was from 11 to 26 inches.
Eleven of the 15 specimens were in the rubbish of the adjacent
campsite, one was on the surface and only three in the concentrated burnt-rock middens or "mounds." These facts agree with a
statement made by Bliss,ZO who was in charge of the excavation:
"Results of excavations show that the burnt-rock areas of the
mounds produce £ew artifacts compared with the peripheral areas.
The deep mound of burnt rock produced very Yew artifacts."

Eight of the pendants are whole and ~ven are fragmentary.
addition, there are five incomplete and undrilled specimens.

In

An unusual fact, discovered in the laboratory, is that a fragment
from the surface fits onto another piece secured at a depth of 26
inches.
At the Williams site, Travis County, was another b~oken pendant
the fragments of which were found at different depths. According
to George R. Fox, in charge of the excavation, one was at a depth of
18 inches; while the other, in a different square, was only eight
inches deep. The restored specimen, with some still missing from

Pevdr~rtts and Their Uses

one end, has a length of 8a!.i inches and a maximum width of 234
inches. The greatest thickness is 5/I6 inch. Both surfaces are well
polished. ]’he material is slate and the edges contain 76 notches.
An interesting feature in connection with these fragments is the
presence of two ~ts of two offsetting perforations along the broken
edge of each piece. (Plate III, 3). They match so well as to force
the conclusion that they were used in repairing the broken specimen.
The two original end holes are drilled from only one side; tile
four holes along the broken edges are drilled from both sides.
We have here the possihility that the specimen was used after its
repair; later came apart, one piece was discarded and the other
continued in use for a time.
In writing of the stone pendants from the tleffington site, Travis
County, J. Charles Kelley,2 ~ in charge of the excavation, states:
"The two fragmentary specimens are both ~rom the burnt rock
midden at the t-Ieffington site. One comes from t.he 6"-12" level (below surface), the other from the 18"-24" level. At the present stage
of research no culturat differe~biation of significance has been noted
from one level to another. No clue to the relative age of the specimens within the midden is thus available other than the hare facts of
their depths. The si~e itself is in every obvious way a ts~pical burni>
rock midden, with the normal cultural associations thus implied. It
appears relatively late in regional archaeological chronology. There
is, however, no evidence that the site survived into historic times in
the area; it is, therefore, presumably la~e prehistoric."
Kelley22 also reports a broken "gorget" frown the Jackson-Caldwell site, Brewster County.

It came from the contact between the

Kokernot and the Calamity formations and may immediately precede the chronological picture as given for the Bravo Valley aspect.
"Sites of the La Junt~ focus, :Bravo Valley aspect, consistently produce ceramics of Southwestern origin; a complex of wares dated by
~ree ring methods at about 1200-1400 A. D. in the Southwe-st.’" * * *

William A. 1)uffcn,23 in charge of the excavation of a large midden on aa old river terrace remnant known as Morhiss Mound,
~v’ictoria County, dia:usses the comparative ages of three stone pendants from that South Texas site:
"One of the few polished stone specimens from this site is a heavy
pendant of a dense slate, occurring at a depth of nine inches in the
midden material. It is oval in outline, having a length of 2 9/16 inches

24

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

and a width of 1 9/16 inches; with a thickness of 9/16 inch at the
center, tapering off to a rather thin but rounded edge. The perforation is formed by two conical pits in opposition, showing a drilling
from both sides. The material and the artifact form are intrusive to
the coastal area.
Dr. E. H. Sellards of the Bureau of Economic
Geology of the University of Texa~ feels that the material might well
be from the Ouachita area near the boundary of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The specimen was in the horizon with small projectile points
and corner-tang knives and seems to be proto-historic.
it is a late period.

At any rate,

"The fragments of a banded slate pendant, or so-called gorget, came
from a depth of 33 inches in the midden deposit. It is piano-convex in
cross-section, and has been perforated by drilling from opposite sides.
This material as well as the artifact are foreign to the area. The
source of the stone could have been the same as in the preceding case.
The specimen seems to belong to the late prehistoric period.
"A single object, which at one time had been a bannerstone, was recovered from a depth of 15 inches in the midden. The piece had been
smoothed along the broken edges and then drilled with a single hole
for suspension, thus converting it into a pendant. The material of
which it is made and the resulting artifact are both intrusive to the
area. It seems to be late prehistoric."
Materials Used

Various stones were used in the manufacture of the pendants. The
most common were Packsaddle schist, slate, limestone, and sandstone. Others include limonite, hematite, steatite, banded siltstone,
turquoise, etc. The colors range through gray, brown, green, blue,
yellow, red and black. Some of the banded pieces are beautifully
colored.
In many cases the stone used was secured locally; as, for example,
the limonite and hematite in East Texas; the limestone and schist in
Central Texas.
In certain cases, as that previously nmntioned in South Texas,
slate seems to have been brought in from other regions.

Varieties o] Stone Pendants
The stone pendants tend to subgroup into varieties. Certain of
these overlap, so there is not always a clear-cut line of demarkation.
It seems that shape alone is not the most desirable basis
sification. Neither can the matter of size be considered of
importance. The method here employed is to consider
number and position of the perforations; (2) the shape;

for clasprimary
(1) the
(3) the

size.

Data Regarding Per]orations
Most of the perforations consist of biconically drilled holes,
sometimes referred to as countersunk holes. Using a flint drill,
or reamer, the drilling was done from both sides, the two parts of
the hole meeting near the center. Often these were located with
great precision. In other cases the holes were not exact offsets and
were adjusted by enlargement. In a few specimens such action was
not taken, leaving the crude asymmetrical perforations.
When the holes were small and the stone thin, drilling sometimes
was done entirely from one side. In such cases there usually is
evidence that the edge of the hole was somewhat shattered when the
drill point emerged. This occasionally was remedied by a slight
reaming of the hole on that side.
A third method of perforation was by the use of small reeds or
bone tubes. In such cases the holes are cylindrical. A few holes
have been noted where countersinking was employed. The hole
first was put through with a small cylinder; then a larger one was
used on each side to a shallow depth. There is a definite break
between the holes of the different diameters. This feature is noted
in a pendant from Val Verde County and another from Bell County.

Two or more small perforations near broken
edge .............................................................

The pendants with a single perforation at one end are more plentiful than the other varieties. The only appreciable difference between the specimens with a single perforation at each end and those
with two central perforations is that in the latter case the holes are
somewhat closer together. One variety merges into the other.
Specimens with two or more perforations at one end and with a
single hole at the opposite end also are fairly plentiful. They, however, are not distributed over as wide a region as some of the other
varieties.
Many of the broken specimens have the breaks running through
the center of one or more of the holes. Eighteen per cent of all
Texas stone pendants examined were broken through a perforation.
Such breakage may have resulted from the drilling process, or occurred later due to rough usage. As mentioned elsewhere, the small
perforations along broken edges seem to have been used for repair.
All stone pendants reported from Coke, Mitchell and Victoria
counties have only a single perforation at one end. In the latter
county, however, some shell specimens have two perforations.
In localities where stone pendants are numerous, as in Travis
County, all varieties listed above are present. The single perforation in one end is more frequent than any of the others.
Sizes o] Specimens
The sizes vary widely.

This is true not only in remotely separated

areas, but often applies in a single locality.
Of 58 specimens from Travis County, 25 yield all dimensions.
The length, apparently more diagnostic than the width, ranges from
7/8 inch to 98~ inches, with an average of 4~/~ inches. The specimens

have been divided into the following length groups:

The maximum width, usually near the center of the specimen,
ranges in Travis County from z~ inch to 31/~ inches, with an average
of 2ai~ inches. The thickness of the same specimens varies from
3/16 inch to r/s" inch, averaging 2/5 inch.
The dimensions of the three longest specimens are 8¼"x3"x5/16",
91/~"x28/~"x5/16" and 9~"x3½"x¼". These taper gradually from
the center to rounded points, and have a single perforation somewhat removed from each end. All have suffered more or less
breakage.
In examining these large perforated stones a similarity was noted
between their sizes and shapes and those of three so-called blades
from the Fall Creek site,zz~ Llano County. The "blanks" from
Llano County, like the pendants from Travis County, are made of
limestone and "roughed out" by percussion, with the edges and ends
somewhat thinned. Thinning the edges in this manner would have
saved much grinding, and may represent the initial stage in the
manufacture of large pendants.
Specimens from other Central Texas counties compare favorably
with the averages stated above. The average size, 4"x17~’’, of specimens from East Texas also compare to those in Central Texas. On
the average, however, specimens fro,n North,Z5 South, Southwest 26. z7 and parts of West Texaszs, zg, 3o seem to be smaller
than those in Central Texas.
Few Primary Shapes
The primary shapes do not vary greatly. The predominant form
is the oval; a few are triangular, rectangular and square with
rounded corners; an occasional one is almost round, in the form
of a discoidal; and a few are "reel-shaped" or "butterfly-shaped."
The specimens with only a single perforation include a greater
variety of shapes than do those with combinations of two or more
holes. The oval with the hole near one end is the most popular
shape among the single-perforated specimens. Triangular pendants
usually have the hole in the small end, but occasionally it is in the
center of the wide end. The few small square pendants usually
have the hole in one corner. The rare round specimens more often
are perforated in the center; while the rectangular ones have a hole
in the center of one end.

3O

Tezws A~ch~olog~cal ~ P~l¢o~tological ~oc~e~y

Two central perforations occur in specimens that are approximately round, rectangular, reel-shaped, and rarely in oval ones.
Two holes near one end and one hole at the other are confined
almost entirely to oval specimens.
A form of considerable interest is the so-called reel-, wing- or
butterfly-shaped pendant. The writer knows of only six such specimens in Texas. One of these, reported from a grave in Coryell
County, has been discussed.
Another specimen of that general form was found by J. E. Hawkins in Limestone County. According to Frank H. Watt,3~ who
kindly furnished a photograph and data, it is made of black amphobile schist and was secured at Site No. 40A8-4. It has two central
biconically drilled holes, and is broken through the center of one
of these. (Plate II, 5).
Wilson32 reports "three broken gorgets of a very odd shape"
from a site located "about four miles southeast of Wylie," near the
Collin-Rockwall County line. A sketch restoration, based on about
one-fourth of a specimen, shows the original shape about the same
as the one from a cave burial in Coryell County. The only apparent
difference is that Wilson concludes his specimen probably had four
original pcrforations arranged in two groups; whereas, the one from
Coryell County originally contained only two central holes.
The remaining Texas specimen of this general form came from
a depth of only 14 inches in a burnt-rock midden, Travis County.
It is made of Packsaddle schist, and has two central perforations.
George T. Wright33 furnishes data on 35 stone pendants, including four reel-shaped slate specimens each with two central perforations, from surface sites near Red River in Choctaw and McCurtain
Counties, southeastern Oklahoma. (Plate IV). One of these is
much like several of the Texas specimens, while the others are of
the more pronounced four-wing form.
There is a noticeable similarity between the shapes of these stone
specimens and certain reel-shaped objects of copper from Alabama3z~ and elsewhere.
Decoration
Some form of decoration appears on 15 per cent of the stone
pendants reported from Texas. By far the greatest part of such

Pendants and Their Uses

31

decoration consists of small notches or serrations along the edges.
(Plates II, 1-2, III, 2-3; IV, 1, 3a-b).
In some cases the notches are wide, deep and fev~ in numbers;
in others they are narrow, shallow and numerous. The number
varies from two to 38 on each edge. Usually equal numbers appear
on the opposite edges. The symmetry often is such that one must
consider the notches as intended solely for decorative effect. The
theory that they are tally mark.s, or represent some record, seems
unlikely.
Engraved designs are present on a few specimens. (Plates II, 2, 7;
III, 1-2; IV, lb, 3a-b). These take the form of simple band lines,
ladder-like and diamond-shaped elements, rayed circles or so-called
sun-symbols; and occasionally a design suggestive of a plumed
serpent.
Beauty also was attained in certain cases by perfect symmetry,
highly polished surfaces, and the utilization of the natural colors ha
some stones.35 (Plates I, 3; II, 3).
The elaborately engraved designs on a specimen reported by
Harris36 from Denton County, Texas, is similar to one on a pendant from the southeastern corner of Oklahoma.
Uses to Which Placed
It may be well to present some of the facts and theories set forth
by various writers in an attempt to explain the uses to which these
perforated stones might have been placed.
As early as 1820 R. G. Wilson-37 wrote concerning a mound
burial in Ohio:
* * * "On the breast also lay a stone ornament with two perforations, one near each end, through which passed a string- by means of
which it wa~ suspended around the wearer’s neck. On this string,
which was made of sinews and very much injured by time, were
pIaced a great many beads." * * *

In 1873 Jones3~ expressed the belief that stones perforated with
two holes near the center or with one hole at the end--when thin,
with notched edges and decorated with carved lines--were "intended
as ornaments and were suspended from the neck or fastened to some
conspicuous part of the vestment." He thought, however, that other

32

Texas Archeological and Paleo~$ologicaI Society

specimens more thick and durable, with holes drilled all the way
from one side and twice as large on one side as on the other, were
used in manufacturing bowstrings. He then quoted Catlin, who
thought otherwise:
* * * "Those which I have seen were used * * * for grooving the
shafts of their arrows. * * * These grooves are * * * indented by
pressure produced while forcing the arrow, softened by steam, through
a hole in the tablet, with the incisor of a bear set firmly in a handle
and projecting over the rim of the hole, as the arrowshaft is forced
downward through the tablet. * * * It would be useless to pass the
bowstring through the tablet, for the evenness and the hardness of
strings are produced much more easily and effectually by rolling
them, as they do betwcen two flat stones whilst saturated with heated
glue."
Holmes39 a few years later wrote:
* * * "As a rule the larger and more important pendants are employed as gorgers, but vast numbers of the smaller specimens are
strung with beads at intervals along the string, attached as auxiliary pendants to the larger gorgers, suspended from the nose, ears
and wrists, or form
ments." * * *

He quotes Beverly in his "History of Virginia" (p. 196) regarding pendant ornaments:
"These they wear * * * before or behind their neck, * * * or else
they lace their garments with them, and adorn their tomahawks and
every other thing that they value."

Holmes then names other possible uses for pendants, such as
badges of authority, shuttles, armor plates, wrist protectors, sinewsizers and cord-twisters.
Fowke4o ten years later summarized the preceding theories and
added a few of his own. He stated that some perforated pieces "are
supposed to be bracers. It is said that the Miami Indians wore
similar plates

"Some writers suppose the gorgets to have been shuttles; but this

supposition can hardly be entertained. * * * As twine-~wisters they
would be about as awkward as anything that could be devised. * * *
The bracer theory is plausible. * * * If they were ~o be worn, at the
belt or on any p~art of the dress they could easily have been fastened
by a knotted string. * * * If suspended around the neck, in order
to make them be flat against the bre~t they probably had a short
cord passed through the perforation and tied above the top of the
object, the suspending cord being passed through the loop thus
formed."

Mason41 defines bracer or wrist guard as "a contrivance for protecting the archer’s wrist from being galled by his bowstring: A
shield of leather or other substance fastened to the wrist of the
left hand to prevent injury from the bowstring."
Holmes42 mentions the use of large "pigment tablets." There is
a possibility that some of the circular perforated stones may have
been used in like manner. The present writer has seen no perforated stone with evidence of paint on it; but there have been
found small imperforated stones, of about the same size and shape,
on which appear red paint."~3
In the Handbook, Holmes’~4 in discussing pierced tablets states:
"Those with two or more holes were probably fixed to some part of
the costume, or to some article of ceremony. * * * Their distribution
is general, and their use must have extended at one time or another
to most of the tribes east of the plains and well northward into Canada. ¯ * * It is not unlikely * * * that some of these classes of objects
exhibiting marked diversity of form, size and finish had multiple
offices, serving on occasion or with different communities as implements, ornaments and symbols." * * *

Moorehead45 as late as 1917 wrote:
* * * "If these were made and used by the American Indian of
today, or of the past 100 years, it would have been far easier and
more simple to visit the descendents of such Indians and secure firsthand information as to the use and purpose of these perplexing objects. * * * That some of these objects were in use in historic times
no one wil! deny; that many of them are ancient is also quite true."

In referring to ovate forms with two central holes, or a hole near
each end, he states he found several of these on the chests and arms
of skeletons. A pendant from Maine had a polished groove between
perforations. He thinks the groove was the result of rubbing back
and forth of a thong by which the specimen was fastened to some

86

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

other object. With further reference to grave finds he quotes the
Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society (Vol. VII, p. 134):
"The Storey mound, west of Chillicothe, sheds some light upon the
gorget class. On the right wrist of a skeleton was found a fine
expanded-center gorget of ribbon slate with t~vo perforations. On th~
left wrist there was one of the same kind, but not perforated. Also
at the left wrist was a concave one with unusually sharp edges."

Webb and Dodd46 report the finding of a bone "gorget" on the
left arm of an adult male in a mound in northwestern Louisiana.
Attention is called to the fact that "bow-string protection would be
afforded only if the bow were held horizontally, not vertically."
They also mention a find by H. J. Lemley of "a double-perforated
stone tablet beside the arm of a skeleton in a Ouachita River mound
near Malvern, Arkansas."
Purpose o] Extra Holes

A po~ible use of what seem to be "extra" holes in pendants may
have been for attachment of objects of various kinds. This is suggested by Harrin~on:47
"Quartz cryst~als of various sizes were used by the Indians for surmounting ceremonial wands of bone or as pendants, asphalt being
applied to one end of the crystal for attachment."
Some years ago Pearce wrote the United States National Museum
requesting information concerning the perforations in certain specimens. In reply Graf4e quoted F. M. Setzler as follows:
"We agree with Pearce that the two holes near the outer edge were
made primarily for inserting a thong for suspension. The only explanation our archaeologists have for the larger hole in the center
and on the right hand edge is that feathers or some small animal skin
might have been suspended from these holes. We have no definite
proof for this theory. A careful examination of the edges of perforation might reveal evidence of wear."

In a few cases where there is a small "extra" hole near the edge
it shows some evidence of wear.
Pendaztts on War Bonnets?
One individual states that certain Indians in Oklahoma until a few
years ago used stone pendants in the tops of war bonnets. W.E.S.
Dickerson, a Choctaw Indian who formerly lived in Oklahoma, says

Pendants and Their Uses

37

he knows of no such practice; but that sometimes a shell or small
stone pendant might be used as a slide on a cord beneath the chin
when a war bonnet is worn.
Pendants As Possible Atlatl Weights

Perforated pendants in certain cases seem to merge into perforated boat-shaped artifacts. Pattersonz~9 discusses the possible use
of boat stones as "gorgers" and adds:
"In addition to their resemblance to certain forms of pierced tablets, boat-stones have been found in graves under conditions which
might support this suggestion. * * * According to the report~ made
by the discove~cers, three of these pieces were lying on the chest of
the skeleton. * * * All of these specimens are of the perforated type.
This may be regarded by some as presumptive evidence that they had
been worn after the manner of a gorget, suspended perhaps by a
string encircling the neck.
But it cannot be taken as conclusive
proo:~." * * *

It is interesting and perhaps significant that three of the Central
Texas counties--Travis, Williamson and Bell--with the greatest
number of stone pendants are likewise ones reported by Patterson
as among the greatest yielders of boat-shaped artifacts.
Webb and Dodd5° also have found that "Southwestern Arkansas
represents a minor culture center for gorgers, as Patterson found it
to be for boatstones."
If, as seems from the evidence Patterson presented, many of the
boat-shaped artifacts "were used primarily as weight stones bound to
atlatls to give the weapon additional weight and efficiency," may
not certain of the stone pendants also have been used as atlatl
weights? Some would lend themselves well to such attachment.
(Plate II, 3, 4, 5, 7).
Pendants Possibly Used in Games

Certain of the large so-called pendants possibly may have been
part of the equipment used in playing a game, (Plates III, V), somewhat after the manner of double balls or double billets as reported
by Culin:51
"The game of double ball throughout the eastern United States and
among the Plains tribes ks played exclusively by women. * * * In

Texas Archeologica2 ~d Paleontological Society

38

noTthern California, however, it is played by men.

The implements

for the game consist of two balls or similar objects attached to each
other by a thong, and a curved stick with which they were thrown.
The balls vary in shape and material. * * * Among the Sauk and
Foxes * * * the balls are oblong, weighted with sand and frequently
both, with the connecting thong, are made of one piece of buckskin. * * *
"A distinct variation is found among the ttupa; where, instead of
balls, two small bottle-shaped billets tied together at the top are
employed. The Klama~h use large billets fastened together by a cord
passing through a hole in the middle of each stick. * * *
"The sticks, made of saplings, usually taper to the end and are
slightly curved. * * * They vary in length from 23 inches to six
feet. One stick is ahnost invariably used. * * * The bases, two in
number, consist of poles (Chippewa) or of two piles Of earth (Omaha),
and vary in distance from 300 and 400 yards (Omaha) to a mile
(Cree) apart.
The object of the game "is to get the ball over the
opponent’s base line or to take it to one’s home. Bets are made upon
the result.
"’Another * * * is what is called the throwing game.

It is played

by two large bands, ~vho collect round two opposite poles, and try
to throw the object over the opponent’s pole. * * * They throw them
in the air by means of a staff excellently shaped for the purpose, and
catch it again very cleverly’." * * *

Culin also reports a small "stone buzz" from a cliff ruin in
Arizona. A few s~nall Texas specimens with two central perforations might have been twirled on a twisted cord to make a buzzing
noise.
Summary and Conclusions

Perforated stone "pendants" have been reported from 50 Texas
counties. They probably are present in many others. These are
scattered over a wide area, ranging from the Gulf of Mexico to the
tip of the Panhandle, from the Louisiana border to the E1 Paso
region.
The present known distribution suggests a tendency toward concentration along a comparatively narrow strip, extending from the
northeast part of the state southwest to near the mouth of the Pecos
River. This strip includes a large part of the burnt-rock mound
area of Central Texas, in which these specimens seem to be more

Pendants ~nd Their Uses

numerous than in any other part of the state.
in other areas may change the picture.

39

More extensive work

In the seemingly concentrated area the specimens tend toward
larger size and more elaborate workmanship than in other parts
of the state.
The stone pendants seem to belong to the middle and late prehistoric periods. Few, if any, appear to be of an earlier period. A
few apparently are historic.
Thirteen Texas specimens have been found in graves. Five were
on the chest, three on the right wrist, and ~ive were in a cremated
burial.
Among recorded Texas finds of shell pendants (not circular gotgets) eig)~t were beneath the back of the head, five on the chest, one
near the left wrist, three beside the pelvis, one near the right
shoulder and one on the right femur.
It seems that the~ burial finds, with the po~ible exception of
those on the wrists, may have been entirely for orna~nental purposes.
The bracer or wrist-guard theory is deserving of consideration.
After reviewing all available evidence on the subject, however, tim
present writer is inclined to the idea fl~at most of the specimens on
or very near the forearm were wrist ornaments, rather than bracers for
protection against the bowstring.
There is greater uncertainty regarding the possible uses to which
specimens from midden deposits may have been placed. It seems
unlikely that the Texas specimens were used in the manufacture
of bowstrings, or as sinew-sizers or cord-twisters. Practically all of
the perforations are too small for use in grooving arrowshafts.
The use of small pendants on strings with beads, and as auxiliary
pendants suspended from holes in larger ones, seems probable, z~,
shell pendant in a South Texas grave was in association with beads;
as also was a stone one in Central Texas.
It is possible that some of the stone specimens with two perfora.
tions may have been atlatl weights. Their distribution coincides
with boat-~aped artifacts thought to have been so used.
Some of the large specimens with two or more perforations may
have been attached in pairs, by a thong, and thrown with a stick in

playing a game. Such use might account for the large percentage
of bre,’~kage and battering of the specimens.

McKENZIE CAVE AND ADJACENT SITES
IN PECOS COUNTY
By W. C. HOLDEI~
Approximately twenty-two miles east of Fort Stockton, Pecos
County, Texas, is Tunis Spring. A current of clear water some
eight feet wide and a foot deep flows from beneath a stratum of
limestone. The stream runs between eight and ten miles before it
sinks into the sands and gravels of Tunis Creek. A stage stand of
the Butterfield Trail, built in 1858, was located at the Spring. In
1936 the stage stand was moved and reconstructed by the State
Highway Commission on Highway No. 290 one-third of a mile
northeast of the original site. The original rock corrals are still
intact at the Spring.
Tunis Canyon, in which the Spring is located, varies from two to
four miles in width. The bottom of the Canyon which is almost
level, save for Tunis Creek, is covered with growth of brushy mesquite. The sides of the Canyon, which have the appearance of mesas,
rise some four hundred feet and are covered with a caprock of limestone about twenty feet thick. This caprock, in its perpendicular
sides along the edges of the Canyon, contains a number of caves and
rock shelters. A number of these caves and rock shelters show
signs of human occupation. Panther Bluff, located three miles
southwest of the Spring, has one cave and two shelters. The cave
whose entrance measured seven feet eight inches wide and five feet
three inches high, was filled with debris to a depth of three feet.
Its ceiling had considerable smoke incrustations. The cave had
been previously excavated by Mr. Woodrow Smith and Mr. Jeff
Crump of Fort Stockton. We examined the materials and found
them to be similar to those taken from McKenzie Cave, a description of which follows. Of the two shelters in Panther Bluff, one
measured twenty-one feet wide, six feet six inches deep, and six

feet three inches high. The other was nineteen feet six inches wide,
eighteen feet deep, and eight feet six inches high. The ceilings of
both had smoke incrustations, each had a pictograph on its wall,
and neither coniained any debris.
Approximately six miles east and four miles south of Tunis
Spring is McKenzie Cave,1 located on the ranch of Mrs. Mary Lea
McKenzie. It measured at the entrance 38 feet seven inches wide,
23 feet four inches deep, and five feet high. The ceiling is practically level. However, the floor slopes upward toward the back
until it is within 18 inches of the ceiling. Between ten and fifteen
inches of debris covered the floor. The debris was for the most
part pulverized limestone and windblown material mixed with a
limited amount of ashes. Most of the artifacts came from the front
central part of the cave.
Matting
The large specimen in Plate 6, Fig. 3 is similar to one found
by A. T. Jackson in Val Verde County Rock Shelter2 and classified
by him as Type III. It seems to have measured originally 58 cm by
62 cm. It came from a small dark cave about five by seven feet
located two miles southwest of McKenzie Cave. It is made of triangular culms threaded together at intervals of 17 to 13 cm with
cords. The culms, having a width of 5 ram, are of tule grass which
still grows in the vicinity. The four cords which hold the mat
together vary as to diameter, material, and hardness of twist. The
top cord is 5 mm in diameter, made of agave lechuguilla, and is of
loose twist. The second one from the top is 4 mm in diameter, made
of agave lech~guilhr, and is of compact twist. The third one is 2
ram, apparently of a grass fiber, and of hard twist. The fourth, or
bottom, cord is 3 ram, and is of Spanish dagger.
The small specimen in Plate 6, Figure 3, from a small cave two
miles north of Tunis Spring in the Eight Ranch, is of the same
material as the large specimen, only the triangular grass blades

have been pounded flat. The ends have been twisted, turned back,
and woven together with two alternate cords of firmly twisted agave
lechwguilla. A similar specimen not shown, came from the same
small cave as the large specimen in Plate 6, Figure 3.
A third specimen, shown in the lower right corner of Plate 6,
Figure 4, came from an unexcavated cave three miles northeast of
McKenzie Cave. It differs from the two specimens described immediately above in that the selvedge is formed by the flattened
grass blades being twisted into a cord along the edge. The four
specimens on the left of Plate 6, Figure 4, came frora McKenzie
Cave, and are similar to the large specimen in Plate 6, Figure 3,
only these specimens are thicker and more closely woven. The
cords near the edges are about 1 cm from the edge, and the ends of
the culms are cut off evenly. In as much as the edges to the large
specimen in Plate 6, Figure 3 are not existent, it may be that its
edge was like these four. Although these specimens are cornmonly
referred to as matting, a loop of cordage attached to the edge of one
of them suggests that they might have been u~d as hangings, or as
the back of a cradle.
The back of a cradle board from a cave in the Huecos Mountains
30 miles from E1 Paso is of similar material and construction. The
cradle board is shown in Picturesqu.e Southwest, Vol. I, No. 1, p. 24.
The frame of a cradle was found by George C. Martin in a cave on
the lower Peeos, and is shown in Big Bend Basket Maker Papers No.
3, Witte Museum, p. 4~4, Plate XLIV, Figure 7. It is probable that
this frame, like the one from the Hueeos Cave, was covered with the
matting in question. Incidentally, these cradle boards, together with
the presence of similar types of matting may represent an affinity
between the lower Pecos’and the Hueeos cultures.
The piece of checker board, or square weave matting in upper
right of Plate 6, Figure 4, is similar to types reported by George C.
Martin from caves on the lower Pecos and shown in Big Bend Basket
Maker Papers, No. 3, p. 60, Plate XLI, Figure 5, and p. 61, Plate
XXI, Figure 3.

been carefully split on the two sides and bottom, leaving the parts
attached at the top with a hinge like connection about 7 cm long.
Fi~,e other leaves were split on one side only, the split side being
stitched together with a slit piece of Spanish dagger leaf. One of
these was stuffed with shredded cedar bark. The leaves are shown
in Plate 6, Figure 5, top.

Quids
Numerous quids resulting from the chewing of young and tender
fibrous stalks, which perhaps were sotol, were found in McKenzie
Cave. Similar quids have been reported from Murrah Cave on the
lower Pecos, from Pearce and Jackson’s Rock Shelter in Val Verde
County, and from Jackson’s caves in Culberson County. The specimens are shown at the bottom of Plate 7, Figure !.
Sandals
Ten fragments of different sandals came from McKenzie Cave.
Prototypes of all of them have been reported from other sections of
the Big Bend area. The specimens in the middle left and lower left
of Plate 6, Figure 5 are similar to those described by Victor J.
Smith, Texas zlrchaeological and Paleontological Society Bulletin,
Vol. V, as Type I, Round toe, and shown in Plate 13, No. 30, p. 65.
The same type of sandal is also described by A. T. Jackson from
Caldwell Cave No. 1 in Culberson County, Texas Archaeological and
Paleontological Society Bulletin, Vol. IX, pp. 154-179. The specimen third from the left, bottom row, Plate 6, Figure 5, is similar to
a type described by Martin from the lower Pecos Caves in Big Bend
Basket Maker Papers, No. 3, pp. 71, 72, 73. Two specimens in the
middle upper of Plate 6, Figure 5, are like two sandals from Murrah
Cave and shown in Texas Archaeological .and Paleontological Society
Bulletin, Vol. IX, p. 63.
One of the ten specimens is of unsplit Spanish dagger (Yucca
trecullana Cart). Six are of split Spanish dagger. Three are of
either yucca (locally known as soap weed) or of bear grass. Two
of the sandals have complete tie-strings of split Spanish dagger, and
one has a tie-string of split yucca.
Flint
Only two flint artifacts have been found in McKenzie Cave or the
other caves in the immediate vicinity. Unfortunately neither speci-

men is shown in Plate 6, Figure 6. Both are knives. One is of
white chert, 8.3 c.m. long and 3.5 c.m. wide, and is leaf shaped.
The other is of grey chert, 9.9 c.m. long and 4.5 c.m. wide with a
thickness of 7 ram, and has a pear shape.
The other specimens shown in Plate 6, Figure 6 are from surface
sites in the McKenzie Cave area. They may or may not have an
association with the cave cultures.
Pottery
The eight pot sherds shown in the second row from the top of
Plate 6, Figure 6 came from a surface site on Tunis Creek some
three miles northwest of McKenzie Cave. Five of the sherds are
from the same pot, apparently of a thick Plains ware. Another,
the fourth from the left, is thin ware, without a slip, but polished
on the outside. The third sherd from the left is a Pueblo black on
white ware, probably a trade item. The seventh from the left is
also of Pueblo origin, and is both painted and incised. As in the
case of the flint mentioned above, there is no association between
any of the~ sherds and the adjacent cave cultures.
Fire Sticks
Two fire, or hearth sticks, and one fire drill, shown in the center
of Plate 7, Figure 1, are like those reported by Smith from Hard
Rock Shelter near Alpine, by Jackson from Val Verde County and
Culberson County,.and by the writer from Murrah Cave.
ShaJts
One stick with a tenon-like end, measuring 11.4 c.m. long and
5 mm wide with a fork on the other end, came from McKenzie
Cave. It is shown in Plate 7, Figure 1, third item from the left,
top row. A gum-like substance on the tenon end indicates that
another shaft or other object had been bound to the shaft. Jackson
shows four such sticks in Figure 28, p. 122 of his report on a Prehistoric Rock Shelter in Val Verde County. Coffin reported similar
sticks from Brewster County.
Two shafts, measuring 24.6 and 52 cm in length respectively, and
1.2 c.m. in diameter, apparently of button willow are shown in
Plate 7, Figure 1.

One shaft fragment of a reed, locally known as tule measures
9 mm in diameter and 11.1 cm long. One end has been burned,
so that the original length and use of the shaft cannot be determined.
Tule grass still grows along Tunis Creek.
Burials
Two burials were revealed by erosion on Tunis Creek approximately three miles north of McKenzie Cave. The skulls are shown
in Plate 7, Figures 2 and 3. The skeletons were approximately
of the same height, the fe~nurs measuring 44. cm. There was nothing to indicate a relationship of the burials with the caves.
Cordage and Knots

Eighty-nine specimens of cordage and knots ca~ne from McKenzie
Cave. Materials used consist of Agave Lechuguilla, Spanish dagger, yucca, sotol, algoe, and bear grass. Some of the specimens are
made from the twisted fiber, and some are of split leaves. The
specimens are similar in materials, and construction to cordage and
knots reported by Jackson, Smith, Coffin, and Martin from caves
in the area extending from the Pecos on the east to E1 Paso on the
west. No attempt is made here to analyze or describe in detail the
McKenzie cave specimens. They are shown in Plate 8.
Conclusions
The evidence from McKenzie Cave and other nearby sites indicates that the culture is typically Big Bend Cave Dweller. Nothing
was found which would cause one to believe that McKenzie Cave
was occupied in historic times. There was considerable evidence of
wind erosion on the ceiling of the cave. Considering the amount
and rate of erosion, we arrived at a rough estimate that it had been
four hundred years since the cave was last occupied. This would
place occupation within the time range of Jackson’s Culberson
County caves. Jackson, basing his conclusion upon the occurrence
of pottery of known horizon, placed the occupation of his sites at
between 1300 and 1600.

A GREENSTONE HEAD FROM TRAVIS
COUNTY, TEXAS
CARL C i~I ELF

In 1939 while searching for campsites in the Colorado river valley
in Travis County, Texas, the writer found a small greenstone head
similar to some of those found in southern Mexico. Had this object
been brought to the museum, no importance would have been attached to its finding because one could be relatively sure that some
tourist had obtained it in Mexico. However, the archaeology of the
camp will show that its occurrence is hardly more rare than other
objects that have been found in similar sites.
For a time it appeared as if this site would be flooded by impounded water of Marshall Ford dam before it could be excavated,
but fortunately, the Department of Anthropology of The University
of Texas, in cooperation with the Work Progress Administration,
was able to work the area thoroughly. An additional greenstone
object was found during the course of excavation. The complete
results of their work is to be published soon.
The campsite contains two burnt-rock mounds composed of fistsized pebbles of Cretaceous limestone, occasional bone, flint, and
other typical refuse. These mounds as de~ribed by Pearce1 and
Saylese cover the entire Edwards Plateau of Texas. Evidence points
to several phases and early and late stages of occupancy. Essentially all phases and stages of the burnt-rock mound cultures are
characterized by the lack of pottery, the occurrence of large projectile points, and non-existence of keel-back scrapers.
However, a few burnt-rock mounds, by virtue of their proximity
to permanent water, probably were occupied later by a group using

pottery. The area covered by the pottery using groups has been
defined by Sayles~ as Wichita. This region, larger than the mound
area itself, extegds over a large belt roughly two hundred miles
wide across Texas from the Caddoan speaking region to the Rio
Grande and probably into Mexico.

Whether a hiatus of magnitude exists between the upper burntrock mound stages and the Wichita is not known from present data,
but dateable pottery has been found in these sites,z~ Patination is
considered to be of importance to some, and, as such, a hiatus
could be postulated on such grounds. Wichita groups often reworked flints of burnt-rock mound cultures. The reworked pieces
frequently show that ~nuch alteration had taken place before the
artifact was retouched. No studies have been made on the rate of
patination of Edwards flints in different regions of Texas so this
cannot be seriously considered as proof of a definite break between
non-pottery and pottery using groups. The Inost obvious differences are reflected in the entirely different complex of artifacts.
The Wichita is characterized by bevelled, double-pointed knives,
small triangular and stemmed projectiles, a thin buff pottery, occasional sherds of typical Caddoan area wares, and probably Texas
Coast pottery. Obsidian chips, but rarely artifacts, are found. This
material was certainly obtaiued from the westernmost portion of
Texas or New Mexico. A few marine shells from the Pacific Coast
have also been found, but they are rare. It is with this assemblage
of material traits that the greenstone head is believed to belong
rather than to the nompottery burnt-rock mounds at this site. This
is assumed to be true, but the material has been badly mixed dow’n
to plow depth. The Texas Memorial Museum collection from this
site is represented by surface finds alone.
The material of which the greenstone head is made is a dark green
porphyry. The occasional phenocrysts are lighter than the fine
groundmass. It is not a native Texas stone. According to Dr.
George Vaillant~ and Dr. J. Alden Mason,6 the material resembles
porphyries used in the states of Puebla and Vera Cruz. They are
also of the opinion that the appearance of the specimen suggests a
southern Mexican origin, possibly Guerrero. Dr. Vaillant points

out the resemblance to a poor or preliminary stage in the making
of a tiger-face mask. Both agree that it is a piece which does not
speak readily for itselL Their opinions support the contention that
it is definitely from Mexico. The specimen is not fraudulent, and
is surely not of recent origin.
The low relief of the face is hardly recognizable in ordinary light.
The eyes and mouth are left as raised prominences similar to peckedpebble heads from New Mexico and Chihuahua. Of interest are the
rather prominent ridges left on each side of the face, covering the
cheek and jaw areas. If these were intended to repre~nt the cheeks
alone, it appears that they would have extended only over the cheek
areas. Another feature is a shallow conical hole made by a drill
in the forehead region. This might possibly have been a later attempt to drill the head for suspension, but it was never completed.
This object is one of several sKowing a Mexican origin or influence
which have been found in Texas in recent years, but little attention
has been given to any of them.

also contains several interesting groups of Indian petroglyphs.
Through the persistent research of Dr. Cyrus N. Ray1 and others,
it has been demonstrated that several cultures of the region, the
Abilene and the Clear Fork in particular, date back to about the
time of Folsom man in America--perhaps to late Pleistocene time.~z
In view of these facts it seems worthwhile to carefully examine the
petroglyphs of the region for indications of age, and if possible to
uncover evidence that might link them with these very old cultures.
Champion Creek Petroglyphs
The first petroglyphs examined in this region are on Champion
Creek in Nolan County located three miles east of the Mitchell
County line. The group consists of about a dozen simple designs
including the picture of a man and a turtle (Plate 10, No. 1). The
outlines apparently were rubbed into the top surface of the sandstone
which outcrops level with the ground on the south side of the creek.
The grooves are about one-eight of an inch in width and, in most
ca~s, very ~allow. One unusual design was found on a similar
sandstone about half a mile down the creek from the main group.
It seems to be a conventionalized man formed by a series of pits
pecked into the stone (Plate 10, No. 1, d). The fig-ure is eighteen
inches high. It does not appear to be very old.
In the same rocks on which the petroglyphs were carved are many
deep mortar holes, chiefly of the boat shaped variety. But since
there are many large groups of similar mortar holes cut in the bedrocks of. sites in the district containing no petroglyphs, the association seems to be accidental. Very good evidence was found that
the rocks into which the mortars were cut had weathered down an
inch or even more since the mortars were made.3 This, of course,
would have destroyed any lightly cut petroglyphs made at the time

of the mortars.

It seems evident then that, although there is no evi-

dence of white contact, these petroglyphs are quite recent.
The Browns[ield Petroglyphs
The site which was next examined is a small shelter on the V. M.
Brownsfield ranch in Nolan County about five miles northeast of
Nolan. Here the petroglyphs were lightly scratched into the smooth
surface of the limestone in the back of the shelter; and, unfortunately, they have since been almost completely obliterated by names,
dates, and scratches made on the rocks by recent vandals. It was
found necessary to consult photographsz~ of the designs made before
they had been mutilated, in order to clearly distinguish the Indian
designs from the recent markings*.
However, an accurate copy
was obtained and the pictures, consisting of four slender, squareshouldered men about eight inches high, and a few indistinct designs,
proved to be exceptionally interesting (Plate 10, No. 2).
Square-Shouldered Men Like Basket-Maker Pictures
The same scratchy technique is found at several sites in South
Texas; but pictures of square-shouldered men like these, resembling
the true Basket-Maker pictures in Arizona5 and the Val Verde Dry
Shelter, or Texas Basket-Maker pictures in Val Verde County,6
have not been reported from any other petroglyph site in Texas.
The similarity between these petroglyphs and file typical anthropomorphic man of the Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture is remarkable
in view of the fact that the one is scratched into the rock while the
other is painted on it, and that 200 miles separate the sites.
Points o] Similarity to Val Verde Dry Sheher Pictures
Let us list the points of similarity:
1.

The four human figures among the Brownsfield petroglyphs

*Note:
At the I~rownsfield site there are severM strata of charcoal.
The deeper
one is separated by a thick sterile rock deposit from the shallower deposits,
Perhaps
the older stratum may date with the pictures or it may not.

are slender and broad-shouldered like the typica! Val Verde Dry
Shelter man found only in Val Verde County.
2. Both hav.e upraised hands; but the arms of the Brownsfield
man are bent at a sharp angle while those of the Dry Shelter men
are either straight or curved upward.
3. The head-dress on Brownsfield man "b" (Plate 10, No. 2, b)
is quite like the head-dress on certain Dry Shelter men.
4. On the right wrist of the same Brownsfield man is an ornament almost identical with ornaments usually worn on the right
wrist of the typical Dry Shelter men.
5. The left hand of this man holds an arrow quite like the one
or more arrows usually held in the left hand of the Dry Shelter men.
Also, Brownsfield man "c" holds a line in his left hand, probably
representing an arrow. The Dry Shelter men frequently hold similar lines.
6.

Crossed in front of Brownsfield man "b" are two staffs, and

to the left of them is another, all of which are almost identical to
staffs held by the Dry Shelter men. Brownsfield man "e" holds a
similar staff in his right hand. All of these staffs, however, point
downward while the Dry Shelter staffs almost always point upward.

7. To the left of Brownsfield man "b" are a slender triangle,
probably all that remains of another square-shouldered figure, and
two fringed objects not unlike many fringed objects among the
Dry Shelter pictures.
8. While we were copying the petroglyphs, one of the party,
W. C. Fields, discovered a coiled basket7 and seven cut straws in
association with a burial in the Brownsfield shelter.8 Since material
of this kind is common in the Dry Shelters of Val Verde County
and has never been found at another site in North-Central Texas,
the similarity of the pictures is emphasized.
Although the similarity between the Brownsfield petroglyphs and
the Val Verde Dry Shelter pictures seems too great to be explained

away as accidental, it must be admitted that important differences
exist which make it difficult to believe that the petroglyphs were
actually made by Val Verde Cave Dwellers. Chief of these is the
fact that the Val Verde Cave Dwellers are not known to have ever
made petroglyphs, although there are more than fifty sites of their
pictographs in Val Verde County. The detail of the robes on the
Brownsfield figures is unlike any found in the Dry Shelter pictures.
And also, the seven red negative hand prints in the Brownsfield
shelter are a point of difference, since the Dry Shelter people never
made hand prints of any kind. These, however, may not have been
made by the Indians responsible for the petroglyphs.
The limited material at this site hardly justifies more than a suggestion that there nlay be some relationship between this shelter and
the dry shelters in Val Verde County. But until more examples
of the Brownsfield petroglyphs are found this relationship will
probably remain a mystery.
The Fort Chadbourne Petroglyphs

Still another type of petroglyphs in North-Central Texas was
reported by E. B. Sayles9 in the 1930 Annual Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society. At that time Sayles
found two sites of this culture, one in Taylor County and another in
Coke County; but only the larger site in Coke County was described
in the report. This site is on the sandstone walls of a cave on the
bank of a creek near the site of old Fort Chadbourne. In the fall
of 1940 a third and more extensive site containing this same type of
petroglyphs was discovered about two miles west of the town of
Fo~’t Chadbourne by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray. In April, 1941, the writer
and his wife accompanied by Dr. Ray, examined and made accurate
copies of the petroglyphs there (Plate 11; Plate 12, No. 1). Most
of the pictures at the site are under shallow shelters near the top of
a small mesa; three small designs are on boulders at the foot of the
hill.

The Designs Resemble Abrading Marks
The designs, resembling abrading marks, are deeply rubbed into
the standstone .walls of the shelters, in some cases, to a depth of
about one inch. Most of the grooves are about three-fourths of an
inch wide and exhibit a round bottom; a few are V shaped. They
are clo~ly spaced and most of them are perpendicular to the floor
of the shelter. A few branch out from larger grooves like limbs from
a tree. Three or four were cut across the perpendicular grooves at
right angles. Shallow zig-zag lines were cut between a few of the
larger grooves. Only one small circle and a very few curves were
found among the many straight lines.
Whether these petroglyphs resulted from the sharpening of tools
on the shelter walls or were made for some other purpose cannot be
definitely determined. It is certain, however, that some of the
grooves were added solely for the sake of design, which clearly distinguishes these petroglyphs from so called abrading marks, and
gives them a distinctive character easily distinguished from other
types.
Evidence o] Age
Most of the designs in the cave near old Fort Chadbourne have
been well protected from the elements and although they look old,
they show very little weatheringlO; however, the best protected
designs at the site west of Fort Chadbourne are considerably weathered. About half of the designs are exposed to blowing rains and
are almost entirely weathered away although they must have been
an inch deep originally. The shallow lines added for decoration,
if they ever existed, are completely gone. A few fragments of the
cliff containing the designs have split off and fallen down the talus.
A third site containing Fort Chadbourne type petroglyphs is
located a few miles south of Merkel in Taylor County. This is the
Taylor County site discovered by Sayles. Here the petroglyphs are
located on the back wall of a small shelter near the top of a large
mesa. They consist of only a few short grooves crossed in one
place by a horizontal line, but lacking the shallow decoration lines
found at the other sites (Plate 12, No. 2). Although they are well
protected from the elements, the lines appear to be old and weathered:
10.

The cave near old Fort Chadbourne was completely excavated by
E. B. Sayles in 1930, but nothing indicating extreme age was reported. The Taylor County shelter was also excavated by Sayles
hut nothing was found that sheds light on the age of the petroglyphs.11
Ancient Camps Surround the Sites
The site west of Fort Chadbourne has little or no midden in the
shelters; however, there is an extensive surface camp around and
on top of the mesa. This camp has yielded various kinds of Clear
Fork artifacts~ as well as one fragment of a channeled point found
on the north side of the same mountain. Clear Fork material has
also been found on a surface camp on the hill above the cave near
old Fort Chadbourne. And Folsom and Yuma points as well as
Clear Fork artifacts have been found on a camp at the base of
tile mesa just below the shelter 11~ Taylor County.
But no way has yet been found to connect the petroglyphs with
the artifacts made by the same Indians and lost on the adjoining
camps. Whether the Fort Chadbourne petroglyphs are the work of
the Clear Fork people as has been suggested, or a much later cu!ture, remains to be demonstrated.
Petroglyphs by Late lndians
There are, however, a few designs on the ceiling of the deepest
sheher at the site west of Fort Chadbourne which definitely are not
of the Fort Chadbourne type. They consist of three human figures,
m~merous cross marks, and various other simple elements, lightly
scratched or rubbed into the surface of the rock (Plate 12, No. 1,
a and b). They are unquestionably the work of Indians, but appear
almost as recent as certain names and initials on the same rock. They

resemble other simple carved and painted pictures in various parts
of the state and are probably the work of roving bands of Plains
Indians in early historic time.~*
It is interesting to study the various types of Indian pictures in
different parts of the state and, when possible, to determine their
relationship and age sequence. And they should be described and
illustrated in scientific literature; but the chances of arriving at
an accurate age or proving a definite connection with a particular
type of artifact is indeed very remote, except perhaps, at a very few
sites in the State.

There is an extensive covered site of the Clear Fork Culture
which is now eroding from gravel and red silt in a large valley floor between the
mountains immediately to the north of this site.
There is a Clear Fork si~e on the

On the shelf at the west side of the mountain is a campsite which probably was occupied by more recent Indians but no signs occur there of
historic occupation.

Infant Burial in Ca~’yb~g Basket

INFANT BURIAL IN CARRYING BASKET
B~ E. B. S-,tY~.Es
While making a survey of Texas, in 1932-33 for Gila Pueblo,
several sites were investigated in the Rustler Hill Region, about 40
miles northwest of Toyah. In one of these an infant burial was
found, which is now de~ribed with the permission of the director
of Gila Pueblo.
The site is a typical sink-hole shelter, formed by water carrying
away the gypsum strata which underlie the surface limestone.1 The
latter, being more resistant, forms a dome; the ceiling eventually
falls, which leaves a cave with an overhanging encircling rim.
These sites were generally occupied by prehistoric man, the camp
debris being preserved where moisture had not touched it, although
much of the human debris of every site investigated by this writer
had been burned. This was true of this site.
The principal part of the sink-hole occupied was that directly
beneath the opening, where hearth stones were abundant.

This was

reached from the surface by a slope, where drainage into the cave
had built up a talus covering the bed rock which formed the principal living area, and which was about 20 feet below the outside
ground level. On each side of this living area the overhanging rim
provided protection; opposite to the entrance slope was an extension of the sink-hole, semi-dark, ending in a small sink into which
the surface water disappeared, after draining along each side of the
main part of the shelter.

This semi-dark extension of the cave was on a general level about
15 feet lower than the living area, which was limited by the sheer
drop in the bed rock to the lower part of the cave. Debris had
accumulated mainly in the lower level and had formed a talus extending from the living area to the lower space.
The site had had a great deal of occupation as evidenced by sotolpits on the outside, round mortar holes in the exposed limestone of
the rim adjoining the cave; also by numerous pictographs covering
1. Similar sites in the same area have been investigated and described by Jackson,
~. T., 1937, pp. 146-192.

parts of the walls of the shelter, but particularly by the accumulation of refuse in the cave itself. This extended from beneath the
overhanging rim, where it was protected from moisture, a width of
about 60 feet, and to a like distance into the darker part of the cave.
The deepest part of this refuse was where it joined the living
area; that is, along the face of the bed rock, where it dipped to the
lower part of the cave. Here the trash was 7 to 8 feet deep, and
from here it sloped, becoming thinner, until it joined the guano
which covered the floor of the darker part of the cave.
The basket had been buried near the face of the bed rock, where
it dipped into the lower part of the cave. The antelope skin covering the basket was at a depth of 4 feet, 6 inches below the surface.

The basket rested upright in an excavation made for it through several very compact strata. The topmost one was of rotted fiber,
followed by dust and stone, then a thicker deposit of rotted fiber,
underlain by one of loose, burnt fiber and stone; then rotted fiber
resting on the guano. The overlying deposits .were quite different.
At the surface of the midden was about a foot of loose sticks with
but few artifacts. Beneath this was a single deposit of rather irregular layers of fiber, ash, dust and burnt stone, containing potsherds
identified with E1 Paso Polycbrome and associated wares,z The
underlying deposits, in which the excavation for the burial had
been made, contained no pottery.
The cultural remains have been analyzed as Hueco Cave Dweller,3
a period of the Texas Cave Dweller, in which pottery was present,
probably intrusive, in the latest stage, but which lacked pottery in
earlier stages. Other than tiffs difference in the presence of pottery
in the last stage, trait differences have not been established.
There is every indication that there were earlier stages of the
Hueeo Cave Dweller than those defined with pottery.

Howard has

found, in the Guadalupe Mountains to the north, certain extinct
fauna associated with artifacts in deposits underlying what appear
to be typical Basket Maker II artifacts,z~ At another site identified
with this culture, the writer found the radius and mandible of Tetra~neryx.5 The Conkling Cave,6 with various extinct species in association with man, is also in the same region.

There is sufficient

evidence that man was in the area identified with the Hueco Cave
Dweller at a fairly early time, as measured by American archaeology.
There is no evidence as to how early the Hueeo Cave
Dweller may have been, but we can assign an estimated date of
about !.I00-1.300

A. D. to the pottery that overlies this burial.

This date probably also represents the last stage of the culture.
The culture, as now known, is cotnparable to that of other Texas
Cave Dwellers in many respects, differing mainly in the presence
of pottery in the last stage, varied sandal forms, and particularly

in the absence of many traits which characterize other periods of
Texas Cave Dwellers. It would, however, appear to belong to that

limited to the Four Corners area, while the Texas pattern has been

bundle, but without a basket container,e The motive is probably
the same, but the particular custom found here is more suggestive of
that in the Basket Maker-Pueblo area, to the west, where child
burial is frequently made in a cradle.9
Other western connections are suggested in the presence of the
olivella shells (from the Gulf of California, or Pacific), probably
in the cotton, the "prayer" sticks, the bull-roarer, and the carrying
basket. The latter is known to have been used both by the Apache
and Pima during historical times.1 o
Dog remains are common as bones but other remains of this domesticated animal from prehistoric times are not common.11
The rabbit fur blanket and the twined mat are typical of the Texas
Cave Dweller.
The hank of human hair seems evidence of the rather widespread
custom of cutting off the hair as a sign of mourning. Further evidence of this sacrifice seems to be indicated by all the objects, as
they unquestionably represented a great deal of wealth.

POTTERY TYPES FROM THE BELCHER
MOUND SITE
BY C. H. WE~B AND MONROE DODD, Jm
Our report1 of last year concerning house types among the Caddo
Indians featured the description of five hou~ floors from the
Belcher mound site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. Four of these
were immediately superimposed on separate levels of the stratified
Mound B and, as mentioned in the previous report, a study of the
sherds from the four levels showed distinct differences in the potteries. This evidence of pottery sequence, in addition to a correlation of types among the whole vessels from the burial pits and house
floors, forms the basis of this report on pottery from the Belcher
site.
The existing cla..~ifications of pottery and other culture traits in
the historic Caddo area are admittedly incomplete, occasioned by
the paucity of careful excavations and complete area studies.
Moore’s2 extensive collections from the Red and 0uachita River
valleys, instructive in affording a broad survey of regional artifact
types, give little help in differentiation of these types.

The same

objection obtains for Harrington’sa study in Southwest Arkansas,
since he groups everything in the area as Caddo, although subtypes
of the Caddo material--and probably some non-Caddo--are evident
in the report. V~\alker’s4 report of the Natchitoches site, nseful in
linking the engraved wares with the historic Caddo, was minimized
by the destruction of much of the site before he arrived, leaving
little material for study. Ford’s5 tentative classification of Caddo
~pottery types of Louisiana is based chiefly on surface collections
and, admittedly, must await the results of numerous excavations
before it can be stabilized. Jackson6 considered the pottery of East
Texas, including the areas of the historic Caddo and related Asinai,
as well as prehistoric sites, to be fairly uniform, with some significant differences related geographically to the four principal river
basins.

Goldschmidt7 suggested a chronological sequence of Caddo types
in East Texas, chiefly on the basis of intrusive burial pits. Multiple
pottery placements and the presence of engraved wares characterized
the more recent burials. Lemley and Dickinson’sa report of the

PoStery Types From She Belcher Mound SiSe

89

Crenshaw site is important in definitely establishing a pre-Caddo
(Cole’s Creek) culture, and subsequently9 they pointed out the indications in Southwest Arkansas of an intrusion of engraved Caddo
wares into an’indigenous widespread incised-ware culture. Swantonlo indicates historic evidence for a post-DeSoto migration of a
Caddo people down Red River Valley from Southwest Arkansas
coming into an area already well populated with Caddo tribes.
Current excavations in East Texas and Oklahoma may throw further
light on culture sequences and relationships in this area.
Since our previous report, the four-foot fill separating house floors
V and VI, immediately superimposed on the plateau north of Mound
B, has been almost completely removed. Six burials below floor V
have yielded 62 whole vessels and four other vessels from floor VI
have been reconstructed. The addition of this material to the vessels
from Mound B gives a total of 163 whole vessels from burials and
house floors for our study. Table 2 shows the origin of these vessels.
Table 3 gives the summary of 5100 sherds from the four levels of
Mound B, in addition to which our pottery typing is enhanced by
numerous sherds from floors V and VI and from the surface for a
half-mile downstream. It ~nay be mentioned that the separation of
the pottery-bearing floor levels of Mound B by 2 to 3 feet of almost
sterile sand fill facilitated the sherd collection, and as each floor was
carefully troweled, we believe that comparatively few sherds were
missed.
There may be some objection to a grouping of house floor sherds
and burial vessels for classification, since some tribes made special
funerary wares. At the Belcher site, vessel types from burials without exception have sherd representation from the floor collections
and from the surface of the village site downstream. Furthermore,
many of the vessels from burial pits showed marks of usage, including old breaks from the lips or necks and soot on the culinary
wares, indicating that burial placements were chosen from previously made and used pottery. The relative frequency of ornate
and unusual forms among the burial placements indicates selectivity
in the choice of these vessels, but there is no particular evidence of
a specialized funerary ware.
To date, no Europema trade objects have been found, although the
cultivated surface layer yields comparatively recent objects. Ap-

l~arently the site was deserted before contact with Natehitoches,
(1717) or other trading centers, was established.
Type 1---Belcher Engraved
Caddo pottery apparently reached its peak in the development of
the engraved wares, with variegated vessel shapes, polished surfaces
and complex curvilinear designs engraved after firing, with pigments impressed into the lines. At the Belcher site, this type flourished during the last two phases of occupation.
The paste is predominantly clay with occasional shell or tufa,
tempered, fine textured, usually having black or brown core and a
smooth surface slip, more frequently black or mahogany, although
buff to reddish brown surfaces appear. Differential firing is frequent. Inner surfaces are smooth, outer surfaces smooth and often
polished.
Fracture patterns indicate coil technique. Hardness
ranges from 2 to 2.5.
Reference to Table 1 shows that a number of decoration techniques and elements were used, engraving, pigment bnpresslon and
spurred lines being the more frequent. Decoration patterns are
varied, usually featuring curvilinear designs, with scrolls, interlocking scrolls, concentric circles, semicircles in festoons and arches,
spirals and meanders all represented. Discs, ovals and bands often
appear in negative relief, outlined by lines, arcs or circles. These
patterns may appear in fields or units and are most frequently
repeated 4 times around the vessel, although division of the vessel
circumference into 3, 5 and 2 units occurs in this order of frequency.

Pottery Types Fro~ the Belcher Mound Site

91

Subtype a: Shallow bowls (Plate 15, No, 1), 10 to 28 cm. diameter, with flat bases (all ba~s at this site are circular), angulatecl
shoulders and f.laring rims. Four nodes project from the shoulder,
outlined by two to four diagonal lines, with the intervening shoulder
space bisected by an interrupted horizontal or slightly diagonal line,
The shoulder angle between the nodes is notched. A horizontal
plain or spurred line and a parallel row of triangular punctates encircle the rim. White pigment appears in the lines. Paste is nearly
always hlack or chocolate throughout and is fine textured, with clay
temper in all except one vessel, which is shell teInpered.
Subtype b: Flat bowls (Plate 15, No. 2), tl to 26 can. diameter,
with convex bases, incurving narrow rims and rounded lips from
which four nodes project upward. A narrow band of decoration on
the rim is divided into four fields by vertical arcs below the nodes,
the arcs enclosing an oval in which appear interlocking arcs. Each
larger field contains flattened S figures, sometimes conventionalized
into a zig-zag, in negative relief, outlined above and below by engraved arcs forming small discs. Pigment in lines is white.
Subtype c: Shallow basins (Plate 15, No. 4), 11 to 26.5 cm.
wide, bases usually convex, rims taller than previous forms and
ahnost vertical. Decoration band on outer rim, with horizontal
lines (plain, spurred or narrow hachured bands) combined with
vertical arcs to produce flattened horizontal-L or fish-hook figures.
"Vertical arcs divide the decoration band into 2 or 4 segments. Red
pigment in lines.
Subtype d: Slightly deeper bowls (Plate 15, No. 3), 12.5 to 21
cm. diameter, with convex and almost hemispherical base, strongly
insloping rims and rounded lips. Vessel walls thin, averaging 3.5
ram. Four of the twelve vessels have trailed curvilinear designs
of concentric circles, spirals or interlocking scrolls over the base, in
addition to the rim decoration. The rims have a band of decoration
units, 2 to 4. around the vessel, with a figure similar to the horizontal-S of subtype b, outlined by reticulated fields, closely placed
lines or upright arcs. The flat-S figure sometimes is conjoined in a
series of 2 or 3, at tbnes having a geniculate appearance. It is possible that all of the horizontal-L and S figures are flattened conventionalizations of the interlocking ~roll prevalent in the engraved
wares of Type 1. Red pigment in lines of 2 vessels, white in 1.

92

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Subtype e: Shallow bowls with high vertical rims and direct or
slightly everted lips. Color buff or brown, paste slightly coarser
than previous four subtypes, and no shell tempering is seen. Decorated with curvilinear lines, often cross-hatched bands or spurred
lines, forming semicircles, circles and scrolls. Diagonal rim notching on one sherd. Lines do not contain pigment. Subtype e is the
bowl type for the fourth or deepest occupation level and no whole
vessels were found.
Subtype ]: Semiglobular bowls with widely flaring rims (inverted helmet, Plate 15, No. 5), 9.5 to 15 cm. wide at lip. Bases
convex, lips thinned and, in four instances, notched. Body and rim
decorated over outer surface, the former having interlocking scrolls
outlined by meanders, the rims having semicircles or rounded chevrons, either as concentric festoons from the lip or arches from the
shoulder. One vessel has concentric circles instead of scrolls on
the body. White pigment in lines.
Subtype g: Small bowls (Plate 15, No. 7), with insloping wide
shoulders and flaring narrow rims. Three vessels have 4 equidistant
nodes projecting upward from the lip. Decoration on outer shoulder area of concentric arches formed by spurred lines and punctated
bands, or of inter-l~)cking scrolls encircling the shoulder. One
vessel has two parallel horizontal lines across the shoulder, with
tent-like triangular projections from the lines. Either white or red
pigment. Shell tempering, an addition to the clay, appears in 5 of
9 vessels, tufa in 2.
Subtype h: Conical bowls with flat base, straight side walls and
rounded lips. Decoration on 5 separate fields covering the entire
outer wall, of interlocking scrolls outlined by plain or spurred lines,
the background filled with small circles. Only I whole vessel and
a few sherds of this type were found.
Subtype i: Vase forms (Plate 15, No. 6), with modified globular
bodies and high vertical rims, the total height 13.5 to 16.5 cm. One
vessel has a yellow core revealed by engraved lines through the red
slip (black in areas due to irregular firing). Rims are decorated

with interlocking scrolls formed by plain and spurred lines and
outlined by fields of engraved circles containing negative discs.
2 to 4 suspensi.on holes are present on each side of the rim near the
lip. One vessel (from 4th floor burial) is thicker, made of coarser
paste, and has parallel lines encircling the rim, with a scroll pattern on the upper body. The other two vessels have undecorated
bodies.
Subtype j: Water bottles (Plate 16, No. 4) 14 to 20 cm. !figh,
with almost globular bodies, small flat base, cylindrical neck and
everted narrow rim. Surface brown to black; red or white pigment
used in lines. The design, four times repeated, consists of concentric circles formed by alternately continuous and interrupted
lines and surrounding a disc with projecting triangles, evidently
the sun symbol. All of these vessels are clay tempered.
Subtype k: Water bottles (Plate 16, No. 1) 15 to 23 cm. high,
with flattened bodies, cylindrical necks curving outward near the
lip and flat bases. Surface is mahogany to black in color and
highly polished. One bottle of this type is shell tempered, all others
clay. Decoration consists of meanders, scrolls or festoons of semicircles, using plain or spurred lines with red pigment insertions.
Two or three parallel lines encircle the shoulder area.
Subtype l: Water bottles (Plate 16, No. 2) with globular bodies,
small flat bases and bulging or biconical necks with flaring rims.
Decoration in four separate fields, of three discs in a vertical row,
separated and surrounded by fields containing concentric arcs, semicircles, interlocking scrolls or interlocking narrow bands. One
highly ornate vessel has stippled discs, hachured fields and spurred
line elements. The decoration includes the neck in this vessel. Another bottle of this type (Plate 16, No. 3) has tripod support. It is
shell tempered, all others clay.
Subtype m: Effigy vessels (Plate 16, Nos. 5, 6, 7), including a
land terrapin and two bird bowl effigies. The terrapin has bands
on each side with design elements like those on rims of Subtype c.
One bird bowl of shell tempered black ware has white pigment impressed into the three lines which encircle the body. The head is
conventionalized. The smaller bird effigy has a hollow head containing small pellets which rattle when shaken.

96

Subtype n: Compound vessels (Plate 16, Nos. 9, 10), in one instance combining a bowl of Subtype a, atop a globular body; in another instance a pot form made of yellow paste with a red slip
through which the design is engraved. The rim suggests a bowl of
Subtype d, seated on a globular body which has a scroll design.
Four suspension holes are opposed near the shoulder area.
Type 2

Foster Trailed-incised

Apparently coeval with the engraved wares at Belcher is a group
of several vessel forms in which trailed and heavily incised decorations appear consistently. Moore1 ~ illustrates a number of vessels
of this type from the Foster site on Red River in Southwest Arkansas,
and examples appear in numerous other collections from Red River
and Ouachita River sites.
The paste is similar to that of the engraved wares, clay tempered
with occasional tufa or shell; fine to medium fine textured and
usually firm. Hardness 2 to 2.5. Cores are usually brown to black,
occasionally buff; surface buff to brown with frequent differential
firing. Surfaces are smooth but seldom polished, with considerable
erosion in some of the small cup forms.
Decoration, usually over the entire outer surface, is produced by
firm, deep, U-shaped incisions and shallower, wider trailed lines.
Vase forms have secondary decoration of the tall rims with more
lightly incised lines and, in one instance, punctates. Fingernail
punctates occur on the lip of one ve~el and others have shallow lip
notching. Small teat-like nodes in groups of 3 project from the
center of concentric circle designs on some vessels.
Subtype a: Vases (Plate 17, No. 2) 7 to 14, cm. high, with semiglobular bodies, flat circular bases, and tall outcurving rims ending
in unthickened lips. The bodies have concentric circle and semicircle designs formed by deep U-shaped grooves, closely placed. The
central discs in four instances have teat-like nodes. Designs are
repeated 3 times on most vessels, 4 times on one. The rims bear
incised concentric arches, interlocking scrolls or hor{zontal bands
of diagonally incised lines. Punctated triangles appear on one rim.
Subtype b: Conical bowls, 13 cm. wide, who~ entire outer wall
is decorated with interlocking scrolls flanked by parallel meanders,
all formed by trailed lines. Transversely notched lip; flat circular

Pottery Types From the Belcher Mound Site

bottom on the outer surface of which appear three concentric trailed
circles.
Subtype c: ~Modified globular pots and cups (Plate 17, No. 3)
9 to 12 cm. wide, with narrow flaring rims and flat bases. The
paste is often soft and eroded badly. Decoration of vertical grooves
from rim to base, trailed or heavily incised, U-shaped and closely
placed to give a ribbed effect. Fingernail punctated arcs are present
on the outer rim surface of one vessel.
Subtype d: Modified jar and bottle forms (Plate 17, No. 1),
10 to 15 cm. high, two of which are elevated on flat cylindrical
pedestals. Pear-shaped bodies are decorated with incised or trailed
lines forming interlocking scrolls, parallel arcs or fishhook-like
parallel scrolls or volutes outlined by meanders. A field of punctates surrounds the shoulder areas. Necks and pedestals have parallel encircling lines. A globular vessel has trailed concentric circles,
a punctated field around the shoulder and a short ridged neck resembling a double pulley.
In addition to these subtypes, it is to be noted that both the engraved vessels of Type 1 and the stamped vessels of Type 3 have
instances of trailed and incised secondary designs.
Type 3

Belcher Stamped

A group of globular bowls (Plate 17, No. 5) found with the engraved and trailed wares in the late period burial pits and house
floors, has a characteristic stamped design on neck, body or both.
The paste is shell tempered, fine textured, hardness 2 to 3 with a
tendency to flake because of shell tempering. The core is gray to
mottled black, the surface predominantly brown, with areas of buff,
orange or black due to differential firing. Surface finish smooth,
sometimes moderately polished. Although found in burial pits,
these vessels were frequently coated with soot.
Decoration on the body wall includes courant spirals (10 instances), concentric circles (4 instances) and concentric diamonds
(1 instance), the designs repeated 4 or 5 times. Spirals are formed
by a band enclosed between trailed lines and roughened by dentate
rocker stamping, or by parallel light trailing. Concentric circles
and diamonds are formed by trailed lines. A neck band between

98

Texa~ Archeologizal and Paleontological Society

trailed lines is roughened by stamping as described above or by
vertical rows of punctates, possibly made with a dentate stamp.
The vessels are 12.5 to 20 cm. in diameter, with walls only 2 to 4
mm. thick. Bases are convex. A narrow flaring rim with thin lip
surmounts the decorated neck. A compound vessel (Plate 16, No.
8) combines three cups, each with stamped neck band and different
body design produced by trailing or roughened bands.
Moore illustrates vessels with stamped designs of this type from
the Friday place on Red River in Arkansas12 and from Old River
Landing on the lower Arkansas River.13
Type 4-~Belcher Plain
Undecorated vessels are comparatively few in number at this site,
only 10 whole vessels and less than half of the sherds (Table 3)
being plain. Although some variations occur, these plain vessels
and sherds can be divided into two general types, one predominating
on the last two occupation levels of Mound B, the other on the two
deepest levels. While undecorated portions of decorated vessels account for some of the characteristic sherds of each type, enough rim
sherds and entire vessels are present, showing the same differences,
to warrant separation of the two.
Type 4 Plain, associated with the engraved, trailed and ridged
wares of floor levels 1 and 2, is thinner, firmer and has smoother
surfaces than the plain sherds of the deeper levels. Coiling technique was used; the paste is usually fine and homogeneous, clay and
occasionally shell tempered with minor percentage of tufa or sand.
Some of the shell tempered sherds have a vacuolated appearance
from leaching of the shell (similar to Type 6). The core is most
often black in color, sometimes buff to brown; the surface is less
often black, many sherds with black core having buff, orange or
tan surfaces. Colored slips (yellow, orange or green) are sometimes seen. Both surfaces are smoothed, the outer sometimes moderately polished. Erosion has changed some of the-black surfaces

to a dingy chocolate color. Vessel shapes are uncertain, except for
the three subtypes described below.
Subtype a:

Black or chocolate colored sherds, with homogeneous

clay tempered core, probably are derived from the undecorated portions of Type 1 a flat bowls. They represent about one-third of
Type 4 sberds on floor 1, the last occupation level.
Subtype b:

Three entire vessels, one each from house floors II

and VI and a mcond level burial, have the shape of Type 1 ] (inverted helmet shape).

They are thin walled (3 to 4, ram.) with

convex bases, semiglobular bodies and straight flaring rims, 10 to 14
cm. wide at the lip. One has shallow transverse notching of the lip,
otherwise they are undecorated. The paste is homogeneous, dark,
clay tempered; the surfaces smooth but not polished.
of this type were found on levels 1 and 2.

A few sherds

Subtype c: Large, heavily fired o!las or jars (Plate 17, No. 6)
appear almost exclusively in the last two occupation levels. Sherds
from the ~cond level are thin for the vessel size, 5 to 6 ram., showing black cores and a firm light-colored coat or slip on each surface. These sherds are firm with hardness of 2 to 2.5, but not
overfired. Three entire vessels found broken on Floor I, and numerous other sherds from this level, are thicker, 5 to 10 ram. The
vessels are globular but often deformed in the lower segment, probably because o:[ the vessel weight before firing.
40 cm., heights 30 to 4,0 cm.

Diameters 35 to

The undecorated body is surmounted

by a comparatively small vertical neck which has a cambered or
slightly flaring rim. The neck may be plain or have a few irregularly incised horizontal lines.
The paste is clay or clay and tufa tempered, with slightly coarse
dark gray to black core.

Hardness ranges from 2 to ¢.

The sur-

face slip is yellow, buff, green, orange or light brown, showing differential firing. Inner surfaces are more frequently yellow or green
in color. The exterior is roughened by high firing temperature
which produced puffiness of the paste and this same high firing
makes the sherds quite hard, so that they emit a metallic sound when
struck.

Some of Type 4 c sherds are similar to Type 8 plain, except

for the overfiring.
Type 5--Belcher Ridged
The predominant type of culinary ware at this site, on all except

102

Texans Archeological a~l Paleontological Society

the oldest stratum, is the ovoid urn with ridged side walls. The
vessels (Plate 17, No. 7) are 16.5 to 33 cm. high, ovoid, with flat
bases. Rims flare outward, are usually narrow and rolled or cambered on first floor vessels, often wider on 2nd and 3rd floor sherds.
Walls may be only 3 to 4 ram. thick.
The paste is coiled; clay and shell are about equally represented
and tufa appears occasionally. The core is brown to black in most
instances, the surface buff to black with differential firing, and
often coated with soot. Hardness ranges from 2 to 3.
The outer surface is roughened by narrow vertical ridges, running from rim to base, spaced from 3 ram. to 1 cm. apart. These are
apparently produced by marking with a notched instrument or by
pushing up the clay on each side of troughs made with a roundtipped instrument. Fordt4 thought the ridges may have been made
by pinching or brushing between the fingers, and called this type
Finger Brushed, but generally the ridges are too closely placed for
fingers and fine regular vertical striations in the troughs indicate a
firmer molding tool with surface irregularities. The outer rim surface may have rough vertical, diagonal or horizontal incised lines.
One small tufa tempered vessel whose side wall is partially ridged,
has triangular flanges on the rim to give a squared orifice, with
small strap handles on two sides. This is the only vessel frora this
site which has handles.
Type 6--Belcher Brushed

Entire vessels of brushed ware are lacking, but numerous sherds
(Plate 18, Nos. 1, 2, 3) were found on the three upper levels, only
one on the fourth (Table 3). The brushed and ridged wares show
many similarities and possibly the ridged ware, found on many
sites in this area, is a local derivation of the more ubiquitous brushed
ware. The reverse may be true in this area, or they may have developed simultaneously.
The paste is shell, clay, tufa and grit tempered, and leaching of
the shell produces vacuoles. Texture is medium to coarse; the core
is usually black, occasionally buff or gray; the surface varies from
gray to black. Hardness 2 to 4, usually 2 to 2.5. Coil or strip
technique was used. The inner surface is smooth, the outer roughened by brushing. The lines vary from fine, closely placed brush-

Po~ery Types Frown ~he Belcher Mound S~e

103

ing to bolder marks approaching the incised. Random marking
occurs, although regular vertical or horizontal fields predominate.
Several sherds have oval nodes, with a suggestion of a row of
nodes separating brushed fields. Rims may be direct and unmodified, or rims similar to Type 5 Ridged ware may be found. Sherd
forms suggest urns, pots and vases. Thickness 4 to 9 ram.
Type 7--Smithport Incised-Punctate

This constitutes the predominant type (Plate 18, Nos. 4 to 17) of
pottery made by the first inhabitants of Mound B, persisting on the
third level and fading out in the upper levels (Table 3).
The sherd fractures suggest coil or strip technique. The paste is
predominantly clay tempered with occasional tufa or grit. Shell
tempering is absent. The texture is usually coarse, as compared
with the later wares, the hardness 2 to 3. The core is gray or buff
to mottled brown or black, the surface usually buff or gray. The
inner surface is smooth, showing tool marks; the outer surface occasionally smooth but often rough, eroded or crumbling.
The decoration consists predominandy of straight line incisions,
usually triangular lines made with a pointed tool, rarely trailed or
U-shaped, and occasionally "overhanging." Punctates were made
with the fingernail or a blunt-tipped instrument held at an angle.
The lines may be vertical, diagonal or horizontal (not curvilinear),
on rim or body. Alternating fields or herringbone patterns occur
(Plate 18, Nos. 8 and 9), sometimes separated by a row of punctates (Plate 18, No. 13). Rims are usually notched, transversely
or diagonally, in contrast to the later pottery in which lip notching
is comparatively infrequent.
Several vessels show fingernail punctation (Plate 18, Nos. 14 and
15), typical of Ford’s15 Wilkinson type fingernail punctate. Sherd
forms for Type 7 suggest open bowls of medium height with direct
rims or vase forms with flaring rims. Sherd thickness 5 to 9 ram.,
average 6 to 7 ram.
Type 8--Smithport Plain

The undecorated sherds from the deepest level (premound) have
much the same paste characteristics as Type 7. Clay tempering predominates, with some tufa and grit. The texture is moderately

104

Texas Archeological a~uZ Paleontological Society

coarse, with numerous small lumps of clay temper. The core is
gray or buff to brown, rarely black; the surface is more frequently
gray or buff--some sherds have a light colored outer surface, moderately smoothed, with a dark brown, mottled inner surface. Erosion
occurs frequently and many sherds are small because of the crumbly
quality of the paste.
Thickness ranges from 5 to 10 ram., the usual sherd being 6 to 8
ram. thick. With exception of Subtype a, vessel shapes and sizes are
uncertain.

Subtype a: Three water bottles (Plate 17, No. 4) from the level
4 burials, with ~veral bottle sherds from Floors II, Ill and IV, have
paste characteristics as described above, clay tempered and medium
textured. The core is tan to brown, the surface gray or light red
with brown or black areas. The surface is smooth but unpolished.
The walls are thicker (6 to 8 mm.) than other bottles in the polished
and engraved series.
Decoration is entirely lacking on two vessels and confined to 4
irregular lines around the shoulder of the third. The bottles are 17

superficial part of Mound A, as the pottery from all of these seems
quite uniform. These burials illustrate the custom among the latter
Caddos of abundant funerary placements, a total of 135 vesselz
in addition to other ornaments and artifacts~accompanying 17
burials. Two of these burials had no pottery accompanying them,
several with infants had only one or two vessels, while four pits
contained 14, 16, 21 and 33 pottery vessels.
In contrast, the two deep pits, originating between the 3rd and
4th levels of Mound B and containing 4 and 5 skeletons, had a total
of only 5 vessels, all placed above the heads. The vessels in the
top level pits were placed all around and on top of the bodies.
The premound surface (Level 4) shows a marked predominance
of Type 7 and 8 sherds, with complete absence of Types 2, 3 and 4 c.
Type I Engraved is represented only by the water bottle and the
open bowl, chiefly Type 1 e.
On level 3, although the incised-punctate wares persist, all other
types except the large olla appear suddenly. Brushed sherds are
infrequent, but Type 5 Ridged is almost as numerous as the earlier
incised type. The thick-walled, undecorated water bottle of Type 8 a
disappears above the 3rd level, being replaced by the thinner, polished and highly ornamented bottles of Type I Engraved. All subtypes of the engraved wares are not represented on the 3rd level,
but many are present, as well as the trailed and stamped.
As levels 2 and 1 are reached, the incised-punctate wares of Type
7 fade out. The ridged culinary vessel, Type 5, becomes the most
abundant, of the decorated sherds with Type 6 Brushed increasingly
frequent. The engraved wares are second in frequency on the surface layer. Surface collections from a number of sites in this area
indicate that engraved sherds and Type 5 Ridged sherds follow similar frequency distributions, although at some sites another type of
ridged ware is frequent, having broader notched vertical ridges with
bruslfing between the ridges.
The engraved subtypes which are more frequent at Belcher--the
open bowls (Type 1 a, c and d) and the water bottles, especially
Type 1 ] with concentric circle design and sun symbo!, are also the
most frequent examples of engraved ware in surface collections from
this entire area.

Discussion
As indicated in Table 4, various sites in the Red River Valley of
Northwest Louisiana show varying proportions of engraved-ridged
and incised-punctate wares. Smithport is in DeSoto Parish and
Wilkinson in Natchitoches Parish 40 and 50 miles south of Shreveport; Indian Hill and Pease Place are hillside sites, Vanceville and
Werner are mound sites in Bossier Parish, across Red River from
Shreveport.

Although it would be premature to outline definite cultural affinities for the several types of Belcher pottery, some similarities are
evident and suggest future study. The engraved, pigment-inserted,
polished vessels of Type 1, with effigy forms and a certain amount
of shell tempered ware, suggest close relationship to the Middle Mississippi horizon. Some similarities to the Moundville pottery of
Alabama are evident. In the Red and Ouachita River valleys of
this region, vessels of this general type are frequent. The engraved
vessels of the Natclfitoches site 4, and from Keno and Glendora
in the Ouachita basin (2) are similar in paste, general conception
and decoration, although not identical. Similar vessels are also
illustrated by Harrington (3), from the Southwest Arkansas area,
and by Jackson (6), from East Texas.
Vessels which are identical in form and decoration to a number
of the subtypes of Belcher Engraved were found by "Moore2 at the
McClure, Friday and Foster mound sites along the Red River in

Southern Arkansas, and other artifact types indicate cultural identity of these four sites.
It is interesting to speculate on the origin of several decorative
elements in Type 1 Engraved wares. The interlocking scroll with
its variants is probably the most frequent design motif in this type.
Its use seems to be rather widespread on both Southeast and Southwest pottery (Mesa Verde for example), also in Mexican pottery.
The spurred line which appears so often on Belcher Engraved and
engraved wares from other Caddo sites does not appear elsewhere
in the Southweast or Mississippi Valley area, so far as I can ascertain, but does appear early in the Southwest (Mesa Verde, Mimbres)
and again in Central Mexico (Toltec). One is struck, on visiting the
National Museum in Mexico City, by the similarities in form, design
motifs and elements between the potteries of Central Mexico and the
Caddo area of Louisiana and Arkansas. For example, the angulated-shouldered bowl of Subtype 1 a at Belcher, unique in the
United States area, is frequently duplicated in the Mexican potteries, even having the same four nodes projecting from the shoulder
angle. Efforts to demonstrate definite evidence of a direct link between the two areas have so far been futile, but future study may
do so.
Type 2 Trtffled.lnclsed and Type 3 Stamped, also found in one or
more of the above mentioned three sites on Red River, suggest a
carry-over of certain decorative features of the Mid-Louisiana Marksville pottery. The deep U-shaped vertical and concentric circle incised decorations of Type 2 may be compared with the Marksville
Incised (Figs. 35-36) of Ford and Willey’sl 5 report of the Crooks
site. Similarly, the alteration of roughened bands and smooth
fields, and the roughening of bands by rocker stamping with a dentate stamp, indicate a trait inheritance from Marksville Stamped16
(Figs. 28-34, Crooks report) by Belcher Stamped. Vessel shapes,
tempering and other paste characteristics are entirely dissimilar.
The large olla of Type 4 c is an interesting late development at
this site, apparently representing the result of experimentation with
higher firing temperatures. A few sherds of this type and of Type 1
bowls found on level 2 of Mound B show the effect of this high
firing temperature which made them lighter yet firmer, producing
the metallic ring when struck. Puffiness and cracking of the slip

114

resulted and in some instances grotesque twisting of the vessel
occurred. On the top level many more of these sherds were found,
and at least three large ollas of several gallons capacity were suecessfully made. The shape suggests that they were used for grain
storage. Similarly fired vessels, sometimes cracked in the process,
having been found near the Spiro site in Oklahoma.18
Type 6 Belcher Brushed shows some similarities to the ~lnna
Brushed15 of the Mississippi Valley and to Plaquemine Brushed19 of
South Louisiana, but differs in being thinner, shell tempered instead
of clay tempered and having thickened or rolled rims.
The straight line incised-punctate wares of Type 7, found in large
quantities on most sites in this area, but particularly on large hillside sites like Smithport, Wilkinson, Indian Hill and Pease Place
between Shreveport and Natchitoches, seem to bear some relation to
certain components of the widespread Coles Creek horizon described
by Ford.17 Many of these sites afford a minor percentage of
sherds listed as marker types for Coles Creek--overhanging parallel lines encircling the necks of beakers, a line of triangular punttares below the overhanging lines, grooving of the upper surface of
flattened lips and characteristic arrangement of punctated fields.
Type 7 lncised may prove to have several subtypes and shows certain similarities to Manchac Point Incised, Hardy Incised and Rhonebart Punctated of South Louisiana19 which also seem to be derived
from Coles Creek and to extend to historic levels.

The plain water bottles of Type 8 a seem to accompany the earlier
indigenous pottery of this area, often found in burials on sites where
ineised-punctate wares predominate, as at Smithport Landing and
Allen place in Natchitoches Parish. This is in keeping with their
occurrence in the burials originating from the deeper levels of
Mound B at Belcher, where Type 7 lncised wares were prevalent.
Conclusions
The Belcher site appears to be a comparatively late but not historic Caddo site, whose Mound B shows four occupation levels. The
pre-mound inhabitants, who built a rectangular house structure,
made pottery on which incised straight lines and punctations were
the prevalent decorations, with a smaller amount of engraved wares.
After construction of the first small mound, there was a cultural

Types From the Belcher Mound Site

115

invasion suggested by the increasing amount of engraved, ridged
and brushed pottery wares. In the last two habitation periods of
this mound, the invasion was complete, as indicated by the construction of circular lodges, profuse offerings with burials and the
pottery types in place of the incised-punctate wares. A similar intrusion of a later culture into a widespread indigenous incisedpunctate culture is suggested for the Red River Valley in this entire area.
We wish to express our indebtedness to Dr. Jas. B. Griffin, Ceramics Repository, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and to the entire staff of
the Department of Archaeology at Louisiana State University for
their kind assistance and numerous suggestions in the course of

CERTAIN VESSELS FROM THE CLEMENTS
PLACE, AN HISTORIC CADDO SITE
B~ S. D. DICKINSON
Hundreds of vessels belonging to the complex which Harrington
called Caddo1 have been taken from graves in southwest Arkansas,
but none, insofar as I know, have ever been found in association
with European trade material. Even along the Caddo Trace, that
at certain points can be located with a fair degree of accuracy,~ not
one site has ever been identified as historic. In view of known contacts between European and Caddoes during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries this seems strange.
Certainly, the highly polished and elaborately engraved ware belongs to the last horizon in this area. At both the Crenshaws and
Kirkham4 sites it occurred above Coles Creek material; and in the
Arkansas River Valley it is sometimes associated with an historic
ceramic complex characterized by painting, modeling, and champleve.5 Moieover, somewhat similar pottery has been recovered
from historic sites in adjacent states.
At the Fish Hatchery site near Natchitoches, Louisiana, Walker
observed material, apparently belonging to the Natchitoches tribe,
which though related, differed somewhat from southwest Arkansas
pottery. The latter exhibits greater variety in form and decoration,
which as Walker explains, would be expected, "’if we are here dealing with the Grand Caddo tribe, the leader of the confederation of
which the Natchitoches and the Ouachita were more outlying members." He adds that further work in eastern Texas will probably
reveal additional Subtypes of the Caddo complex.6
About fifty years ago Mr. Will Scott of Atlanta, Texas, accidentally found an aboriginal cemetery on his farm between Black
Bayou and Murray Branch, two and one-half miles west of Atlanta,
in the northeast part of Cass County. From the burial ground he
obtained a large collection of artifacts, which he sold and gave to
various people. His sister, Mrs. C. A. Smith, received six of the
finest pieces of pottery and also a shell pendant and a bead. On the
death of Mrs. Smith, these specimens were inherited by her daughter,

118

Texa~ Archeological and t’aleontolog~cal Society

Mrs. J. B. Hesterly, of Prescott, Arkansas, who in turn gave them
to me.
In June and July, 1932, the Anthropology Department of the
University of Texas excavated what remained of this site which
was then known as the Clements Brothers place.

According to Mr.

A. T. Jackson, who was in charge of the excavation, twenty-two
graves were discovered. Although they had been badly disturbed
by previous diggers, parts of skeletons and some funerary offerings
still remained. One burial was flexed; the others were extended on
the back. In five of the graves there were blue glass trade beads
in association with pottery.7

Although no study has been made of these beads to determine
their origin and period, and thereby date the pottery, it seems
highly probable that they belong to the eighteenth century when
European traders were especially active in this section of the Red
River Valley. In the contract which Juan Piseros made with
Athanase de Mezieres at Natchitoches, February 3, 1770, the former agreed to supply the Village of the Great Caddo with "Sixty
pounds of small glass beads, sky blue, white and black," among
other things.8 Inasmuch as the Clements place was not a great distance from the Cadodachos settlements which Bolton locates in the
vicinity of Texarkana,9 one would expect the pottery to be representative of the historic ware of the Great Caddo.
In describing the ware from the Clements place, Jackson says:
"The prevailing types of pottery from this historic site greatly
resemble tho~ ~rom prehistoric burials in Cass, Upshur, Harrison,
Titus and Morris Counties. A few vessels have rounded bottoms
and delicately incised lines like those from R. L. Jaggers farm,
Franklin County, where a cremated burial--but no evidence of European contact~was found. Apparenty red slips were not common
here. No whole specimens bearing such slips were present; and
only a few sherds showed evidence of slips. Very few bottles were
found here; but their position, at or near the head, was the same as
in most prehistoric sites of the region. A small, crude bowl illusPLATE !9

trates the method of forming a vessel from a single lump of clay,
rather than by the usual coil method."
"The designs include sun symbols, interlocking scrolls, one swastika, raised lines, fingernail imprints and incised triangular designs.
The workmanship shows a fair degree of excellence. Certain desigaas show a marked similarity to some from Louisiana and Arkansas, as pictured by Moore.’’10
Obviously, my collection from the Clements place cannot be considered typical of all the pottery from this region, because Mr. Scott,
who Judge Harry J. Lemley and I interviewed several years ago,
said that his sister had chosen the finest pieces from among those he
found; and the high degree of workmanship shown by the specimens
themselves attest to the truth of his statement. Nevertheless, they
are closely related to the pieces which the University of Texas excavated. Likewise, they have a number of features in common with
pottery found in the valleys of the Red and Ouachita rivers of
Arkansas and Louisiana.
Though it is now the fashion in some archaeological circles to
minimize the scientific value of a beautiful specimen, the fine piece
is still important in cultural studies. It may be atypical, but it represents a note in the gamut of human activity. And among primitives, where art was not divorced from industry, beautiful examples
of craftsmanship, whether common or rare, were the highest form
of human expression.
A detailed description of my Clements collection is presented in
this paper to point out specific similarities to pottery from Caddo
sites in Arkansas where no evidence of contact with whites have been
found; and to show that the principles of historic Caddo decoration,
unchanged from the pre-Columbian period, fulfilled all that a good
designer would ask.
The bottle illustrated in Plate 19, No. 1, is made of compact paste,
Benzo Brown11 in color, and is tempered with sand. Its hardness
is 4. It is 13.3 cm. high and has a maximum body diameter of 12
cm. The color of the highly polished exterior surface is Clove
Brown.12 The short bulbous neck, rounded body wails and small
flat base are rather common features of bottles from Caddo sites in
the Red River area.13 Similar forms occur along the Ouachita

122

Texa~ ArcheologlcaI and Pa2eontologicul Society

River from Glendora Plantation,~ a Louisiana, to the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas; and are also occasionally found in the Lower
Arkansas Valley. ~ 5
Its engraved decoration, which had been rubbed with red ochre,
is likewise common. Four spirals, placed equidistantly about the
base of the neck form a swastika when viewed from above. Below
and balancing these spirals which are arranged on a vertical axis is
a continuous pattern of four volutes placed on a horizontal axis.
Movement in the upper scrolls is to the left; that of the lower to the
right. All are bisected longitudinally by a dentated line. Interspaces are filled with hatched lines arranged in groups at an angle
to each other, and with discs placed near the inflection of the
volutes.
In the design on this bottle one sees the basic principles* followed
by Caddo potters in decorating.their highly polished ware. From
the standpoint of pure design it is an excellent example of unity
and balance obtained by compact arrangement and. complete integration of motifs. As on almost all Caddo bottles, the decoration
is confined to the body with which the plain neck and base surfaces pleasantly contrast. Such restriction eliminates any possibility of flamboyancy, and at the same time emphasizes the largest
surface. To give movement to the static vessel shape, the potter
chose an asymmetric motif,~6 the scroll, to dominate the design.
The pattern, however, was evenly divided according to horizontal
and vertical axes, and as a result, there is movement in opposite
directions, further intensified by the volutes and spirals which go
to the right and to the left. Moreover, movement in two directions
coordinates all surfaces, both plain and decorated. On looking at
the design, one’s eyes follow the upper scrolls to the neck and the
lower continuous volutes to the base. As a minor motif, the hatched
lines in the background echo the diversification of movement. And
the discs, acting as accents for the change in curvature of the motifs,
also serve as intermediaries between foreground and background.
*Caddo pottery includes two general types : Caddo Domestic and Caddo Burnished.
The former is heavy, smoothed but not ofte~ polished, and has in~sed and applique
decorations. The latter is thinner, much better made, and is usually highly polished.
It has engraved, applique, or well executed incised patterns.

A variation of this design occurs on the small engraved bottle
shown in Plate 19, No. 2. It has, however, five spirals radiating
from the base of the neck and a similar number of connected volutes
below them. Design elements grouped in twos, threes and fours
are common among the Caddo,17 but a grouping of five is unusual.
The upper motifs go to the right and the lower to the left. The
background is crosshatched and does not have discs.
The neck of this bottle is shaped somewhat like an hour-glass.
A more bulbous form is a common feature of bottles from Red
River. The small base is concave--an unusual feature in southwestern Arkansas. Vessel dimensions are: height, 9.2 cm.; maximum body diameter, 8.2 cm. ; basal diameter, 2.4 cm. ; oral diameter,
3.2 cm. Its hardness is 3.5; and its color is Deep Mouse Gray.18
There is no slip. A somewhat similar diminutive bottle from Lafayette County, Arkansas, is in the collection of U. S. Judge Harry J.
Lemley of Hope, Arkansas.
The eccentric bottle illustrated in Plate 21, No. 1, is a very rare
form in Arkansas. .ludge Lemley has two of this shape from the
Arkansas River Valley. They were found in Perry and Yell counties. Both vessels are of yellow ware and are engraved.19 Bottles
having a pointed body are occasionally found in the Middle Mississippi complex,zo but they are not analogous inasmuch as the
body curves upward in crescent fashion.
The color of the paste core of this bottle is Deep Mouse Gray.zl
Its highly polished exterior surface is Fuscous-Black. 2a The paste
is compact and is tempered with sand. Dimensions are: height, 11.
cm.; basal diameter, 3.1 cm.; body length (from point to point),
18.3 cm.; maximum body width, 10.2 cm.; oral diameter, 1.4 cm.
Its hardness is 4.
In keeping with the greatest dimension of the vessel, the decoration is arranged according to the horizontal axis. Movement along
the horizonal plane begins at the concave base, around which a
series of concentric circles are engraved, and progresses laterally
and upward to the plain conical-shaped neck. Four connected
scrolls going to the left occupy the greatest space in the pattern.
These are bisected by hatched bands. In contrast to the basal circle
and scrolls, parallel lines engraved around the two ends of the body
convey the idea of upward movement. Intervening curvilinear lines,

126

Texas Archeological and Pcd~on~ological Society

however, act as intermediary elements between them and the scrolls.
Small plain hexagons and short bars fill the remaining spaces between the principal motifs.
The engraving is rather deep and more roughly done thart much
of the carving found on Arkansas Caddo ware. As usual, red ochre
had been rubbed into the design. Though filling intaglio designs
with pigment could easily have been developed anywhere, the practice vaguely suggests the technique used in cloisonne ware of Teotihuacan.
The graceful jar figured in Plate 21, No. 2, is shaped somewhat
like a much larger vessel from a mound on the Webster Medley
place, near Bayou Macon in Cbicot County, Arkansas.z3 The latter
specimen, now owned by Judge Lemley, has an incised design of
scrolls, and is of buff colored porous paste characteristic of the
historic horizon in southeast Arkansas.

Measurements of the Clements jar are: height, 14.6 cm.; basal
diameter, 4.5 cm.; maximum body diameter, 5.6 cm.; and oral
diameter, 3.9 cm. The color of the paste core is Dark Mouse
Gray,2z~ and that of the exterior surface, Fuscous-Black.z5 The
paste is silicious and compact. Its hardness is 4.
Like other vessels already described, the jar has an engraved
design which was once rubbed with red paint. Two interlocking
scrolls with the usual discs dominate the pattern. Above and below
there are horizontal lines encircling the v~sel. Though the movement is lateral, division of wall space into panels of varying width
creates horizontal rhythm well suited to this shape.
The vessel illustrated in Plate 21, No. 3, is unlike any Arkansas
Caddo form which I have seen. If it did not have the small flaring
neck it would rese~nble the so-called neckless bottles found in the
Upper Ouachita Valley.26
The dimensions of this specimen are: height, 16.8 cm.; basal
diameter, 6.2 cm.; maximum body diameter, 8.3 cm.; and oral

diameter, 4. cm. Vessel hardness is 4. The paste cbre is colored

which is clouded, is Drab.z8 The texture of the paste is lumpy.
Temper could not be determined. The jar was smoothed but not
polished.
Four vertical appliqued bands divide the body into an equal
number of zones. Each zone is divided vertically by a panel of
engraved crosshatching and two engraved, vertical dentated lines.
Both the rim and the appliqued bands are notched, a trait sometimes
found on Caddo pottery from Arkansas. An Asinai bottle having
incised vertical panels and triangles, from Henderson County, Texas,
is illustrated by Jackson.29
The dinmnsions of the vessel shown in Plate 20, No. 1, are:
height, 23.8 cm.; basal diameter, 5.9 cln.; maximum body diameter,
24.5 cm. It is tempered with sand. The paste core is Dark Mouse
Gray;3O and the mottled exterior surface is Orange-Cinnamon31
and Black.3~ Hardness is 4.
Although the pot or urn shape is common in southwest Arkansas,
rarely is such a well made vessel found. Evidently the Arkansas
specimens were used in cooking, but this piece is too well done to
have been a part of a woman’s culinary equipment.
Decoration on the body is done in bands of applique, placed in
angular fashion. Six zones, outlined by angles with the apex to
the left are filled with concentric angles, the apices of which point
to the right, and parallel lines. This arrangement creates an impression of opposing movements along the horizontal axis, but the
eyes of any one looking at the vessel are led by the diagonal linem
upward to the rim where there are three horizontal rows of incisions
made with a spatulate-shaped tool.
The s~nall bowl in Plate 20, No. 2, is rather similar in composition and treatment. Its dimensions are: height, 6.9 cm.; basal
diameter, 5. era.; ~naximum body diameter, 8.8 cm.; oral diameter,
7.5 cm. The color of the paste core is Dark Mouse Gray3~ and
that of the outer surface, Wood Brown.3~ Sand was used for tempering. Vessel hardness is 4.
The applique decoration covering the entire exterior is divided
by vertical lines into four panels, which in turn are bisected diagonally. Each section of the panels is filled wilh bands.
Applique decoration, as previously stated, is soznetimes found on

130

Arkansas engraved ware, but it is much more conunon on culinary
vessels. This technique ~ems to have be~n much less popular
among the potters along the Ouachita than among those living in
Red River Valley. However, in southwest Arkansas, applique ell
masse, as on the two piec~ just described, is not common.
In ornalnenting their vessels the potters at the Clements Site and
elsewhere in the region occupied by dm Great Caddoes tended to:

Similarities between file historic Clements pottery and vessels
from graves in southwestern Arkansas, where no ol,jccts of European
manufacture have been fonnd, point toward an uninterrupted ceramic
industry among the Upper Caddoes until the eighteenth century.

SOME UNUSUAL BASKETRY AND BAGS
FROM THE BIG BEND CAVF.S
By VICTOR J. SMITH

The study of culture traits in the analysis of what seems to be a
distinct group of primitive people such as has been observed in the
area of the Trans-Pecos in Texas must be made from a multitude of
angles before the obscure picture clears. Among such angles of study
that of basketry tedmiques must be ranged as an important element
which should shed considerable light upon the whole problem. The
art of basketmaking assmnes an important place in archaeological
studies becau~ of its relation to both early and present aboriginal
peoples.
The reconstruction of the culture picture in many archaeological
areas has been frequently limited to the examination of stone, bone,
clay, and impressions of artifacts and construction upon mud or
baked materials. The Greater Big Bend of Texas," however has
shared with a few other fortunate areas in that deposits are available
for interpretation which contain culture evidence preserved for considerable periods of ti~ne in deposits of dry ash and dust, sometimes
further protected by rock falls and usually within shallow rock
shelters or overhanging cliffs. At one site fragile specimens were,
to my surprise, unearthed well out in the open area in front of a
small shelter, normally exposed to rainfall. At this time a heavy
shower falling almost vertically indicated that the cliff overhead
protected the talus slope for at ltu~st thirty feet in front of the bluff.
U’ndcr the conditions described frag~ncnts of basketry and hags tell
the story of these utensils as used by the Indian groups.
Concerning the basketry of the Big Bend there has been much
discussion and so~ne material published indicating interesting and
valuable information related to the variety of techniques employed.
It is at. once evident that the wide variety of use and the weaving

and sewing skills displayed deserve careful analysis and permanent
r~cord.

A general description of the widely distributed split stitch type of
basket, which has been found generally daroughout the area, thinning
out to the East, West, and North and extending an unknown distance into Old Mexico, and which seems to be a basic utensil for all
of the Greater Big Bend Cave Dweller groups, is a basin-shaped
container averaging about 7" in depth and 14" in diameter. The
largest ones to my knowledge are about 9" deep by 21" in diameter.
The work surface is on the inner concave side of the basket and the
coils are ~wed in a counter-clockwise direction to the left of the
worker. Stitches for this type are non-interlocking and the coiling
is formed from a bundle of grasses or coarser desert plants.

Coiling

is usually 5 to the inch and stitches 4 to the inch. For the sake of
brevity and quick comparison, the general description of this and
other basketry herein described has bt~n thrown into chart form.
Variation From Split Stitch Basketry
Tlm small split stitch basket shown in Plate 22, No. 1, contains
assembly technique basically similar to the larger artifacts but also
indicates evidences of a distinct and interesting departure from the
usual form of split stitch basket in that the size is much smaller, the
stitches coarser, the work surface is outside, and the introduction of
an interrupted black band near the rim on the inner side adds m~
element of decoration. For such a small utensil it is quite natural
that the start should be on the bottom (good side) since the nearer
finish would then turn up the outside exposed areas of the basket.
It will be noted that the start of the coil compares with the standard
split stitch basket but that, once the rim is turned the worker continues the coils but is necessarily working clockwi~ rather than
counter-clockwise and on the convex (near) surface rather than on
the concave (far inside) surface. Work continues in both cases to
the left of the worker. In the bottom of this small basket a slightly
raised inner rim occurs just before the edge is turned. This sugPLATE 22

gests, if not an accidental selection of extra-coarse weaver, that
some game might be connected to the use of the object such as
children frequently use in rolling shot or marbles in place upon a
partly depressed background. At any rate, the raised circle of
coiling is rather too uniform to suggest accident and occurs but once
fully around, indicating intention rather than accident.
Twined Basketry

Plain Twined
The small plain twined bowl- or cap-shaped basket illustrated in
Plate 23, No. 2, is the only one of its type known to the author.
It is further described in the tabulations of the chart, becomes more
interesting in view of the use of No. 3 (8) red cord twined decorations. Four rows of these red cords are woven in at intervals of
inches. Each red band is interrupted in a fashion to exclude any
thought other than definite intention.
In calling attention to the twined work of Lovelock Cave it is not
to be assumed that direct relationships are claimed, but rather mentioned in order to suggest a variety of widely separated parallels
from which is excluded any definite conclusions as to kinship or
migrations. The parallel of plain twining, stick warp, and the use
of red cordage in basketry, however, is interesting and suggests again
the usual "this topic bears further study." While twining was practically unknown to Southwestern Basketmaker, in the Big Bend,
Setzler (7) identified additional twining in the Pecos River area.
Cross Warp Twined

The container illustrated in Plate 23, No. 1, is of unusual modified cross warp assembly of spokes with a plain twined spiral weave
of half-inch pitch wo~’en from the outside in a counter-clockwise
direction. The shape again suggests that the worker held the basket
with the bottom up to start in a clockwise direction to the right until
about half the basket was completed, then turning the object over,
worked on the near (convex) side in a counter-clockwise direction

to the right until the article reached the stage of completeness indicated by the cut referred to. The size of this container is 3½
inches in diameter by 101/~ inches high. The maximum number of
warp units is-107 which is increased or decreased by adding or dropping the number of warp elements by using a bent warp to make two
added spokes.
Twined Lid Si]ter
This article (Plate 23, No. 2), which appears to be either a sifter
or basket lid rather than a storage or carrying utensil, is 2 inches
high by 8 inches in diameter. The weaving starts with 23 spokes,
which is increased to 99 at the rim by dropping in additional single
unbent units as the diameter increased. The initial twining is spirally in a clockwise coil of one-fourth inch pitch to the right. As
the object became larger we again assume that the article was turned
and worked from the outside convex surface, resulting in a counterclockwise direction to the right of the worker. The Heye Foundation report (1) for Brewster County indicated the finding of sifters
with 1/16 inch and % inch mesh. This mesh averages less than
1/8 inch if used for sifting purposes.
Cross Warp, Wrapped Twining

This interesting type was excavated by the writer from a dry
shelter near Alpine (three specimens). It has been unknown, however, in West Texas generally but was reported by F. M. Setzler
from caves along the lower Pecos to the East. Harrington (2) also
mentions this type of basketry technique in his description of the
Gypsum Cave deposits but is not positive of the associations due to
the presence of rodent nests. This type of basketry in Texas was
evidently used for the construction of some sort of cone-shaped container. Horizontal rods are on the outer convex surface and the
vertical rods are bound to each other by non-interlocklng twining.
Mr. L. S. Cressman in a personal letter throws some interesting
light upon this unusual technique:
No. 103, the Dead Cow Gave specimen is interesting. It is of course
wrapped twining and as a devic~ or process is used ~oday in much of
the basketry of the Puget Sound region in Washington. It also occurs
in the Plateau but chiefly as a decorative device to apply an overlay
element upon the twined foundation. This decorative use occurs in
our Oregon caves and in f~he lowest level of Lovelock Cave. I exam-

142

Texas AraheologicaI and Paleontological Society

ined a specimen at the Heye Foundation last fall. The Klamath also
use it to apply porcupine quill overlay on their women’s hats and perhaps some baskets. Mason figures it as a functional, like yours, etc.,
that is twining and not decorative, device for Ute water jars. Thig
last I have not seen nor have I run across the reference anywher6
else. This apparent widespread use of the technique in a roughly
continuous area, and its use in part as a definite twining device only,
raises some interesting questions. It is unfortunate that the Gypsum
Cave specimen is not referable to any stratigraphic horizon.
A cut illustrating one of the Dead Cow Cave finds will be found
in Bulletin No. 7 of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological
Society, 1935, accompanying my short article on the split stitch
basket.
Coiled Bag
The coil and loop assembly bag, without foundation, illustrated
in Plate 24, No. 1, because of the nature of the find and contents
attracts more interest than most of the materials herein listed. This
bag was discovered in the extreme far end of a rock shelter of moderate size. With the single exception of a small circular area of
about 20" the entire floor of the shelter was solid rock.

Evidence

on the talus and pictographs near, however, indicated the.usual use
for such shelters by the Big Bend Indians. Excavation of the pocket
yielded a single specimen only, a folded bag, wrapped and tied in
a shape suggesting a lady’s hand purse. The tie was coarse cordage;
untwisted yucca cord with square knot (9). It was evident that from
the weight of the object that the contents were of some heavy materials, wrapped and hidden away.

The object, however, was taken

to the Museum at Alpine, photographed, and opened after preliminary cleaning. The contents, somewhat disappointing, but nevertheless interesting in that it indicated what type of tools were valued
and used, appeared to be a tool kit composed of 13 blades or knives
and two pebbles of coarse texture with little shaping to suggest use
other than abrasive. The flaked work (Plate 24, No. 2), was
coarsely chipped from poor materials and is not unlike the rather
poor grade of work sparsely found in other dry rock shelters. With
attention focused upon the bag itself, however, more. pleasing results accrue.

Once cleaned and protected by preservatives, the bag

assumed a globular shape 8" in diameter and 68~" high. There are
eight coils and five stitches per inch. Fiber string of uniform
twisted No. 2 cord (9) was used throughout. The bottom of the
bag was woven counter-clockwise to the left of the worker on the
outside surface with the upper part also to the left but clockwise on
the convex side. The top opening was worn and it was difficult to
determine the exact type of finishing, it was 3½" in diameter. A
small hole (Plate 25, No. 1), stuffed with shreds of fiber for mending
reminds us that Coffin (1) found similar repairs at Eagle Canyon in
the Big Bend. A satisfactory attempt at decoration was the inclusion of three coils of red cord near the large diameter of the bag.
Red cordage fragments form 4 per cent of the total twisted string
collected by the writer in West Texas (9).
The Heye Foundation Expedition also reported a "cap" woven
in 10 coils and 6 loops per inch with a second article of 5 coils and
7 loops per inch. The shape of the bag illustrated here suggests the
cap shape reported is a similar form of incomplete bag. Kidder
and Guernsey report (4) from their Arizona Cliff House studies a
weave technique of almost identical type with coils ranging from 4
to 9 per inch and loops 5 and 6 per inch. They identify this assembly of cordage as used for making bags, leggins, cap, and sandals.
Netting

Two pieces of open mesh work in circular, cone-shaped form
(Plate 25, No. 2), suggest other uses for the identical weave technique used in the c!osed bag assembly, the only difference being the
increased coarseness of the mesh to 1/~ inch and 3~ inch respectively. Pearce and Jackson (6) found that this type of mesh was
most interestingly used to enclose a stone mano. They reported six
other bags of similar type with mesh size range ~o inch and 1 inch.
Checker Basket

With quantities of checker matting extending throughout West
Texas, it is strange to observe that limited use was made of this
easily assembled type of container. Nevertheless, barring some
larger bags, the specimen illustrated (Plate 26), is the only such
article observed by the writer in the form of a small container. This
cube-shaped basket is four inches square by four and one-half
inches high. The top selvedge is formed over a No. 4 twisted cord

146

T~as

Araheological and Paleontological Society

(9). The cord handle itself is the usual counterclockwise twist of
cord which is tied around the selvedge cord at one end by a figure
eight knot. On the other side a loop is inserted to the third warp
element and the handle cord is tied to this loop. The plaited elements are 1½ to the inch. According to F. G. Speck, the checker
basket suggests a strong Eastern influence. A similar basket was
found at Bee Canyon by the Heye Foundation (1) which measured
41~x4½x5 inches save that the plaiting was diagonal rather than
checker weave.
Conclusion

The student interested in other types of basketry from West Texas
should consult Coffin (1) and Pearce and Jackson (6) for additional illustrations. Sevaral museums have unusual assortments of
basketry from the area which have not been described and tabulated from the standpoint of weave direction and other techniques.
Future studies should be concerned with indications of motor habit
as a possible criterion indicating group differences. With such
accumulated studies in a wide variety of topics the puzzle of the
West Texas Cave People will reach a more satisfactory solution.
While no such early date as has been assigned to Basketmaker
may be safely allocated to the basketry described herein, it seems
reasonable to believe that much of the cave deposit material represents a pre-Columbian period.
In assigning ten "Basketry Areas of North America," Weltfish
(11) has mapped the continent excluding West Texas from District
8. It is believed that this excellent report, if revised today, should
include the Big Bend district either as a part of the Southwest or, if
research seems to justify, a distinct area of its own.

closer relationships with neighboring areas rather tended to estabPLATE 25

THE VARIOUS TYPES OF THE CLEAR
FORK GOUGE
BY CYRUS N. RAY

The first specimens of the Clear Fork gouge on record were
found on the banks of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River early
in 1928.
By the end of that year fourteen specimens had been accumulated,
which were studied and compared with illustrations of flints in
texts to determine whether the artifacts had been previously described and pictured. At that time no reference to them was found.
I then decided that it was a type of Texas artifact not previously
described or classified in scientific texts.
At the meeting when the Texas Archeologieal and Paleontological
Society was formed, which was held in my office at 125 1-2 Pine
Street, Abilene, Texas, in October, 1928, I read a paper entitled
"A Differentiation of the Prehistoric Cultures of the Abilene Section." This was the first time that the Texas Clear Fork gouge was
described in scientific literature so far as the writer knows. This
article with illustrations was later printed as the first paper in Vol.
1, 1929, Bulletin of Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society. Clear Fork gouges were described on page 18, Plate 1, lower
panel, Nos. 8-9-10-11. In the next year’s Bulletin, on Page 46, under "Limestone Incrusted Artifacts," Vol. 2, 1930, Plate 10, No. 2,
another specimen of the Clear Fork gouge was shown and described.
In an article entitled "Flint Cultures of Ancient Man in Texas," in
Vol. 6, 1934, I named the Clear Fork gouges as part of the Clear
Fork Culture. The name was taken from the place where the gouges
were first found, as mentioned in the first description of them in
Vol. 1, 1929 issue of the Society’s Bulletin. Six more Clear Fork
gouges were shown in the 1934 article on Plate 18, Nos. 99-101-102104-109-110.111. This article also described many other components of the Clear Fork Culture.
In 1935 E. B. Sayles illustrated the same type of gouge in "An
Archeological Survey of Texas," Plate X, under the name of "Abilene core scraper." On Plate IX of the same Survey, Sayles also
showed a page of points which he listed as "Abilene points," of a
type which I listed as "Clear Fork darts (1) and (2)".in "The

ciety. Fourteen Clear Fork gouges were also shown in the latter
article in Plate 24, No. 2, two top rows.
In Vol. 7, 1935, of the Society’s Bulletin, my report entitled
"Folsom Sites," Plate 17, showed two Clear Fork gouges, Nos. 209
and 233. This plate also pictured other components of that culture.
Clear Fork Gouge (1)
The type of Clear Fork gouge found most frequently in the Abilene
region is a triangular to ovoid blade, which has been chipped to a
curved or scoop like cutting edge at the large end, and to either a
point or a chisel edge at the small end. The flaking was done by
.percussion on both faces, which left a sinous edged thick blade, convex on both faces. Some retouch was done from both faces of the
curved cutting edge. (See Plate 27, Nos. 1-2-6-11-12-13-14-15).
The gouge (1) type artifacts are usually from 3 to 31/~ inches in
length to from 2 to 2¼ inches in width at the cutting end. The
deep bevel was cut back into one face of the blade from the broad
end. The broad end of the other face was then chipped so that a
curved or scoop like cutting edge was made. The depth of the
scooped out chipped space varies greatly in different specimens
from a few larger ones which are chipped back from the edge as
much as 1~ inches to a similar number which are only one-half an
inch in depth. The scooped out portions of the majority are bevelled back from the cutting edges to depths of between one-half and
three-quarters of an inch.
While the majority of the blades are rather uniform in size, there
are many much smaller than the figures given above. The smallest
of these is 1~/.~ inches wide, and 17/s inches I~ng. The largest specimen of gouge (1) is 45~ inches in length, by 23/~ inches in width.
There are however only t.wo of such large size, and the other one
is slightly smaller. There are 39 of Gouge (1) which are of sizes
below 21~ inches in length. The total number of Gouge (1) type
is 206. These vary much in thickness, and in the shape of the
scooped ends. Some are broad and relatively thin, and the cutting
end more resembles a bevelled edge, except that no matter how narrow the cutting edge may be, it is always curved.
In some specimens one end of the cutting edge has been finished
off into a point for boring. There are twelve of these which are
definitely so, eleven points were made on the left hand, and one on
the right hand. One had points on each end of the cutting edge.

Texax Arch¢ological and Paleon$ologlcal Society

Nearly all of Gouge (1) are heavily patinated in shades of white or
tan. Only one, the largest one, is not patinated but another one of
nearly the same size has a thick brown patina. Only 22 of the 206
have even a gray patina, all the others have progressed into shades
which thoroughly hide the original blue-gray flint color. Some were
heavily incrusted with lime or caliche; there were 15 of Gouge (1)
lime incrusted in some degree.
Many of these tools show deep chemical alteration of the texture
of the stone, indicated by a chalky appearance of the patinated
cortex as seen in recently fractured surfaces. In several cases chemical alteration has proceeded to a pitted stage caused by considerable chemical remova! of the flint. In one case the left half of
the cutting edge has been entirely dissolved and the remainder shows
pits of disintegration on the edge and over the blade. This form of
gouge is frequently found eroding from the same old beds of red
gravel along mountain branches, from which Folsom points, mammoth bones and other ancient types of flints also erode.
Clear Fork Gouge (2) or Planer Gouge
This is the second most numerous class of gouges and there are
175 specimens of Clear Fork Gouge (2) in the collection. (See
Plate 27, Nos. 3-4-5-7-8-9-10).
The principal difference between specimens of Gouge (2) and
those of Gouge (1) is that all of Gouge (2) have a flat face oppoPLATE 27
No. 1, the largest Clear Fork Gouge (1) is 4% in. long by 2% in.
wide and % of an in. thick. Number 2 is one of the smallest of Clear
Fork Gouge (1) and is 2~ inches long, 1% inches wide and 7/16 of
an in. thick. Numbers 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are various types of Clear
Fork Gouge 2. Number 8 has two small spokeshave notches at the
smaller end opposite to the cutting edge, Number 10 has three notches
cut into the front or cutting edge. Numbers 1, 2, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and
15 are of CIear Fork Gouge (1) type. Number 6 has sharp points at
each end of its curved cutting edge. Number 13 has the left end of the
cutting edge worked into a short borer. Number 14 is spongy from
chemical alteration, and heavily incrusted with lime. Number 15 is a
beautiful specimen of iron cemented quartzite from P. H. Walser’s
collection at Bryan, Texas. A large area of this gouge, near the cutting edge on the reverse side, is polished from use. Numbers 2 and 9
have large patches of caliche incrustation over portions of their chippod surfaces. All of the gouges shown on this plate have their cutting edges turned toward the bottom of the page. Numbers 6 and 13
are of about the usual size of Clear Fork Gouge (1). Number 6 is
2~ inches broad at the cutting edge and 3~ inches long and ~ of
inch thick. Number 13 is 2 inches broad at the cutting edge,
inches long and 9/16 of an inch thick.

site to the one out of which the scoop or gouge has been chipped.
It seems that a large flake with one flat surface was used in making
them. The upper surface was flaked off convex and only enough
flaking was done along the flat surface to finish off any rough
spots on the edges of the blade. Clear Fork Gouge (2) may be
divided into those having a curved cutting edge, of which there are
88, and those having a straight or approximately straight cutting
edge, of which there are 87 specimens. The specimens of Gouge
(2) show the same signs of patination or chemical deterioration that
those of Gouge (1) do.

Lime incrustation shows on 18 of Gouge (2).

Eight of Gouge (2) had corners of the cutting edges finished off
as borers. Three were on the left, two on the right, and three
on both ends of the cutting edges. Ten of Gouge (2) contained
small notches or spokeshaves which probably were provided for the
sharpening of bone awl points. Six had them on the cutting edge,
one was at the end opposite to the cutting edge and three were on
the sides. ~Iqaere were 20 of these tools not made of flint. Twelve
were of a hard gray dense refractory material of about the hardness
of jasper. Six were of quartzite, one of fossil wood, one of hematite, and 155 were of flint.
Clear Fork Gouge (,3)
There are 33 of Gouge (3) in the collection.
1-2-3-4-6).

(See Plate 28. Nos.

The specimens of Clear Fork Gouge (3) are long and

relatively narrow. The blades have a tendency to be either nearly
the same width from the cutting edge to near the other end, or to
gradually increase in width from the cutting end to about the middle
and then to become slightly narrower toward the other end.

Both

faces are convex like those of Gouge (1), but the shape is long and
relatively narrow, instead of being triangular. Three specimens are
incrusted with ealiehe, two very thickly.

All are patinated.

Three

have a gray patina, and all of the others are either white or some
shade of tan or red brown, which are the colors which indicate the
thickest coats of chemical alteration. While Gouges (1) and (2)
are also found in the same sites with this Gouge (3) type, there are
some indications that Gouge (3) may have been used at an earlier
period than the others.
Clear Fork Gouge (4)
There are only 11 of Gouge (4).

(See Plate 28, Nos. 7 and 10).

The distinguishing feature of Gouge (4) is that it has curved cut-

158

Texas Archeological and Paleontolog~al Soc;~ty

ting edges at both ends instead of at only one, such as those previously de~.rilxwl. In shape, eight of Gouge (4) are of about the
same width from end to end.

Three are of triangular shape similar

in form to those of Gouge (1). In seven of Gouge (4) both gouge
bevels are made at opposite ends in the ~me face of the implement.
In four specimens there is one bevelled edge on each face, in opposite ends of the i~nplements.
Clear Fork Gouge (,5)
There are 9 of Clear Fork Gouge (5).

(See Plate 28, Nos. 5 and

11). The implements of this type are long oval, thick blades, which
have a very narrow curved cutting edge on the small end and gradually become larger toward the other end, which may be finished
off into a roun&xl or squarish ended knife or a celt edge. The
curved cutting edges of these usually vary from one-fourth inch to
one-half inch across, which is an exceedingly small cutting edge
compared to those of the other types of gouges.
Clear Fork Gouge (6)
There are only 7 of Clear Fork Gouge (6).

The distinguishing

PLATE 28
Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are of the Clear Fork Gouge (3) in its
various forms. Numbers 2 and 6 are heavily incrusted with caliche,
and No. 1 is incrusted to some extent. Numbers 7 and 10 are typical
double bitted gouges of Clear Fork (4) type; it will be noted that a
small spokeshave notch has been cut into the lower left hand corner
of the bottom cutting edge of each. as arranged in this plate. Numbers 5 and 11 are typical specimens of Clear Fork Gouge (5). This
is a heavy, long, thick blade with a relatively small bit or curved cutring edge. The curved cutting edge of No. 5 is ½ inch across. The
blade is finished off into a flat chisel edge at the broad upper end
which is 1.% inches wide, and the tool is 5% inches long, and 1%
inches broad in the central portion, and is .~. of an inch thick. The
curved cutting edge of No. 11 is ~6 of an inch across. The upper end
o£ this gouge is al~o a flat celt or chisel edge, which is 1~ inches
across, and the too! is 4 inches long, and ½ an inch thick.
These
are the t~vo largest artifact~ of the Gouge (5) class; the usual curved
cutting edge is from one-fourth to one-half an inch across. Numbers
1, 2 and 3 are also unusually long and large specimens of the Clear
Fork Gouge (3) class. Number 1 is 5 inches long, 1~ inches across
the curved cutting edge, 2~ inches wide at the middle and ~ of an
inch thick. Number 3 is 1½ in. across the curved cutting edge, 5~A
in. long, 1% in. across in the middle, and ~ of an in. thick. Number
7, an example of Clear Fork Gouge (4) is 3 in. long, 1~ in. broad,
and ~ of an in. thick. Number 10, of the same gouge (4) class, is
3 in. long, 1~& in. across, and 7/16 of an inch thick. Number 8, of
Gouge (6) class, is 2~ in. long, 1~. in. broad and 9/16 of an in. thick.
The curved cutting edges of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 are turned toward the bottom of the page. The curved cutting edges of Nos. 8 and
9 are turned upward. It is difficu!~ to photograph these gouges so as
to adequately represent them, as the curves often show flat in pictures.

Plate 2S

The Various Types of ~he Clear Fork Gouge

feature of Clear Fork Gouge (6) is that there is a curved cutting
edge of Clear Fork shape on one end of the implement and a heavy
drill point on the other end. There are two subtypes of these. One
kind is nearly flat on the face opposite to the bevelled one, and the
edges of the sides run straight to a point from the ends of the cutting edge. The other subtype flares out in the central portion before
the drill portion begins. Both types are shown in Plate 28, Nos. 8
and 9. Of No. 8 there are four, and of No. 7 three specimens.
The Clear Fork Gouge An/tncient Implement
All of the Clear Fork gouges described above have been found
where they were eroding out of gullies in either ancient red silts,
caliche, or red gravel deposits of considerable age. In some of the
same types of deposits Folsom and Yuma points and the other
components of the Clear Fork Culture have also been found. Their
use probably extended back into the Pleistocene to a date comparable with that of the Folsom and Yuma cultures, and also up
into the bottom of the lower Burnt Rock Mound Middens. How
many thousands of years this type of tool was used yet remains to
be determined. It is probable that the long relatively narrow Clear
Fork Gouge (3) may be the earliest type, and the smaller specimens
of Clear Fork Gouge (1) the latest type. Types (1) and (2) however seem to have had a vogue throughout a tremendous lapse of
time.
Probable Uses
It has been my belief since finding the first specimens, that it was
not a specialized form of scraper, as some contend, but an entirely
different tool which had its own specialized uses. The same Clear
Fork people made great numbers of side scrapers, of many shapes,
for such uses. The Clear Fork Gouge would be an efficient tool for
digging tubers, bulbs or fleshy roots, which probably formed an
important part of ancient man’s economy. The triangular types such
as Gouges (1) and (2) probably were hafted in wooden handles
and used like we do garden trowels. Those of type (3) are long
enough, and fit the hand well enough to have been used without
handles. The cutting edges of most of these tools show marks of
use, as though they had been forcibly shoved across some substance
of sufficient hardness to slightly break off the edges. This suggests that they may have been used in making atlatls and dart shafts.
They may have served to gouge out wooden bowls, or other utensils.

162

Tew~s Areheological ~nd Paleontolagical Society

These people had no pottery but that does not signify that they may
not have had an extensive industry in perishable wooden implements.
It is possible that they could have been used in hollowing burnt
out logs for boats. These tools would also make efficient removers
of tree bark which may have been used for food. Of course there
is the possibility that the gouges were fitted with handles and used
in fleshing hides.
The idea that these tools, and especially those having one flat
face--Gouge (2), were used somewhat like a modern carpenter’s
steel planer and pushed across a surface, is one I have long held.
Several years ago the collection was shown to Mr. P. H. Walser of
Bryan, Texas, and he remarked that he also had many of the same
types of tools, made of materials other than flint. On Mr. Walser’s
return home he sent me three specimens, two of which were of Clear
Fork Gouge (2), and one of Clear Fork Gouge (1).

All three were

of a brown quartzite appearing stone, which contained considerable
iron. The flat faces of both of Gouge (2) had smoothly polished
zones of surface near the cutting edges. The Gouge (1), a beautiful
specimen, had the largest and smoothest polished zone, also located
near the curved cutting edge, where wear would be most active if the
tool were shoved across a surface as a planer.

(See Plate 27,

No. 15).
Long before this evidence was observed, I had searched for just
such signs of wear with no success.

Evidently the hard nature of

the ~lint used in the Abilene region prevented the development of
polish, such as that which showed so plainly on the three specimens
from Bryan, Texas.
My collection now contains a total of ,t-41 of the six types of
Clear Fork gouges.
Each type as described above could be sub-divlded into other
divisions if one were to consider it necessary.

There is a great di-

versity of form, especially within the first three divisions.

Theie

has been only an attempt to begin classification in a previously
uncharted study. The only reason for here describing those types
of which few specimens have been found, is that such types may be
intrusive in the Abilene region and abundant elsewhere. At any
rate their divergences from type are interesting.

(1) Some Texas Cave Dweller Artifacts

The halted flints, Plate 29, Nos. 1, 2, 3, are instructive in showing
various methods of fastening stone points to wood. No. 1 is art
atlatl foreshaft, showing the more common method used.2 No. 2
shows an unusual method of halting.3 In historical times a similar
implement to that illustrated in No. 2 but with a metal blade, was
used by the Apache in gathering sotol.4 No. 3 may be described
as a knife, although the stone blade fastened in the short handle
probably was used to cut by a sawing-action. This method of
halting unnotched stone blades was probably more widespread than
that indicated by No. 2. Bitumen was commonly used in fastening
the blade where this material was obtainable, as evidenced along
the West Coast. The use of resin, shown by this inxplement, indicates that this material may have had a similar use.s
The painted pebbles shown in Plate 29, Nos. 4, 5, 6, are characteristic of the Pecos Cave Dweller, where they are normally found,
and were probably intrusive in adjoining, contemporaneous eultures.6 The three specimens illustrated appear to be attempts at
showing human faces, or probably represent masks.7 At most,
these human (?) forms are suggestive of those represented by certain "symbolical" pictographs found in the same area, and even
more so of the more highly conventionalized petroglyphs.8 Other

The purpose of the painted pebbles is unknown, but with the
knowledge of these attempts at human representation it might be
surmised that they were fashioned to serve the same use as various
fetishes, and particularly human figurines.

A similar interpretation is sug-

gested for the Texas painted pebbles.

Although the time relation-

ships between these various manifestations are not known, there is a
suggestion of some connection between the Texas Cave Dwellers and
the Hohokam, in the finding by Coffin of two complete and 24 fragmentary clay figurines in the Bee Cave, Brewster County. The painting of facial features in black pigments on the clay figures, described
by Coffin,9 is highly suggestive of those represented by Plate 29,
No. 5. These Texas clay types are somewhat anal’~gous to those
identified with the Pioneer Period of the Hohokam.10

The fishing tackle Plate 29, No. 7, is likewise identified with
the Pecos River Cave Dweller. Fishing was an important economy
of this culture, as shown by the great quantity of fish bones found
in their sites. The rigged hook, line and sinker is interesting in
throwing light upon the development of this pursuitA ~

(2) A Texas Sandia Polntl

In the May 6, 1940, issue of "Time Magazine" the writer read an
article reporting on the preliminary work done on an older culture,
by Frank Cummings Hibben, curator of the Museum of Anthropology, at the University of Ne~¢ Mexico at Albuquerque, New
Mexico.

This article indicated that in a cave in the Sandia Mountains,
near Albuquerque, New Mexico, a definitely stratified sequence of
deposits was found as follows: The surface of the cave floor was
covered with the droppings of bats and rats.

Underneath this was

a layer of stalagmite due to the limestone Irom the roof of the cave
being dissolved out by water seepages and being re-deposited on the
old floor of the cave.

Beneath this stalagmite deposit was found a

typical Folsom Culture stratum, containing Folsom projectile points,
charcoal, bones of sloths, and cat llke carnivores. Below the Folsom
deposit was found an undisturbed layer of sterile yellow ochre.
Directly underneath the sterile layer of yellow ochre, was another
deposit containing the bones of elephant, horse, camel, sloth, bison,
and the projectile points of a culture very different from the Folsom
or Yuma Cultures.
The descriptions and illustrations of the projectile points utilized
by this culture and assigned the name of Sandia seemed familiar.
I was convinced that I had seen these points somewhere before.

I

immediately began a search through my collection of artifacts to
determine if I had this peculiar point.

Almost immediately I dis-

covered the point shown on Plate 30.

This resembles the illustra-

tions of the Sandia points, as found and reported by Hibben. It is
41/~ centimeters in length, 1% centimeters in width at the shoulder,
and almost a,~ e~ntimeter in thickness at the thickest place, which
is at the shoulder. This projectile has the characteristic point at
both extremities, and the still more characteristic indentation or
"shoulder," where normally would be found the tangs of later cultures.

The point is rather crudely flaked when compared with the

workmanship found on the Yuma or Folsom Cultures.

The flaking

was apparently effected by pressure with a rather large flaking tool,
as the flakes are fairly large?* The material used in the shaping of
this point is a fragment, apparently found on the surface a~ it shows
some weathering, of brownish yellow, highly altered limestone. This
fragment of metamorphosed limestone is composed of approximately 80 per cent secondary chert, as revealed by examination
under a high power binocular microscope,
point nowhere compares with the very
found in the Yuma or Folsom artifacts.

The flaking of this

excellent craftsmanship

It is to be regretted that the exact time this point was found cannot
*]~dtorial No~e : Possibly by l~¢¢ussiono

Texas Archeolagical and Paleontological Society

be definitely reported. It is, however, fortunate that the locality
where the point was found, was noted on the point by the symbol
"A". This symbol indicated that the point was found in Andrews
County, Texas. This gave me a very fair clue as to the time it was
found, since my most intensive searching in this region occurred
some seven years ago, and was confined to a rather limited sand
dune area, which was located on the easteru end of a major sand
dune trend. At the time of the finding of this point, I am sure that
I considered it to be a "sport" or a crude and imperfect projectile,
because most of the points found in the area were Pueblo in type.
Published in the September, 1940, Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society was a report by this writer, and
Mrs. Fritz, of the fin’ding of several fragments and two perfect
Folsom type points in the West Texas area. In this article it was
observed that in one area in Andrews County, Texas, were found
the greatest number of Folsom points or fragments, as well as the
greatest number of Yuma type points or fragments. It is interesting
to note that this Sandia type point also was found in this rather
limited area.

Possibly it is coincidence, but a skull that presented

some unusual development which was commented on by Dr. Ray
in the September, 19’-10, Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society, was also found in the same area.

In this area is a trend of sand dunes extending in au east to
west direction in southern Andrews County. This is, so far as
I have been able to determine, the only east-west trending series
of sand dunes in the West Texas-Southeastern New Mexico area.
This may be the explanation as to the selection of this area by
man as a living site. Most of the camp sites arc found on the
south flanks of the major sand dune trend, and would receive
protection from winter winds from the north. The eastern extremity
of this trend is only a few miles west of the Odessa-Andrews paved
highway. The western extremity of this series of sand dunes is a
few miles east of the New Mexico-Texas state line, and intersects
the North-South trending scries of sand dunes, which appear as far
south as Pecos County, Texas. The most prolific area, yet determined, of the Folsom, Yuma, and Sandia type points occur in the
most eastern portion of the East-West trend, in an area covering
approximately six miles long and some three miles wide. Game was

R~ports and

173

probably abundant in this region at the time of occupation as even
now one occasionally will see native antelope in the general area.
Also edible dwarf oak acorns still grow in abundance. Water probably was also available as numerous thickets and growths of willow
trees still exist, indicating a near surface source of water. It is suspected that all of these sand dune trends are the remnants of old
drainage systems which have long past reached geologic "old age."
In a few places numerous fragments of weathered bone, and a
distinct change in the color of the stratified soil, suggests that fossil
deposits are present.

Proper excavation might reveal Folsom, Yuma,

or Sandia points associated with these suspected fossil deposits.
This suggestion is based chiefly upon surface finds of these cultures
in the vicinity of, and w~thin the same sand dune blowout, as that
containing the weathered bone fragments. A few years ago I directed a representative of the University of Texas to a similar site
of weathered bone, and changed soil color in the sand dunes of
Eastern Winkler County, Texas, and not so very far south of the
site under study. It was reported to me, by oral communication,
that preliminary excavation in this site had shown fossil deposits of
camel, bison, and horse.

I wish to advance the thought that this

area offers possibilities in bringing to light more information on
"Ancient Man."

(3) .4 Typographical Error
In an article in the Vol. 12, 1940, Bulletin, entitled "Triangular
Points of Red River County," by George T. Wright, there occurs a
typographical error, on the first line of page 174, which reads, "This
type embraces all symmetrical points . . ." It should read asymmetricaL--C. N. R.

(4) Two Mistakes Made By the Editor
The "Iron Button"

In an article entitled "Some Unusual Cremated Burials Found
Near Colorado, Texas," printed in Volume Eight, 1936, of this Bul-

174

Texa~ Arckeological and Paleontological Society

tetin series the writer suggested an erroneous deduction based on
the finding of what then seemed to be a rusted iron trousers button
in the cave deposit with four serrated arrow heads, and some long
headed skeletons.
The object erroneously identified by the writer as a trousers button has the exact size and shape of a common type of metal trousers button, it also has a hole in the center, and in every respect
superficially resembles a much rusted iron button of the type used
on a workman’s overalls. To the naked eye it has the typical brown
rough rusted texture of an old button. It was so self evident that it
was a button that the writer and his assistant who helped excavate it,
and every one else to whom it was shown, until Dr. A. E. Jenks saw
it in 1937, accepted it as such without question.
In December, 1937, Dr. A. E. Jenks made his second visit to
Abilene (1) and among many things was shown this object, and he
immediately questioned the identification as a button, and applied
a geologist’s len~ to it with the result that it was found not to be a
button but composed of a substance having a crystalline structure
which probably is crystalline iron similar to many larger brown
iron crystals to be found in this region.
Evidently the exact size and form of a button assumed by this
crystal structure was purely accidental.
The writer has intended to make this correction each year since
then but in the rush of editing and getting out the Bulletins has
previously overlooked the matter until after the books were issued.
On the same page is mentioned the occurrence of a Venetian blue
glass bead on the surface of the bottom of a sand dune blowout with
serrated points, and the later finding of a long headed burial at the
same spot when the wind had blown the surface down deeper. While
the facts concerning the finding of the glass bead are unquestionably
true it should also be mentioned that the blowout is in a plowed field,
and the bead could have been dropped by some one at a later date.
We Regret Printing It
There are very few editors who remain active during a long period
1. Dr, A. E, Jenks visited Abilene sites with the writer in August, 1929, and again
in December, 1937.

who have not printed articles or pictures which at the time were
thought to be significant but which later evidence indicated were
rmt. We now regret having published an article entitled "A Prehistoric Cremated Burial of the Abilene Region," Voh VIII, 1936,
Bulletin of the Society. At the present time we believe that the
only scientific significance in the article is in the extracts from correspondence with Mr. Vane Huskey and the associated comments
concerning Nueces Canyon scored stones.--C. N. R.

(5) An Agreement On Abilene Region Terminology
Most of the research in the Abilene region thus far has been done
by the undersigned. We have to a large extent used different terms
for the same artifacts and cultures. This has resulted in some confusion as to the identity of various types mentioned.
To end this confusion, the following chart is published showing
the old designations in the middle column, and the new ones to the
left. On the right are short lists of type artifacts of each culture, it
being understood that these are not complete lists of the components
of any of the cultures listed. This chart is only concerned with a
brief listing of some of the common marker culture types and their
probable placement in time.
Finer differentiations can await the accumulation of more specific
knowledge.
The mano and metate are found in the whole series.

(6) ¢tnother Type o[ Gibson Site Point

Early in June, 1941, the writer again visited the Gibson Site following a heavy creek rise; and finding the cold water had receded
enough to permit examination, sent his assistant, John Allen, across
to examine the bank. He soon located a point embedded just below
the gravel stratum at a depth below the soil surface of 24 feet, 3
inches.
Despite the writer’s recovery from illness, a short time previously,
he then plunged in to verify the depth and nature of the find, and
fortunately with no bad results.
The point is two and three-eighths inches long and three-fourths
of an inch broad.
This flint has the size and the twisted blade characteristic of one
of the Clear Fork Culture dart heads. The base is bevelled to the
right on the right edge, but the left edge of the base is straight. If
this point were bevelled to the right on both edges of the base, it
would carry the characteristics of both of the first twrr types of Clear
Fork Culture dart heads described, combined in one point.1 A
point having only the right edge bevelled is something not previously
noticed. Last year a Clear Fork point bevelled to the right on both
edges of the base was found in the loose gravel of the stream bed
below the Gibson stratified deposits where it could have washed out
of the site. Previously a long narrow Clear Fork gouge was found
in the same loose gravel below the midden strata. There are some,
at present indistinct indications, that the genesis of the Clear Fork
Culture may lie somewhere deep in the Durst Silt deposits.--C. N. R.

(7) The Society Acquires A New Museum Case

Several years ago the University of Texas excavated a mastodon
skeleton from a Taylor County site which I showed them. The
tusks were beautifully prepared in Austin and returned to Abilene
to be shown in the Museum of "The Society," which is housed in
the West Texas Resource and Mu~um Institute of the West Texas
Chamber of Commerce. No museum case then installed in the
I. The Clear Fork Culture Complex, Vol. 10, 1938, Plate 25, No. 1, top four rows
of dart heads.

178

Texa~ Archeological and Paleontologi~ Society

Institute was large enough to receive the tusks and they remained in
storage in the musem’s vault for a period of two years. During
the spring of 1941 permission was obtained for the installation of
a new double case of sufficient size to hold die tusks, and in addition a collection of other bones of prehistoric animals. In a space
of somewhat over three hours time I saw thirty persons, and raised
the sum of $175.50 in cash from twenty-seven of thera, with which
to build the case. This case is three feet, eight inches wide, eight
feet long, and seven feet tall. The case has a floor deck and four
plate glass exhibition shelves. It is one of six fine museum cases
owned by Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society which
are installed in the West Texas Resource and Museum Institute in
Abilene, Texas. Four of these are single cases which are glassed
on the front and ends only and made to stand against the walls. Two
of them are double sized cases, plate glassed on both sides, and the
ends. The six cases, which are entirely paid for, cost the sum of
$775.50.--C. N. R.

INDIAN PICTOGRAPHS AND PETROGLYPHS
IN THE PANHANDLE REGION OF TEXAS
BY FOP.REST

KIRKLAND~*

In these times when so much stress is being laid on evidence of
age, when so many archeologists are concentrating on work that
promises to shed light on the age of America’s oldest inhabitants,
and when the burden of so many archeo!ogical reports seems to be
the proof of great age, it may seem a bit unusual for one to continue year after year working and reporting on a project that deals
chiefly with comparatively recent cuhures and, so far, has been
useful only in dating historic time. The study which the writer
and his wife have been making of Texas Indian pictographs is just
such a project.I
The two weeks we spent last summer (1941) in the Panhandle
region was our seventh vacation devoted to the project. Through
the splendid cooperation of Floyd V. Studer of Amarillo, Curator
of Archeology and Paleontology at the Panhandle Plains Museum
at Canyon, and the owners and foremen of the ranches on which
we worked, we were able to visit and copy every legible picture at
eleven sites in the region--every known site with the exception of
two or three which contain only a few unimportant designs. Washed
out bridges and roads prevented our reaching these.
The object of this paper is to describe and reproduce the best
examples of the Panhandle Indian pictures. And although none
of the~ pictures date back more than a few hundred years at most,
the great majority being historic, we believe they furnish interesting and valuable information about certain Indian tribes that
once inhabited the state--information that is well worth collecting and reporting now while it is still available.

The soft sand-

stone on which the designs were painted or carved is already beginning to disintegrate and destroy this crude but interesting record
left by the Indians.
The Panhandle pictures are chiefly petroglyphs- carved,
scratched, or pecked into the rocks. They are of two apparently

unrelated types, evidently representing different cultures and, no
doubt, are widely separated in time. One type, (Plate 3, No. 3)
found at only two sites, consists of crude human and animal figures
and human tracks coarsely pecked into the exposed surface of hard
limestone boulders. The other type found at eight sites consists
of human and animal representations and various kinds of marks
and designs ca.r~,ed into soft sandstone or lightly scratched on the
sandstone surfaces. These petroglyphs are found on the protected
walls of cliffs and sandstone blocks or in small shelters. Although
there are differences in the subject matter at several sites the similarity of the work indicated that it was produced by related Indians
or tribes.
Pictographs were found at only two sites. A highly conventionalized representation of a man, five feet high, holding a spear in
his right hand (Plate 4, No. 6), and four positive hand prints, all
in dim red paint, were all that remained at one site in Tule Canyon.
Faint indications of another man holding a bow could be made out
on an exposed wall of the cliff. This was also in red. There is
little doubt that this unimportant group is comparatively recent.
The ~ther pictograph site which also contains many petroglyphs
is on a small tributary of the Canadian River in a rock shelter at
Rocky Dell about six miles northwest of Adrian. This is the largest
and best known group of pictures in the Panhandle (Plate 1; Nos. 1,
2, 3). It was reported as far back as 1853 and was described in
Mallery’s classic monograph on American Pictographs in 1880.
Jackson gives an excellent review of its history in his "Picture
Writing of Texas Indians."
The outstanding picture at the site is that of a strange animal
13 ft. long, with horns, a vicious mouth, and a forked tail, (Plate
1; No. 1). It faces a smaller animal with long ears and tail and
what appears to be an ~nthropomorphic man 4 ft. tall. This
strange animal is said to represent the plumed serpent, guardian
of the water--a myth of the Pueblos; who were in New Mexico a

little more than a hundred miles to the west.

This may be true

since Pueblo potsherds have been found at the site, but the writer
has found no proof of the claim.

There are several positive hand-

prints in white, red, and black, and numerous other smaller pictures
of animals and men at the site. The colors used were red, black,
yellow, and white. Unfortunately the principal designs have been
chalked so heavily that it was difficult to make accurate copies.
Some antiquity has been claimed for these pictographs, but it should
be noted that one of the dimmest groups at the site shows a buffalo
hunt with a man riding a horse, (Plate 1; No. 3). This is the only
pictograph at the site showing white influence, but it is unmistakable
evidence that at least part of the designs are comparatively recent.
The many petroglyphs at the site are either sharply incised into or
lightly scratched on the shelter wall or floor and are in poor state
of preservation. They consist of many aimless lines, simple geometrical designs (Plate 2; Nos. 1, 4), and human and animal representations, (Plate 2; Nos. 5, 6, 7).

The dozen or more outlines

of sandals on the shelter floor are unique, (Plate 2; Nos. 1, 2, 3,
5).

No other such designs were found in the Panhandle, nor have

we found similar designs anywhere else in Texas.
tepees were only found at this site, (Plate 2; Nos. 2, 8).

Pictures of
The horse-

back rider and the church date the work as historic, (Plate 2; No. 2).
No similarity between the pictographs and petroglyphs at the site
could be recognized that even suggested that they were made by
the same Indians. The fact that similar petroglyphs were found at
seven other sites nearby containing no pictographs leads to the
conclusion that they were not made by the same Indians.

The site

was probably a buffalo hunting camp visited at different times by
various tribes wtfich would easily account for the two radically
different types of work, even since historic time.
The next site of importance in the Panhandle is on Mujeres
Creek about 15 miles west of Rocky Dell.

It contains only petro-

glyphs which are both scratched and carved into the protected surface of a sandstone bluff above the creek.

There is a narrow

shelf of earth at the base of the cliff which afforded a small partially protected camping space. The pictures are scattered along
the bluff for about 50 feet and extend from 5 ft. above the ground

14

Texa~ Araheological and Paleontological Society

to about 12 ft. The scratched designs were probably never very
clear; but the carved pictures are still in good condition.
An interesting feature was first noticed at this site---the scraping
off of the rock within certain pictures to give them a smooth surface. The grooved outline of the picture, however, was not scraped
away, (Plate 3; Nos. 1, 2). In two cases smaller petroglyphs were
carved on this smooth surface within the large picture (Plate 3;
No. 2), proving that the surfaces were ~raped away by Indians
and not by later white visitors who have carved names, initials, and
dates on most of the smoothed areas as well as on other parts of
the diff.
The twenty or more buffalo pictures at this site average about
2 ft. long and are similar to those at three other sites along the
Canadian River, but are more expertly done, (Plate 3; No. 2). The
interesting little group or story telling pictures are almost always the
work of late historic nomads. This is confirmed here by the large
number of horse pictures, (Plate 3; No. 1). The numerous pictures
of guns definitely date the site as very recent, perhaps, just before
the Indians were driven out of the district.
The group of war implements carved into the cliff above the
other petroglyphs and more than 10 ft. above the ground is the most
interesting and detailed group of such weapons yet discovered in

Texas, (Plate 3; No. 2). It consists of three bows, thirteen arrows,
three war clubs, and one gun; most of which are decorated with
feathers or other ornaments. The average length of these weapons
is 20 inches.
Another picture at this site is unique among the petroglyphs we
have copied in Texas.

It is a deeply carved picture of a man about

nine inches high wearing a robe of some sort. The unusual thing
is that it was carefully painted red after it was carved, (Plate 3;
No. 1).

No other color of any kind was found at the site.

We discovered a small petroglyph site on rocks at the end of a
small mesa in front of the ranch house at Browns Camp on the
Matador Ranch.
Creek site.

This site is only three miles west of the Mujeres

A good spring which now furnishes water for Browns

Camp runs from beneath the mesa cap rock. The petroglyphs which
belong to the latc historic period are on exposed or poorly protected rocks and although they were originally carved deep into
the rocks they are now quite dim, (Plate 4; No. 4).

If lightly

scratched designs were ever made at this site, they are completely
gone now.
\VC’e copied the pictures at two more sites on the Matador Ranch.
The.,," are about three miles west of the Dipping Vat Camp which
is twelve miles northwest of Adrian.

One site is on an isolated

mass of soft gray sandstone in a valley near the mouth of Aqua
Piedro Creek. The few deeply cut Indian pictures can hardly be
distinguished from names, dates, and cattle brands carved on the
same surfacd by cow hands.

They are unquestionably very recent

and are unimportant.
The other site is on a red sandstone bluff on the bank of Aqua
Piedro Creek.

It contains ~veral deep cut designs including two

buffalo pictures more than five feet long (Plate 5; Nos. 9, 10), and
a few small lightly scratched pictures of men and horses. The pictures are similar to those at Mujeres Creek but more crudely executed.

There are two more groups of these late historic petroglyphs on
the north side of the Canadian River on the Bivens Ranch, situated
about ten miles west of the U. S. Highway 287 crossing. One is at
Chimney Rock where the Panhandle Plains Museum has built a substantial field house and begun excavating an extensive group of

2O

Texa# Archeological and Paleon$o~ogical Society

house ruins between the Chimney Rock and the end of the mesa.
The petroglyphs are on the bluff at the end of the mesa and on the
side of Chimney Rock itself. Although tbey are badly weathered
and dim and contain no horses or other definite proof of white
contact, they resemble the other late historic pictures so closely that
we feel sure they belong in that period, (Plate 5; Nos. 7, 8).
It does not seem likely that even deep carved lines in the soft
sandstone could have survived the six or seven centuries necessary
to connect them with th~ ruins at the foot of the cliff.
A few of the pictures at this site show more realistic human form
than is usual for petroglyphs, (Plate 5; Nos. 11, 12). They resemble the designs painted on historic buffalo robes and on hiStoric pictographic records like the autobiographies of Sitting Bull.
One of these figures has its surface scraped away like the designs
at Mujeres Creek, suggesting a similar date for the work. Two or
three other pictures of men at the site which we judged to be the
work of white men may actually have been made by these very late
Indians.
About three miles east of Chimney Rock on the end of a small
mesa near the mouth of Lehey Creek is the other late historic petroglyph site. It contains both scratched and carved pictures of animals and men, (Plate 5; Nos. 13, 14). The projectile point pictures at this site are similar to those found at many other late sites
in various parts of Texas.
The eighth and last late historic petroglyph site which we studied
in the Panhandle is on the north rim of the Palo Duro Cauyon a
short way from the Newton Harrell Ranch house, which is located
seventeen miles south of Washburn. The designs are carved and
scratched on the floor of a small shelter in the bank of a spring
creek. The decorations on the men’s clothing are of more than
ordinary interest and the "thunder bird" reminds one of the promi-

nent painted birdsa at Meyers Springs in Terrell County, (Plate
4; No. 5).
We found an entirely different type of petroglyphs on Alibates
Creek, three rhiles from the Canadian River only a few yards from
the well known Alibates Creek house ruins, forty miles north of
Amarillo. The crude pictures were roughly pecked into the top
surfaces of hard limestone boulders. They consisted of a man, two
turtles, a headless animal, and two exaggerated human tracks. On
the same boulders and on others nearby were numerous small cupshaped depressions apparently small mortars not related to the pictu:res in any way. The largest track measures 24 in. long: The
designs are now so badly weathered that they are not easily made
out, (Plate 3; No. 3).
The house ruins, situated only a few yards away, have been carefully excavated and approximately dated by intrusive pottery from
New Mexico at 1200 or 1300 A.D. It has been suggested that the
petroglyphs and the ruins are the work of the same people, which
may be the case, since the rocks are sufficiently hard to have retained the impressions for a long time and the designs show signs
of considerable age; but unfortunately no evidence of any kind
could be found to prove the association.
We investigated another site near.the Gulf Camp, five miles south
of Stinnett, which was reported to have contained eight human
tracks pecked into the top of boulders. We found that all of the
boulders containing the tracks had been removed and divided between several men working at the refinery. We Were able to locate
only one of the rocks which contained two tracks. The stone and
workmanship was similar to that at Alibates Creek. However, the
tracks--one adult and one child--were actual size and so realistically done that one can readily understand why they were first
reported as fossil human tracks,~ (Plate 3; No. 4). An effort should
be made to locate more of these interesting petroglyphs to obtain
more information about the culture.
The above report accounts for every site zeported to us in the
Panhandle region except a pictograph site containing two or three
dim pictures in the Palo Duro Canyon about two miles east of the

three types discussed above.

CHANNELLED POINTS FROM CLEAR FORK
SITES IN NORTH TEXAS
BY ADOLPH H. WITTE

Channelled or Folsom-like points have been reported from many
places in the Southwest. Recently, Ray, (I) Sellards, (2) and
Hibben (3) have described other types of projectiles that were found
in the same stratified sites in which channelled specimens were
found. Finds from certain stratified, stream terrace sites in North
Texas seem to indicate a similar interesting association of ancient
implements.
A brief discussion concerning some of these sites
follows:
Thaxton Ranch
The site is in an old stream terrace on the south side of Little
Wichita River, in Clay County, Texas. The top of the terrace is
estimated to be at least 40 feet above the present water level and
it does not overflow during flood stages.

The artifacts are found

weathering from near the base of the terrace and rest directly upon
undisturbed Permian clay.

The collection includes several Clear

Fork gouges, one turtleback, one graver, four channelled points, and
two ba~s from projectiles of the Yuma type.

The Clear Fork

artifacts were fashioned from pebbles which occur locally in Pleistocene deposits.

In sharp contrast, two of the channelled points and

the fragments from the Yuma-like items are all from a reddish
brown flint. It is quite doubtful that these could have been quarried in the region.

Similar red cherts outcrop in the Palo Duro

Canyon, which is situated two hundred miles westward.

The two

remaining channelled points are of materials which probably were
obtained within this area.

The next three sites to be discussed in this paper are located in
Montague County. The surface formations are of Lower Permian,
Upper Pennsylvanian and a part of the lower Comanche Series of
the Cretaceous. Dissected stream terraces occur along the larger
streams and at various altitudes above the present high water levels.
These terrace deposits consist of reworked materials from the Paleozoic and Cretaceous outcrops. Recently, a number of fossil bones
have been collected from some of the high terraces. Most of the

28

Texa~ Archeological and Paleontological Society

forms discovered to date, apparently are extinct. The following
fauna has been reported to the writer.
Bison, one skull, a small specimen, probably Bison Bison. Beaver
Creek.
Elephant, one molar, tusk, various limb bones. Braden Branch.
"Elephant, one molar. Dye Creek.
Mastodon, several molars, tusk fragments, etc. Dye Creek.
Mastodon, right ramus with molar. Denton Creek.
Saber tooth cat, several canines, apparently too small for Smilodon. Denton Creek.
Alligator, several teeth, skull fragments, etc. Denton Creek.
Turtle, fragments from several carapaces. Denton Creek.
Garfish, a number of scales. Denton Creek.
Farmer’s Creek Site
This is situated in an old stream terrace on the east side of
Farmer’s Creek in Montague County. The estimated elevation above
the present water level in the creek is 35 feet, and the site does not
overflow. Artifacts were collected on the surface of an almost
completely eroded terrace. The specimens found here include 11
Clear Fork gouges, a number of Clear Fork knives, sidescrapers, two
turtlebacks, etc. The base of one channelled point was found.
Big Sandy Creek Site
The locality is an old stream terrace on the south side of Big
Sandy Creek in Montague County. Apparently the top of the terrace is about 20 feet above the present water level in Big Sandy
Creek and does not overflow. The artifacts came from the surface
and edges of the terrace. They include four Clear Fork gouges, one
graver, several knives, one turtleback. The base of one channelled
point was found in this site.
Briar Creek Site
This site is located on a stream terrace on the east side of Briar
Creek in Montague County. The estimated elevation for the top of

the terrace is 40 feet above the present water level in Briar Creek.
This stream intrenchment is sufficient to prevent the site from over.
flowing. The artifacts were discovered near the base of the terrace.
Clear Fork specimens include twelve gouges, two turtlebacks, several
incomplete knives, points and gravers. Two channelled points were
found (see plate 6, tgp row of artifacts).
Cli][ Evans Site
During April of this year (1942) additional data upon the fauna’l
age of the stream terraces in this region came to hand. A fine long
tooth from one of the Edentates was found on the eroded surface of
a Little Wichita River terrace, two miles west of Henrietta. Several unnamed culture types of artifacts were collected in close association with the sloth tooth. This stratified site does not overflow
and is quite similar in height above the present water level to the
four artifact-bearlng stream terraces described previously. Farther
down-stream, the writer has collected extinct mammoth, horse, bison
and other fossil bones from terraces of similar height. Obviously,
the faunal age of these terraces is some stage of the Pleistocene,
and the Clear Fork, Yuma, Folsom, and other unnamed culture
types of artifacts have been sealed within these terraces since that
time.

PREHISTORIC NOVACULITE QUARRIES
OF ARKANSAS
BY HAPmY J. LEMLE¥

Among the best known quarries from which the Indians procured
their flint are the novaculite quarries of Arkansas.1
Novaculite is a siliceous rock, believed to be of sedimentary
origin, having a hardness of seven in a scale in which the diamond
is rated at ten, and occurs in many colors, red, white, pink, blue,
yellow, gray, black, and numerous shades between.

Branner2 gives

the following as an analysis of a typical novaculite: "Silica, 99.45;
alumina, .26; soda, .54; potash, .19; lime, .12; magnesia, a trace;
water, .06."

Novaculites are of two classes, known as the Arkansas and the
Ouachita. The former, a true novaculite, is a fine grained, homogeneous stone 6f waxy luster, translucent, with a marked conchoidal
fracture. The Ouachita stone is less dense, coarser, less translucent
and lacks the waxy ~uster of the true novaculite; and has the dead
appearance of unglazed porcelain. Both stones were used in the
manufacture of stone implements, and for the past hundred years
have been used for whetstones.
The novaculites are found in formations of from 500 to 600 feet
in thickness along the edges of the Ouachita Uplift in west central
Arkansas. Branner3 estimates that there are between 300 and 500
miles of novaculite ridges in the state. On these ridges, principally
in the neighborhood of Hot Springs, but reported at other points
between Hot Springs and the Oklahoma line, a~e ancient pits from
which the novaculite used by the Indians was taken. Implements
of this material are found in great profusion in Arkansas and,

sparsely, as far east as Virginia and as far west as New Mexico.
The quarries near Hot Springs are the largest found in the novaculite area. Groups of these are located on the crest of Indian
Mountain, about two miles northeast of that city, and also near
Magnet Cove on the south arm of Basin Mountain, locally known
as Spanish Diggings Mountain,~* about twelve miles east of Hot
Springs.
Indian Mountain Quarries
These consist of a large excavation on the crest of the ridge and
a number of smaller pits nearby. The large excavation, which is
partially filled with debris, is oval in shape, about 150 by 200 feet,
with its long axis approximately north and south. It has the appearance at the present time of two conical pits, each about 25 ~eet
deep, with a low saddle between. The entire excavation is lined
with small broken pieces of novaculite; and it is possible that the
low saddle refer.red to is a large pile of debris heaped up in the
center thereby giving it the appearance of two pits with shallow
diggings between. Surrounding the large excavation and the smaller
pits referred to, and extending over the adjoining area, are enormous
amounts of broken pieces and chips of novaculite, of almost every
color. This area represented .the work shop used in connection
with the mine. Crude quartzite hammer-stones, used in the excavation and in reshapirig the material, are found in considerable numbers both in and around the quarries. Those collected by us range
in size from two to eight inches in diameter.
The pits on Indian Mountain were observed by Featherstonhaugh
in 1834.z He described them as follows:
"Lofty hills are found there, composed entirely of this material
(novaculite). On one of these I saw several large pits, twenty to
thirty feet deep and as many in diameter, resembling inverted cones,
the insides of which were covered with broken chips of this beautiful
mineral, some white, some red, some carmine, some blue, some quite
opalescent. In and nea~ these pits round and long masses were scattered about, of a hard green stone I had found in place eighteen miles
distant, and none of them too large for the hand. They were, undoubtedly, Indian tools, and these were the quarries from ~vhence the

Indians had formerly obtained the materials they had used for their
arrow heads, and other weapons of offense."

Featherstonhaugh’s estimate of the diameter of the larger pits
falls far too short.
Holmes visited Indian Mountain in 1891, and later described the
quarries.5 He referred to what appeared to be evidence of fire in
some of the lateral diggings. The blackened patches mentioned by
him have now disappeared. At least, the writer has been unable to
find them. However, modern quarrymen who have dug into some
of the ancient quarries around Hot Springs report finding ashes in
the bottoms of some of the pits.
Quarries Near Magnet Cove
The diggings on the south arm of Basin Mountain resemble in a
general way those on Indian Mountain, but are much more extensive. A series of deep and shallow pits extends almost continuously along .the crest of the ridge for a distance of about 3 1-2
miles. In and around these pits are enormous accumulations of
rejectage, in which an occasional hammerstone may be found.
Griswold,6 who evidently saw only a part of the quarries, describes them as follows:
"The so called ’Spanish Diggings’ near Magnet Cove are situated
on ~he crest of a very narrow ridge of novaculite which rises sharply
from the valley of Cove Creek to a height of 500 feet or more above
it. The ’diggings’ consist of round or oval-shaped hollows made ir~
the ledges of the very crest of the ridge, varying from a few feet up
to a hundred or more for the longer axis, by fifty feet in width.
They are comparatively shallow, the largest being perhaps twentyfive feet deep.. They extend along the top of one ridge for more than
a mile, almost changing the top of the ridge from a rounded back to
a hollow trough."

Holmes made a hurried examination of these quarries on the
occasion of his visit to "Indian Mountain and incorporates in his
report a description furnished him by Professor Jenney.7 Jenney
states that the excavations examinel by him consisted of a number
of shallow diggings covering a belt 300 to 600 feet in width and

Mr. J. M. Lowery, of Hot Springs, who owns the land upon which
most of the diggings are located, reports that in the year 1932, a
shaft was sunk in one of the larger pits to a depth of 35 feet through
debris, and that when the shaft was abandoned at this depth, debris
was still in evidence.

So far as we are aware, no complete scientific investigation has
been made as to the depth of, or actual area covered by, the quarries on either Indian or Basin Mountain.

EVIDENCE OF EUROPEAN INFLUENCE IN
THE PICTOGRAPHS OF WEST TEXAS
BY VICTOR J. SMITH

I.

Representations o] Shelter

Man has always been occupied with problems of food, shelter,
clothing, and combat. It is to be expected that the things in which
his interest centered would form the motifs for most of his efforts in
the field of art. Two other factors, however, probably influenced
his selection of petroglyph and pictograph studies. These are the
ego of man sho~m in his efforts to record events reflecting credit
upon himself, and of magic, by which some charm or extra power
is derived. It seems true that these last two factors were of great
influence since an examination of thousands of recorded primitive
drawings yield so many records of warfare, and the hunt, as evidenced by animals or hunting scenes. Relatively few drawings indicate articles of clothing since little distinctive apparel was worn
which could be described within the narrow limitations of rock inscription or painting. It is of some interest, however, to note that
here and there among early inscriptions and drawings are to be
found conventionalized building or shelter forms. This is to be
expected in the Southwest since its occupation by the Spaniards
developed the distinctive type of architecture represented by the
Missions. The interesting fashion in which the Indian artist represented this massive outline, the window openings, roofs, and the
surmounted cross are illustrated in drawings accompanying this
article.
It is important to note that petroglyphs and pictographs generally fall into roughly classified groups as follows:
1. Representations of events, people, situations, or objects, possibly crudely drawn, but intended to show the object or the events
exactly as the artist observed them.
2. Drawings which include symbolism or the representation of
an idea rather than the actual event or object. We may also credit
certain areas of the Old World as well as some of the tropical areas

of the New World with taking the next great culture step and using
pictures for the purpose of representing the sound of syllables or
letters, but it is with the items 1 and 2 above that our discussion is
now centered with respect to the purpose of this paper, i. e., to point
out the use of pictograph representations and conventionalization of
building forms (shelter) among the Indian drawings of West Texas.
Such representations of shelter have appeared among some of the
oldest records of this form of art. Frobineus and Fox2 report rock
engravings representing ancient pile dwellings from the Camonica
Valley of Northern Italy. Crediting these drawings to the Iron
Age they report, "Of particular interest are the frequently recurring pictures of pile dwellings with gable, cupola, or barrel roofs.
Similar structures with gable roofs often topped with phallic symbols are still built by the peasants of Asturias and Galicia in Northwestern Spain who use them as granaries."
In Mallery’s extensive report5 concerning picture-writing there
appear enough shelter representations to indicate that the practice
was not uncommon among the American Indians generally. For
example, he reproduces records of authentic conventionalizations of
the medicine lodge, the lodge of the spirit, the grand medicine lodge,
the trading store, lodges, lodges occupied by girls, agency houses,
dwellings, earth lodges, the tipi, the adobe house, etc. Some of these
drawings are at once to be recognized to be crude but clear representations of log construction, smoking chimneys, etc. Many, on
the other hand, are highly conventionalized from long use, the
meaning of which would not likely be known except by means of the
early and careful type of research and record presented by Mallery.
Reference to the types of shelter or dwellings among North American picture-writing recorded by Mallery (Plateel) will indicate the
similarity of those he observed to many of the West Texas drawings. The exact meaning of the latter has long been lost in obscurity and can now be only a matter of interpretation of the ev.idence and careful comparison with known translations. Other West
Texas forms merge into reasonably definite pictures and are easily
identified as structures of the Spanish Mission type.
My first opportunity to record a conventionalized shelter among
the pictographs was in t921, when Dr. R. A. Smdhalter and myself
made a reconnaisance trip into southern Brewster County. A small

42

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

limestone cliff in Chalk Draw yielded an interesting group of geometrical forms (Plate 8), some decorative and others indicating
conventionalization such as symbols for lightning or for water.

Of

most interest, however, was a row of six lodges, one of which Was
evidently of more importance as if occupied by the leader of the
group. Here, as elsewhere, the main lodge was identified by an
extra rectangular decoration or symbol.

These pictographs, as well

as all others reported from Texas in this paper, were drawn with
red pigments or cinnabar red.

It is to be remembered that Brewster

County is still extensively mined for cinnabar ore (mercury) and
there seems to be no doubt but that this basic pigment was extensively sought after, traded, and highly prized by the Indians. Jack:
son3 in his comprehensive study of Texas pictographs reports almost
this same symbol from Presidio County, which is a short distance
to the West in the Big Bend.

Students interested in a broad survey

of Texas pictographs should by all means consult Mr. Jackson’s valuable contribution.

Other conventionalized drawings in West Texas are likely to
represent temporary dwellings as a series of circles. Research has
indicated this at a number of places, prominently so at Rock Circle
Village in Brewster County. In areas where it was difficult to drive
stakes, stones were nsed to weight down the sides of circular shelters,
hence a series of circles were drawn to represent such a village site.
Other more conventionalized drawings with a similar probable meaning are of rectangular and irregular forms.
Matlery very properly points out the distinctions between the
types of lodges constructed by different tribal groups and records
the symbolism used to distinguish these different types among the
pictographs. He also calls attention to the niceties of interpretation
according to arrangement and the position of elements on a drawing,
if confusion is to be avoided in their solution.
Six reproductions to exact scale in my pictograph collection group

and subject matter, though they are widely scattered geographically.
These are Mission building forms and are illustrated in Plate 9,
Figures 1 to 6;

Figure 1 was copied at the Point of the Rocks

Ranch, near Skillman Grove

in Jeff Davis County (Location 20,

1921) in an overhanging shelter which contained several dim paintings. A hand and arm with star could be recognized as well as the
24 inch wide mission with cross as represented in the illustration.
This was a line drawing and probably could have been drawn with
crayon.

Figure 2 was found on a boulder at the foot of Ajua Frio

Bluff in Brewster County (Location 22, 1921).

This drawing is

smaller in area individually but more massive in effect and is surrounded by correlated and adjacent designs of some interest.

At

Ajua Frio a group of horses and riders suggest other European influences which are altogether quite rare in West Texas generally
with the exception of the Meyers Springs group in the Eastern portion of the Trans-Pecos.

At Meyers’ Springs there are numbers of

priests bearing the cross, stage coach, horses, guns, and other evidence of European influence.7

The third figure was sketched and

photographed at Paint Rock (Location 79, 1924), Texas, by permission of Judge O. L. Sims.

Added interest is centered in the

double roof area (each with a cross) and in the row of nine conventionalized window openings. In this, as well as in many other
cases pointed out by Kirkland,z~ there is much to be considered with
respect to the art of simplified design among the pictographs as
well as items of balance, arrangement of mass, and movement. Figure 4 embodies the idea of an interesting conventionalization representing people entering the church (a series of dots). It is probable, however, this may intend to represent the idea of a center aisle
leading to the altar, since the line wall areas enclose the "footsteps."
Most of the missions did have a walled area to the front of the
structure, hence our thought of footsteps represented in a manner
similar to the indication of horses traveling by a series of "horseshoe" tracks.
It is generally conceded that the time and effort of the artist in
the production of pictographs were not the result of idle scrawling6
as many of them were high out of reach and their production difficult.

It may, therefore, indicate that the recurrence of the cross

on structures could be the result of some belief in the power of the

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

46

white man’s religion and that in other cases the thought of the tepee
or other shelter held a meaning somewhat comparable to our thoughts
of "home" today.

PREHISTORIC PAINTINGS COVERED WITH
STALIGMITIC DEPOSIT
BY Da. CYRus N. RAY
In recent years much has been published concerning prehistoric
American cave and rock shelter paintings and some similarities to
European Paleolithic cave art have been noted. Most of these rock
paintings were made in dry portions of the caves where there was
no subsequent alteration from dripping water. However in March
1941 the writer examined a Texas cave shelter where considerable
surface change had occurred after the paintings were made. This
rock shelter, located ten miles northeast of Moran in Stephens
County, Texas, contained thirteen red paintings and of these four
had become covered with transparent staligmitic deposit since the
paintings were made¯
In the numerous writings about American rock paintings the
writer does not recall seeing in the literature any previous mention of staligmitic deposit covering American rock paintings. The
deposit in this shelter is so transparent that it evidently was overlooked by previous visitors.
The site is located on a hill immediately above the east bank of
a creek where it flows approximately north and south. The limestone capped hill parallels the stream and rises to a height of about
150 feet above the creek. Near the top of the south end of the escarpment a lhnestone ledge faces west and the paintings are on the
vertical wall beneath this overhanging ledge.
Beginning on the north end of the wall and describing the paintings in order from there to the south, we have the following:
The first one is of an exceptionally slender standing human figure.
The head is broad and flat on top and is roughly heart-shaped. The
right arm is bent at the elbow and points down. The left elbow is
also b~nt and the arm points upward. The legs are widely spread
and the phallus is shown. See Plate 13, No. 1.
This painting is of a round ball and from it a line sweeps upward
with a tuft on its end. See Plate 12, No. 3.
The next one shows a small human figure with an irregular halo

5O

or feather head dress above the head and a flattened E like marking
joining its lower border on the right. Plate 12, No. 6.
This painting is of a forked drawing shaped somewhat like a slingshot fork. Plate 12, No. 5.
The next one has a superficial resemblance to the letters G V. The
drawings described above .are all small except the first one.
The next painting is one of a skirted human figure which seems
to be dancing; it is holding the arms extended at full length, the
right held higher than the left, as though whirling in a dance. The
head is round and decorated with three feathers. Beneath the left
arm is a circular object which is represented as in the air and may
be a ball. See Plate 14, Nos. 1 and 2. There is no staligmitic deposit on any of the paintings thus far described.
The ’following described figure is of a man whose head is broad
and flat on top; and it shows the ears, which is unusual. The arms
are extended and slightly bent at the elbows. The right fist is shown
shut and the left open. The legs are widely spread and the feet are
indicated, and also the phallus is shown. This figure is partly
covered with clear staligmitic deposit. This one is 3 feet tall and
14 inches from hand to hand. See Plate 13, No. 2.
This painting is of a round headed man whose arms are half
raised and extended as though in a dance. The legs are widely
spread and the phallus is shown. There is a quite thick deposit of
clear staligmitic deposit over this figure. Plate 13, No~ 3.
The next figure is long, slender, and skirted. The head is broad,
rounded and flat on top. The right arm is extended with what seems
to be the open hand although no fingers show. The left arm is
bent upward at the elbow and something, evidently a fringe, hangs
down from the point of the elbow. This painting is 3 feet, five

inches tall, and eleven inches across from hand to hand. To the
left of the feet an oval object shaped like one of the local Texas
~nanos is shown. See Plate 13, Nos. 4 and 5. This figure has the
greatest thickness of staligmite of any except the next one to be
described.
This painting is so thickly covered with staligmitic deposit that
it cannot be copied. It seems however to have represented another
long slender skirted human figure.
This one shows a thick bodied male which has a broad, flat topped head showing horns. The arms are extended and turned
slightly downward and the right fist is clenched. The legs are
wide spread showing knobs for feet and the phallus is shown. The
figure is 17 inches tall and 12 inches from hand to hand. There
is no staligmitic deposit on this picture, and none on the two following described ones. See Plate 14, No. 3.
All of the previously described figures have been shown standing vertical. The next painting is of a male in horizontal position.
The head lies to the south and is broad and flat on top. The arms
are extended downward. The legs are widely spread, m~d show feel,
and the phallus is shown. Between the upward turned arm and leg
is a peculair four armed object of undetermined type. See Plate 12,
Nos. 1. and 2. This man’s figure is 30 inches long and 17 inches
across from lmnd to hand.
The next painting is of a skirted figure. The head is flattened
on top but narrower than those of the definite males. The right
hand holds a long handled racquet like object higher than the head
and this is fifteen inches long. The human figure otherwise is
twenty-five inches tall and seventeen inches from hand to hand. The
left band and arm arc extended and four fingers may be counted.
See Plate 14, No. 4.
This hill top site is dry except during rains when some water
drains down from the top and falls over the ledge above the paintings. The area on top of the hill is small and ~hether enough lime
gets into solution during these brief rainy periods under pre~nt
conditions to have produced the staligmitic deposit seems rather
doubtful to the writer. If so, it must have required a very long

66

Texas Ar.~heological and Paleontological So~ieSy

period of time to form the staligmitie deposit; which is now about
the thickness of a table knife blade.
Apparently no previous visitor had noticed the deposit until the
writer unwittingly called attention to it in the hearing of a collector of artifacts. At that time little damage had been done to the
paintings. On another visit to the same site about fifteen months
later he found that vandals had chipped off large portions of the
staligmitic deposit and ruined many parts of the underlying paintings.
Whether or not the smaller drawings belong in age with those
representing the human figures would be hard to determine. The
same kind of red paint was used in all the paintings. There is one
feature common to nearly all of this site’s pictures of human beings
which is quite unusual and worthy of note, and that is the extreme
relative breadth of the heads and the unusual flatness of the tops
of the heads. Nearly all of the human figures show a flatness of
the vertex which the writer believes was neither accidental nor coincidental. The sense of motion and other artistic values conveyed
by the human figures would lead one to wonder if the prehistoric
artist did not execute true depictions of some extinct ancient Texas
race which carried an unusual skull flatness.

HISTORIC MATERIAL FROM FIELDER
CANYON CAVE
BY FORREST KIRKLAND

Fielder Canyon runs into the Pecos River on the northeast side
about one mile below the Ozona-Langtry highway crossing in the
northwest corner of Val Verde County, Texas. There are numerous
caves in the district, usually high up the sides of the cliffs and
small mountains.

Many of these caves contain evidence of occu-

pation by the typical Texas "Basket-Maker" Indians.
The cave which we will describe here is in Fielder Canyon about
three miles from its mouth, and under the cap rock thirty feet below
the top of the canyon wall. A long, steep talus extends from the
mouth of the cave downward to the bottom of the canyon which is
about 200 feet below. The mouth of the cave is about 5 feet square.
Its inside width is about 8 feet, its depth 12 feet, and its height 5
feet. There are several large flat rocks in front of the cave. Beyond
these rocks the ground recedes down the talus in narrow flat spaces
like an irregular stairway.
Discovery o] the Cave
The cave was discovered by Waiter Babb, a local rancher, twenty
years ago when his dogs ran a bobcat~ into a hole in the top of the
cave.

In trying to get at the cat, he discovered four or five arrow

foreshafts and a number of small glass beads on a ledge in the cave.
The foreshafts are said to have been of hard wood, about 8 1nches
long and tipped with barbed metal arrow points. The necks of the
points were inserted into the ends of the shafts which were encircled
by flat strips of metal.

These objects were taken to the ranch but

were soon lost and forgotten.

While visiting at the Babb Ranch in 1938, a teacher in the Ozona
~hool happened to mention finding a metal arrow point ou a ridge
near the mouth of Fielder Canyon. This brought to mind the arrow
shafts and beads found many years before and led to a visit to the
cave which was located with some difficulty. Instead of finding
*U. S. loealism for a type of the lynx (Ed.).

62

Texas Archeo~gical ~nd Pal~on$ologic~ Society

additional metal arrow points as was expected, an assortment of
metal objects, broken glass, and trade beads, were discovered on the
cave floor and on the ground around the flat rocks in front of the
entrance. Everything in sight was collected and divided between
the two. The teacher has since moved from Ozona and there is no
record of his part of the material.
Description o] Objects From the Site
The writer and his wife were shown the material in Mr. Babb’s
collection during the summer of 1939 while copying pictographs on
the Babb Ranch. The collection consisted of: More than 150 conical, bell like, metal ornaments one inch long, three-sixteenths of
an :inch in diameter at one end and one.sixteenth inch at the other,
(Plate 15, Nos. 14, 15).
Over 50 flat uniformly cut pieces of metal one inch long, threefourths of an inch wide at one end and one.fourth inch wide at the
other--blanks from which the ornaments were made, (Plate 15;
Nos. 12, 13).
Several fragments of flat hoop iron one inch wide from which
the objects described above appear to have been cut, (Plate 15;’
No. 9). Also fragments of the same material three-fourths of an
inch wide and one-half an inch wide, (Plate 15; Nos. 10, 11).
One iron buckle, one and one-fourth inches long and one and
three-eighths inches wide, similar to buckles used on harness, (Plate
15; No. 4).
Two oblong brass rings formed from heavy brass wire three-sixteenths of an inch iu diameter. The larger ring measures two and
three-fourths inches the long way; the smaller, two and one-half
inches--a shape and size suitable for bracelets, (Plate 15, Nos.
1, 2).
Two brass buttons about three-fourths of an inch in diameter,

similar to buttons used on uniforms. One button contains a raised
floral design, (Plate 15, No. 7) ; the other, a floral border with the
head of a wolf in the center, (Plate 15; No. 8). The school teacher
is said to havre a button from the cave similar to the latter except
that it contains the head of a horn.
Fourteen glass beads about one-eighth of an inch in diameter.
Six are light blue and eight are white, (Plate 15; No. 6).
Several fragments of heavy, colored glass bottles.
One broken flint projectile point, (Plate 15; No. 5) ; and a flake
of flint.

our schedule for 1939 would not allow for immediate investigation.
However in August, 1940, we returned to Babb’s ranch to work out
the problem if poszible. And with the full cooperation of Mr. Babb,
we visited the site, explored for additional material, took photographs, and gathered all the information possible about the cave,
the material, and the early history of the community.
A shallow deposit was found on one side of the cave floor. This
was not completely removed because test pits proved that it consisted only of about two inches of sheep manure and several inches
of sterile chalk from the roof of the cave. We found no midden
or other signs that the cave had been occupied for any great length of
time. Mr. Babb said that he and the teacher found a few metal
ornaments and beads on the cave floor; but we found only two of
the ornaments inside of the cave.
Most of the material found by Babb and the teacher was on the
surface at the base of the flat rocks in front of the cave. It could
not have come from the cave floor, because a crevice in the rock
at the entrance would have caught anything falling from the floor
above. No artifacts were found in the crevice. Most of the objects appeared to have been originally lost on the ground outside
the cave.
Few artifacts were exposed on the surface
site; but by carefully sifting the loose earth
we found on the levels in front of the cave: 75
ornaments, 14 metal blanks, 3 fragments of

glass bead, one fragment o! thick glass bottle, and a pair of small
scissors, (Plate 15; No. 3).
The scissors were found on the surface about twenty feet from
the entrance to the cave. They measure four and one-half inches
long, they are bradded together and have about one-fourth of an
inch broken from one point. They are not different from cheap
modern factory made scissors. They have no trade mark, firm
name, or other means of identification stamped on them. The other
objects are merely duplicates of those already described.
It will be noted that all of the material collected is of European
origin except the projectile point and the sliver of flint. It seems
most likely that these were accidentally associated with the modern
objects since the hill above the cave is covered with flint flakes and
it may have been an ancient flint workshop.
We could find no direct evidence that Indians lost the material
at the cave. However, similar metal ornaments were universally
used by historic Indians, and similar caves in secret, out of the way
places were commonly occupied by them. It seems most unlikely
that a white trader who might have carried such goods would have
occupied a cave in so difficult a location when a desirable place
with level ground, shade trees, and a spring of good water, was
available at the mouth of the canyon only three miles away.
Old Military Post in Fielders Canyon
In the meantime, Mr. Babb had discovered an old half-forgotten
military post about two miles down the canyon from the cave, which
throws considerable light on the cave and its contents. He had
collected from the site of the old post almost a bushel of iron and
glass objects, including many fragments of thick round-bottomed
liquor bottles identical with the glass fragments found at the cave.
If the glass at the cave was contemporaneous with the other objects

there, as it seems to have been, the occupation of the cave must have
been during or after the" time of the encampment. This makes it
seem reasonable to suppose that the old post may have been the
source of the sheet iron bands, buckle, buttons, and other metal
objects found at the cave.
A statement from H. H. Fielder, whose father settled at the mouth
of the canyon which bears his name, was furnished the writer by
Mrs. Josephine Couch of Ozona, Texas, who for some time has been
collecting information in that district for a history of the Langtry
country. He said, "In the early part of ’79 my father, C. S. Fielder,
his brother Zeno Fielder, with my mother and three sisters and myself came to this country. We first camped in the motte~ ~ at Howard
Springs (at the mouth of Fielder Canyon) . . . Renegade Apaches
were thick at that time. They gave little trouble except for the
stealing of horses. During the spring of ’79 my father went to San
Felippe Springs (Del Rio, Texas) and asked an officer in Bullis’
command for soldiers to be placed in our locality. I cannot tell you
just when the soldiers were camped there (at the old fort) or for
how long they stayed, but I do remember them camped there at the
old "Soldiers Camp". It was just a few and they did scout duty
throughout this locality."
Mrs. Couch said that from all the information she had gathered
the camp was established during the summer of 1879 and was occupied by soldiers for al~out five years. She identified the two buttons
from the cave as those used by two-troups of Bullis’ scouts.
Similar Objects Found At Other Places
Bell-shaped metal ornaments were in common use by most Indians
in early pioneer days, and it is said they were an important item in
the stock of early Indian traders.

This is borne out by the fact that

many ornaments of this kind have been found on a camp in Central
Texas near an old Indian trading post, and around the site of Old
Spanish Fort on the Red River.
An assortment of metal objects were taken from a cache between
Marathon and Alpine and are now in the Big Bend Memorial Museum at Alpine. This cache contained several brass rings similar

to the two found at Fielder Canyon Cave and many of the metal
bell-shaped ornaments. A large number of these ornaments and
many glass beads were also found with a burial in Jones County,
Texas, and are now in the Abilene Museum. Similar ornaments
made of brass have recently been found in a mortuary on the Potomac River below Washington, D. C.
Use Made o] the Ornaments
The bell-shaped ornaments are quite common on clothing and
ceremonial objects in most ethnological collections. They were
usually made from bright tin and were used as decorations on
such articles as bags, sheaths, war clubs, and ceremonial images,
(Plate 16; Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4). On these objects they usually served
as sheaths for tassels of bright colored feathers or hair. They were
also used in great numbers as fringes on dance costumes and sandals.
In this way they acted as little bells, giving off a pleasant tinkling
sound with each movement of the dancer.
Conclusions
The assortment of metal objects from the Fielder Canyon site
indicate that it may have been a place where ceremonial paraphernalia and garments were manufactured. The bell-shaped ornaments
were unquestionably manufactured there, because they were found
in all stages of manufacture. The scissors are too light to have
been very serviceable in cutting the metal for the ornaments, but
they would have been excellent for cutting cloth or other thin materials used in making garments. The beads, buttons, and brass
rings fit into the garment factory theory.
The flat rocks in front of the cave would have served well as
work tables; and the fact that most of the objects were found on
or in the soil at the base of these rocks seems best explained by
assuming that the objects were accidentally dropped from these
work tables and trampled into the earth and lost.
Our investigation, therefore, indicates that the Fielder Canyon
Cave site was occupied for a comparatively short time, probably by
roving bands of late historic Indians shortly after 1879, that the
occupants of the site had contact with the military post situated two
miles down the canyon, from which they secured at least some of the

Histo~’ic Material From Fielder Canyon Cave

71

objects found at the site, and that the site was probably used as a
place for manufacturing ornaments, garments, and ceremonial obj ects.

CERTAIN CACHES OF FLINTS FROM
THE NORTH TEXAS AREA
BY ADOLPH H. WITTE
Several similar caches of worked flints have been discovered in
the North Texas area. Data on four lots are in the writer’s file, and
these will be described here. The first two groups are of special
interest as they do not seem to correlate with known culture complexes. This fact itself is not surprising since Texas remains are
largely unexplored and neglected. However some progress has been
made toward outlining a stream terrace chronology based upon
paleontological contents. Obviously these stream terrace explorations should be expanded and accelerated since more and more
ancient implements are discovered each year in the Pleistocene deposits in the state.
Whitzitt Cazhe
A group of 28 unusually large flint implements was brought to
the writer during 1935. The cache had been discovered beneath a
flat stone on the Whitzitt farm in Jack County. The area lies within
the drainage pattern of the Trinity River and the topography is
rough, with scrub oaks and mesquites dominating the landscape.
Various members of the Lower Harpersville formation of the Upper
Pennsylvanian System are exposed along the strike which extends
almost east to west.

The formations exposed consist of sandstones,

shales, and coal measures and do not contain cherts or siliceous
nodules suitable for artifacts.

Subsequently, the writer visited the locality where the cache had
been discovered, but was unable to find middens or workshops
which might be correlated with the cache.
The weight of the cache is six pounds. The average length of the
implements was 3a,/4’’, the width 3", the thickness almost 1~". When
considered as a whole the entire group is somewhat similar in outline, and might be described as ovoid with a point. One flint is
evidently a scraper, as it is chipped only on one face. Another

specimen might be classified as a spokeshave. The opposite edges
of one axe show a curious S twist; as if the blade had been plastic
and had been twisted. Similar "twisted" axes appear to be found
exclusively with Acheulean tools in Europe, according to Burkitt.
All of the tools exhibit long, well controlled flake ~ars. The
technique employed in manufacture is percussion. The edges of all
the tools are dull, indicating considerable use, and perhaps age.
Four of the artifacts are light brown in color; and the source of
this excellent stone is unknown. The re~naining 24 are of a fine
semi-translucent flint usually considered Cretaceous in origin. The
color includes various shades of blue with ~nany light colored spots
due to patination since manufacture~
lohn.~on Cache
This cache was also found within the Trinity River drainage and
was discovered a few inches below the surface of a cultivated
field.

The locality is in Clay County and is approximately 20

miles eastward from where the Whitzitt cache was discovered. The
area is near the contact of the Harpersville and Pueblo formations
and suitable cherts are not found.

This cache consists of 30 implements and the weight is 9 pounds.
With only one exception the individual flints are somewhat smaller
than those of the Whitzitt cache. However, the material is of the
same light blue Cretaceous flint and came from distant quarries.
The largest specimen in the group is a big oval axe with point, and
this measures 7a,~"x6" and is almost 2 inches in thickness. The
pointed end shows considerable battering. There are no grooves
or notches to indicate that this huge 3~ pound object was ever
halted (See Plate 17). One knife-like object is four inches in length
and semihmar in outline. Another specimen, a finely fashioned axe,
exhibits a "twisted" appearance, and is very similar to the one described from the Whitzitt cache. Considered as a whole, the Johnson and Whitzitt caches are surprisingly similar.
Palo Duro Cache
The cache was discovered two feet below the surface of the tableland and in the edge of a sxnall gulch which drains into the Palo
Duro River, a few miles from Canyon, Texas. The cache consists
of 608, sharp, unworked, flint flakes. The weight is 7~/.., pounds.

The materials, red and brown c!mrts. The flakes are from 1 to 4
~nches in length and obviously could have been fashioned into
almost any type of artifact.

The source of this cache, a vast pre-

historic quarry, was discovered a short distance down the canyon.
Many huge hammers and quarrying tools were observed in situ, just
as the ancient miners left them. Countless spalls, chips, and flakes
mantle the slopes below the horizon where the chert nodules are
expo~d.

The chert deposit seems to be Triassic in age.

Much of

the debris has changed color since it has been exposed to weathering.
This fact itself is significant, as Palo Duro cherts and artifacts
seldom exhibit patination.
The picturesque Palo Duro Canyon abounds in archeological stations of various sorts, such as middens, workshops, quarries, and
burials. Shallow oval and deep circular mortar holes are found in
addition to the rare boat-shaped type.
Potter County Cache
This lot, consisting of 81 unworked flakes was discovered 3 feet
below the surface of the tableland in a ravine which drains into
the Canadian River.

The material is of a red varigated chert, pos-

sibly Alabates. The size ranges from 1 inch to 5 and all are covered with gray mineral incrustations. Cord marked pot sherds and
small triangular points with side notches of recent Panhandle types
were observed on the surface of the locality.

THE GENUS BOOTHERIUM, WITH A NEW
RECORD OF ITS OCCURRENCE
BY CUIITIS J. HESSE

The Pleistocene formations of North America are rich in vertebrate remains as well as localities from which collections have been
made. Tar seeps, lake beds, caves, river terraces, and glacial drift
have all contributed and still contribute to the ever growing faunal
list of this epoch.

In no other subdivision of geologic time is our

knowledge of the vertebrate life so complete from the tiny shrew
and vole to the huge Paraelepluts.

Since the first papers on Pleis-

tocene vertebrates appeared in this country, over one hundred years
ago, the detailed knowledge of the animals of these deposits has
steadily increased.
Probably the earliest North American fossil locality to become
well known throughout the world was Bigbone Lick, Kentucky.

As

early as 1739 fossils were collected here and vast quantities of fossil bones were later sent to various Musenms,

Here was collected

a Pleistocene fauna, not extensive in species, but typical of many
later discoveries. The animals of the Bigbone Lick are well known
now.

As the years bare progressed, other localitit~ and Bigbone

Lick itself have yielded additiona! material of the forms represented.
An exception to this generalization is the extinct genus named
Bootherium.

The original specimen, a cranium and incomplete

horncores, was found at Bigbone Lick.

It was a part of the col-

lection made there by Governor William Clark and sent to President
Thomas Jefferson who was keenly interested in such things.
In
1818 C. Wistar described the specimen and regarded it as allied to
the Bison.

A few years later Harlan (!825) confirmed this view

and gave it the name Bos Bombi]rons.

As the years went on the

specimen was mentioned by other authors, but it was not until 1852
that Joseph Leidy recognized the Muskox-like characters of this
queer animal. He gave it the distinctive name Bootherium, bombi.
FOltS.

For almost 100 years our knowledge of this genus has remained
unchanged. Various writers have discu~ed its relationships, some

Texa~ Archeological and Paleontological Society

78

differing but mostly agreeing with Leidy’s interpretation.

In 1908,

Dr. J. W. Gidlcy (p. 683) described a second specimen from the
"Pleistocene, post glacial" of Moorland Swamp, Michigan.

This

specimen was little better than the first, a frontal and complete
horn-cores, the basal rugosities of which; "extended much beyond
l]le horn-core base, nearly or quite meeting tile one from tile opposite side in the median line." Other writers (lid not agree with
Gidley’s generic reference, and believed that his B. sargenti was a
female skull of .~’mbos cavi]rons. This idea does not seem to have
met with wide acceptance and Gidley’s specimen stands in the literature today as he originally referred to it.
In 1915, O. P. Hay (p. 523) described a third species, basing it
on both horncores and frontals of a specimen that had been collected in 1880 at Elel)hant Point, Alaska. This specimen was inter~nediate in its horn characters between the original B. bombijrons
and B. sargenti.

It was designated as B. nivicolens.

specimen was a very poor one, and Gidley did not compare it wida

He did point out that it was more closely allied to

Oviboa (the living Muskox) than it was to the California Euceratherium-Preptoceras forms.

Unfortunately Gidley used a preoccupied

Meanwhile M. Cossmann (1907, p. 6~’1,) had a!:ready sub-

stituted Gidleya as a generic name, and for many years it stood as
such in the literature.

In tire recent work of Frick (1937, p. 560) on

flmse groups, this specimen is regarded as (?) Ovibos but from a
study of Gidley’s figures it seems to the) writer that it is more likely
another Bootherium. This view was also suggested by Gidley himself (1908, p. 684), but due to the confusion of names, it was not
made clear.
This completes the list of described species, so we may now turn
to the additional finds which may be referred to the genus BootherPLATE 18

/urn. Other finds, recorded in the early literature as Bootheriurn
cavi]rons are now regarded as Symbos. The records of Bootheriurn
are few in number and often of questionable accuracy. The first of
these is from Bigbone Lick, Cooper (p. 173) wrote that a second
skull was preserved in the Finnell (Phinnell) Collection which was
made in 1830. The whereabouts of this specimen is today unknown.
Second, in faunal lists and reports of the early 50’s Liedy mentioned
Bootherium as one of the animals found at Natches, Mississippi, but
all evidence seems to indicate that Syrnbos cavi]rons was the animal
he identified. Third, in 1870, after partly draining Beaver Lake in
Newton County, Illinois, skeletons of Mastodon and Bootherium
were supposed to have been found. What became of this material
is unknown, but again it is more likely that the find was S. cavifrons
since this form is more common. These records are all discussed
by O. P. Hay in his work on the Pleistocene of North America.
Hay (1924, p. 263) in discussing a Pleistocene fauna from Kemmswick; Jefferson County, Missouri, mentions a horn core "resembling
that of Bootheriurr~ bombi]rons." This specimen was in the private
collection of Mr. C. W. Beehler of St. Louis. One of the most important finds of material of this genus was that described by Peterson (1926, p. 258) from Frankstown Cave in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, so little of the skull was preserved that the generic deterruination may be uncertain. Frick (1937, p. 565) suggests that this
may possibly represent true Ovibos which was discovered in a nearby
cave. There was, however, considerable skeletal material and a few
teeth with this diseovery, which providing the identification is correct, gives us tim only information we have on these parts of
Bootherium. The latest recorded find of this genus, the usual incomplete cranial roof and broken horns, was described by Barbour
(193!, p. 227). This specimen was probably found near Omaha,
Nebraska, and from the measurements given seems to be slightly
smaller than the genotype. In 1937 Frick (p. 566) records the
finding of three ne~," specimen~ referred to B. nivicoIens in Alaska,
but does not describe the material.
From the above records, we may consider Bootherium as definitely
recorded from Kentucky, Michigan, Alaska, Nebraska and probably Missouri. It is probably recorded from Illinois, Pennsylvania,
and if Gidley’s genus is Bootheriurn, from New Mexico. To this

list we may now add Texas, the southern most record yet established.
Bootherium brazosis n. sp.

Type: An incomplete cranium with bases of horncores, T. A.
M. C. No. 2553.
Locality: This specimen was collected in the spring of 1940 at
Pitt’s Bridge (loc. no. 3), Brazos County, on the Brazos River.
Material has been collected here since 1899 as the river cuts away
its lowest terrace. Few specimens are found in place, but are picked
up, as was this one, on the bars below the eroding banks. The
specimens are mostly fragments, but two fairly complete Paraelephas
skulls have recently been found in place here. That the specimens
are indicative of Pleistocene age, no one would question, but assigning this age to the terrace itself might be open to question, since
the fossils may have been transported to their present site.
Description o] the specimen:

This specimen is less complete than

the others, it consists of the cranial cap made up of the heavy
frontals, with the base of the right horn core and about two-thirds
of the left.

The fragment is well preserved, and since the sutures

are completely obliterated it was probably a fully adult animal.
The most striking feature of the specimen is the great thickness of
the cranial roof in proportion to the size of the skull.

Just hack of

the bases of the ho~u~ cores this is 63 ram. thick, and while there is
some suggestion of thinning anteriorly this roof is approximately
50 ram. thick in the region of the orbits.

The horn cores are round

in cross section, are set on a well marked pedicel and are directed
outward and down. It is difficult to orient the skull cap accurately
enough to say which way the horns are then deflected.

The horn-

cores themselves do not have a heavy burr, but their bases are quite
distinct. The parts preserved are not ridged or grooved and while
they are somewhat rugose they are by no means as much so as
Ovibos or Bison.

There is no sign of the development of exostosis

across the forehead or of any outgrowths on the horns at all. Another outsta:nding feature is the facial angle of the dorsal outline
of the skull. As in the original specimen, this angle is divided
by a line between the bases of the horncores. Allen (1913, p. 211)
gives the figure of 55° for the angle between the front and back
parts of the genotype. In the Texas specimen the angle is 60°+.
In the mid-line of the posterior part of the specimen is a wide but
very low ridge, this feature also is readily seen in Allen’s figure
(p. 211, Fig 45) of the genotype. Little more may be said of the
specimen. Within the heavy boney cap are large sinus cavities and
the general construction of the skull is heavy although it is small.
ReIazionships o] B. brazosis to the other species: Of the three described species of the genus, B. brazosis is most closely allied to the
genotypic one. The three species are most readily distinguished on
the direction, size, and exostosis of the horncores. In B. bombi]rons
the horn cores leave the skull at right angles, have a pedicel, and
curve slightly forward and down. In B. rdvicolens the horn cores
are directed outward and less downward, and on the ripper surface
exostosis has developed to the extent that the pedicel is obscured.
In B. sargen:ti the exostosis has developed even further and the slender horncores sweep forward and downward. This last species has
been regarded by some (see Allen, 1913, p. 214) as a female of
Symbos cavi]rons, which is allied to the true Muskox. The Texas
specimen approaches most closely the condition of B. bombi]rons as
does the specimen recorded by Barbour from Nebraska. From a
careful study of the figures of B. bombi]rons its horncores are much
more ribbed, have a larger, more definite "burr" at their base and
turn down more sharply than those of B. brazosis. Judging from
Allen’s figure of the Kentucky specimen the skull is somewhat arched
transversely between the horncores, while in the Texas form this
area is flat. In size there is little difference, the Texas specimen
is a few millimeters larger in most comparable dimensions.
In this connection it is of interest to note the Nebraska skull
described in 1931. This specimen is somewhat less complete than
the genotype.

The horneores are very similar to those of the Texas

form, but leave the skull at a nmch higher angle, this producing
a broad valley instead of a flat or convex surface between the bases
of the horncores.

In other respects it seems to resemble the geno-

86

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

type and the Texas specimen. It is difficult to evaluate such characters, since we know so little of the genus.
General Relationships of the Genus Bootheriurn
Bootherium is one genus of a family about which we know very
little. Some difference of opinion exists as to the families and
subfamilies into which these groups are divided. In general the
Cavicornia is an old world family, with its present center of distribution in Africa. It originated either in southern Europe or Asia,
although certain genera are undoubtedly of North American origin.
The group is characteristic of the Pleistocene in North America, and
is of particular importance for the domestic forms it contains (sheep,
goats, etc.).
The subfamily Ovibovinae contains one living genus and four
that are extinct. The living form Ovibos is the Muskox, an inhabitant of the tundra of North America. In Pleistocene time it ranged
over Asia and Europe as well as North America as far south as
the United States. Symbos, an extinct genus, is most closely allied
to the living Muskox and was probably an animal of similar habits.
Bootherium discussed in the paper is a third genus, also extinct,
and resembles the Muskox more than any other animal. However it
is distinct enough to suggest that it had different habits, and since
it is so rare it was probably not one of the common Pleistocene
forms. Euceratherium and Preptoceras may be sexual variations
of the same animal. In their characters they are not closely related
to the Muskox, although they have a general re~mblance to the other
animals that make up the subfamily. By some (Frick, 1937, p.
540) they are regarded as between the sheep and the true antelope.
At best we can only regard them as peculiar horned animals of
somewhat uncertain relationships.

A NEW SPECIES OF CAPROMERYX FROM THE
PLEISTOCENE OF WEST TEXAS
BY GRAYSON E. MEADE

INTRODUCTION
During the past few months an intensive search has been made for
Pleistocene vertebrates with which it would be reasonable to expect
to find associated artifacts. In cooperation with the Departtnent of
Geology and the West Texas Museum, exploratory work has been
carried on in eastern New Mexico and a number of counties in
western Texas. In the course of this work a new Pleistocene vertebrate fossil quarry was discovered in Lubbock County.
The site is a former Pleistocene lake basin which was drained and
subsequently dissected by the headward erosion of Yellowhouse
Canyon, a tributary of the Brazos River. The quarry has been
worked intermittently for several weeks whenever the weather permitred. The prospects are excellent for obtaining a fine Pleistocene mammalian as~mblage from this locality. The material discussed in the following pages is from this quarry and was found in
association with Parelephas, Equus, Camelops and as yet unidentified carnivora and rodents.
The genus Capromeryx was described by Matthew (1902) frmn
the Pleistocene deposits in Sheridan County, Nebraska. Frick (!937)
figured two horn-cores of Capromeryx collected at the type locality
which serve to substantiate the association of dentition with horncores of this species. Taylor (191!) and Furlong (1925) described
C. minor and C. mexicana and the horn-cores of these species are
considered as typica! of the genus.
Hesse (1935) suggested the possibility that C./urci]er might have
been collected from the Pliocene exposures at Hay Springs. Frick
(1937) does not consider this a possibility. In as much as his material is recorded as from the Pleistocene the qucstiou may be presumed settled. Frick (t937) described a new genus, Texoceros,
based upon a fragmentary horn-core from the Optima fauna. He
considered that the dentition of Capromeryx ahidens belongs with
1.
The .study involved in the preparation of ~his paper has been forwarded by the
Research Fund of Texas Technological College.

A New Species o] C~promery~

Texoceros. Apparently he reasoned that all the Pliocene species of
Capromeryx are actually Texoceros, with horn-cores like that of the
latter genus. Stirton (1938) pointed out that if the dentition referred by Hesse to Capromeryx ahidens actually belonged with the
horn-core of Texoceros, then Texoceros would automatically become
a synonym of Capromeryx. Either interpretation may be correct,
but in as much as no typical Capromeryx horn-cores have been found
in the Pliocene, it may tentatively be argued that Capromeryx does
not occur in the Pliocene. If this is correct, then the genus Texoceros
would not be synonymous with Capromeryx.
Capromeryx, like many other fossil genera in which there is a
questionable association of parts, is subject to a great diversity of
interpretation. Whether or not the belief that Capromeryx is confined to the Pleistocene is accepted, that is the status of the genus
as it now appears in the literature. The genus Capromeryx, then,
is made up of the following species. C. ]urci[er, C. minor, C. mexicana, C. gidleyi, and C. minimus.

ened antero-posteriorly.

P/3 is similar to the corresponding tooth

of C. minor, but the lingual inflection is broadly U-shaped and not
V-shaped as in the latter species. There is a slight postero-external
inflection.

P/4 is similar to P/3 except that there are two lingual

inflections.

There is but one lingual inflection on P/4 in C. minor.

The anterior inflection is V-shaped; the posterior inflection broad
and shallow.

The external contours of the tooth are like those of

P/3.
The first and second lower molars do not differ from those of
C. minor in any diagnostic way.

M/3 is proportionately narrower

and is longer than the corresponding tooth of C. minor. The third
lobe is well developed, noticeably longer than either of the other
two lobes, though this may partially be the result of the stage of
wear of the teeth. This elongation of the third lobe makes the total
length of the tooth row nearly equal to that of C. minor, despite the
shortness of the other teeth.
C. minor and C. mexicana have jaws which are foreshortened with
a considerable depth of ramus below M/3.

The jaw of C. minimus

does not exhibit these characters. C. minimus is immediately distinguished from C. ]urci]er by its nmeh smaller size and the construction of the premolars.
Description o] horn-cores.---W. T. M. No. 19 (Figure 2) is a small
horn-core, well preserved except for the distal tip of the posterior
prong.

much the longer of the two prongs.

The posterior bea~n is

Although the distal tip is not

preserved its estimated height is less than that of C. mexicana.

It is

considerably longer and more slender than the corresponding beam
of C. minor.

It tapers uniformly from the point of union with the

anterior beam to the distal end.

It is slightly flattened transversely

so that its diameter averages about 2 ram. less in that direction than

From the lateral view it has a forward inclina-

tion which starts just above the point of union of the two beams,
though this inclination is not nearly so pronounced as in C. mexicana.

The posterior face of the larger beam is deeply grooved as in

C. mexicana and C. /urci]er. In C. minimus and C. mexicana the
groove runs ventrally and terminates in the margin of a broad, deep
sulcus that lies at the base of the horn core.

Furlong (1925) states

that there is a similar groove in C. minor, which terminates above a
narrow, deep pit-like sulcus. In C. minimus the anterior face of the
posterior beam has a shallow groove which extends ventrally from
the antero-internal side and terminates on the mid-anterior surface
at the point of junction between the two beams.

Viewed from the

top the anterior and posterior grooves give the appearance of separating the right and left sides of the beam, as though they were
joined in a slightly off-set fashion.

The outer side extends slightly

farther anteriorly than the inner side, while the portion medial to
the two grooves extends farther posteriorly than does the outer side
of the horn core.

The anterior beam is nearly half the height of the posterior beam
measured from the dorsal rim of the orbit. It is triangular in crosssection with the apex of the triangle pointing forward. The posterior
face of the beam is deeply~ concave. Externally, near the anterior
margin is a deep groove which extends from the base of the beam
nearly to the distal end. The anterior beam is similar to the corresponding beam of C. mexicana, C. minor, and C. ]arci]er, but it
is much more reduced.
Another left horn-core W. T. M. No. 20, is not as well preserved
as the one described above, and is badly pitted and etched by solution. It exhibits no particular differences from specimen No. 19
that can be determined except for a slightly more robust anterior
prong and a longer posterior prong; differences that probably arise
from individual variation.
The horn-cores of Capromeryx mexicana differ from those of C.
minor in the slightly different construction of the posterior groove
on the larger prong; in its longer and more slender posterior prong
and in its forward curvature. The anterior prong, is relatively

94

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

longer and more robust and the lateral constriction of the common
base is more pronounced than in C. minor.
Capromeryx minimus horn-cores differ from those of C. mex~cirna
principally in the more reduced anterior prong and the more vertically situated posterior prong. They differ mainly from C. minor
in the reduced anterior prong and the more slender, tapering postterior beam. They appear to differ from those referred by Frick
(1937) to C. furoi]er in the more reduced anterior prong. C. gidleyi
is not figured by Frick (1937), but the measurements given for the
posterior beam indicate a much larger species.
Discu.sslon.--The genus Capromeryx has been considered the most
likely candidate to fill the role as an ancestral form leading to the
modern pronghorn. Hesse (1935) gave an excellent summary of
the genus with a clear consideration of its relationships. There is
good evidence that some one of the species of Texoceros may represent the ancestral form of .4ntilocapra Americana. However, the
horn-core of Texoceros differs greatly from that of the pronghorn.
It is difficult to imagine that it could be modified in the direction
of Antilocapra. Since dental and other skeletal parts do not seem to
debar Texoceros from an ancestral position it may be speculated that
not all the species referred to this genus truly belong there. However, the question of the relationships of various Pliocene .antelopelike genera with zlntilocapra has been discussed by various authors
and there is no new evidence to be presented on the subject at this
time.
Considering Cal~romeryx as made up of the species enumerated
in the introduction, it seems most improbable that it has any close
relationship with the modern pronghorn. The horn-cores are totally
unlike those of the modern pronghorn and it does not seem probable that they could be modified to the pronghorn type. In addition, Capromeryx and .4ntiIocai~ra have been found associated in
the McKittrick and Rancho La Brea Pleistocene deposits. It does
not appear likely that this occurrence represents another example
of an ancestral form existing contemporaneously with an off-shoot
descendant.

VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY
IN TEXAS
BY CURTIS

J.

HESSE

This vast state in which we live is blessed with a great diversity
of natural phenomena. Its climate, vegetation, wild-life, and topography offer many interesting leads to the student. As in these
other fields, so it is with our geology; although the first scientific
papers dealing with it were published one hundred years ago, only
the broad outlines of our geologic map have been drawn.
In studying the thousands of square miles of rocks exposed within
our borders many traces and remains of past life are found. These
were preserved when the surrounding rocks were being deposited
as muds, sands, and gravels. Such objects are fossils, and the collecting and study of them is the science of Paleontology.
Almost everyone is familiar with fossils of one sort or another,
for there is scarcely a county in Texas that has not produced some
fossil material. Indeed, certain of our fossil localities are known
the world over. Fossils themselves may be divided into three
groups, depending upon what type of life they represent. First are
the plants; their leaves, stems, wood, seeds, and sometimes flowers
are found preserved in the rocks. The study of fossil plants is called
paleobotrmy. Second are the animals without backbones, such as
sponges, corals, clams, snails, and insects. These are the most
common of all fossils and the study of them is called Invertebrate
Paleontology. Third, are the animals with a backbone, similar to
those we see about us every day. This is the field with which we
are primarily concerned in the following pages. It is called Vertebrate Paleontology.
The vertebrates are well known to all of us, they are: fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The ]ishes are so ~’amiliar
that they need no characterization. The Amphibia, the bridge form
between land and water, are animals of reptilian appearance but
which in early life breathe by means of gills, go through a metamorphosis and then have air-breathing lungs. This once dominant
group is represented today by the frogs, toads, and salamanders.

98

Texa~ Archeological az~ Paleontological So~y

The reptiles represent one more step forward in that they breathe
by means of lungs throughout life. We have all seen snakes,
lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, the common reptiles of today. These
are cold-blooded, scale-covered animals that are members of a Once
much more wide spread class. The birds are also familiar. They
are derived from the reptiles and retain many reptilian characters.
They are warm blooded, have feathers instead of scales, lay eggs,
and usually can fly. The last, and now dominant group are the
mammals. These are warm blooded, produce milk, and have hair.
Since mart is a. member of this group, it is regarded as the most
highly developed type animal.
With this brief survey of the kinds of vertebrate animals we may
now turn to the great collections of fossils amassed in Museums
to see what has been discovered in Texas by the pick and shovel of
the paleontologist or his collector.
The Paleozoic
Throughout north central Texas, along the eastern edge of the
Panhandle and to some extent irt the Trans-Pecos region there is
a great series of rocks known as the Permian (see Plate 21). These
rocks were deposited partly in the seas and partly on the adjacent
shores some 250 million years ago. One of the oldest and most
important assemblages of vertebrate animals in the world has been
found in the rocks of this ancient Permian shore. Some of the first
of these strange creatures to be discovered were collected, by Jacob
Boll and sent by him to eastern institutions.
There are approximately 100 different kinds of. fishes, amphibians, and reptiles known from these Texas localities. They are animals of estuaries, swamps, lagoons, alluvial, plain~, and open or
dense woodlands. No traces of birds or mammals have been found,
nor have many highly specialized reptiles (running, leaping, or
flying forms) been discovered. These higher types, if evolved at
this time, probably inhabited the higher interior lands.
The amphibia were at the peak of their evolution and the largest
amphibians that ever lived, the Stegocephalia (Stego-covering roof;
cephalo-head), were represented by about 25 species (see Plate 22
B). These animals were about five feet long, with a broad flat
skull, and the general body proportions of an alligator. They were

Vertebrate P~leon~ology in T~as

evidently carnivorous, judging from their sharp recurred teeth and
from numerous coprolites, (fossil excrement) supposed to have
come from them containing bones of fishes and other small vertebrates. Eryops (see Plate 22 C), the form most common in Texas,
was semi-aquatic. Although it had a heavy body, the forms of the
muscle attachments of its bones suggest it was probably capable of
quick movement. Diplocaulus (see Plate 22 D), although a smaller
form, was none the less interesting. The skull of this form was
shaped like an expanded A. The skull length along the side or
wing was about 10 inches and the distance across the posterior tips
of the sides was about 12 inches. The mouth, nares, and eyes were
at the apex of the skull, and the slender weak body was attached
immediately behind at the apex of the inner "V". Although it was
long believed to be a legless form, small leg elements were later discovered, but neither the body nor legs of this amphibian were in
proportion to the skull. This "arrow-shaped" animal evidently lived
in the mud and slime of pools and streams, wriggling its way along.
The amphibia were the dominant type of vertebrate in this and
other Permian faunas, but since that far off time they have steadily
declined in importance and are now represented only by the lowly
salamanders, frogs, and toads.
Of the reptiles on this old shore, there is a greater variety, in
some cases foreshadowing those groups which were to rule the world
in the following geologic era.

Of the 50 or so known kinds found

here in Texas, none are more striking than the Dimetrodon-Edaphosaurus group (see Plate 22 A). These animals resembled in a
general way the alligator.

They were about six feet in length, with

They carried sharp recurred teeth characteristic

of carnivorous animals.

The neural spines of the vertebrae

were

tremendously elongated, extending about three feet above the animal’s back.
For what purpose this great expanded dorsal "fin"
could be used, it is difficult to imagine. It must have been a nuisance to the animal in getting around, and a drain on its vitality to
grow it and keep it in repair.

Faunas similar in age to the Texas Permian have been found in
New Mexico, Oklahoma, and scattered mid-continent localities.
These are in turn related in age and to some extent in kind to
groups of animals found in the Permian of Scotland, Russia, South

lo0

Te~a~s Archeological a~d Paleontological Society

Africa, and China. The University of Chicago, the University of
Michigan, and Harvard have the largest collections from Texas
localities. This material has been extensively studied and described
by.Cope, Case, Williston, and Romer, and is considered by them to
represent one of the most important fossil vertebrate faunas of the
world. Recently, under a Works Progress Administration project,
the Bureau of Econo~nic Geology at the University of Texas has collected some of this material. It is the only large collection of this
age in the possession of any Texas institution.
The Mesozoic
The following great subdivision of geologic time, the Mesozoic
(see Plate 21), began approximately 200 million years ago and
closed with the last retreat of the great inland seas more than 70
million years ago. This is commonly known as the Age of Reptiles,
for throughout this span of time collections show them to have been
the dominating forms. In Texas there is a great suite of rocks that
were deposited in the era, containing both marine and fresh water
beds. Although these rocks have been studied, their sequence worked
out, and distribution plotted, no adequate attempt has been made
to collect their vertebrate fauna. A fairly complete fauna is known
from the Triassic, amphibians, crocodile-like Phytosaurus, and a
few other reptiles having been found. It is indicative of about the
same kind of environment as in the Permian. The Jurassic, which
elsewhere contains the striking sauropodus dinosaur faunas, is not
well represented in Texas. The main Jurassic deposits of this state
are marine, and so far no vertebrates have been found in them. However parts of one dinosaur were found some years ago in Oklahoma.
The last and most widespread of the Mesozoic periods is the Cretaceous. It was the time of the final great invasion of the continent
by shallow seas. Almost everywhere that extensive Cretaceous rocks
are exposed, vertebrate fossils have been found. These rocks are
rich in both marine and land forms, and a wealth of material has
been collected from them in many parts of the world. From Texas
exposures of the Cretaceous have come scattered specimens; a few

fish, one or two Mosasaurs, a fairly good Plesiosaur and Other incomplete records, but nothing approaching the rich fauna of similar
beds in Kansas.
A few fossil fishes here in the collection at A. & M. are of interest
since they are forms related to those of the Cretaceous of the West
Indies and Europe.
A few hundred miles to the. north in the
Niobrara Chalk of Kansas (~ Austin Chalk of Texas) is a large
suite of fossil fishes yet many of the Texas forms are not represeuted there. It is possible that the Kansas fishes represent those
of a near shore part of the ocean, while the Texas species are more
of the open ocean types. The large, impressive Xiphaclinus audax
is recorded from both areas, both Oklahoma and Texas Universities
have good specimens of this form di~overed by Dr. Jo W. Stovall.
Fragments of Mosasaurs or great sea lizards, have been found in
many localities, mostly vertebrae, but the University of Texas has
one good skull and other fairly complete specimens have been found.
These large marine animals resembled, and are related to, the
modern lizard. They had paddles instead of feet, and ranged ia
size from 10 to 50 feet. They were predaceous forms, feeding on
fish, and in that far off day they must have been the rulers of the seas.
One of the most interesting Cretaceous vertebrates is a nearly complete skeleton of a rare Plesiosaur (see Plate 23 B), found near
Marlin, Texas. This is one of the rare types of plesiosaur, called
Trinacromerum, it is a small form about ].2 feet long, with a stout
body. Its head was small but carried a long slender snout armed
with sharp teeth, this, with its large flipper-like paddles made it a
swift, dangerous animal. With these were great sea turtles, some
as much as 10 feet across the shell, and most peculiar of all the
Pterodactyl (Pteranodon) (Plate 23 A), a great toothless flying
reptile with a wing spread of over 20 feet. Although complete
skeletons of these winged reptiles have not been found in Texas,
the only uncrushed bone of such a form was found here a few
years ago. Since the bones of their skeletons were hollow as they
are in birds, and are always as flat as this paper when found, great
difficulty was experienced in identifying this uncrushed element
when it was found. Nothing like it had been seen before. All
these and other strange creatures have been found in the rocks of
the Cretaceous seas.

Texas Archeological ~_nd Paleon$olagical Society

In the past few years it has been noted that certain of the Cretaceous deposits in the Big Bend had dinosaur bones in them as
well as marine forms. It is still too early to say much about the
monstrous dinosaurs of this time in Texas. Mr. Strain’ of the College
of Mines and Metallurgy at E1 Paso and Dr. J. W. Stovall, of the
University of Oklahoma have both been collecting this material.
They report many finds of leg bones and fragmentary parts of
skeletons. The fauna will be, apparently, similar to one in Wyoming. So far Ceratopsian (Plate 23 D), or horned forms, have been
discovered and Trachodont (Plate 23 C), or duckbilled types. The
latter were apparently aquatic, living along the shore lines and
feeding on plants. They were bi-pedal, and a long heavy tail enabled them to walk about in an upright position. Their skull with
its bill some two feet long, does resemble that of a duck, and in all
probability indicates some similarity of feeding habits. The American Museum of Natural History, New York City, has prospected in
this region as well as Dr. Charles W. Gilmore of the U. S. National
Museum, Washington, D. C. It remains to be seen just what Cretaceous fauna of the Big Bend region will contain.
For many years reptilian tracks have been kno~n to occur in the
Cretaceous rocks of Texas. Many of the~ are dinosaur tracks, even
though they are not all large, for not all the dinosaurs were big
animals. Some are without doubt those of other kinds of reptile~,
possibly even of forms about which we know nothing. These tracks
are found at many localities and always excite considerable local
interest. Recently, Mr. Bird, of the American Museum of Natural
History, found the first sauropodus dinosaur tracks that have ever
been discovered near Texas. Another fine series of tracks was obtained by the University of Texas and the American Museum of
Natural History, and moved to a shelter outside the Museum at
Austin.
The Cenozoic
At the end of the Cretaceous most of the great reptilian orders
became extinct, and their place in nature was taken over by the more
adaptable, warm blooded mammals. Although the mammals had
appeared in the Upper Triassic in other parts of the world, we have
none of these early records in Texas. The Cenozoic (see Plate 21),
or Age of Mammals, opened with the deposition of a series of rocks

Vertebrate Paleontology i.n Teo~as

105

called the Eocene. These rocks are well exposed in this state, extending in a broad band from the Louisiana-Arkansas border to the
Rio Grande about Laredo. There are both marine and terrestrial
beds in this extensive formation and invertebrate faunas have been
known from the Eocene of Texas for many years. Shark teeth ~nay
be found at some localities, and a sword-fish rostrum has been recently discovered by H. B. Stenzel of ~e University of Texas. A
few vertebrae of the great primitive whale, Zueglodon, were collected
many years ago in San Angustine County. These were large, free
swimming animals, with a long, slender snout, armed with sharp
teeth. They retained the front paddles, and with their slender bodies
must have been swift moving animals with habits similar to those of
a whale. Complete skeletons of these animals found outside the
state are from 50 to 70 feet long. Another interesting record about
which we know very little is a series of 16 vertebrae discovered a few
miles west of College Station in Burleson County. Dr. Kellogg of
the U. S. National Museum believes that these vertebrae are those of
a sirenian, an animal related to the living sea-cow. If we could find
more of this or other similar specimens it would be of great interest,
since little is known of the fossil history of this group of animals.
Some years ago a single bone of a fossil crocodile was found in
Falls County, but nowhere in Texas has the Eocene produced extensive or even fragmentary vertebrate material. Why this should be
is not at all clear. Leaves, stumps, etc., all show that much of the
area was land. So far as one can tell these formations are as favorable as any for the preservation of vertebrate fossils. Nor can one
say that the fossil fields have not yet been discovered. These Eocene
outcrops have been quite thoroughly explored, and hundreds of invertebrate localities are known.
With the next sub-division of the Cenozoic, the Oligocene, the
story is much the same. Throughout the east and central Texas,
rocks of this age are represented by a formation known as the Catahoula. It has produced one vertebrate fossil, a fragment of an
upper jaw containing four teeth. It was found near Burton, in
Washington County, and is a part of an extinct kind of rhinoceros
known as Caenoptts. On this slim record the dating of these rocks
as Oligocene rests.
In the Big Bend region of the state are extensive lake deposits

made up of volcanic tuffs and other sediments. These beds lie
above the Cretaceous in that region, so it has long been known that
they represented some part of the Tert!ary or Age of Mammals.
In 1938, Dr. J. W. Stovall of the University of Oklahoma discovered
a locality in these lake beds that contains fossil vertebrates. This
interesting and important locality proves that part of these beds are
Oligocene in age, and the nearest known Oligocene vertebrate faunas
are almost 800 miles to the north! These faunas of the north are
characteristic of the Dakota bad-lands and are found where these
formations are exposed. They are called the White River, from the
very productive areas along that stream. Mr. Stovall has collected
about 10 different kinds of "White River" animals and we await
with interest the results of his future investigations.
One of the most interesting and scientifically important of the
fossil faunas of Texas is that of the Miocene, some 12 million years
old. From the Sabine River near Burkeville, down to the Rio
Grande is a band of clays and sandstones representing the deposits
built up near the mouths of ancient rivers. In these old gravel bars
and silts of the flood plain and delta are the bones of long extinct
animals. These were first discovered in 1860, but it was not until
1914 that a collection was made for scientific study. C.L. Baker,
now head of the Department of Geology at Texas A. & M. College,
then geologist for the Southern Pacific Railway, made a small collection of this material from several localities, .and the results of
his work were published. This aroused the interest of the late Dr.
Mark Francis of Texas A. & M. College, who although he was a
veterinarian, collected fossils as a hobby, and he began to collect
at two of the Miocene localities. By the time of his death in 1936,
Dr. Francis and others had brought together a fairly large and com.prehensive collection of these Miocene vertebrates. The fauna is
now known to occur at several localities in East Texas. That the
animals were washed in by streams is shown by the presence of catfish spines, ganoid scales, and otoliths (ear bones) of fishes. Although shark teeth are also found here, they are abraded and incomPLATE 22

plete, so it is likely they are derived from the Eocene rocks that
were being eroded to form the later deposits.

It is not impossible,

of course, that the Miocene sharks and rays came into the mouths
of fresh water streams, as many of the modern forms do.

From

this formation, near Coldspring, San Jacinto County, comes the
only Amphibian skull known from the Miocene rocks of the world.
Indeed, it is one of two specimens that have been found in the entire
Tertiary of North A~nerica.

This small skull was found by Mrs.

Claude Riley of Crockett, Texas, in 1938, and is being studied by
Dr. Edward H. Taylor of the University of Kansas.

Two species

of turtles, a crocodile and a single snake vertebra make up the list
of reptiles. The mammals of this collection are very interesting,
since this is one of the ~nost Southerly Miocene faunas.

We can

co~npare them with the faunas of similar age in different geographic
regions such as Nebraska and Florida. The influence of latitude
may thus be demonstrated. For example, iu the southern fauna is
a small horse called Miohippus, in the north it is kuown only from
the Ollgocene rocks where it is common.

Here in the south it is a

survivor, a carry-over from an earlier day living aloug with animals
that have evolved far beyond it.
Another odd horse-like creature was Itypoh.ippus, a side branch
of the equine family.

These were three-toed animals with browsing

rather than grazing teeth.

Along with these unusual ~orms is the

true horse of that time, Merychippus. A cmnplete skeleton of this
fortn was recently found by Claude Riley of Conroe. It is now in
the American h{useum.

One of the most striking anhnals of this

fauna is Prosynthetoceras ]rancisi, (Plate 24 A) an antelope. It
had the usual pair of horns behind each eye socket, and in addition
it carried a forked horn at the tip of the snout just back of the nostrils. Only six skulls of these strange beasts are known and all have
come from Texas. In Miocene time it must have been a very common form, for many loose teeth and fragments of horn cores are in
collection ,here at A. & M. College.

It is interesting to note that

prior to 1935 the very existence of such an animal was unsuspected.
Another unusual animal of this fauna is the great Amphioeyonine
dog, commonly called the bear-dog. The skeleton of this animal was
similar to that of the dog, but the teeth were similar to those of a
bear.

This must have been a formidahle animal; it was as large or

110

Tez, as A~-cheological and Paleontological Society

larger than a grizzly bear and capable of the same muscular achievements. The remainder of the fauna is made up of more normal
mammals, but all are long extinct forms. There is a peccary,
camel, dog, rhinoceros, and other forms similar to those found in
the Miocene deposits to the north. Unfortunately, the general preservation of this fauna is not good. Most of the specimens are fragments and loose teeth. However, the finding of the horse skeleton
by Mr. Riley suggests the possibility of better material to be found
in the future.
The Pliocene deposits of Texas are well developed, covering most
of the Panhandle, as well as a strip similar to the Miocene in the
coastal region. In the latter area, some distance east of Beeville,
the University of Texas has discovered a rich deposit of Pliocene
,bones in a quarry and several other productive localities. It is too
early to say much about this fauna yet, but it appears to be one of
the most important discoveries made within the state. Much of this
collection is now being studied by Dr. Joseph T. Gregory of the
University of Michigan, who was at the University of Texas at the
time the collection was made. The Pliocene of the Panhandle stands
close to the Permian in the wealth of material it has produced and
in the number of good collecting localities. These beds were first
worked by Cummins and Cope in the early 1890’s, and the results
of their investigations were published in the Fourth Annual Report
of the Geological Survey of Texas. This is the first important paper
to deal with the fossil vertebrates of Texas, and the first collection
of any size to be made by a Texas institution. Later this region was
worked by the American Museum of New York, and a large collection obtained. Local people made some collections, but not until
1928 did interest in this region revive. In that year C. L. Baker and
associates, while working on the geology of Hemphill County discovered about 30 localities in that county where vertebrates could
be obtained. The University of California worked these and other
localities each summer from 1928 until 1933, obtaining much material. Denver Museum of Natural History and the Frick-American
Museum parties have all worked in this region. Through the efforts
of F. V. Studer of Amarillo and others a museum has been established at the West Texas State Teachers College at Canyon, and that
institution is now working this field. The late Mr. C. Stuart John-

V~r~ebra~e Paleontology in Texans

ston was most active in forwarding the paleontological work of this
museum.

His untimely death was a serious blow to the work in

this area.

However, Dr. A. McAlpin is now in charge of the paleon-

tological work there so the area is not being neglected.

Texas Tech-

nological College at Lubbock has recently established a museum
and Mr. Ike Meade is in charge of their program.

All this points

toward a period of great activity in the Panhandle.
The fauna is a rich one and there are many localities from which
it comes.

It was preserved in stream channels, and is made up of

those forms inhabiting the open grass lands as wel! as the streamborder types. It represents conditions similar to those of a few
years back in that same area, where winding streams with their
forested bottom lands were a meeting place of the plains-roving
bison, antelope, and wild horse, as well as the forest dwelling deer,
and elk all drawn together by a common need of water.

The Plio-

eene animals were caught in quicksands, drowned at water holes,
or died naturally and their bodies swept away in floods.

Many

modes of death sugg~..’.st the~nselves for these skeletons. Today we
find the bones in the channel deposits of those vanished rivers.
There were three different kiuds of horse, and they are the most
common animaI iu the fauna.

They must have roamed the plains in

great herds, as did the bison of later day.

These horses and the

antelope called Cat)rom, eryx probably represent true plains types.
The rhiuoeeros was fairly connnon, and the largest skull of any
ancient or living rhinoceros was collected just nine miles east of
Miami, Texas.

There were two different kinds of rhinos present, a

horned and a supposedly hornless form.

The rhinos, and the sev-

eral kinds of camels from these deposits, were probably inhabitants
of the savanna-like bottoms, where they browsed on the trees and
brush.

The beaver, raccoon, badger, and deer-like animals, all

found in these sands, suggest 12he more forested stream-border association.

Carnivores were common, from the great bear-dbgs, ~veral

kinds of wolves and foxes to the saber-tooth eat, a forerunner of the

been many animals of which we have found no trace, nevertheless,
the Pliocene o~ the Panhandle gives a fairly complete picture of the
life of that day.

The epoch seems to have been the last of the times

when the great mammals held sway.

Three notable events marked the history of life on earth during
the Pleistocene. First, the epoch was marked by the encroachment
a] tire continental ice sheet that was to advance and retreat over the
northern hemisphere for the next million years. Second, vast
changes in the geograp]~ic distribution o] the mammals were brought
about, accompanied by the extinction of many forms. Third, at
some time early in the epoch, probably in Southeast Asia, man ]irst
appeared. The great continental ice cap, such as Greenland now
carries, made four major advances and retreats in North America.
At the maximum of the advance, the ice cap extended as far south
as Kansas, but did not reach any part of Texas. However it must
have had great influence on the climate of this area. During the
retreats, both the flora and fauna moved back into the glaciated
area. At the maximum retreat of the ice, conditions were much the
same as they are today, indeed some believe that we are living in
an interglacial stage now.
The fauna of this epoch, as we know it, was a rich one. This is
probably due to its being the latest of all fossil faunas, and therefore has suffered less from the vicissitudes of time. Specimens of
this age are common, some deposits are incredibly rich. Within
the glaciated area to the north the deposits of the four advances and
retreats can be made out, thus dating any fauna found within them.
Outside this area, in Texas for example, such a ready reference cannot be made. Our Pleistocene deposits are extremely difficult to
date as to whether they are early or late, since we do not have a
clear picture or the chronology of the fauna either in Texas or elsewhere in North America. We know that the horse became extinct
here in North America during the Pleistocene, but when this occurred we are uncertain. It may be possible, in time, to build up
a picture of this million year old epoch, with the time of extinction
of the various forms worked out. This would be invaluable in dating

It has been done to some degree in Europe.

The most striking thing about the Pleistocene fauna is not unusual animals, but the vast changes in the distribution and extinction that have occurred. Elephants and the elephant-like Mastodons
were very common in Texas, and their remains have been discovered in hundreds of places within our state. They probably lived
up to comparatively recent time, at least until the first men reached
this part of the world. The rhinoceros became extinct here at the
close of the Pliocene, and I am aware of no record of them in the
Pleistocene of the New World. The bison and its relatives made its
first appearance in Pleistocene time. Possibly it was better adapted
to the country, able to reproduce faster or to withstand the clirnate
better than the horse which seems to have occupied the same environmental niche prior to its extinction here in North America.
One of the bison, B. :atifrons, was noted for its tremendous spread
of horns. This animal is not well known. Less than five good
skulls have been found, and never in association with good skeletons. The spread of the horn cores is seldom under six feet and
often near seven. When one recalls that this represents but twothirds of the span of the horns as they were in life, some idea of the
great size may be obtained. The animal must have been heavily
built, similar to an ox. With this form, and much more common,
were bisons of approximately the same size as our living form.
With these bisons was a large camel, differing in certain details
from the living forms, and slightly larger. This camel was fairly
common throughout the Pleistocene and until recent times. Along
with it, and much rarer, was a slender legged Llama-like form, first
discovered only a few years ago and known in Texas from a few
fragments. There were several different kinds of antelopes in the
Pleistocene, including the living Antilocapara americana. Another
form, Tetrameryx (see Plate 24 B) had four straight horns arising
just back of the orbit. This animal was first discovered in the sand
pits near Dallas, but it has proven to be fairly common in the Pleistocene of this and other states.
The great ground sloths, now extinct, are represented in almost
every collection made in the Texas Pleistocene. Early in the spring
of 1942 Dr. K. Hussey, of the University" of Houston, was fortu-

116

Texas A~,cheologica~l and Pc~leon~ological Society

nate enough to find most of the skeleton of one of these large creatures. It is called Megatherium and the specimen, from near Humble, Texas, is probably the best yet found in this country. These
large, slow moving creatures were immigrants from South America,
as were the Glyptodons. This latter group resembled very large
Armadillos. Some of the "shells" measure as much as eight feet
in length. Unfortunately, complete specimens of this, or any other
fossil animal are hard to obtain, and it is represented in most collections only by fragments of the big carapace. With these animals was a large lion, the well known saber-toothed cat (Truci]elis
]atalis), wolves, bears, pumas, and all the other elements making up
a complete fauna.
As to the important question of man’s first appearance on this
continent, in fairness to all we must admit is as yet unanswered.
That man was contemporary with certain animals now extinct has
been fairly well established. The important question of when this
was is still open to answer. According to the best evidence we can
obtain the final retreat of the ice, which marked the close of the
Pleistocene occurred approximately 25,000 years ago. No actual
"fossil man" has been found in this country, that is, actual skeletons. Those that have been found in deposits which might be old,
are similar to the Indian skeletons of a later date. Traces of man,
artifacts, fire places, etc., have been discovered in deposits believed
by some to be late Pleistocene. The entire literature of this field
is a difficult one, the question shrouded in controversy, and unbending personalities present a distorted picture. As stated before,
that man was contemporary with certain animals now extinct has
been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Some of these animals, characteristic of the Pleistocene, may have lived on after the last retreat
of the ice, up to a comparatively recent time. Since we have not,
thus far, been able to build up a chronology of cultures here, comparable to that of Europe, the question becomes one of dating the
finds by the beds in which they are found. These deposits, caves,
lake beds, river terraces, and others are among the most difficult of

all formations to date, and especially since the dating must be quite
exact to be of any value. Again we meet wide diversity of opinion
among the geologists, a criterion selected by one man as the key of
the age is considered worthless by another. In the last 15 years
there has been a tremendous increase in interest in the problem and
ten men are at work on it where one was prior to that time. The
studies of the Yuma and Folsom cultures which began some 15 years
ago also holds some promise of the development of a chronological
culture pattern by means of which other finds may be dated. We
must look to the future then, for the solution of this question and
hope that Texas will be the scene of some of the important and definitive discoveries.
As mentioned early in this report, most of the work in the field of
vertebrate paleontology in Texas has been done by institutions outside our state.

ANIMAL HOLE MOLDS IN THE PERMIAN
B~ Cvaus N.
In a deeply gullied depression in Permian red clay and argillaceus shale, located nearly ten miles northwest of Abilene, Texas,
an unusual fossil formation is exposed for a distance of more than
two hundred feet across the bottom of the southern portion. The
gullied area is about five hundred feet in diameter and drains to
the north. On top of the north bank the formation is different and
here is an outcrop of thinly laminated arenaceus shale which contains some Permian fossil imprints, ripple marks and a few holes
which were bored vertically through the laminations.
This sandy laminated shale resembles the Castle Peak Permian
shale which contains numerous animal tracks of various species,
which were described by Roy L. Moodie (1) although the tracks seem
not to occur here. Castle Peak is situated 20 miles by road farther
up the same Mulberry Creek valley.
The writer will only attempt to describe the peculiar fossils of
the southern end of the depression mentioned above. Here there is
a bedding plane containing thousands of stone cylinders which lie
vertically in the stratum. These vertically placed cylinders are exposed for a distance of 215 feet near the bottom of the depression.
The vertical thickness of the layer of cylinders varies from twentytwo inches to three feet. The upper portion is eroded away and the
formation once might have been much thicker. (See Plate 25).
The writer has explored the Abilene region during many years
and has not previously found anything like this cylinder deposit.
The cylinders are rather uniform in size within certain limits.
On measurement of cross sections the greater number fail within a
diameter of between seven-eighths and one inch, although a few are
so large as one and three-fourths inches in diameter, and some so
small as five-sixteenths of an inch. The cylinders break off into
various lengths wherever a crack has formed in the shale. A large

percentage of the broken off cylinders are between four and five
inches in length although sections of all lengths up to ten and
seven-eighths inches are found. The bedding plane is filled so
thickly with columns that they crowd each other, and in many places
little or no matrix remains between them. (See Plate 25). In other
places they had penetrated masses of clay more thinly and this has
turned to stone. It is in such places that one can best study the
evidences of the manner in which the cylinders were formed. Many
cylinders show that subsequent to their being formed as holes, and
filling with mud, other holes were excavated beside them which removed enough of their filled substance to gutter out the sides of
the original cylinders for many inches. (See Plate 26, Nos. 4-5-6).
In some more than half of the original column has been removed.
In very large cylinders one may see where a column of one-half inch
diameter has been driven vertically down through the center of a
much larger one. (See Plate 26, Nos. 11 and 15.) The diameters
of all cross sections of any one column are about the same throughout its length, and this is true of even the longest which are three
feet long in some parts of the formation.
Due to erosion the original tops of the columns can not be examined but the bottoms end at approximately the same level and
there are no signs of the cylinders in the red clay below that general level.
The lower ends of the cylinders end abruptly in the stony matrix
in blunt rounded ends of nearly the same size as the remainder of
the columns. (See Plate 26, Nos. 8, 9, 10, 12, 13.) In large pieces
of the stony matrix where the lower end pieces of cylinders have
fallen out, the second finger of a large man will fit snugly into the
ends of some of them. (See Plate 27, Nos. 1, 6, 7, 13, 14.) In other
cases the cylinder ends have remained in the matrix and when removed these somewhat resemble the rounded ends of large bullets.
There are hard stone split matrices which show some longitudinal
sections of the holes with the cylinders fallen out, and some in place;
where the cylinders are out one can see innumerable circular scorings as though some animal had used its claws in excavating the
holes. (See Plate 27, No. 3.) This left the insides of the holes
roughly circularly scored and indented. It seems that then a smooth

Texas Archeological ~nd Paleontological Society

lining of some substance, presumably mud, was applied to the
walls of the holes. There is one cylinder, embedded in its original
stony matrix, which shows on cross section an entire diameter of one
and three-sixteenth inches and of this the outer lining showed a
thickness of nearly one-fourth inch.
There are specimens which show very small pittings such as could
have been made by an arthropod walking on moist clay.
Encrusted in the outside of many of the cylinders are fossil remains of ~only one kind. These are slightly curved, are slender and
from three-eighths to one-half inch in length, and have a shallow
groove lengthwise down the center. These organs always lie crosswise to the long axis of the cylinders. The fossils have an angular
appearance resembling arthropod legs and in two cases there seem
to be miniature hooks at the smaller ends reminiscent of those seen
on a grasshopper’s feet. Some have a resemblance to sections of the
chitinous body shells of small crustaceans. One collection of the leg
like fossils radiates from a common center in a manner somewhat
resembling a crustacean’s legs.
The stone of both cylinders and matrices is the same and is a
very hard clay shale. The centers of the cylinders show no evidences
of fossil remains, the organic remains are embedded in the outer
surfaces of the cylinders in positions which evidently were just inside the linings.
Examination of the stone matrices from which the cylinders and
their linings have fallen shows a manner of excavation reminiscent
of that used by modern crayfish.
This site probably was the shore of a Permian body of water as

shown by the ripple marks and Permian fossils embedded in the
sandy shale of the north portion.
Evide.ntly some gregarious type of animal life lived on its mud
flats in countless thousands, and bored its holes in the moist clay.
Holes eventually filled with mud which later solidified into stone
cylinders; and after the first dug holes filled, other holes were bored
down beside or slanting against them and guttering their sides. Some
smaller holes were bored straight down through the centers of older
filled ones.
The animals died and their remains were left in the soft linings
of the holes’ sides and bottoms.
A small species of crab today bores holes in great numbers in the
flat shorelines of quiet Texas bays and it may be that its far distant crustacean projenitors had similar habits.
"Identification of the animal species which made the holes will
have to await the attention of some one who has the requisite specialized knowledge.

FORREST KIRKLAND

Forrest Kirkland, who died April 2, 1942, was born near Mist,
Arkansas, November 24, 1892. He obtained his early education in
Arkansas and his art training in Battle Creek, Michigan.
Mr. Kirkland was a very successful advertising artist in Dallas
for many years.
In 1932 he became interested in geology as a hobby and collected many fossils and among them found a new species of fossil
jellyfish which was named after him (Rhisostomoides kirklandi) by
Dr. Kenneth E. Caster.
His collecting of fossils brought him into the region of Indian
rock paintings and in 1933 after viewing the rock paintings at Paint
Rock, Texas, he began to make exact copies of Indian paintings in
colors. It was his intention eventually to publish a book of these
paintings in colors. Annually since 1937 when The Bulletin published the first of the series Mr. Kirkland has prepared well written,
beautifully illustrated, articles on Texas Indian pictographs and
petroglyphs for publication therein.
His work was unique in that he was the first person to copy every
legible picture in a cave or shelter to an exact scale and in color.
Mr. Kirkland was a member of the Dallas Art Association and
organized and was President of the Dallas Archeological Society,
Director in the West Texas Historical and Scientific Society, member of the Society for American Archaeology, American Association
for the Advancement of Science, Regional Vice-President of the
Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society, and Fellow of the
Texas Academy of Science.
His work had won much recognition in American art circles, and
his pictographs were shown at the Addison Gallery of American Art
May 20-June 19, 1938, also at The Buffalo Museum of Science, Buffalo, N. Y., in 1940. The entire collection was shown at the Hall
of State, Dallas Historical Museum, and the Dallas Museum of Fine
Arts intends to show his works soon.
Texas art and science have both lost a master craftsman in Forrest Kirkland.

ANCIENT ARTIFACTS AND MAMMOTH’S TEETH
OF THE McLEAN SITE
In July, 1938, the writer conducted Dr. Kirk Bryan and his assistant, Samuel Vaughan, Jr., to a location in the McLean Site where
he had removed the teeth of a mammoth in 1935 with the assistance
of Dr. E. H. Sellards and Otto O. Watts. (1). Subsequent heavy
rains in 1938 had exposed more of the animal’s bones in the hard
alluvium, and in the margin of the hole where the teeth had been
excavated the rains had also exposed the base of a Folsom point. (2)
This Folsom blade was complete except for the small tip of the point
and the blade was more than three inches long. The flint had been
almost in contact with the mammoth’s teeth. (3) The writer had
collected Folsom, Yuma and Clear Fork artifacts from this site’s
gullied silts ever since 1929, but no satisfactory illustrations had
been previously made of them. (4) The 1938 Bulletin article should
have shown the Folsom point found with the Elephas Columbi skeleton (identified by Dr. E. H. Sellards and pictured in plates 35 and
36) but the writer found it to be impossible to get good pictures of
the blade in Abilene. Dr. Kirk Bryan kindly had some pictures of
the McLean Site flints made, which are shown herewith. Of these
Plate (30) shows two views of a typical Clear Fork gouge found in
gravel near another mammoth’s skeleton at a locality situated about
two miles from the McLean Site. Plate (30), No. (I) shows the
gouged out face of this gouge. Plate (30), No. (2) shows the convex face of the same gouge.
Plate (31), Nos. (1) and (3) shows two faces of the mid-section
of a fine Folsom blade found by Floyd V. Studer of Amarillo when
the writer conducted him through the McLean Site in 1929. Plate

by the writer, buried eight feet deep in the McLean Site silt in 1929.
Plate (32), Nos. (1) and (3) show both faces of a channelled blade
the writer found embedded in the alluvium of the McLean Site in
1929. Plate (32), Nos. (2) and (4) are of a dart point found on
the McLean Site alluvium by the writer during Dr. Bryan’s visit.

Dr. Bryan’s visit. Plate (33), Nos. (2) and (4) show the two faces
of a blade found on the McLean Site alluvium in 1929 by the writer.
Plate (34), No. (1) shows the long Folsom blade which was fotind
embedded in the McLean Site Durst Silt by Bryan, Ray and Vaughart
where it had been almost in contact with a mammoth’s teeth. (3)
Plate (34), No. (2) shows a beautifully polished Yuma point found
by the writer in the Durst Silt of the McLean Site during Dr. Bryan’s
visit. Plate (35) shows one of the mammoth’s teeth found with the
Folsom blade, approximately natural size. Plate (36) shows two
teeth of the mammoth’s skeleton found with the Folsom blade (approximately half natural size).
Some bones of other animals were also found in the McLean Site
in 1938 and during previous years, but the writer has not thus far
been able to obtain identifications of them for publication.

WHAT CAUSED THESE PERMIAN GROOVES?
In 1934 the writer found a series of parallel slickened grooves in
a horizontally laid stratum of Permian limestone which forms the
bed of Paint Creek near where it flows into the Clear Fork of the
Brazos. The site is situated approximately thirty miles north of
Albany, Texas, and is across the Brazos River west of the Matthews
family ranch, known as "The Lamb’s Head Ranch."
Paint Creek at the point mentioned flows approximately from
west to east and is here floored by a horizontal bed of Permian
limestone. In very dry periods the creek bed becomes entirely dry
at this locality. The banks rise rather steeply on both sides, and
on the north bank the limestone is covered by a bed of hard packdd
gravel. This coarse gravel is filled with various sized rounded or
water worn stones ; a large percentage of which are of igneous origin.
In Plate 37, No. 2 some of these rounded stones are shown.~ The
two large angular edged stones also pictured in No. 2 are loose
blocks of the limestone composing the stream bed and came from a
break in the stratum above, and have recently been washed down
so as to lie on the gravel formation.
For a considerable distance the stream seems to have been cutting into the north bank and removing the gravel which overlies the
stone, leaving the fresh surface of the Permian limestone exposed.
On this fresh surface are a series of parallel grooves in the limestone
w.hich extend under the bed of gravel in the north bank.
This series of parallel grooves go under the bank in a northeastward direction or diagonally to the west-east direction of the
present stream flow.
It has been the observation of the writer that water worn stone or
wave ripple marks on limestone are rough in finish, and not polishcd
and slickened so that they glisten in sunshine as these do.

The site is isolated and the writer has been able thus far to get
0nly one geologist of note to see it. Unfortunately tile site then had

water in the grooves and the shine on the slickened grooves was not
very noticeable, and the geologist termed them "ripple marks."
The appearance of the grooves is as though several extremely
heavy objects had slid across the surface in parallel formation and
in so doing had produced a series of slickened or highly polished
grooves.
The polish has an appearance exactly like that produced by pushing a hard stone across a bed of damp firm clay.
The stream action flowing from west to east across the grooves
which run north-eastward has entirely removed them in the center
of the stream bed and the grooves are only to be seen along the
north side where they have been exposed within recent years.
If heavy masses of ice formed during a Per~nian period of glaciation and moved across previously formed limestone, it seems that
this might be a possible explanation of the slickened grooves. However nothing else suggesting such a theory has thus far been found.
The writer directs the attention of competent geologists to this
unusual site, and would like to have a satisfactory explanation of it.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
SOCIETY
Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
The Texas Archeological Society (TAS) offers a wide range of opportunities for
those interested in Texas heritage. The mission of the Society is to promote study,
preservation and awareness of Texas archeology. A recent strategic plan calls for the
Society to create training opportunities for students, enhance and expand programs,
increase and diversify membership, inform the community of their archeological heritage
and cultivate and preserve resources. The membership generally numbers around !400o
The Society calendar begins in October with the Annual Meeting, an event that
has taken place since 1929. Archeologists, professional and avocational, get together to
share information in research sessions and to hear from nationalb! renowned luncheon and
banquet speakers. Friday is a popular evening for the public forum with high profile
speakers and artifact identification. Meetings will be held in Lubbock (08) and Del Rio (09).
Each spring TAS offers sessions of the Texas Archeology Academy. Topics in
this series of workshops include Archeology 101 (including a field day), Ceramics: ~ne
Stories Pottery Tells, Lithics: Reading Stone Tools, Historic Archeology and Rock Art of
TeXOSl Each Academy features power point presentations, a manual and hands-on
activities to reinforce concepts presented. In 2009 sessions will be held in Georgetown,
Study Butte, and Lake Jackson. Surveys at the close of sessions reveal that participants
greatly va~ue the information imparted during the workshop and the camaraderie of fellow
students.
The summer brings a field schoot that offers an opportunity for folks to
contribute to research about Texas archeology. The principal investigator is supported
by staff and experienced volunteers. Usually around 300 people participate. Newcomers
appreciate an orientation session before joining crews in the field.

Survey and lab

sessions provide other venues for people who want to learn more about the archeo~ogical
process.

The field school in 2009 will be in the Panhandle near Perryton.

We offer

scholarships to college students and Native Americans. A youth program instructs around
60 students each year.
PuNications of the Society include a journal, the Bulletin of the TAS, a quarterly
newsletter and two web sites,

is the organizational web site that relates

current programs and opportunities. The other web site is ~v~_~e~_a~be~y~dh is_~oL~y~0~L a
