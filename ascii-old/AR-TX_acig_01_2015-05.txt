ABSTRACT
For four days during May of 2015, archaeologists from aci consulting conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of 17 acres (6.87 hectares) for the Abrams-Kiewit Joint Venture
(AKJV) as part of the Loop 375 Border Highway West Extension (tolled lanes). The investigation
focused on two high probability areas (HPAs) within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) on land
administered by the US Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission
(USIBWC). The investigation was performed in accordance with Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) and Texas Historical Commission (THC) guidelines. The survey was conducted under the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) Permit Application No. 24 in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. Ann
M. Scott served as Principal Investigator and Julie Shipp served as Project Archaeologist and
Project Geoarcheologist. Records and diagnostic artifacts recovered from the investigation will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
As part of the transportation project a portion of the roadway (Bridge 17) will be elevated
adjacent to the Rio Grande, which falls under the jurisdiction of the IBWC and requires a license
and approval from the Commission to perform the construction. Bridge 17 will have pier footings
(bents) located in both the Rio Grande floodplain as well as outside of it, at times affecting the
levee road. The investigation in the southernmost HPA (1) was driven by the presence of historic
artifacts on the surface as well as its proximity to the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood. Three
trenches (1, 2, and 3) were excavated in the site area at the location of three bents and
demonstrated the presence of cultural materials to at least 4-5 feet (1.2-1.5 meters) in depth in all
three trenches. A representative sample of artifacts, mostly targeting the diagnostics to aid in
understanding the chronology, were collected and analyzed (n=237). As a result, site 41EP7118
was recorded as a historic artifact scatter. The majority of the artifacts dated from the 1920s
through the 1940s and consisted of glass (n=150), ceramics (n=61), metal items (n=17), bone
(n=4) and miscellaneous objects (n=5). The trench profiles exhibited dumping episodes and none
of the materials appeared to be in situ and no intact features were encountered. While there is
evidence of dumping, it is likely that the dumping did not represent the dumping of household
trash by the inhabitants of Chihuahuita neighborhood. Instead, years of disturbances and other
construction endeavors have affected the integrity of the site and have likely re-deposited
materials from a different location to this site.
Two trenches (4 and 5) were excavated in the floodplain adjacent to the levee road at the northern
end of the project area (HPA 2). No archeological materials were observed in either of the
trenches. Therefore, no site was present in the northern end of the project area.
The area of site 41EP7118 has undergone extensive disturbance and modification over the last
100 years or so. Impacts from the initial construction of irrigation features/Franklin Canal, the
levee road, which was initially constructed prior to 1908, movement and flooding of the Rio
Grande, razing and demolitions in Chihuahuita neighborhood, Rectification of the Rio Grande
and maintenance over the years, and improvements to the railroad, levee, and development of the
American Canal have all contributed to the disturbance of the area of site 41EP7118. Because of
the lack of intact cultural deposits or features, the inability to attribute the materials to significant
people or events, and the compromised site integrity, site 41EP7118 does not meet the criteria for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No further archeological or
archival work is recommended for site 41EP7118. It is further recommended that construction for
Bridge 17 be allowed to proceed.

Due to the nature of the IBWC construction license (a federal action) and further compliance with
Section 106 and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) as well
as the Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711), it is recommended that should any human
remains be encountered during construction on any IBWC administered land that the construction
stop within a 30.5-meter (100-foot) diameter area of the center of the discovery, the area be
secured, and the appropriate personnel contacted to determine the nature of the find and develop
an efficient plan for recovery, if necessary.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), along with Abrams-Kiewitt Joint Venture as
the developer, is proposing to build Loop 375 Border Highway, West Extension (tolled lanes) in
the City of El Paso, El Paso County, Texas. Portions of this highway will be located on lands or
in areas administered by the United States Section, International Boundary and Water
Commission (USIBWC). Furthermore, a license is required from USIBWC for the construction
of Bridge 17, an elevated portion of the highway proposed near the Rio Grande. These actions are
considered federal undertakings and require compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and through a permit under Archeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA). The investigation was supervised by Ann M. Scott, PhD,
Principal Investigator under ARPA Permit No. 24 on behalf of Abrams-Kiewit Joint Venture.

1.1 Project Area
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for this permit consists of a 1,672-meter-(5,485-feet) long by
a variable 16-55-meter- (53-180-feet-) wide (6.87 hectares/17 acres) area where Bridge 17 will be
constructed near the Rio Grande (Figures 1 and 2). The APE for Bridge 17 will include temporary
access roads including one for the construction cranes and for hauling materials. The piers for
Bridge 17 will be up to 12-18 meters (40-60 feet) deep and will be positioned in various places
along the Rio Grande both in and out of the flood plain. The alternate name for the piers of the
elevated bridge are called Bents. The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether sites
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in the APE.

1.2 Environmental Setting
1.2.1 Physiography
The project area is located in the Basin and Range region of west Texas. The topography is hilly
with some peaks as high as 2,438 meters (8,000 feet). The hills slope west toward the Rio Grande
valley at the toe slopes of the Franklin Mountains, which is where the current project is located. It
is a semi-arid region, with vegetation ranging from grassland in the basins to an oak-pine-juniper
mix in the mountains (Wermund 1996).
1.2.2 Climate
El Paso County is hot in the summer and moderately cold in the winter. In winter, the average
temperature is 48 degrees F, although daytime temperatures often reach 55 to 65 degrees F.
Summer temperatures average 95 degrees F in the daytime but fall to about 65 degrees F at night.
Sunshine is abundant year round, and the climate is extremely arid. Rainfall is too light for the
growth of vegetation apart from desert plants; therefore, irrigation is necessary for farm crops,
gardens, and lawns. More than half of the yearly precipitation occurs in the summer months
during brief thunderstorms, and light snowfall occurs almost every winter but rarely covers the
ground. Dust storms and sand storms are easily formed by a moderately strong wind and are
frequent in the spring, especially in March and April. Although possible, they rarely occur at
other times of the year (El-Hage and Moulton 1998).

1.2.3 Geology and Soils

The Franklin Mountains are a north-south trending fault block that has tilted westward. In this
mountain block, formations from the Paleozoic to Holocene are represented (Harbour 1972).
Precambrian cobbles of quartzite, rhyolite porphyry, limestone, basalt, and granite are the
principle sources of materials for chipped stone, ground stone, and hearth stone for prehistoric
people (Hard 1983). Many of these materials are located in local arroyos and washed down
through Fusselman Canyon. These source materials occur in a wide variety of colors and provide
an array of textures for a variety of material type needs. The surface geology at the project
location is mapped as intrusive igneous rocks (Barnes 1974).
The primary soil mapped within the APE is Made land, gila soil material (NRCS 2015). The
landscape within the APE has been significantly altered from urban development, including the
construction of the American Canal, levee, railroads, border patrol road, and border fence. The
landforms were constructed primarily with Gila soil. These soils formed in stratified alluvium
from mixed sources. All of the work performed during this investigation was within this soil.
The westernmost 800 feet (243 meters) of the APE is mapped as Delnorte-Canutio soil. This
forms within the igneous gravels of hilly upland and fan piedmonts. A typical profile of Delnorte
gravelly loam is A-Bkk-Bkkm-BCk, with the unconsolidated bedrock at approximately 20-80
inches (50-203 centimeters) below ground surface. Canutio series soils are similar, with a
shallower BCk1 horizon at approximately 11 inches (28 centimeters) (NRCS 2015).

2.1 Prehistoric Background
Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period which dates
from 11,500-8,800 BP (Collins 1995). As the Pleistocene period ended, diagnostic Paleoindian
artifacts including Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the
archaeological record. These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden
spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls, large game such as mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna,
Paleoindian groups likely harvested less daunting prey including antelope, turtle, frogs, etc. Some
evidence of nomadic hunters of megafauna has been recovered in El Paso County. Clovis,
Folsom, and late Paleoindian projectile points have been recorded during surface collections in
the Hueco Bolson (Carmichael 1986:7-11; MacNeish 1993:159,160; Anderson and Carter 1985;
Largent et al. 1991), suggesting hunting zones and base camps were present. Studies on the
prehistoric Texas environment suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler
(Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to drier and warmer
conditions during the Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off during
the shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant foraging.
Archaic Period
Archaic trends in El Paso County indicate a broader spectrum of subsistence patterns than the
Paleoindian period. Strategies leaned more heavily on gathering than large game hunting and
mobility was slightly more geographically restricted (Shafer 2001). Four temporal phases make
up the Archaic period in this region. These phases are Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP),
Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP), Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP), and Hueco (2,900 BP-800 BP) (MacNeish

1993). This temporal scheme requires additional diagnostic markers and excavated sites with
stratified deposits are rare, but the work of Carmichael (1986) and MacNeish (1993) have
provided archaeologists in this area with a solid point of departure for interpreting a landscape
that is heavily deflated, and subject to intensive development and looting.
Gardner Springs (8,000-6,300 BP)
The archaeological record has not yielded as much data on the Gardner Springs phase as the other
subperiods. Projectile point styles that characterize this phase include Jay, Abasolo, and Bajada
(Anderson 1987; Beckett and MacNeish 1994). Small bands hunted smaller game and exploited
numerous types of microenvironmental zones in the spring and summer. Environments exploited
in the fall tended to be riverine, basin floor, and mountain habitats. Exploited winter sites were
typically in the basin floor playas, but also in higher elevations where acorns and piÃ±on nuts
could be stored for long periods of time (Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993).
Keystone (6,300-4,600 BP)
Like the Gardner phase, the Keystone phase saw fairly static settlement patterns and similar
subsistence strategies. Several Keystone sites have suggested population increases, social stress,
and climatic changes. Projectile point styles indicative of this phase include Bat Cave, Pelona,
Shumla, Gypsum-Almagre, Amargosa, and Todsen. MacNeish states that this phase exhibits âa
subtle shift toward a more efficient desert foraging subsistence system as well as a possible
exploitation of more desert plants from more ecozonesâ (1989:689).
Fresnal (4,600-2,900 BP)
Significant pattern changes occurred during this subperiod. A shift from seasonal camps to more
semi-permanent base camps took place. Domestic plants such as maize, pumpkin, and some
squash began to take dietary precedence over hunted meat according to C12-C13 and N15
proportions examined in human burials (Brown et al. 1995). A higher quantity of recorded
Fresnal sites might also suggest a population increase during this phase. Projectile point styles
exhibited in the Fresnal phase consist of Fresnal, San Jose, Augustin, Chiricahua, and also Todsen
(Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993).
Hueco (2,900 BP-800 BP)
This phase saw a heavier reliance on corn, squash, amaranth, and beans with a shift toward semiÂ­
permanent occupations of sites. Mesoamerican influence is present during the Fresnal phase
(Beckett and MacNeish 1994; MacNeish 1993; MacNeish and Beckett 1987), but these influences
are more apparent in the Hueco phase according to increases in observed cultigens in the
archaeological record (Holmes 2002). This phase also suggests seasonal exploitation of desert
basin resources (Graves and Peterson 1996; Mauldin et al. 1998). Projectile point styles include
Hueco, San Pedro, Armijo, and Hatch (Beckett and MacNeish 1994).
Formative Period
The presence of brownware ceramics marks the onset of the Formative period. This incorporation
of pottery into the relatively mobile lifeway indicates an important change in food preparation
and storage. The Formative period is divided into regional periods correlated with local phases.
The five temporal designations that make up the Formative period in this area are the Early
Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP), Late Pithouse Period/Late Mesilla Phase
(1,400-1,000 BP), Transitional Pithouse Period/DoÃ±a Ana Phase (1,000-800 BP), Pueblo
Period/El Paso Phase (800-600 BP), and the Post El Paso Phase (600 BP to European contact).

Early Pithouse Period/Early Mesilla Phase (1,800-1,400 BP)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by data recovered during large scale surveys in the Hueco
Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978, 1980). Recorded sites
indicated short-term camps associated with larger playas of concentrated resources. The Early
Mesilla phase is very much a continuation of the mobile settlement patterns of the Late Archaic
with the addition of ceramics and a major population surge (Carmichael 1986). Ceramic
assemblages typically consist of plain brownwares in the form of bowls, deep bowls, tecomates,
and short-necked jars. Diagnostic lithics include San Pedro projectile points, oval basin metates,
and one-handed manos.
Late Pithouse Period/Late Mesilla Phase (1,400-1,000 BP)
The population increase observed in the Early Mesilla continued to increase significantly more in
the Late Mesilla (Whalen 1981:82-83). Sites from this phase are observed in both the basin floor
and edges of the Hueco Bolson. Aggregated pithouse villages such as Turquoise Ridge and Los
Tules formed at this time. Subsistence strategies centered around the gathering of wild plants and
the hunting of small game, particularly rabbits. Ceramic assemblages consisted primarily of plain
brownware ceramics in the form of hemispherical bowls, deep bowls, tecomates, short-necked
jars, and ladles. Intrusive ceramics from neighboring Mogollon regions such as Alma Plain, Alma
Nick-Banded, Three Circle Red-on-white, Three Circle Nick-Corrugated, Mimbres Style I and
Style II have been documented at several Late Mesilla sites (Dering et al. 2001). Changes in
projectile point styles consist of corner-notched, expanding-stem arrow points which signify a
transition to bow and arrow hunting strategies that complimented or replaced atlatl hunting during
this phase. However, wooden shafts with sharpened tips have also been recovered from Late
Mesilla contexts (Cosgrove 1947).
Transitional Pithouse Period/DoÃ±a Ana Phase (1,000-800 BP)
Diagnostic architectural elements from the DoÃ±a Ana Phase consist of rectangular pithouses as
well as small huts (Dering et al. 2001:48). The distribution of sites tended to rest along
mountainous outwash fans at the basin edge rather than the basin floor, possibly due to increased
corn consumption (Whalen 1994). Additional data gathered on new styles of metates and manos
also suggest a heavier reliance on corn processing (Carmichael 1986). Corn consumption was
steady, but not necessarily grown locally. It may have been traded during interactions with more
sedentary Mimbres communities (Shafer et al. 1999). Locally painted wares entered ceramic
assemblages during the DoÃ±a Ana Phase such as El Paso Bichrome and early style El Paso
Polychrome. Mimbres Style III Black-on-white ceramics are also very common in DoÃ±a Ana
components. It is possible that the DoÃ±a Ana phase was a local cultural manifestation that was
briefly incorporated into the Classic Mimbres regional system (Shafer et al. 1999).
Pueblo Period/El Paso Phase (800-600 BP),
This phase of the Pueblo period experienced growth in settlements, larger residential units, a
population increase, more specialized site types, increased ceremonialism, and more interaction
with surrounding cultural regions (Dering et al. 2001). Diagnostic architectural traits of the El
Paso Phase include the presence of surface pueblos. Motifs in rock art dating primarily to the El
Paso phase people is not unlike symbolism found in other Pueblo period art (Dering et al. 2001).
This increase in ceremonial expressionism could be attributed to a heavier reliance on agriculture
(Dering et al. 2001), or may be a result of Mimbres influence from the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Shafer
1996). Subsistence data suggests more intensive use of domesticates than any previous period.
Floral inventories included corn (8- and 10-row cobs), beans, gourd, mesquite, prickly pear,
amaranth, tornillo, sunflower, yucca, etc. (Browning et al. 1993, Foster and Bradley 1984;
Whalen 1980). Diagnostic ceramic assemblages consist of classic or late-style El Paso
Polychrome jars with everted rims, restricted-orifice, necked jars, and hemispherical bowls

(Moore 1947; Wheat 1955). Intrusive diagnostic ceramics include Ramos Polychrome, Villa
Ahumada Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-white, Las Lunas Smudged, Playa Red Incised, St.
Johnâs Polychrome, Fourmile, Pinedale, Pinto Gila, and Tonto polychromes. This phase of the
Pueblo period is considered the apex of socioeconomic complexity in the Hueco Bolson
embodying numerous manifestations of the Southwest with influences from Mountain Mogollon,
Casas Grandes, and Salado cultures (Dering et al. 2001).
Post El Paso Phase (600 BP to European contact)
The abandonment of sites during the late Formative period has been a speculative topic. It could
be attributed to a shift in bison herd migration, climatic changes, internal conflict, collapse of
trading alliances, warfare, or a combination of variables (Holmes 2002; Dering et al. 2001).

2.2 Historic Background
Protohistoric Period
In Texas, the first exposure to European contact comes with the arrival of Alva NuÃ±ez Cabeza de
Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition in 1528. Between 1528 and the late
1600s, Spanish excursions into the Texas territory were limited. Europeans did not begin to settle
the territory until the beginning of the eighteenth century, and still the inhabitants of the region
were mostly Native Americans until the late 1700s.The Protohistoric period pertains to the first
Spanish accounts of the landscape in present-day El Paso continuing until more permanent
Spanish settlement in the 1650s when missions were built to convert the Sumas and Mansos.
Europeans first entered the El Paso area on April 28, 1598 when Don Juan de OÃ±ate and a party
of settlers and soldiers forded the Rio Grande (Brown et al. 1995).
The Manso, Suma, and Jumano Indians inhabited the El Paso Valley on both sides of the Rio
Grande River during the Protohistoric period. The Mansos lived in the area of modern El Paso
and to the north, and the Sumas lived south of El Paso. They subsisted primarily on fishing, deer
and bison hunting, plant gathering, and corn crops (Griffin 1983). The Jumano Indians occupied
the area east of present-day El Paso. They were primarily hunter-gatherers but some bands
farmed land at La Junta (Holmes 2002). Some data suggests that a shift in site locations might be
due to more defensively planned sites (Gibbs et al. 2000). The material culture of Native
Americans in this area soon changed with the introduction of Spanish metals. The period is
concluded with the establishment of a strong Spanish presence in the region in the mid- 1600s
and early 1700âs. Sporadic encounters between the indigenous populations and Europeans
occurred at this time. Identifying this period archaeologically is problematic since a clear set of
material culture associated with this period is lacking. Protohistoric sites may have mixture of
Late Formative and Historic artifacts.
Historic Period
This period begins in 1659 with the establishment of MissiÃ³n de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe.
After the conclusion of the Pueblo Revolt in northern New Mexico, Spanish and northern New
Mexico Indian refugees fled southward to present-day El Paso. By 1684, the settlement had
spread far beyond the walls of the MissiÃ³n de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe. The San Lorenzo,
Senuco, Ysleta, and Socorro Native American communities had established permanent farming
villages. However, strife with Spanish leaders, coupled with disease, drought, and war soon led to
the abandonment of numerous settlements. During the early part of the nineteenth century, New
Spain gained its independence as a result of the Napoleonic invasion of its motherland, forming
the new nation of Mexico. Mexico enabled the additional settlement of Texas by allowing Anglo
settlers, led by Stephen F. Austin, the opportunity to inhabit the region. After the influx of the
Anglo settlers, a movement for independence from Mexico was underway by the 1830s. The

Republic of Texas was incorporated into the United States in 1845. One year later, the United
States seized the El Paso area declaring the Rio Grande as the official border (Timmons 1990).
The individuals in the El Paso area were an old and valued part of the Republic of Mexico and
had little involvement in the Republic of Texas period from 1836-1845. Following the Mexican
War and the resulting Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 all the area north of the Rio Grande
became part of the United States. At that time the El Paso passageway became very important to
the United States and the Texas Legislature proclaimed Sante Fe County, which included modern
El Paso County. In 1849 meetings were held in Austin to determine how to establish El Paso and
establish control over the passage way. Two frontiersmen were sent out to organize the area and
the same year a military force was sent from San Antonio to establish a military post in El Paso.
This post, established by a company of 275 soldiers, later became known as Fort Bliss (Timmons
1990).
In 1850, Sante Fe County was divided into four counties including El Paso County. San Elizario,
the ancient Spanish presidio town was chosen to be the county seat. By 1860, El Paso County had
a population of 4,456 and a strong agricultural base. In 1860 the census showed only fifteen
slaves in the area, however in 1861 the county voted strongly in support of secession. Although
the county had many troops present little combat occurred and Fort Bliss was surrendered
peacefully to the Confederates (Timmons 1990).
In the 1880âs El Paso County was a violent place politically. Political conflicts, such as the Salt
War of San Elizario, which led to a riot and murder in the streets resulted in the need for
government control. Much of this de-stabilization and un-rest was exacerbated by the economic
down-turn also occurring throughout the region. Farming and cattle ranching were seeing a
particularly difficult decade. This particular unrest caused the government to re-garrison Fort
Bliss to help stabilize the region. El Pasoâs economy grew steadily during the 1890âs and the
early 20th century. Farms increased and cattle ranching increased in economic viability. By 1929,
cotton became an incredibly important crop for the region and chicken and eggs also increased in
importance. Manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers all suffered through the Great
Depression, some successful. The increase in personnel and enlargement of Fort Bliss during
World War II helped the El Paso community recover following the Great Depression. Fort Bliss
remains an important economic element of El Paso today (Timmons 1990).
El Paso and other areas along the US and Mexico border benefited from the âNew Dealâ
programs in the 1930s, which included both acts of Congress and presidential Executive Orders.
One of these was the Rio Grande Rectification Project that came out of the Convention of
February 1, 1933 between the US and Mexico (Treaty Series No. 864) (IBWC 2015; Metz 2010).
In this joint US-Mexico agreement the need for better flood control measures, irrigation, river
stabilization, and border establishment was addressed by the canalization and straightening of the
Rio Grande. Project features included canals, levees, and dams that were supervised by the US
side as a Public Works Administration (PWA) project (allotted for a sum of $433,000 in 1933)
(Timm 1941:214). The project features were completed and operational in June 1938 (Timm
1941:188).

3.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
3.1 Inventory of Previously Recorded Sites, Surveys, and Designations
A search of the THC Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that no previously recorded sites are
located within the current APE, nor were there any previous surveys conducted within the APE
(Figure 3). Five National Register Districts (Table 2), 18 National Register Properties (Table 3)
and eight previously recorded sites are within one kilometer of the APE (Table 4). The National
Register Districts are the Franklin Canal, El Paso County Water Improvement, Old Fort
Bliss/Hartâs Mill, Sunset Heights, and Old San Francisco. The Franklin Canal runs parallel to the
APE approximately 30 meters (100 feet) feet to the north, and is now called the American Canal
in this section of the district. Although this part of the Franklin Canal has been modified and
likely does not contributed to the District, Bridge 17 will not be directly impacting the canal.

The Chihuahita Local Historic District, designated by the City of El Paso in 1991, is the oldest
neighborhood in El Paso and is located north of the American Canal, near the eastern portion of
the APE. Designated as the First Ward in El Paso in 1887 and became one of the first areas of
settlement in the city (Smith et al. 2012:75). As Sanborn maps demonstrate, some of the early
adobe dwellings were situated diagonally on lots suggesting they may have been hastily built with
no records of ownership (see Appendix A). The area and the shanty structures were also
vulnerable to flooding from the Rio Grande. A 1950 aerial shows the Rio Grande brimming with
water with both the Franklin Canal full, and present on 8th Street, as well as the fully functioning
levee, which had been in place by 1908 as depicted on Sanborn maps. As Smith et al. (2012) and
Sonnichsen (1980) note many dwellings were razed in 1916 by the City to prevent the spread of
disease and other parts of Chihuahuita were removed between 1902 and 1905 (Sanborn maps).
During the late 1960s, after the Chamizal Treaty was ratified, the railroad came through the
community and they razed several blocks of Chihuahuita neighborhoods (see Appendix A). It is
likely that household fill from those demolitions over the years may have been placed adjacent to
the Rio Grande. The exact location of this debris is unknown. It was recommended in a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the THC and TxDOT that the Chihuahuita Historic
District should be avoided by the current project.
Six previous surveys have been conducted within one kilometer of the APE (Table 5). Previously
recorded sites 41EP533 and 41EP2369 were last recorded by a team from New Mexico State
University for the KPL Phase II conducted for the City of El Paso under the Urban Development
Action Grant. The location of the sites is now occupied by an addition to the Paso del Norte
Hotel. Site 41EP37 is Old Fort Bliss and Hartâs Mill. The eligibility of the site has not been
officially determined, but it was recommended by researchers in 2014 that the site be avoided as
it is evidently significant to Texas history (Silberberg and Feit 2014).

4.0 FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS
4.1 Field Methods
4.1.1 Subsurface Examination
Prior to entering the field, historic maps and aerials were consulted and georeferenced against the
proposed Bridge 17 APE to understand the context of the area. Due to the presence of known
historic artifacts on the surface as well as the proposed depth of impacts, backhoe trenching was
the preferred method of investigation. The investigation methods and study location were
developed with guidance from the IBWC Cultural Resources Specialist, Mark Howe.
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards for the overall project area. Backhoe
trenching, which was the primary form of investigation, was conducted to determine the nature
and integrity of the soils in the area and understand the context of the historic site and depth of
cultural materials. All trench excavations also complied with the safety rules and regulations of
the AKJV as well as federal laws and did not extend past 4-5 feet (1.2-1.5 meters) in depth.
Excavations were monitored by at least two archeologists, one who supervised the progress in the
trench, examining the walls and floors for cultural material, and one who examined the sediments
being removed. Cultural material was abundant and artifacts were examined for diagnostic
features or makerâs marks. Those that were unique or diagnostic or contributed to understanding
the site were collected. Collections were controlled by general vertical provenience of 20Â­
centimeter (8-inch) levels. Trench 1 was divided horizontally by ânorthern endâ and âsouthern
endâ due to its length. Otherwise, the level was considered for the whole trench area. In some
cases, an exact depth of an artifact was recorded for the provenience. Artifacts were collected, the
dirt mostly removed in the field, and bagged according to provenience level and backhoe trench
(BHT) number. Bags were collected and stored in a secure area until transported to the
archeological laboratory at the aci consulting headquarters in Austin, Texas.
All location data for the excavated trenches was collected with a sub-meter accurate Trimble
GeoXT GPS unit. Hand-drawn field maps were also completed of profiles of all trenches
excavated to record stratigraphy and any evidence of buried soils, disturbance, and any features
present. Trench data was described and photographs of trench walls and floors were taken.
4.1.2 Pedestrian Survey
A pedestrian survey of the HPAs of the APE was conducted to supplement the backhoe trenching.
The pedestrian survey was used to help determine locations for backhoe trenching and to help
establish the new site boundaries based on artifact densities. In addition, the pedestrian survey
was utilized to identify any surface features that might be located within the project area. The site
area was generally walked in to record the limits of the site. The site boundary was mapped with
a Trimble GeoXT GPS unit.

4.2 Laboratory and Artifact Analysis Methods
All artifacts were processed in the laboratory at the aci consulting headquarters in Austin, Texas.
All of the field artifact bags were inventoried and given lot numbers and the artifacts were
washed, dried, and rebagged. Each lot was sorted into large groups including glass, ceramic,
metal, and miscellaneous. Each artifact was described and the information compiled in an Excel

spreadsheet. Numerous lines of evidence (e.g., internet, books, catalogs, etc.) were consulted to
identify those artifacts containing potential makerâs marks or other diagnostic features or
elements. The best specimens are photographed. All of the artifacts analyzed were quantified by
count in the large group categories. Some artifacts collected had no interpretive or temporal value
and were not included in the count or analysis. Those items will be discarded during the curation
phase in conjunction with guidance from IBWC. The artifact descriptions and counts are
presented in Appendix B in this report.

5.0 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS
A total of five backhoe trenches were excavated during this investigation, on May 14, 15, 26, and
27, 2015. Two high probability areas (HPAs) were identified within the 1,672-meter-(5,485-feet)Â­
long APE prior to field work (Figure 4). The HPAs were defined in collaboration with Mark
Howe of the IBWC. HPA 1 encompassed the portion of the APE directly south of the historic
Chihuahuita neighborhood and HPA 2 was the portion of the APE that is within the flood plain of
the Rio Grande and approximately 730 meters (2,400 feet) southeast of Old Fort Bliss/Hartâs Mill
National Register District and 1,127 meters (3,700 feet) northwest of HPA 1.

5.1 HPA 1
HPA 1 was chosen in part because of the proximity to the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood, but
also because Mark Howe from the IBWC had previously located historic artifacts on the surface
where a section of the Bridge 17 construction was proposed. It was expected that there would be
an historic site in this location and this assumption was confirmed in the field. The artifacts were
on the surface of a gravel area that was constructed south of the levee at the same elevation,
basically widening the levee. Three backhoe trenches were excavated south of the levee, where
the levee was wider from various construction activities over the years. All three trenches were
positive for cultural material, and cultural material was on the ground surface in proximity to the
trench locations. The historic site was recorded as archeological site 41EP7118.
41EP7118
Site 41EP7118 is located south of the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood, south of the
Franklin/American Canal and the railroad tracks, and immediately south of the levee, which is
used as a road for Border Patrol as it has been these many decades (Sonnichsen 1980:8) (Photo
1). The levee was present on a 1908 Sanborn map (see Appendix A) but during Rectification in
the 1930s to straighten out the Rio Grande the levees were improved as riverside roads (Peterson
and Brown 1994:8). The artifacts are on the surface and buried in a level area south of the levee
and north of the Rio Grande, on property administered by the IBWC. The site is defined as the
area between the levee road and the flood plain, which is approximately 30 meters (100 feet) east
to west. The length of the site is approximately 525 feet (160 meters) north to south, at an
elevation of 967 meters (3,172) feet above mean sea level (see Figure 5).

Work Performed
Three backhoe trenches were excavated within the site boundary where the construction of Bents
43, 44, and 45 for Bridge 17 are proposed (Figure 5). The trenches were approximately 20-30 feet
(6-9 meters) long, 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide, and four feet (1.2 meters) deep. All trenches were
profiled, photographed, and recorded with a Trimble GeoXH GPS unit (see Appendix C for
trench data). The trenches revealed fill material to a depth as deep as four feet. Excavation was
terminated at approximately four feet because of safety regulations. The profiles of each trench
reflected several events where fill mixed with historic debris was dumped south of the levee.
Artifacts
Diagnostic artifacts were collected from each trench. The cultural material consisted of domestic
historic artifacts and structural debris from the early to mid 20th century. The artifacts generally
consisted of a few whole bottles or small jars and numerous fragments of the following
specimens: Coca-cola, 7-Up, El Paso Empire, Ponds, Vicks, perfume or medicine bottles; green,
purple (amethyst/solarized), aqua, amber, cobalt, milk, clear glass vessel fragments; porcelain
figurine fragments; whole bricks-handmade and one Corsicana Cherry Red; bathroom tiles-small
and large white hexagonal tiles with mortar; car parts; tableware; white ware, transfer print ware,
stone ware; shoe fragments, and marbles. The artifacts date from the 1920s to the 1940s, and are
mostly household items with some structural debris and car parts. The collected artifacts are
described in more detail in the artifact inventory in Appendix B.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41EP7118 consists of early to mid 20th century domestic historic artifacts and structural
debris that has been mixed into the fill that was used to possibly widen the levee on the north
bank of the Rio Grande likely during the construction of the American Canal. The cultural
material likely came from the historic Chihuahuita neighborhood adjacent to the project area.
There were several dumping episodes within the levee extension, so it is difficult to say where
exactly the fill came from. Several of the same artifacts (i.e., white hexagonal tiles) are present in
different matrices, so it is possible the fill contains material from one or possibly two domestic
structures and randomly distributed. Attributing the artifacts to a particular home is not possible.
This area in general has been highly disturbed over the years from flooding and changes in the
river, construction of canal and Rectification of the Rio Grande (Timm 1941:187-189), and
improvements on the canal (American Canal Extension), levee, and road.
Because there are no intact features at the site due to lack of integrity and the historic artifacts are
mixed within levee fill from a variety of disturbances, the site is not considered to be eligible for
inclusion on the NRHP. No further work is recommended.

5.2 HPA 2
HPA 2 was the portion of the proposed Bridge 17 within the flood plain of the Rio Grande
downslope from the levee. Backhoe trenches 4 and 5 were excavated between the slope of the
levee and the extent of the APE, at the locations of Bents 15 and 16 (Figure 6 and Photo 2). These
were the only two locations where there was adequate space in between the levee slope and the
extent of the APE for the excavation of backhoe trenches, and thus the dimensions of the trenches
was approximately 15 feet (4.5 meters) long, four feet (1.2 meters) wide, and four feet (1.2
meters) deep, as opposed to the longer length on BHTs 1-3. The soil was similar to a stratified
Gila alluvium, however, modern trash was observed throughout most of the profile likely from
recent flooding episodes. No historic or prehistoric cultural material was located in either trench.

A total of 237 artifacts were analyzed as part of the investigation. The majority of the artifacts
dated from the 1920s through the 1940s and consisted of glass (n=150), ceramics (n=61), metal
items (n=17), bone (n=4) and miscellaneous objects (n=5). These broad groups can be broken
down into smaller groups. A detailed inventory of the artifacts are presented in Appendix B.
Glass
Glass consisted of bottles (medicine, paint, soda [Coca-cola, 7-Up], household chemicals,
liquor/wine/beer, perfume) jars (cosmetic [Mum (Photo 3)], [Pondâs], [Noxema], medicine
[Vaseline], [Vickâs Vap-O-Rub], miscellaneous food container), table wares (bowls, pitchers
(Photo 4), decorative plates, salt/pepper shakers), flat glass [window], and toy marbles. A total of
150 pieces were described. Identification and descriptions of bottles was aided in part by Putnam
(1965), Toulouse (1971), Fike (1987), Florence (1992), Horn (2005), and Lindsey (2015), the
Society for Historical Archaeologyâs bottle website.

Blossom Pattern, Pink variety (Florence 1992:28).
While the popular glass makers were represented, including Owens, Illinois Glass Co., OwnsIllinois, and Hazel-Atlas, Mexican bottle maker Vidriera Monterrey was represented (Photo 5).
Other makers identified included Brockway Glass Co., Three Rivers Glass Co., Glenshaw Glass
Co., Knox Glass Bottle Co., Diamond Glass Co., Foster-Forbes Glass Co., Empire Bottle and
Supply Co. (see Photo 6 right bottle), and Obear-Nester Glass Co (see Photo 6 left bottle). These
glass makers range in date as early as turn of the 20th century and are still in production today. On
average, most of the dates derived from the artifacts span from the 1900s through 1940s (see
Appendix B). There were some specimens such as green wine bottles with push ups that could
have potentially dated earlier, such as the late 1890s, but the exact dates are uncertain. The
assemblage appears to be typical of household or domestic context.

Ceramics
Sixty-one ceramic specimens were collected and analyzed as part of the project, the majority of
which were not identifiable for pattern or maker. During the analysis, a variety of sources were
examined including Kovel and Kovel (1986, 1995), Lehner (1988), Rinker (1997), Snyder
(1999), and Lage (2004). An internet search using Google Images was also used to supplement
the analysis.
The ceramic artifacts collected fall into the following categories: porcelain (n=28), white ware
(n=18), stoneware (n=5), red earthenware (n=3), and one specimen of yellow ware. Six fragments
of ceramic tiles were identified and counted separately. Blue transfer print and makerâs marked
sherds were collected but the pattern and maker was not identifiable in the resources available
(Photos 7 and 8). Artifact function identified includes plates, cups, saucers, bowls or mixing
bowls, teapot, porcelain stopper (Photos 9 and 10, head with painted eyes and headdress),
porcelain doll (Photo 11), stoneware crockpot, majolica, field tile, bathroom tile, and door knobs
(see Appendix B). Similar to the glass, the ceramic assemblage is typical of household or
domestic contexts.

Metal
A total of 17 metal items were analyzed in the collected artifacts. These objects included two
spoons, a fork, metal wire, a possible T-shaped valve key, a copper bell fragment, thin wire,
copper pipe, metal parts to unknown machines or car parts, possible jewelry ring (highly
oxidized/rusty), and miscellaneous metal parts.
Besides the general household items, a heavy, round metal ball was recovered from Trench 2 at
about 60 centimeters (23 inches) below surface (Photos 12 and 13). The specimen, which is
mostly intact, has small fragments of rust spalling off. It averages about 2 inches (5 centimeters)
in diameter and weighs .95 lbs (430 grams). Various possible identifications of the specimen were
considered. Although it might be an industrial ball bearing or it was speculated to have been part
of the Battle of Juarez that took place in that area around May 10, 1911 (Timmons 1990; El Paso
Herald), it instead appears to be a milling ball used to crush ore (M. Howe, personal

communication, July 30, 2015). With El Pasoâs long history of processing lead, zinc, and copper
ores, it is plausible that the specimen is an ore milling ball likely derived from the ASARCO plant
located in the north western part of El Paso, which employed about 900 workers in the early
1900s (Kohout 2010).

Bone and Miscellaneous Artifacts
Five artifacts were categorized as bone (n=4) and miscellaneous (n=5). These consist of 2 cut,
butchered bone, 2 large mammal bones (cow?), a shell button (see Photo 11), fragment of mortar
(cement), 2 fragments of coal, and one plastic pump spray nozzle. This assemblage is
representative of a domestic context with household debris. The coals could have either been for
home use or it may have been associated with the nearby railroad immediately east of the site.
The origin is unknown.
In sum, a total of 237 artifacts were analyzed dating from the early 1900s through the 1940s. The
artifacts include glass bottles, window glass, milk glass jars and decorative glass as well as
whiteware, stoneware, porcelain, metal tableware, childrenâs toys, car parts, butchered bone, and
structural debris. Except for the possible grapeshot, the artifacts appear to represent household
debris likely from the Chihuahuita neighborhood.

6.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff archeologists from aci consulting completed an intensive archaeological examination of a
two high probability areas within lands administered by the IBWC along the Rio Grande as part
of the Loop 375 Border Highway West Extension project. Five backhoe trenches were excavated
resulting in the recording of a historic site, 41EP7118. Numerous artifacts collected from the site
were analyzed dating the materials from between roughly the late 1890s at the earliest through the
1940s. Most of the diagnostics were from the 1920s through the 1940s. Because of the disturbed
nature of site and lack of features and integrity, site 41EP7118 is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP. It is further recommended that construction be allowed to proceed on
Bridge 17 and no further archeological investigation or archival work is necessary at the site.
Due to the nature of the IBWC construction license (a federal action) and further compliance with
Section 106 and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) as well
as the Texas Health and Safety Code (Chapter 711), it is recommended that should any human
remains be encountered during construction on any IBWC administered land that the construction
stop within a 100-foot (30.5-meter) diameter area of the center of the discovery, the area be
secured, and the appropriate personnel contacted to determine the nature of the find and develop a
plan for recovery if necessary.
