Abstract

ABSTRACT
Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to perform a
background review and archeological survey for the Greasewood to Nevill Road 345-kilovolt (kV)
Transmission Line (Project) in Pecos County, Texas. The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit
#9020. The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods and
results of the cultural resources background review and an archeological survey of an approximately 10.5mile (16.9 kilometer [km])-long by 125 feet (38.1 meter)-wide proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE)
comprising 178 acres.
No previously recorded archeological sites or previously designated historic-age resources listed or
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or designated State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) were identified within the APE during the background review. An intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing was conducted between August 18 and August 22, 2019. No artifacts were
collected during the survey. All project related paperwork and photographs will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Library (TARL).
Four prehistoric archeological sites were recorded during the survey (Sites 41PC925, 41PC926, 41PC927,
and 41PC928). All four sites consist of burned rock scatters and remnant thermal features likely
associated with plant baking activities. Sites 41PC925 and 41PC926 contain buried organics in
association with buried rock features. Further testing is needed to assess the eligibility of 41PC925 and
41PC926 for NRHP listing or designation as a SAL, and their eligibility remains undetermined at this
time. GP&L will avoid 41PC925 and 41PC926 to prevent any impacts to the sites in association with the
proposed Project. Sites 41PC927 and 41PC928 are recommended ineligible for the NRHP or designation
as SALs. As a result, no further consideration of impacts to cultural resources under the Antiquities Code
of Texas is recommended in association with the proposed Project. Burns & McDonnell requests
concurrence that the Project would not adversely affect cultural resources.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Garland Power & Light (GP&L) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological survey for the Greasewood to Nevill Road
345-kilovolt (kV) Transmission Line (Project) southwest of McCamey, Pecos County, Texas (Appendix
A: Figure A-1). The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods
and results of the cultural resources background review and archeological survey following the Council of
Texas Archeologists Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports.

1.1

Project Description

The Project involves construction of approximately 10.5 miles (16.9 kilometers [km]) of 345-kV
suspended power lines within GP&L’s proposed 125-foot (38.1-meters [m]) wide easement and two
substations on either terminus (Appendix A: Figure A-1). The depth of impact is estimated to reach

approximately 40 feet (12 m) below the current ground surface. The Area of Potential Effect (APE)
is therefore defined as the total 10.5-mile (16.9 km) long, 125 foot (38.1 m)-wide proposed
transmission line and two substations (totaling 18.75 acres) to a maximum depth of 40 feet (12 m).
The APE is approximately 178 acres. The proposed Project is funded by GP&L, a not-for-profit
municipal utility owned by the City of Garland, a political subdivision of the State of Texas. Therefore,
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) is required. No federal funding or permitting is
anticipated in association with the proposed Project, thus compliance with section 106 of the NHPA is not
required.

1.2

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. The archeological survey was conducted between August 18 and 22, 2019,
by archeologists Dan Rodriguez and Bruce Darnell under Antiquities Permit #9020 (Appendix B). Dan
Rodriguez served as Principle Investigator. Jay Claussen and Grant Cox provided GIS support.

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN

The overall objective of the background review and the cultural resources survey was to locate and assess
historic-age (50 years of age or older) properties or archeological sites listed or eligible for listing as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the APE
that could potentially be affected by Project construction. The following chapter provides information
regarding the sources consulted during the initial background review as well as the methods used during
the archeological survey.

2.1

Background Review Methods

A Burns & McDonnell archeologist performed an initial desktop review, including an examination of the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) to identify previously recorded archeological sites and other
previously identified historic-period resources within a Study Area extending 0.6-mile (1 km) from the
proposed Project (Appendix A: Figure A-2). This review included identification of NRHP-listed
properties and districts, SALs, historic-age cemeteries, and Official State of Texas Historical Markers
(OTHMs), such as Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), within the Study Area. The
archeologist also used the TASA to identify previous cultural resources surveys performed within the
Study Area.
Additionally, the online Texas Geologic Map Data provided by U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Soil
Web supplied by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), historic-age maps provided by the
United States Geologic Service (USGS) Historic Topographic Map Explorer, and historic-age aerials
provided by Nationwide Environmental Title Research (NETR) were consulted. These resources were
used to identify high probability areas (HPAs) for previously unrecorded cultural resources within the
APE (Appendix A: Figure A-2).

2.2

Archeological Survey Methods

Burns & McDonnell archeologists conducted a pedestrian survey of the entire Project Area along parallel
transects spaced approximately 30 m apart. Shovel tests were excavated at approximately 100-m intervals
in HPAs identified during the background review. Shovel tests were approximately 30 centimeters (cm)
in diameter and excavated to a maximum depth of approximately 80 cm below surface (cmbs) or until
pre-Holocene substrates were encountered. Soil matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (0.65 cm)
mesh when possible. Clayey matrices were hand-sorted and visually inspected. All shovel tests were
backfilled immediately after inspection. Additional shovel tests were excavated to delineate the horizontal
extent of archeological sites identified during the survey. Shovel test locations were recorded using

Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. The field survey was performed in accordance with the
research design approved by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to survey (Appendix B).
Artifacts were analyzed and photographed in the field but not collected. Project records and photographs
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL).

Environmental Setting and Soils

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND SOILS

Understanding the region’s natural environmental and geological development contextualizes the region’s
cultural history and the survey results. The environment greatly influenced past human subsistence and
behavioral patterns and conversely, the environment has been significantly impacted through human
intervention. This section discusses the physiography, geology, soils, vegetation, and fauna of the Study
Area.

3.1

Physiography

Pecos County is located in the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2017). The Chihuahuan
Desert ecoregion extends over 500 miles from the Madrean Archipelago in southeastern Arizona, south
into Mexico. The ecoregion, in much of the U.S. portion, is generally characterized by basin and range
terrain, with mountain ranges consisting of a geological mix of faulted limestone reefs, rhyolitic
intrusions, and volcanos and associated basalt and tuff extrusive rocks. The proposed Project extends
from west of U.S. Highway (US) 67 at an approximate elevation of 2,400 feet above mean sea level to
approximately 2,370 feet at the eastern terminus. The Project skirts to the south of Girvin Butte and
crosses over several low karstic ridges between unnamed drainages to the Pecos River.

3.2

Geology and Soils

Geologically, the Project is situated on the Fredericksburg Group (Kfr), the Washita Group (Kw),
Other/Older Quaternary deposits (Qao), and alluvium (Qal) (USGS 2019) (Appendix A: Figure A-3). The
Fredericksburg Group primarily consists of limestone, dolomite, chert, and marl dating from the Early
Cretaceous period. The Washita Group consists of alternating units of clay and limestone dating from the
Early and Late Cretaceous period. Other/Older Quaternary deposits consist of boulders, cobbles, and
pebbles of Cretaceous limestone and chert overlain by brown silt. Alluvial deposits consist of sand, silt,
clay, and gravel associated with floodplain and low terrace landform sediment assemblages dating from
the Holocene period (USGS 2019).
Soils within the proposed APE are mapped as Reakor, Reagan-Hodgins, Upton, Lozier, Dev, and Iraan
(NRCS 2019) (Appendix A: Figure A-3). Reakor series soils are very deep, loamy soils formed in
alluvium derived from mixed sources. Reakor series soils are located on broad plains and alluvial fans.
Reagan-Hodgins association soils are calcareous loams to silty clay loams formed in alluvium and/or
eolian deposits derived from limestone. These soils are found on nearly level to gently sloping uplands
and in shallow valleys. Reakor and Reagan-Hodgins soils have some potential for shallowly buried
cultural deposits. Upton series soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They formed in gravelly,

Environmental Setting and Soils

calcareous loamy slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone and marl and are located on
nearly level to moderately sloping foot slopes or fans of ridges on dissected plateaus. Lozier series soils
are shallow gravely loam soils over limestone bedrock. The soils formed in loamy residuum and
colluvium derived from the bedrock. Cultural deposits in Upton or Lozier series soils, if present, are
likely to be at or near the surface. Dev very gravely loam is a rapidly permeable soil formed in gravelly
loamy alluvium derived from limestone and located on flood plains. Iraan silty clay loam is a welldrained soil formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from limestone and located on flood plains
along streams on dissected plateaus and river valleys (NCRS 2019). The Dev and Iraan series are alluvial
with typical A horizons less than one meter deep and have potential for buried cultural deposits.

3.3

Vegetation and Fauna

Vegetation of the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion primarily consists of semi-desert grasslands and arid
shrublands, with several species of oak (Quercus spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), and pinyon pine (Pinus
spp.) found at higher elevations. Natural vegetation includes grasses, shrubs, xeric plants such as
burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolius), grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), river cane (Phragmites australis),
alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), and broomweeds (Amphiachyris and Gutierrezia spp.), fourwing
saltbush (Atriplex canescens), pickleweed (Allenrolfea occidentalis), Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata),
tarbush (Flourensia cernua), saltcedar (Tamarix spp.), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), sotol
(Dasylirion spp.), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), pricklypear (Opuntia
spp.), and yucca (Yucca spp.) (Griffith et al. 2017).
Intensive, year-round cattle grazing during the late nineteenth century has drastically altered the
landscape, leading to gradual desertification and expanding shrublands within mountain foothills and
lowlands (Griffith et al. 2017). Wooded areas once dominated by riparian lowland trees and plateau live
oak (Quercus fusiformis) have been replaced by woody shrub species such as redberry juniper (Juniperus
pinchotii), ashe juniper (Juniperus. ashei), mohr oak (Quercus mohriana), and vasey oak (Quercus.
vaseyana) (Griffith et al. 2017).
The Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion supports numerous bird, lizard, and fish species such as muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.), kit fox (Vulpes velox macrotis), jackrabbits (Lepus
californicus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana),
blackthroated sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), soft-shelled turtles (Apalone spp.), side-blotched lizard
(Uta stansburiana), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), little-striped whiptail lizard
(Cnemidophorus inornatus), Comanche Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon elegans), proserpine shiner

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Cultural Overview

Pecos County is located in the Trans-Pecos Archeological Region as delineated by the THC (MercadoAllinger et al. 1996). This region is constrained by New Mexico to the north, the Rio Grande to the west
and south, and the Pecos River on the east. The Trans-Pecos region represents a diverse cultural history
extending from Paleoindians to historic European settlements. The archeological record reflects this
diversity through a wealth of sites ranging from rock shelters to forts. It is generally accepted that the
cultural history of this region is divided into four periods: the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic periods. Each of these periods is briefly summarized below.

4.1.2

Paleoindian

The Paleoindian Period occurred approximately from 10,000 to 6000 B.C. It is characterized by small,
highly nomadic bands with a reliance on large mammals such as bison and mammoth for subsistence
(Perttula 2004). Paleoindian sites in the Trans-Pecos region such as the Fresnal Shelter, Pendejo Cave,
and Hermit Cave have produced material dating from approximately 10,000 B.C. to 5000 B.C. (Perttula
2004). The Paleoindian period is divided into three chronological traditions defined by its tool kits: the
Clovis Complex (10,000 to 8800 B.C.), Folsom Complex (9000 to 8000 B.C.), and the Plano/Cody
Complexes (9000 to 6000 B.C.). The Clovis Complex is the earliest known occupation. It is represented
by the fluted lanceolate Clovis projectile point; however, very few Clovis sites have been recorded and
none of those maintain their integrity. The Folsom complex is a more prolific manifestation of the
Paleoindians in the region. Sites such as Chispa Creek have produced an artifact assemblage consisting of
hundreds of Folsom points, scrapers, and bifacial knives (Perttula 2004). The Plano/Cody complexes are
similar to the Clovis Complex in that very few substantial sites have been recorded. Eden and Scottsbluff
points have been documented as mostly surface finds throughout the region.

4.1.3

Archaic

The Archaic Period (6000 B.C. to 200 A.D.) signifies a shift from a big-game hunting subsistence
strategy to seasonal mobility and generalized subsistence strategies to adapt to increasingly arid
conditions. Developments include the introduction of horticulture, agriculture, and residential pithouse
structures, as well as new projectile point technology, where lanceolate-shaped points gave way to dart
points that were stemmed and barbed (Black 1989; Perttula 2004). The Archaic Period has been defined
mostly through excavations of rock shelters and open-air sites such as the Gardner Springs site, Keystone
Dam site, and Fresnal site. Because of the significant span of the Archaic Period, archeologists generally
separate it into Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.), and

Garland Power & Light

4-1

Burns & McDonnell

Greasewood to Nevill Road 345-kV Transmission Line

Cultural Background

Late Archaic (1,200 B.C. to 200/900 A.D.). The Early Archaic is a poorly known phase primarily defined
by carbon dating thermal features at the above-mentioned Gardner Springs and Fresnal sites, as well as
the Pendejo site (Perttula 2004). The Middle Archaic in the Trans-Pecos is most clearly represented in the
Keystone Dam 33 site. Excavations of 23 features at the site described as round, shallow structures of
simple construction have yielded dateable materials between 2500 and 1800 B.C. (Perttula 2004). The
Late Archaic saw the development of horticultural and agricultural practices as well as the initial use of
plain brownware ceramics. Fresnal and Tornillo rockshelter sites have produced ample corn and bean
specimens, which offers evidence for the development of cultigens in the Trans-Pecos region.

4.1.4

Late Prehistoric

The Late Prehistoric (200 to 1450 A.D.) is a continuation of the trends recorded in the Late Archaic,
including a decrease in mobility, increase in agricultural specialization, technology developments, and
architectural developments (Perttula 2004). The bow and arrow, universally adopted by 1000 A.D.
throughout the region, is a common indicator of the Late Prehistoric. However, very few arrow points
have been recovered from Late Prehistoric sites in the Trans-Pecos region, suggesting a reliance on small
to medium game. Developments in architecture and settlement patterns also signify shift toward formal
social organization. The types of Late Prehistoric structures observed in the region include huts,
pithouses, single room structures, and pueblos. The Hot Well Pueblo is an intensely dated site that
represents the progression of pithouses to pueblos. Other technological developments of the Late
Prehistoric include polychrome ceramics, thermal storage features, groundstone, and possible water
control features.

4.1.5

Historic

Historic activity in Pecos County intensified starting in the early 1800s with the development of several
trade routes through Texas. The Comanche Trial crossed the county beginning at Horesehead Crossing
and ending at Comanche Springs. By 1859, Fort Stockton was established at Comanche Springs to protect
interests along the trails, including mail from San Antonio to El Paso and settlers. Consequently, the town
of St. Gall was established near Fort Stockton in 1868 by an entrepreneur named Peter Gallagher. St. Gall
became a hub for travelers and the army looking to resupply (Rives 1980; Justice and Leffler 2016).
In 1871, Pecos County was established by Texas legislature separating it from Presidio County. St. Gall
formally became the county seat in 1875 and was renamed as Fort Stockton 5 years later after the army
post closed. As a result, the county lost most of its landholders during the 1880s due to an economic
slump caused by the fort closure (Justice and Leffler 2016). Multiple portions of the county were either
divided into Reeves and Terrell counties or absorbed into Val Verde County.

Cultural Background

Introduction of the railroad in 1913 caused a significant boom in industry and land investors. The Kansas
City, Mexico, and Orient Railway Company of Texas began developing rail systems across Pecos
County. This supported irrigation efforts for agricultural business and eventually the oil boom in 1927.
Towns such as Iraan, Bakersfield, and Red Barn were established to support the oil industry. By 1920, the
population doubled as a result of the developing railroad, agricultural, and oil industries; however, the
Great Depression in the 1930s severely impacted tenant farming. Tourism began reviving the area with
the development of paved highways between Fort Stockton and the Big Bend National Park. But it wasn’t
until the rediscovery of oil and natural gas in the 1950s and 1960s that the area saw major growth.
Modern industries are varied in Pecos County, but mainly consist of farming, ranching, oil and gas
production, and tourism (Justice and Leffler 2016).

Results of the Background Review

RESULTS OF THE BACKGROUND REVIEW

Burns & McDonnell reviewed the TASA to identify previously conducted cultural resources
investigations and previously recorded archeological sites and other designated cultural resources within
the Study Area, including NRHP-listed properties and districts, SALs, historic-age cemeteries, and
OTHMs such as RTHLs.
One previous cultural resources investigation is mapped within the Study Area on the TASA. The survey
was conducted in 2005 by Jeff Turpin of TAS, Inc. for Big Bend Telco Fiber Optic. No sites were
recorded within the Study Area during this survey. Two additional surveys were identified during the
background review but are not mapped on the TASA. These surveys recorded six archeological sites;
however, none of the sites are located within the Study Area. The background review did not identify any
previously recorded archeological sites. No NRHP listed properties or districts, SALs, historic-age
cemeteries, or OTHMs were identified within the Study Area during the background review.

Results of the Archeological Survey

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

The following section outlines the results of the archeology survey of the approximately 10.5-mile (16.9km) APE (Appendix A: Figure A-5). Burns & McDonnell archeologists performed the intensive survey
between August 18 and 22, 2019. The APE was predominately upland desert scrub brush consisted of
sand sage, mesquite, creosote, cactus, and yucca with ground surface visibility generally greater than 80
percent (Appendix D: Photograph D-1 though Photograph D-5). Disturbances within the APE included
ongoing collocated transmission line construction, previous oil and gas exploration, private roads, eolian
erosion, potential historic land clearing/grading, and livestock trampling. Archeologists excavated 191
shovel tests within HPAs identified prior to survey (Appendix A: Figure A-5; Appendix C). Shovel tests
typically revealed either light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam extending to 20 cm over strong
brown (7.5YR 5/6) argillic clay or indurated bedrock at approximately 20-30 cmbs. Four new
archeological sites, 41PC925, 41PC926, 41PC927, and 41PC928, were recorded.

6.1

Site 41PC925

Site 41PC925 is an ephemeral prehistoric campsite consisting of an isolated burned rock feature located
in a valley approximately 4.6 miles southeast of the Pecos River (Appendix A: Figure A-5.4). Site
41PC925 measures approximately 5 m north-to-south by 5 m west-to-east and is completely contained
within the APE (Appendix A: Figure A-6; Appendix D: Photograph D-6 through D-8). The site is situated
within sparse desert scrub brush with 90 percent ground surface visibility. Clusters of fragmented bedrock
are exposed throughout the area. Previous disturbances observed on site include land clearing, slope
wash, and eolian erosion.
Eight shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site. Of these, only shovel test BAD43 was positive for
subsurface cultural material. Shovel test BAD43 was excavated on the east side of Feature 1 and
contained carbon inclusions from 15 to 20 cmbs (Appendix D: Photograph D-7). Shovel tests soils
typically revealed light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam to silty clay matching the mapped Upton
soil series (NRCS 2019). Artifacts observed on site include approximately 150 limestone fire-cracked
rocks (FCR) located entirely on the surface (Appendix D: Photograph D-8). The surrounding area
constitutes a deflating landscape with little relict soil remaining. The soil within the shovel test was
generally darker than the surrounding landscape.
Feature 1 is a partially diffuse scatter of FCR measuring 1.8 m in diameter in a half-circle shape (see
Appendix D: Photograph D-8). The FCR measures between 5 to 20 cm in diameter with the larger rocks
within the feature cracked in place. Based on the presence of carbon observed in shovel test BAD43, the

feature may represent the remains of a plant-baking earth oven with a ring-like discard zone to the west
and partial deconstruction of the heating element represented by the large cracked-in-place rocks. The
organic rich soil observed in BAD43 suggests the center of the feature is likely somewhere just east of the
discard pile and north of the cracked-in-place rocks.

6.1.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41PC925 is an ephemeral prehistoric campsite consisting of an isolated burned rock feature. The site
contains an intact subsurface component with datable organic material and may have the potential to
provide significant information important to prehistory under NRHP Criterion D, however additional
work is needed to assess the NRHP eligibility or SAL designation of the site. Therefore, the site remains
undetermined for listing on the NRHP or designation as a SAL. Burns & McDonnell recommends
avoidance of the site to prevent any adverse effects to archeological deposits in association with the
proposed Project in lieu of further testing. Protective fencing and signage should be installed prior to
clearing or construction to prevent impacts to the site.

6.2

Site 41PC926

Site 41PC926 is a prehistoric campsite with three burned rock features located in a valley approximately
4.6 miles southeast of the Pecos River (Appendix A: Figure A-7; Appendix D: Photographs D-9 and D13). Site 41PC926 measures approximately 8 m north-to-south by 6 m west-to-east and is completely
contained within APE. The site is situated within sparse desert scrub brush with 90 percent ground
surface visibility. Previous disturbances observed on site include land clearing, slope wash, and eolian
erosion.
Six shovel tests were excavated, all of which were negative for subsurface cultural material. Shovel test
soils typically revealed two strata within the soil profile. Stratum I consisted of light yellowish brown
(10YR 4/6) sandy loam to silty call to a maximum depth of 19 cmbs. Stratum II extended form the
termination of stratum I and consisted of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) to reddish brown (10YR 6/6) silty
clay. Shovel tests were terminated due to compact soils at a maximum depth of 45 cmbs. Artifacts
observed on site include approximately 400 limestone FCR. Artifacts were located entirely on the surface.
Approximately 10 FCR measured between 5 and 10 cm in diameter. All other FCR observed at the site
were 5 cm in diameter or less.
The site contains three features exposed on surface (see Appendix A: Figure A-7). Feature 1 is 80 cm in
diameter and is composed of mostly angular FCR measuring approximately 5 to 15 cm in diameter. An
animal has recently dug approximately 5 cmbs into the center of this feature and exposed chunks of

burned wood measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter (Appendix D: Photographs D-10 and D-11). Feature 2
measures approximately 1 m in diameter and is more diffuse than Feature 1 (Appendix D: Photograph D12). FCR within the feature measure between 5 and 10 cm in diameter. Shovel test BAD33 was placed
adjacent to the feature and found no evidence of an intact cultural horizon (Appendix D: Photograph D13). Feature 3 also measures approximately 1 m in diameter with rocks of similar size to Feature 2
(Appendix D: Photograph D-14). Half of the rocks making up Feature 3 are limestone FCR with the other
half appearing to be hardened limestone with iron oxide staining. All the rocks within the feature are
completely sitting on surface. All three features likely represent a Multiple plant-baking events that have
been superimposed together by erosion of the surrounding soil matrix.

6.2.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41PC926 is a prehistoric campsite with three burned rock features. Based on the charcoal from the
animal burrow in Feature 1, the site may contain an intact subsurface component with datable organic
material and may have the potential to provide significant information important to prehistory under
NRHP Criterion D. However, additional work is needed to assess the NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation of the site. Therefore, the site remains undetermined for inclusion in the NRHP or designation
as a SAL. Burns & McDonnell recommends avoidance of the site to prevent any adverse effects to
archeological deposits in association with the proposed Project in lieu of further testing. Protective
fencing and signage should be installed prior to clearing or construction to prevent impacts to the site.

6.3

Site 41PC927

Site 41PC927 is a prehistoric campsite consisting of an isolated thermal feature and burned rock scatter
exposed on the rocky toe slope of Girvin Point in a valley approximately 4.6 miles southeast of the Pecos
River (Appendix A: Figure A-8; Appendix D: Photographs D-15 through D-16). Site 41PC927 measures
approximately 18 m north-to-south by 30 m west-to-east. The site is situated within desert scrub brush
with 100 percent ground surface visibility. Previous disturbances observed on site include land clearing,
slope wash, and eolian erosion.
Nine shovel tests were excavated, all of which were negative for subsurface cultural material. Artifacts
observed on site include approximately 500 limestone FCR. Shovel tests typically revealed light
yellowish brown (10 YR 4/6) sandy loam to silty clay to a maximum depth of 10 cmbs. Artifacts were
located entirely on the surface. Feature 1 measures 3.1 m in diameter and consists of large rubified rocks
and FCR approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter (see Appendix B: Photographs D-15 through D-16). The
feature morphology is very diffuse and appears to be completely sitting on the surface. Aside from
Feature 1, there are three other diffuse concentrations of FCR within the site boundary. These areas may

have once been thermal features but are too eroded to be able to discern morphology and as such, were
not considered features. The site boundary was defined by the concentration of burned rock observed on
surface which appeared to be approximately 1 FCR per square meter.

6.3.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41PC927 is an isolated thermal feature and burned rock scatter. The site appears to lack spatial
integrity, datable organic material, and diagnostic artifacts which would provide significant information
important to prehistory under NRHP Criterion D. Therefore, the site is not recommended for NRHP
inclusion, or for designation as a SAL. Regardless, no proposed tower locations are within the site
boundary.

6.4

Site 41PC928

Site 41PC928 is an ephemeral prehistoric campsite consisting of an isolated burned rock feature located
in a valley approximately 4.6 miles southeast of the Pecos River (Appendix A: Figure A-9; Appendix D:
Photographs D-17 through D-19). Site 41PC928 measures approximately 8 m in diameter. The site is
situated in desert scrub brush with 100 percent ground surface visibility. Previous disturbances observed
at the site include land clearing, slope wash, and eolian erosion.
Eight shovel tests were excavated, all of which were negative for subsurface cultural material. Shovel test
soils typically revealed two strata within the soil profile, matching the Reagan-Hodgins association
mapped in the area. Stratum I consisted of light yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy loam to silty clay to a
maximum depth of 10 cmbs. Stratum II extended form the termination of stratum I and consisted of
strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay to clay loam. Shovel tests were terminated due to compact soils at a
maximum depth of 30 cmbs. Artifacts observed on site include 40 to 60 limestone FCR. Artifacts were
located entirely on surface. The site consists of an isolated thermal feature, Feature 1.
Feature 1 is an isolated, slightly diffuse burned rock feature observed on surface measuring approximately
1.2 m in diameter (Appendix D: Photograph D-19). The FCR of the feature is angular and measures
between 10 to 20 cm in diameter. No organics were observed underneath the rocks that were exposed.
Shovel test DR43 was conducted immediately adjacent to the feature but found no evidence for cultural
deposits (Appendix D: Photograph D-18). The feature likely represents a single plant-baking event which
has now settled on the surface of a highly erosional landscape.

6.4.1

Summary and Recommendations

Site 41PC928 is an isolated burned rock feature exposed on the surface of an erosional landscape. The
feature appears to be in situ, however the surrounding matrix and any organics within have been eroded

away. The site appears to lack spatial integrity, datable organic material, or diagnostic artifacts which
would provide significant information important to prehistory under NRHP Criterion D. Therefore, the
site is not recommended for NRHP inclusion, or for designation as a SAL. Regardless, no proposed tower
locations are within the site boundary.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The background review and archeological survey of the approximately 10.5- mile (16.9 km) long, 125feet (38.1 m)-wide proposed APE was completed between August 18 and 22, 2019. Four archeological
sites were recorded, 41PC925, 41PC926, 41PC927, and 41PC928. All four sites represent the remnants of
prehistoric campsites with remnant features or burned rock scatters. Based on the data recorded during the
survey, 41PC925 and 41PC926 may have the potential to provide significant information important to
prehistory under NRHP Criterion D, however additional work is needed to adequately assess the NRHP
eligibility or SAL designation of the site. The site’s eligibility for inclusion in NRHP or designation as
SAL is undetermined at this time. GP&L will avoid 41PC925 and 41PC926 to prevent any impacts to the
sites in association with the proposed Project in lieu of further testing. Protective fencing and signage
should be installed prior to clearing or construction to prevent impacts to the site. Burns & McDonnell
recommends sites 41PC927 and 41PC928 do not contain the data resources to warrant NRHP inclusion
under Criterion D or designation as a SAL and are recommended ineligible. No further consideration of
impacts to cultural resources under the Antiquities Code of Texas is recommended in association with
proposed Project. If previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during construction work
should cease in the immediate area and GP&L should contact the THC's Archeology Division to consult
on further actions that may be necessary to protect the cultural remains.
