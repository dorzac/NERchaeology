ARCHIVAL INFORMATION SEARCH AND ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY FOR
THE PROPOSED AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE FACILITY,
ROBERT GRAY ARMY AIRFIELD, BELL COUNTY TEXAS
1.0 INTRODUCTION: The area in question, as illustrated on the attached
maps, had been previously subjected to reconnaissance by personnel of the
office of the Fort Hood Archeologist; six sites had been recorded within the
area of probable impact. The contractor was asked to conduct an archival
search and subsequent evaluation of the National Register potential of these
sites based on archival and archeological information. In addition, the
entire area IIAII was to be subjected to intensive survey to discover and
evaluate any other historic or prehistoric sites which might be present. Two
previously unrecorded historic sites and a prehistoric site were discovered.
This report addresses the details of the archival research and summarizes the
archeological evaluation of the sites. Detailed site reports and quadrat
report forms have been submitted to the COR in accordance with the SOW and
SOP 1981.
1.1 EVALUATION SUMMARY: None of the sites previously identified and
none found during the intensive survey of Area A meet the minimum criteria
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Where practical,
it is recommended that the potential deposits of archeological material in
cisterns and cellar depressions be sealed off with clean fill dirt and marked
such that they could be used for future research.
1.2 AREA BACKGROUND: All of the historic period sites in Area A were
once part of a dispersed hamlet known as Okay, Texas. The school building,
once the center of community activities here, was located on land that is now
under the runway; the community store and the home no'w serve the IIfollow me
truck ready crews. These two buildings and a few outlying houses that are
outside the reservation are all that remain of this small farm community.
The first Post Office in the area was established at Crossville
along the Bell/Coryell county line in November 1872. The school in this
community was located in quad 09/41. Finis E. Henderson, who played a leading
ll

2

role in the Okay community, was the last postmaster of Crossville (Oct. 16,
1878 - Jan. 20, 1881) (Wheat ms.). Henderson was the founder of a family
that still owned a large portion of the land around Okay during the 1940s.
When the railroad was built from Temple to Lampasas the Post Office was
moved to the new railroad town of Copperas Cove. Okay briefly regained the
distinction of its own Post Office from 1896 to 1899, but after that date the
mail was sent to Maxdale (Wheat ms.). The 1925 Post Office rural delivery
map labels Okay school, but not the hamlet itself; the later 1936 county
highway map omits even the name of the school. When Oscar Lewis (1948) did
his cultural survey of Bell County very little was left of the Okay community.
Even the cemetery that had been deeded by the Browns for the use of the Okay
community had been moved to a new location at a crossroad just outside the
military reservation. Yet Lewis {1948:45} encountered the name and sense of
community and listed Okay as a broken down hamlet.
1.3 OLD ROAD SYSTEM. The earliest road in the western section of Bell
County is the Ivie Mountain road, named for Doctor Elijah Ivie who lived along
its path at Ivie Gap. The road was the original route of the stage coaches
and wagons traveling between Belton and Lampasas. The hill on the north side
of the Gap is now more familiarly known as Radar Hill. Local informants
relate that the stage normally stopped overnight at the Ivie house during the
1860s. As illustrated in Figure 1, this road meanders across property lines
and seems to have been laid out on easy terrain for horsedrawn vehicles. This
seems to confirm the proposition in the historic research design that the oldÂ­
est community roadways would be of this general nature with no abrupt corners.
It should be noted also that the route of Ivie Mountain road (Fig. 1) is now
interrupted by the runway of Robert Gray Army Airfield. The original road
went through Ivie Gap and joined Reeves Creek road at the intersection with
Clear Creek road. The Okay community developed northwest of this intersection.
As can be seen from the map in Figure 1, which illustrates land ownerihip a
century ago (ca. 1880), the later roadways are either between two properties
or taken from unclaimed public domain that still existed.
1.4 COMMUNITY PATTERN: There is no evidence whatever that Okay was ever
anything but a dispersed hamlet. It seems to have been primarily focused on

its school and store which stood along the same road. One informant,
Mr. Duncan~ who went to school in Okay~ remembers that there was a church in
the community. His verbal description of the location would seem to place
it within the multiple fence compound in the northern half of 09/37 or 10/37.
A portion of this area was in the public domain for several years after the
surrounding land had been claimed and the farm of Alfred J. Toliver was
located just north of this unclaimed strip. In the 1880 census Mr. Toliver
was shown to be a minister and farmer born 66 years before in Tennessee (1814);
both his parents were also native Americans born in North Carolina. It seems
probable that a small church may have been erected either on the small strip
of public domain that was later claimed by C. C. Allen or on the southern
portion of Toliver's own land. By 1943 there was no legal record of land
owned by a church congregation, but the Alfred Toliver tract was still in the
family and was sold to the government by Mr. G. T. Toliver. The tract sold
included a small section off the C. C. Allen script claim south of the originÂ­
al Alfred Toliver 160-acre grant. Because this area was outside the bounds of
the area designated for survey the location cannot be confirmed in this report.
Another feature that would have added to the community functions of
Okay was the Blacksmith Shop owned by Charles Clayton. This site is predicted
to have been somewhere in quadrat 12/35, perhaps half a kilometer south of the
intersection of Clear Creek road and lVle Mountain road. Mr. Duncan remembers
hearing talk of an old blacksmith shop from the Brown boys who lived in that
area, but does not recall ever seeing such a structure. In the 1880 census
Charles Clayton, blacksmith, age 38, born in Alabama of a Scot father and
German mother, is listed along with his wife Laura, aged 34, born in Alabama
of native-born American parents. The 1880 census shows that one Alfred
Ellington, a 35-year-old teacher. born in North Carolina of native parents,
was also resident in the Clayton home. It is evident that the Okay school was
already open for pupils in 1880.
These features mentioned, then, constituted the community focus that
defined Okay: a school, a church, a cemetery, a store, a blacksmith shop and
a series of scattered farmhouses, each sitting on a private holding of about
160 acres. The Post Office existed for such a short time that it is hardly
worth noting except that it gave an official Federal name to the community.

1.5 ECONOMY: Table 1 is extracted from the Agricultural Schedules of
the 1800 census and shows the precise agricultural production figures for the
year 1879. Several features of the economy of Okay encapsulated in this table
are worth noting. First, a number of the farmers are using oxen, rather than
horses or mules, as draft animals. Second, the bulk of the acreage was devoted
to the growing of subsistence crops such as corn and wheat; most folks kept
a few milch cows as well. It is apparent that these are not farmers devoting
their time to single crop cotton farming but are essentially subsistence
farmers. Only 13 of the 20 farmers are growing any cotton at all and these
produced only 44.33 bales. The maximum acreage on any farm devoted to cotton
was 25 acres of the Sibley farm which produced five bales.
To address the specific questions of economic function raised in the
work order one should examine the first and last entries in Table 1. All of
the land in the designated Area A belonged to either Abram Noah or to Finis E.
Henderson in 1880. The north and east sections belonged to F. E. Henderson,
the southwestern section was owned by Abram Noah. The existing road system in
Area A defines the division between these two owners (Fig. 2). It is clear
that the Noah farm was devoted primarily to a subsistence type of planting
and a balance of livestock aimed at the same objective. Mr. Finis Henderson~
on the other hand. was primarily a sheep rancher with only forty acres under
cultivatfon and 800 acres in unimproved woodl and-grassl and. It woul d appear
from deed records, which will be discussed below in detail, that the land in
Area A which belonged to the Henderson family was not brought into cul tivation
or divided into homesteads until after the tUrn of the century. The only homeÂ­
stead that appears to have been occupied in 1880 by a house and farm buildings
was the Noah homestead which has been recorded as sites 309 and 310. Actually
this appears to have been a single site. Again the long-term ownership of the
site will be discussed in detail below.
Changes in the economy over time were very minor between 1880 and
1943. The major events which changed the economy of the nation only pushed
the local lifeway slightly one way or another. In 1940, 99.7 percent of the
houses in western Bell County still lacked electric lighting (Lewis 1948:30).
The people who lived in Okay Came to the area poor and lacked ready cash, but
in 1880 almost all of them owned the land they farmed. In Bell County as a
whol e, 41. 9 percent of the farms were operated by tenants at that time. The

rate of tenant occupancy around Okay rose over the years, but most of the
people continued as owners until bought out by the Army. Lewis (1948:12)
reported that about 200 families were displaced and unable to purchase new
farms because of inflated prices. These were essentially the same families
of western Bell County who had just managed to weather the great depression,
mostly because of their reliance on small subsistence agriculture (Lewis 1948:
18) and hunting to augment their food supplies (op.ait. 16). The cash crop
cotton farmers of the eastern blackland section of the county were the ones
who required public assistance. Perhaps the greatest single economic event
of the entire span of Okay's existence was the arrival of the railroad at
Copperas Cove. Suddenly it became cheaper to buy flour from the great northÂ­
ern mills than to grow your own and have it ground at the local mill (Tyler
1936:297). In 1879, 84,000 bushels of wheat were grown in Bell County; ten
years later less than 21,000 bushels were reported (op.ait. 296). During
those same years the cotton crop quadrupled. Thus, from 1879 to 1889, the
arrival of the railroads allowed the transition from a self-sufficient subÂ­
sistence-based economy to a cash crop/capitalist agricultural economy in the
county as a whole. Okay and the other small hamlets in the hilly west of
Bell County seemed to have tried to lag in this transition, always ready to
revert to leaner self-sufficient ways of living.
1.6 ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS: In 1880 the entire population of the Okay
community was of the ethnic group called Old-line Americans by Oscar Lewis
(1948:3). This he defined to mean "third_, fourth-, fifth- (or more) generaÂ­
tion persons of English, Scotch, Irish or Welsh descent, most of whose parents
.). The
or grandparents went to Bell County from Southern States." (loa.
Okay residents of 1880 were the grandparents of the generation Lewis was
defining in 1948. The 1880 manuscript census for the 8th District of Bell
County shows 20 families living in what may be loosely termed the Okay/
Crossville area. Without exception, all heads of households were born in
southern states, unless one wishes to quibble over Missouri (4 Texas. 4 TennÂ­
essee, 1 North Carolina, 4 Georgia, 3 Alabama, 1 Kentucky, 1 Missouri,
1 Arkansas, 1 Virginia). Where they are known and reported, all heads of
households had parents who were also native-born southerners, except Clayton,
the blacksmith, whose parents were emigrants, A. W. Richard, whose mother was

8

born in Pennsylvania, and Joseph M. Davis, whose mother was German. Thus
10 percent of the antecedent generation were not southern white, and six
(15 percent) are not reported.
Of the occupants of farmsteads located in Area A and falling withÂ­
in this task order for research, most were the progeny of either Abram Noah
or Finis E. Henderson and thus are a continuation of this same ethnic strain.
Later arrivals, such as T. H. Byler and J. P. Givens, cannot be documented
because the census data for the years they occupied the Okay area farms is
not yet available to researchers.
2.0 SPECIFIC SITE, LAND HISTORIES: The next few sections are reports of
the archival findings relative to the occupancy of all historic sites over the
period from settlement to 1943. These are presented in a format relating them
to the tract as purchased in 1943 by the Army in the case of the various heirs
of the Henderson estate, and as a block in the case of the Noah tract which
passed through the hands of various heirs before being purchased by T. H. Byler
and J. P. Givens mentioned above (see site map, Fig. 2).
2.1 W. J. HENDERSON TRACT: Both the "Brick Cistern ll site (311) at 1188E/
3821N and the "Cowbell in Cellarl! site (313) 1ie in the northeast corner of
the J. Arnold preemption grant on a tract of 139.79 acres purchased by the .ArIJlY
from W. J. Henderson. The Henderson clan was one of the first families to
settle in the Okay/Crossville area and one of the most fecund as well. Samuel
H. Henderson was the third postmaster of Crossville, appointed March 2, 1875,
and was succeeded by Finis E. Henderson on October 16, 1878. Throughout the
rest of the nineteenth, and for the first third of the twentieth century Finis
Henderson was a major landowner and leading farmer in the Okay/Crossville
community. The land in question was, for the greater part of that time, his
property and was given to his son, W. Jarvis Henderson, April 21, 191~ (Bell
County Deed Book 258, page 453) in the settlement of the estate of his mother.
2.12
The parcel of land in question was patented to the grantee,
James Arnold, on February 19, 1876. He appears to have been a chain carrier
on the crew of the county surveyor, Ed T. Rucker, when the adjoining G. W. Clark

9

grant was surveyed on June 25, 1872 (General Land Office Milam Preemption
fi 1e 761).

2.13
In this 1880 tax roll for Bell County (Pg. 52) F.E. Henderson was
taxed on this property, the 155 acre S.H. Henderson grant (abstract 464) and
the 320 acre J. Pointevent survey (abstract 964). Henderson also reported one
wagon, six horses, twelve cattle and 1200 sheep to the tax collector that year.
In the agricultural census for 1880, which reports the production of the 1879
season, he reported 1350 sheep, five horses, two working oxen, six milch;lsic] cows
and five other cattle. He had only 40 acres of land under cultivation. From
other information, it appears that the cultivated portion and the Henderson
homestead was on the S.H. Henderson tract (10/39, 10/40, 10/31,11/39). Thus
the Arnold tarct was used as grazing land during this early period.
2.14
It appears from the 1914 deed of partition that W. Jarvis
Henderson may have been living on the land for some time before it was
actually deeded to him by his father. In 1900 eMS census Bell County 1910 Enum. Dist. 35 sheet 6). W. Jarvis Henderson was ten years old, thus we
can presume that he was ready to begin farming on his own perhaps as early
as 1910 or even 1908.
2.15
Both the Brick Cistern and Cowbell sites are apparently the reÂ­
mains of a single residential occupation by W. Jarvis Henderson beginning
perhaps as early as 1908, but certainly by 1914, and terminating in 1943 when
he sold the land to the Army. It is possible that some structures were
erected to meet the terms of the preemption land act requiring occupation and
cultivation, but it does not appear that any remnants of these earliest
buildings remain.
2.2 ABRAM NOAH TRACT: This tract includes the "Okay Big Depression
sites #1 and #2 (309 and 310). These sites are located on the G.W. Clark
preemption grant of 160 acres originally patented to P.M. Davis on June 29,
1875.

The earliest structures erected on this property were no doubt
erected during Davis' time. On the Bell County tax roll for 1876 (T.S.A.
microfilm), Davis is taxed on the land valued at $400.00, 17 cattle valued
at $95, 5 horses or mules valued at $75 and a hog. The next year his farm
was appraised at $500, he had lost two horses but gained a buggy and seven
hogs for a total taxable property of $750. His annual state tax was $5.75
and $2.50 was assessed by the county. During these years, the farm was
considered to be a part of the Crossville community but the Okay area was
beginning to take on the character of a separate community as more people
moved in and claimed land.
2.21
In October 1878 (Bell County deed book Vol. 29: 598) P.M. Davis
sold the 160 acre farm to Abram Noah for $950.00: one note for $500 due in
December the same year and the balance of $450 due on Christmas Day 1879.
In the casual fashion of business in that day the release of the vendors lien
was not executed until 1907 even though the balance had "long since been
paid (Bell Co. deed book Vol. 211: 57).
tl

Abram Noah was born in 1827 in Tennessee and according to the
2.22
1880 census both his parents were also born in Tennessee. His wife Susan was
seven years younger and was also born in Tennessee, as was her mother. The
Noahs were obviously of the old line American stock of the upland south as
defined above. The oldest son living with the family in 1880 was Rufus K.
Noah, born in Alabama in 1857, who apparently suffered from "rheumatism
The Noahs moved from Alabama some time after 1864. Their son John was born
in Alabama in 1864, and they were living in Mississippi in 1866 when a
daughter, Sarah, was born. A year later another daughter, Minnie, was born
in Arkansas. It is evident from these moves that the family experienced some
hard times during and after the Civil War. All of the data is contai~ed in
the age and state of bi rth data contained in the 1880 census entry .

In 1879, the year after he bought the farm, Abram Noah had 45
2.23
acres under the plow, 30 acres of improved pasture. 65 acres of unimproved
grasslands and 20 acres of unimproved woodland. He had 3 horses.,6 milch [sic} cows
and 14 other cattle as well as 3 swine. He grew 100 bushels of corn and

11

30 bushels of wheat that year (1880 census Bell County, Tx. Agricultural
Schedule).
On September 13, 1880, Abram Noah claimed an additional 100
2.24
acres of public domain just south of the G.W. Clark grant. He purchased
this parcel using script. Three years later, his son, Rufus K, was able to
patent another 80 acres to the east and south as a preemption. One presumes
that the R.K. Noah preemption must have been surveyed the same day as the
Abram Noah script purchases because three years of occupation and cultivation
were required after survey to obtain a final patent. The R.K. Noah preÂ­
emption patent was issued September 19, 1883. Both of these claims were
evidently made in reaction to a series of script purchase claims made by C.C.
Allen. The surveyors field notes for that grant (Texas General Land Office,
Milam Script file 2930) show that a small pig pen was the only structure
actually built on the R.K. Noah preemption, but it was sufficient to limit
the Allen purchase to 357.25 acres for which he paid 76 dollars.
2.25
The result of these subsequent Noah claims was a block of land
totalling 340 acres which was apparently operated as a single farm. In
1889 the entire property was rendered for taxation as the property of Abram
Noah along with 2 wagons, 10 horses, 13 cattle and 6 hogs. The total property
and all appraised at $2,540 (T.S.A. microfilm). By this time, Abram Noah
was 62 years old.
2.26
In 1900, Carrie Noah, a girl of 17 when she married Rufus K.
Noah in 1881, was a 36 year-old widow with an 18 year-old daughter and seven
other children, one only a year old.
On March 19,1900, Abram Noah deeded the entire 340 acre property
to his children and the heirs of his wife Susan (Bell County deed book" 134:
268). At this time, Rufus K. Noah was still alive and participated in the
signing of a series of partition deeds where the heirs, as a group, deed
specific parcels of the 340 acre tract to each family group. These deeds were
all signed the same day, March 19, 1900 in Killeen (Bk 199: 311, bk 162: 554,
bk 170: 356, bk 171: 128, bk 268: 542). This division was accomplished

In summary. then it would appear that the sites found on this
tract (Okay Big Depression #1 and #2) are associated with the Givens. Browns.
A. Noah. P.M. Davis and. possibly. the G.W. Clark occupations. It seems
likely that two houses may have been present and occupied by two separate
generations of the Noah family up to 1900.
2.3 THE I.B. BELL AND WILLIE VIRGINIA HENDERSON TRACT: The earliest
history of these two tracts. which comprise the northern half of Area A, is
also closely associated with the family of Finis E. Henderson. The original
grantee, James Cook, patented somewhat more that 7 million square varas, or
roughly 1278 acres, as part of a first class headright on October 26, 1870
(G.L.O. 1878, III. pg 73), but in the Bell County tax roll of the following
year, 1871, he is not listed as a county resident. In the tax rolls for 1880
and 1881, when the Okay area began to be settled, W.S. Rucker, the assistant
county surveyor, is listed as the owner of the southern portion of the grant.
Rucker sold the southern one~third of the nominal 1280 acre tract to T.B.
Overstreet on September 27, 1881. The tract, supposed to contain 426 2/3
acres, was acquired from T.B. Overstreet by F.E. Henderson on June 1, 1882
(Bell County deed book 39: 403) but was later resurveyed and found to contain
450 acres.
2.31
The complete tract was deeded to the heirs of Mrs. M.A. Henderson
by their father, Finis E. Henderson, and hi.s new wife, Sallie, on April 21,
1914 (Bell County deed book 258: 483) along with the section of the James
Arnold grant that went to W. Jarvis Henderson.

2.32
The nominal 200-acre tract taken from this section of the Cook
grant that was sold by Willie Virginia Henderson to the Army in 1943 was the
estate of her husband Charles Henderson. Charles was born in 1883, the third
son of Finis E. Henderson and his first wife, Mamie. In 1900~ Mrs. Mamie
Henderson had been married 25 years and had given birth to 14 children~ 11 of
whom were living (9 still at home). Charles Henderson had died by
1936. In that year, his father, Finis E., divided the remaining lands among
his children including several who had not yet been born in 1914 (Bell County
deed book 452: 170-171). The estate of Charles Henderson had not, apparently,
been settled when the Army purchased the property from his widow and heirs in
1943 (Bell County deed book 508: 111). Besides the widow, Willie Virginia
Henderson (who most people knew as Virgie), her three daughters, Bernice A.
Priest (Mrs. l.M.L Mollie Maurine Duncan (Mrs. B.J.), and Hollis A.Henderson
(single), signed the deed which conveyed this 201.73 acre tract to the Army.
This is shown as tract 661 on the Real Estate Records of Fort Hood.
As a double check on the partition of this land, the Bell County
tax assessors Abstract records for this grant for the years 1919 through 1933
were reviewed. There was no break in the pattern of taxation during those
years. C.F. Henderson paid taxes on from 200 to 202 acres, F.E. Henderson on
90 and E.A. Cole on 155 or 156 acres.
2.33
The LA. Cole mentioned above, born in 1891, was the husband of
Nettie M. Henderson, a daughter of Finis E. and Mamie Henderson. She and her
husband also benefitted from the division of her mother's estate and acquired
the 155 acres on April 21, 1914. This tract was later sold to the Army by
LB. Bell (deed book 258: 483) and is listed as number 662 in the Fort Hood
Real Estate records. As mentioned above, the tax assessors records show that
E.A. Cole paid the taxes on a tract of land this size out of the Cook survey
in all years from 1919 through 1933.
The mechanics of the transfer of title from F.E. Henderson to
his son-in-law and daughter are complicated somewhat by the sale for cash and
a promissory note of a portion of the Cook tract. As noted above, the entire
block of lands, including the southern third of the Cook grant and the eastern
100 acres of the Arnold grant, were deeded to all the heirs of Mamie Henderson

16

in an undivided block. A series of deeds executed by all the heirs in November
1915 completed the division. As a part of this partition sale, a portion of
the Cook grant was sold to one W,F. Gay (deed book 272: 277). One presumes
that the procedes of this sale were intended for the share of the heirs who
no longer lived in Bell County, In November 1915, of the eleven living
children of Finis E. and Mamie Henderson, 5 were no longer resident in Bell
County. Mollie Massengale and her husband, Tom, were li.ving in Runnels
County, Finis Henderson, Jr. and his wife, Garrison, were living in Pulaski
County, Arkansas. Kennye Luchie and her husband, J.H., were living in Sutton
County. A. Judson Henderson, his wife Emma, and sister Mattie Belle were
living in Harris County.
The remaining six children who conti.nued 1iving tn Bell County
were; Lillie Love, apparently a widow 1n1915, Charles Henderson and his
wife, \Hllie Virginia, or "Virgie!!, Nicholas Henderson and his wife, Mattie,
W. Jarvis Henderson and his wife, Bydie, and an unmarried slster, Bertha.
These families, plus the younger children of f.E. Henderson and his second
wife, Sallie, constituted a major lineage, holding a major portion of the land
in the Okay vicinity in 1942.
The sale of land outside the immediate fami.1 y mentioned above
2,34
did not last long. It is evident that W.F. Gay was either unable to meet his
obligations or that the family wanted back the land sold to him .. On March~
15, 1916, some five months after he acquired the land, he sold the 256,73
acres to E.A. Cole (Bell County deed book 273: 445), who in turn sold 200
acres to his brother-in-law, Charl es Henderson (Bell County deed book 273:
446). This transfer resul ted in the general outHnes of tract 661 and 662
that prevailed at the time the land was taken for government use. There was,
however, one additional transaction where a 1.73 acre parcel from the south.
east corner of tract 662 was sold by the Coles to Charles Henderson for $25
(Bell County deed book 368: 31) on September 17, 1925. This small transfer
is of some interest because it appears this property contained the "intersection
site". A few yards north on the west side of the road 1ies the Charl es
Henderson homestead site with unmistakable remains of a residential structure
and outbuildings. The Cole residence appears to have been on the southeastern

17

corner of the 155 acre tract rather than on the southwestern corner. The
Post Office Department map, dated by the Library of Congress July 23, 1921,
indicates that the Coles lived near the intersection of Clear Creek road and
the unnamed road that runs along the southern border of parcels 661 and 662
and the northern limit of 663. At least, Cole was the name of the family
whose mailbox stood nearest this turnoff in the Copperas Cove Rural Route
#1.
The E.A. Cole home was identified in the survey of Area A as
standing on a low knoll in the far western section of quadrat 12/38. Thus,
the intersection site may have been either non-residential or a temporary home
erected by W.F. Gay during his brief ownership.
3.0 RESULTS RELATIVE TO THE RESEARCH DESIGN: The following is a brief
recapitulation of the research findings from Area A and the archival search
presented as they relate directly to the historic portion of the research
design.
At the level of individual structures it appears that most of
3.1
those represented by archeological remains in Area A were small vernacular
houses of the general hall and parlor type. A standing example of this house
type, which was part of the Okay community, is located along Clear Creek road
at coordinate location 1318E3815N. A double pen dogtrot cabin was also
located off post to the south of the Okay community, but no structures of
this type appear to have been part of Okay. The archival research on the
ethnicity of the residents revealed an overwhelming majority were "old-line
American" stock from the south. As observed above, this result is in conÂ­
sonance with the results of a cultural survey of western Bell County conducted
by the eminent social anthropologist Oscar Lewis (1948).
3.11
Diachronic Questions. The resul ts of the survey of Area A were
less definitive in this area than hoped. None of the sites located had
sufficient material remaining in place such that statements such as lithe E.A.
Cole house remains show no sign of a stone fireplace" cannot be made with any
confidence. However, stove parts were found among the artifacts at a number

of sites. perhaps the most marked diachronic contrast may be seen between
the planed lumber and millwork on the Okay store and C. Whitehead house, still
standing on the opposite side of the runway from Area A. and the rough-sawn
vertical board and batten siding of the hall and parlor house at 1318E/3815N.
This shift in materials is not clearly seen in the archeological remains.
3.2 COMMUNITY PATTERN: It is quite clear that the settlement of Okay
was always a dispersed hamlet. There is no indication whatever of any area
of nucleation or agglutenation at any time in the history of the community.
There is some tendency for the holdings to become smaller as land was parÂ­
titioned in the process of inheritance as illustrated by the land histories
reported in section 2 above; but the dispersed hamlet pattern was present
throughout the history of Okay.
3.21 Diachronic: No trend toward nucleation could be detected. The
earliest dwellings seem to have been placed on individual farm holdings
reached by a series of lanes turning off the Ivie Mountain road leading from
Belton to Lampasas. As predicted in the research design and confirmed by
archival research and informant interviews. this road, which continues as the
Reeves Creek road. was the earliest in this part of the county and meanders
across property survey lines in the manner predicted. The later roadways,
such as Clear. Creek road and the lanes through Okay itself, followed property
lines. Abrupt turns of the type occasioned by property lines are seen clearÂ­
ly in the maps of Okay as it existed in 1936. The Okay community school seems
to have remained the primary focus of the community from 1880 until the dissoÂ­
lution of the community in 1943.
From the 1880 census returns we find that a teacher was present
3.22
in the community at that date. In the 1930s Mr. Duncan, one of our local inÂ­
formants attended the school which was then taught by his older brother,
B. J. Duncan, who is mentioned above (para. 2.32) in another context as the
son-in-law of Charles Henderson. Thus we find the school in continued operaÂ­
tion over, at least, most of the years of the community's existence. Two
lots (AI04 and AI05). both of roughly two acres, were purchased from the

19

trustees of the Okay school, indicating that the school was rebuilt on one
occasion. Both locations are now under the runway of Gray Army Airfield.
3.3 REGIONAL PATTERNING: Okay logically belongs within a pattern of
early settlement era. Main roadways connected administrative centers at each
county seat. The town of Belton was such a center in the early days. Belton
lies in almost the geographic center of the county, roughly twenty miles--or
a days ride by horseback, from the borders of the county. In the pre-railroad
days the Ivie Mountain road connected Belton with the next county seat,
Lampasas. Okay was a small hamlet that grew up beside this road. When the
city fathers of Belton refused to subsidize the building of the railroad to
their town the railroad retaliated by fOIJnding their own town a few miles
away in an open field. Temple was named for B. M. Temple, the chief construcÂ­
tion engineer of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad. The first lots were
sold on June 29, 1880 (Webb 1952 11:722). Four years later this upstart railÂ­
road town was the largest town in the county with two banks, two weekly newsÂ­
papers and a large number of business houses. A few months later a railroad
spur line connecting Temple with Lampasas was built. The highly nucleated
center of the city of Copperas Cove represents the secondary railroad town that
was founded at the halfway mark on this line.
It appears to have been the closeness of Copperas Cove to the CrossÂ­
ville community that robbed this older hamlet of its post office and separate
existence. After the founding of Copperas Cove the focus of the farming
community in western Bell County centered on trade and commerce. The rural
schools, churches and small stores within an hour's ride of the home remained
the basic focus of community until the mid-20th century. Oscar Lewis (1948)
confirmed that this was still the case in 1948. It is also apparent from the
number of cisterns found at the Okay sites that well drilling was not a factor
in the settlement of Okay. A concrete well head at the Noah site is the only
evidence of well drilling noted in the survey. Where underground masonry
surface cisterns were not excavated it appears that a combination of cattle
tanks, masonry surface cisterns and rain barrels filled the need for water
storage. Under these conditions living at Okay during very dry periods may
have been rather marginal (Tyler 1936:298). Several marked rainless periods

20

occurred in the late 19th century. There does not appear to be any marked
change in the pattern of Okay itself until it was purchased by the government.
4.0 RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUMMARY: Based on the research reported in
detail above, none of the sites located in Area A are considered significant
in terms of National Register of Historic Places criteria. To address
paragraph 1.1.1 of task order 13 directly, the comprehensive justification
for this recommendation is as follows: No significant architectural features
remain. None of the sites were ever associated with persons of historical
note. Similar communities of the dispersed hamlet variety exist in the
immediate vicinity which are virtually intact (Ding Dong, Maxdale. Florence).
Only one of the sites dates to the pre-railroad era. This is the Noah/Givens
site, originally recorded as "Big Depression Site 1 and 2". There does
not appear to be a high degree of potential for recovery of artifacts in
context from this site because it has been bisected by a road. The other
sites investigated (both those originally designated and those located during
the survey of Area A) are all post-railroad era sites less than a century old.
4.1
Paragraph 1.1.2 of the work order asked, "Who were the sites'
owners and occupants throughout their occupational history?" To summarize
this data, which' has been given in detail above, the following listi.lJg.is
offered.
A. Sites 309 and 310 were determined to be a single occupation designated
the Noah/Givens site in the text.
Owners: P.M. Davis, June 29. 1875 to October, 1978
Abram Noah, October 1878 to March 19, 1900
W. A. Brown et. uxâ¢â¢ March 19, 1900 to November 11, 1915
J. P. Givens, November 11. 1915 to 1943
B. Sites 311 and 313 were also found to be a single occupation referred
to in the text above as the W. Jarvis Henderson homestead.
Owners: James Arnold, February 19, 1876 to 1879 (?)
Finis Henderson, 1879 to 1914
W. Jarvis Henderson, 1914 to 1943 (Henderson may have occupied
the site as early as 1908)

21

C. Site number 312 was referred to above as the Charles Henderson
homestead.
Owners: James Cook, October 26, 1870 to 1880 (?)
James Rucker, 1880 to 1881
T. B. Overstreet, September 27, 1881 to June 1, 1882
Finis E. Henderson, June 1, 1882 to April 21, 1914
Charles Henderson et. ux., April 21, 1914 to 1943 (He may have
occupied the site as early as 1901)
D. Site number 314, the last specifically addressed in work order 13,
was called the Intersection Site in the text above.
Owners: Same as for the Charles Henderson site up to April 21, 1914
Thereafter,
W. F. Gay, November, 1915 to March 15, 1916 (This brief ownerÂ­
ship may represent the only actual occupation of this site)
E. A. Cole et. ux.â¢ March 15.1916 to September 17, 1925
Charles Henderson et. ux., September 17, 1925 to 1943
E. The other sites located and reported herein are not directly affected
by the proposed construction.
4.2 Paragraph 1.1.3 of work order 13 asked what community or communities
were each of the sites associated through time. As reported above the
"Crossvil1e community was the early focus of settlement but "Okay" became the
official name of the settlement when a post office was located there briefly.
The common school district was also called Okay.
ll

4.3 Paragraph 1.1.4 asks how each of the sites was related to the old
road system. The map displayed in the text above shows this relationship for
a11 sites.
4.4 Paragraph 1.1.5 asks if each of the sites was occupied and what was
the period of occupation. The following summary is offered from the detailed
presentation in the text.
309/310 (a single site) 1878 - 1943
311 and 313 (a single site) 1908 (1) - 1943
312 1901(1) - 1943
314 November. 1915 - March 1916

22

4.5 Paragraph 1.1.6 in the original work order addressed the economic
function of the sites in question within the local economy as it changed
through time. The tabular 1879 production figures from the 1880 census preÂ­
sent a baseline for the two main farm areas that were part of Area A in
that year. The Noah and Henderson family operations are the first and last
entries "in the table. Only one of the sites mentioned in the originial work
order was occupied in that year. Subsequent agricultural census date for
the twentieth century is not yet available to researchers. Indirect evidence
for an increase in cash crop farming, but little real change from a family
farm economy has been presented.
4.6 Paragraph 1.1.7 of the original work order asks if there is archival
evidence to suggest the site occupants were of a particular ethnic background.
Yes, all but three occupants have been documented as "old line Americans" of
British stock~ indeed this has been shown to be the overwhelming majority of
the occupants of Okay. J. P. Givens, who owned and occupied the 309-310
site after November 1915, and W. F. Gay, who may have occupied the Intersection
site briefly. cannot be documented because the census records for those dates
are still confidential, although the names suggest they, too, fit the old line
American description. The Byler family. who occupied a site identified
during the survey after 1915, is also undocumented 1n this respect.
