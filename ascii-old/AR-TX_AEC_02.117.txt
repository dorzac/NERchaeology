Abstract
In January 2011, Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC completed an
archeological survey of 7.03 miles of proposed pipeline right-of-way for the Ferguson
Flow pipeline on the property of the Ferguson and Eastham State Prison Units in Houston
and Madison counties, Texas. Eight prehistoric and/or historic archeological sites were
recorded during the project (41MA38 to 41MA45).
None of the portions of the sites in the project right-of-way are considered eligible
for State Archeological Landmark designation because their archeological deposits lack
integrity and research potential. Their shallow and sparse archeological deposits do not
have the potential to contribute important information about the prehistory or history of
the local area or Post Oak Savannah region of Texas.
The artifacts and records from this archeological survey project will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

Introduction
At the request of Navidad Resources, LLC (Tyler, Texas), personnel from
Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC (Austin and Pittsburg) completed the
archeological survey of three sections of a proposed pipeline (Ferguson Unit Flow Line)
on property controlled by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) at the
Ferguson and Eastham Prison Units in Houston and Madison counties, Texas (Figure 1).
These units are on either side of the Trinity River, the eastern on the Eastham Unit
(Houston County), and the western sections on the Ferguson Unit (Madison County).

Figure 1. Google Earth map of the three sections of the proposed Ferguson Flow Line
pipeline on the Ferguson and Eastham Prison Units, Madison and Houston counties,
Texas.
This project falls under the purview of the Antiquities Code of Texas, as
amended, and its implementing regulations. Antiquities Permit 5839 was issued by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on December 21, 2010,
to complete archeological survey work on the three sections of the proposed pipeline on
TDCJ property. The pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed pipeline right-ofway was completed between January 11-14, 2011. Backhoe trenching investigations were
conducted by the same personnel on January 14, 2011.

2
The proposed Ferguson Flow Line pipeline totals approximately 7.03 miles in
length, and the proposed right-of-way is 50 ft. Except at the boreholes, the pipeline is to
be laid to a depth of 3.0 ft bs (0.92 m); the borehole will be laid at depths greater than 4.5
m so the pipeline can run under the Trinity River channel. The main Ferguson Unit
section is 3.21 miles in length, the Eastham Unit section is 1.97 miles in length, and the
Ferguson T-section is 1.85 miles in length (see Figure 1). The total project area is 42.5
acres in size.
During the course of the archeological investigations, eight new archeological
sites (41MA38-45) have been identified during the survey of the proposed pipeline rightof-way, all on Ferguson Unit sections of the proposed pipeline in Madison County,
Texas. All eight sites have prehistoric archeological deposits, and two of them (41MA40
and 41MA41) also have late 19th-early 20th century archeological deposits.
Environmental and Cultural Setting
The Ferguson/Eastham prison lands are in the Trinity River basin, along the
boundaries of both the Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods in East Texas (Diggs et al.
2006:Figure 2). The headwaters of the Trinity River originate in the Blackland Prairie
well north of the project area. The Blackland Prairie is a zone of tall grass prairie and
clayey soils, with a riparian deciduous forest of oak, hickory, and other tree species. The
Post Oak Savanna to the east and south of the Blackland Prairie is a narrow southwestnortheast trending woodland that marks an ecotone between the more xeric Blackland
Prairie to the west and the more mesic Pineywoods to the east and southeast. The
woodlands in the Post Oak Savanna consist of broadleaf deciduous forests, primarily
including several species of oak as well as hickory and pecan. Small areas of tall grass
prairie were present in this physiographic province, as well as in the Pineywoods.
The Pineywoods cover much of East Texas, and this physiographic zone is
characterized by broadleaf deciduous forests in more mesic habitats, and a variety of
pines (especially loblolly) on upland sandy and sandy loam soils with adequate moisture.
Bottomland communities in both the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna have a diverse
hardwood and swamp forest, including cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum, with natural
levees and alluvial terraces, point bar deposits, old stream channels, oxbow lakes, and
backwater swamps.
Droughts are not uncommon in modern times in this part of East Texas. Proxy
paleoenvironmental records (i.e., tree rings, isotopes, pollen) indicate that there have been
numerous wet and dry climatic spells during the last 1000 years as well as alternating
periods of colder and warmer temperatures. More extended droughty climatic conditions
may have characterized much of the apparently warmer and drier period between ca.
8000-5000 years ago during the Middle Holocene. Modern climatic conditions, with a
number of moist or dry cycles, began about 5000 years ago at the onset of the Late
Holocene period (Bousman 1998; Brown 1998).

3
The proposed Ferguson Flow pipeline crosses both Eocene-aged landforms and
Quaternary alluvial deposits and formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1968). On the
Ferguson Unit side of the proposed pipeline, much of the main section of the line in the
uplands (162-250 ft. amsl) runs along the crest of the Eocene Yegua formation, a 6001000 ft. thick formation of sand, silt, and clay; petrified wood is abundant in these
deposits. Soils in this area include Chazos loamy fine sand, 1-5% slope, Zack fine sandy
loam, 1-5% slope, and Gredge fine sandy loam, 1-5% slope (Neitsch 1994); frequently
flooded creek deposits along Salt Branch have Hatliff fine sandy loam soils. In the west
side of the alluvial valley of the Trinity River, the pipeline first crosses the Late
Pleistocene Deweyville formation (150-158 ft. amsl), an alluvial deposit with point bar,
natural levee, stream channel, and back swamp areas “at a level only slightly above that
of the present floodplain” (Bureau of Economic Geology 1968). Soils on the Deweyville
formation include Rader fine sandy loam, 1-3% slope, and Burleson clay, 0-1% slope.
Holocene alluvial deposits (146-150 ft. amsl) parallel the modern course of the Trinity
River in a ca. 600-800 m band. Soils include Kaufman clay (in the broad floodplain
itself) and frequently flooded Gladewater and Nahatche soils that are nearest to the
present Trinity River channel. Most of the east side of the proposed pipeline, on the
Eastham unit, crosses Holocene floodplain deposits, and it terminates at the juncture of
the Holocene floodplain with the lowest part of the Deweyville formation. Soils
developed in the Holocene floodplain deposits include Texark clay, Kaufman clay, and
Kosse sandy clay loam (Steptoe 2002). The Kaufman clay and Kosse sandy clay loam
soils occur in relatively north-south zones, suggesting they mark old channel fill and
point bar deposits.
The Post Oak Savanna (or Savanna and Prairie) archeological region (see Perttula
2004a:Figure 1.1) has a diverse archeological record, extending back more than 11,000
years. It is impossible to do it justice in a cultural resources survey report such as this; the
reader should refer to synthesis publications on the archeological record in these regions,
including McGregor and Bruseth (1987), Story (1990), Fields (2004), and Perttula and
Nelson (2008:104-109).
With few exceptions in the last 1000 years of the prehistoric era (cf. Bruseth and
Martin 1987; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Gadus et al. 2002), this part of the state of
Texas was first settled by mobile hunter-gatherers and foragers, and remained an area
lived in by residentially mobile hunter-gatherer populations until the time of European
contact (Story 1990; Fields 2004; Ricklis 2004; Foster 2008). Through time, the Native
American groups became less mobile, and developed distinctive territories within which
diverse settlement and subsistence patterns began to fully develop. Caddo farmers lived
farther to the east in the East Texas Pineywoods (Perttula 2004b, 2008; Story 1990).
Previously Recorded Sites and Projects on the Ferguson and
Eastham Prison Units
No previously recorded archeological sites are known within the boundaries of
the proposed Ferguson Flow pipeline right-of-way. There is one nearby site, however,

4
that warrants mention on the Ferguson Unit: 41MA25. This site was recorded by Godwin
et al. (1998) during the course of an archeological survey of borrow pit locations for the
Ferguson Unit. Site 41MA25 is a large (ca. 5 acres) prehistoric encampment of unknown
age marked by shallow archeological deposits with lithic debris, fire-cracked rocks, and
one piece of burned animal bone. This site was considered to have a low research
potential because its shallow (ca. 8 cm bs) archeological deposits have been adversely
effected by modern cultivation practices, erosion, and soil deflation.
Moore (2008a, 2008b, 2010) and Moore and Baxter (2010) has conducted several
archeological surveys on both the Ferguson State Prison Farm Unit and Eastham State
Prison Farm Unit in Houston and Madison counties, on proposed development areas not
far from our present archeological survey. These surveys examined 39.68 acres of prison
lands through both pedestrian survey and shovel testing, as well as backhoe trenching,
but no prehistoric or historic archeological sites were found in these various project areas.
Field Methods
The purpose of this archeological survey was to locate any previously recorded or
unrecorded archeological sites in the proposed Navidad Resources, LLC Ferguson Flow
pipeline project area or right-of-way. If such archeological sites were located, we were to
consider whether State Archeological Landmark (SAL) or National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) eligibility should be sought for those portions of any sites within the
proposed pipeline right-of-way.
This report of investigations is prepared in accordance with the guidelines and
standards of the Council of Texas Archeologists and the 1983 Secretary of the Interior’s
guidelines for cultural resource management reports. In it, we provide sufficient
information to allow the Archeology Division at the Texas Historical Commission to
assess the adequacy of the pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching to
identify archeological sites and to determine the SAL or NRHP status of any site
investigated within the project area.
The survey methods used for the project consisted of a pedestrian survey and
shovel testing of selected portions of the pipeline right-of-way project area by personnel
from Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC (Figure 2-4). Surface visibility
along the project area ranged from less than 10% to as much as 50%, depending upon the
extent of grass, trees, thick brush, and understory present in the area, as well as the extent
of disturbances in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline right-of-way. In most cases,
surface visibility was good only in the area of modern agricultural fields. Therefore, the
pedestrian survey included shovel testing (using shovel tests about 35 cm in diameter),
where practical, to a maximum of ca. 100 cm below the surface (the maximum depth
reachable by shovel testing) or to the clay subsoil, whichever was reached first, along
with examination of any cut banks, erosional profiles, etc. that existed within each of the
surveyed sections of the proposed pipeline right-of-way. Shovel tests were generally
terminated well before 100 cm bs because of the dense clay. All soil matrix was screened

5
in 20 cm levels through 1/4-inch hardware cloth to recover buried archeological
materials; artifacts recovered in the shovel tests were collected for in-the-field analysis
and documentation, and then returned to the shovel test when it was backfilled. A total of
136 shovel tests were excavated across the project area (see below and Appendix 2).
Backhoe trenches #1 and #2 were excavated on either side of the Trinity River at
the proposed entrance and exit for the proposed pipeline borehole under the Trinity River.
During the course of the trenching to depths of 4.5 m bs, the greatest depth that could be
reached with the backhoe’s arm fully extended, the sediments were examined for the
presence of archeological materials. Approximately 10-20 liters of sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch mesh in the sand and loam zones. Samples of the intractable
clay zone sediments were examined (by breaking up the clods) for the occurrence of
archeological materials with both a flat shovel and trowel.

Current Conditions and Disturbances
The Eastham Unit section of the proposed Ferguson Flow pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) crosses agricultural fields that are currently being prepped for plowing. They
have recently been burned to clear the vegetation. The old north-south plow rows are still
evident.
East of ST 125 (see Figure 4) is an old road that the oil company has recently regraded and placed gravel on the surface. The road ROW is approximately 20 m wide with
fencing bordering the edge of the ROW. The road is about 3-4 m in width, and the
remainder of the ROW offers good visibility from the regrading and ditching (which
extends from 0.6-1 m in depth). Surface visibility is about 50%. There are an additional
three north-south-running roads in this section, and they appear to separate agricultural
fields. These roads are about 4-5 m in width, and they have ditching on either side to
about 1 m in depth.
There are numerous underground irrigation lines in the fields. Occasionally there
was an above ground junction for the irrigation near the ROW.
The edge of the existing well pad (see Figure 4) has 30-50% visibility from the
bulldozing for the pad preparation. No archeological materials were visible along the
edge of the pad area in these exposed areas.
There are three north-south drainage channels about 2 m in depth that cross the
ROW (see Figures 3 and 4). One currently has water, and may be a seasonal stream.
These drainage channels have been artificially channelized, and the soil mounded on
either side.
Generally speaking, the surface visibility was about 10-20% in the Eastham unit
section of the ROW, due to the burning. Where the proposed pipeline crosses the above
mentioned features, the visibility was upwards of 50%.
The Ferguson Unit ROW section is more varied in elevation, soils, and settings
than the Eastham Unit ROW section. The western well pad (see Figure 2, at the
beginning of the ROW) is currently being drilled. From the well pad to FM 247, the
ROW traverses the edge of an upland setting, bisecting the edges of several ridge slope
and toe slopes; between them are shallow drainage areas. The proposed pipeline ROW
bypass a prison pig farming operation with holding ponds for liquid pig manure fertilizer.
These ponds naturally seep water down the shallow drainages. The ponds have
underground irrigation lines that are routed to an above-ground sprinkler system, which
sprays the area and ROW to fertilize them. The area of the ROW is currently in a pasture
supplying grasses for cattle. The visibility is less than 10-20% due to numerous rodent
mounds throughout most of the area, except for two 4-5 m wide dirt road crossings where
the visibility is 40-50% due to continual road grading activities.

10
From FM 247 to ST 43 (see Figure 2), the ROW travels slight sloping pastures
with drainages on both sides. The pasture is dotted with numerous rodent mounds, and
surface visibility is about 10-20%. From FM 247 to near ST 22, the ROW skirts the edge
of a fairly recent prison recreational yard. Two 4-5 m wide dirt roads cross the ROW in
this section, where surface visibility is 40-50% visibility. Just to the East of ST 28, there
is a 40 x 100 m area that has some gray gravel and a blackland clay soil base with mussel
shells built up 10-15 cm in height over a graded clay surface. This area is fenced, and it
has round bales of hay stacked in areas outside the ROW.
A section of the ROW from ST 44-57 (see Figure 2) parallels an older road that
has been re-graded and surfaced with gravel. The road is to access a newly constructed
well pad that has not been drilled. The graded sides of the road, as well as the well pad
location, have good surface visibility (up to 70%) along the northern edge of the ROW.
Most of the southern edge of the ROW is covered in grasses with 10-20% visibility.
A section of the ROW from ST 58-65 (see Figure 2) leaves the improved road
until it rejoins again about 120 m northeast of ST 65. The ROW has a sparse grass cover,
due in part to slope erosion that has left a thin top soil cover or clay exposed at the
surface. The visibility is 20-30% in this area.
The section of the ROW past ST 65 parallels the improved road to just west of ST
74, where it then turns south (see Figure 3). The improved road has exposed graded
banks with up to 70% visibility, while the ROW is in grasses with about 10% visibility.
The rodent mounds are more scattered in this portion of the ROW, and they are more
abundant in the sandy areas. These sandy areas are along the edge of a creek drainage; on
the southern side of the improved road are blackland clay agricultural fields that have
recently been plowed.
From ST 74, the ROW parallels a dirt road to between ST 87 and ST 88 (see
Figure 3). The ROW is in grasses on the northern side of the ROW, but the south side
borders the dirt road. The road side visibility is as much as 70 %, while on the grassed
side, surface visibility is 10-20 % because of numerous rodent mounds in the sandy soils.
An additional dirt road turns to the north by ST 76, and is 4 to 5 m in width. The junction
of the two dirt roads has 70% surface visibility. The southern side of the dirt road also
borders plowed agricultural fields. This area has underground irrigation lines, and several
above ground irrigation stations are visible near the ROW. Another disturbance is a
drainage channel between ST 81 and ST 82 (see Figure 3).
The ROW past ST 88 to the Trinity River bore area has a sparse grass cover
underneath a pecan tree grove. The surface visibility is roughly 30%. This area appears
to have overflow channels paralleling the current River channel.
The southern pipeline route from the beginning of the Ferguson T-section to the
south near ST 96 parallels a fence to the east that separate agricultural fields. The ROW
runs between these fields, which have blackland clay and loam soils. The shovel tests
were supplemented with surface inspection of the plowed fields. The surface visibility is

11
about 30%. Irrigation stations are apparent on the surface, and underground lines are
probably present in the ROW, although none were encountered in the shovel tests.
From ST 96 to ST 113 at a drainage channel (see Figure 3), the soils in the ROW
are sandy with numerous rodent mounds. The area appears to normally be grass-covered,
which has recently been burned. The visibility ranges from 10-20% in most of the ROW,
but the western edge parallels a 1 m deep dry drainage channel that has recently been
cleaned by scraping out silted areas; surface visibility is 50-60% along a narrow area at
the far eastern side the ROW. Areas outside but near the ROW in this area have
numerous large and small ponds constructed to hold water for irrigation purposes.
Disturbances in the ROW area consist of two dirt roads that cross it, a channel paralleling
it, and an east-west drainage area south of ST 113 (see Figure 3).
Past the east-west scoured drainage area between ST 113 and ST 114, the ROW
has intermingled blackland clay and sandy areas. South of ST 114, the ROW runs next to
an improved gravel road that parallels the east side of the ROW (see Figure 3). Surface
visibility along the road is 50-60%, while the remainder of the ROW is grass-covered; in
the sandy areas, surface visibility is only 10-20%. Between ST 118 and ST 119 is a small
drainage cut, and an area just east of ST 119-121 is used by the prison for livestock
holding pens. Between ST 121-122 is an east-west prison road. The aforementioned
improved gravel road runs south of ST 122, closer to the newly constructed but not
drilled well pad (see Figure 3). The area from the old road, the new improved road, and
the well pad has been scraped. The surface is bare, and surface visibility is 40-50%.
Results of Shovel Testing and Backhoe Trenching
Pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing (more than 19 shovel tests per
linear mile) of the proposed pipeline led to the identification of portions of eight
previously archeological sites within the project right-of-way (41MA38-45).
Ferguson #1 Site (41MA38)
The Ferguson #1 site is a prehistoric site of unknown age on an upland ridge (250
ft. amsl), about 300 m northeast of a tributary to Larrison Creek, in the Trinity River
basin. The landform is in a pasture, and surface visibility is less than 10%. The site was
identified only through shovel testing, as it had no surface expression.
The Ferguson #1 has five shovel tests (ST 6-10) that contain prehistoric lithic
artifacts from 0-20 cm bs and 40-60 cm bs (only in ST 8 and ST 9) in Chazos fine sandy
loam sediments, on the crest of the landform (see Figure 2). The estimated extent of the
site in the right-of-way is 1200 m2, or 0.3 acres; it must extend both east and west some
distance outside of the right-of-way. The density of prehistoric artifacts per shovel test is
a low 1.2/per positive shovel test, or ca. 9.6 artifacts per m2.

12
The prehistoric lithic artifacts consist of only six pieces of lithic debris from
chipped stone tool manufacture/maintenance activities. The small pieces of lithic debris
are from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood (n=2), quartzite (n=1),
light gray chert (n=1, a biface thinning flake), brown chert (n=1/100% cortical, but only
on the platform), and a brownish-gray chert (n=1). These materials could have been
obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds or in
upland Uvalde gravels (see Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the site in the past includes previous timber clearing activities and
agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern disturbances include
slope erosion, prison agricultural and ranch-related activities, road construction activities,
and the construction of an underground irrigation system.
Ferguson #2 Site (41MA39)
This site is a prehistoric site of unknown age identified primarily through shovel
testing, although two prehistoric lithic artifacts were noted on the surface. It is on a long
and narrow upland slope that trends northeast-southwest (230 ft. amsl), and is primarily
in a grass-covered pasture with less than 10% surface visibility, except along the road
that cuts through the site; there are a few scattered oak trees in a saddle area on the
landform.
Prehistoric lithic artifacts were obtained from six shovel tests (ST 38-43)
excavated on the site (see Figure 2), as well as a small piece of burned animal bone
(possibly associated with the prehistoric archeological deposits) in ST 42 (0-18 cm bs).
Two pieces of lithic debris (1 petrified wood bipolar flake and 1 dark brownish-gray chert
cortical flake) were also noted on the surface in a road cut between ST 38 and ST 39. The
site covers a 160 x 15 m area of the proposed pipeline right-of-way: 2400 m2 or 0.6 acres;
the site’s boundaries likely extend outside the right-of-way both to the north and south.
The archeological deposits are a maximum of 28 cm in thickness, but with a range of 1628 cm bs in the Gredge fine sandy loam sediments. The density of prehistoric artifacts per
shovel test is a low 1.33/per positive shovel test, or ca. 10.6 artifacts per m2.
The prehistoric lithic artifacts in the shovel testing consist of only seven pieces of
lithic debris from chipped stone tool manufacture/maintenance activities. The small
pieces of lithic debris are from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood
(n=4/50% cortical, including a biface thinning flake), quartzite (n=1/100% cortical),
white-light gray chert (n=1, % cortical), and a translucent gray chert with a limestone
cortex (n=1). These materials could have been obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel
outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds and/or in upland Uvalde gravels (see Shafer
1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #2 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern

13
disturbances include slope erosion, prison agricultural and ranch-related activities, and
road construction activities.
Ferguson #3 Site (41MA40)
The Ferguson #3 site has both prehistoric (of an unknown age) and historic (ca.
1870-1920) archeological components, with the principal use of the site occurring in
historic times. This site is on an upland ridge (230-240 ft. amsl) about 200 m south of a
tributary to Salt Branch, itself a minor tributary of the Trinity River. The landform is in a
grass-covered pasture, with few large oak trees along the crest of the upland ridge.
Surface visibility is about 30-40% due to erosion and road cuts.
Archival investigations and examination of land tract records for the Samuel
Brinberry Survey (259.98 acres) provided by Navidad Resources, LLC, suggest that the
principal and initial resident of the Ferguson #3 site was Harvy Randolph and family
(son Harvey, born in 1872), who acquired the property the site is on by deed in January
18, 1873. Harvey Randolph was a widowed Anglo-American farmer, born in 1819 in
Tennessee, and died in Madisonville, Texas, in July 1897. He had moved to Texas around
1838, receiving a second class grant in Washington County, Texas in 1838. The 1850
U.S. census listed him as a grocery keeper (see
http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~barrett branches). In addition to
Harvey, living in the household (according to the 1880 U.S. Census) were John Randolph
(30 years old), Charley Randolph (22 years old), Mary Alice Randolph (20 years old),
Kate Randolph (14 years old), Florence Randolph (10 years old), Harvey, Jr. (8 years
old), Jesse Randolph (5 years old), and Pearl Randolph (2 years old). Others reported as
living in the household at that time included Caroline Stevens (50 years old), Thomas
Stevens (10 years old), and Willis Perry (21 years old) (see
www.familysearch.org/search/search/index).
Harvey Randolph held onto the property until July 28, 1902, when his estate
deeded the property to J. C. Pyle. Charley A. Randolph took over the property on April 1,
1903, and it remained in his hands until it was subdivided by deed with a 50% deed to W.
L. Hill and J. A. Elkins on February 2, 1910 and a 50% deed to J. A. Henry on May 16,
1910. The land went through several more transactions before H. A. Turner, J. A. Henry,
and A. M. Bartlett deeded the property to the Prison Commission of the State of Texas on
June 8, 1916.
The historic archeological materials from the Ferguson #3 site were recovered in
five shovel tests (ST 44-46, ST 47, and ST 49, see Figure 2). The estimated extent of the
site, including both prehistoric and historic components, in the proposed right-of-way is
120 x 15 m, or 1800 m2 (0.45 acres); based on topography, the site likely extends to the
south outside the proposed pipeline right-of-way. The historic archeological deposits are
a maximum of 20 cm in thickness in the fine sandy loam sediments on the landform. The
density of historic artifacts per shovel test is 2.4/per positive shovel test, or ca. 19.2
artifacts per m2. The historic artifact densities range from 8-24 artifacts per m2.

14
A total of 116 historic artifacts were noted on the surface of the site. These
included whiteware, ironstone, and porcelain sherds, various stoneware sherds, bottle
glass of different colors and kinds, brick fragments, iron fragments, and one porcelain toy
head sherd (Table 1). Together, they represent an assemblage dominated by domestic
(food/kitchen) artifacts, including liquor, snuff, and fruit jar glass (n-45), ceramics used

The historic artifacts found in the shovel testing are listed in Table 2. The 12
artifacts recovered in this work include the same range of artifacts documented in the
site’s surface collection, with the addition of post-1890 wire nails, window glass, and
glass tableware. The window glass and wire nails indicate that a wood-framed structure
with windows stood on the Ferguson #3 site sometime after 1890. The thickness of the
aqua-colored window is consistent with window panes that were manufactured between
1864-1940 + 7 years (1.8-2.7 mm) (see Moir 1987a). Other artifacts, most notably the
stoneware sherds, ceramic maker’s marks, some of the bottle glass, and the few decorated
whiteware sherds, suggests the historic occupation at the Ferguson #3 site most likely
occurred between ca. 1870-1920.

The distinction between the whiteware and ironstone at the site follows the
differences outlined by Moir (1987b) in their paste composition and glaze color. The
remainder of the domestic ceramics are porcelain. Porcelain is a hard paste ceramic that
is highly vitreous and has a translucent white body (Majewski and O’Brien 1987:124).
The refined earthenware sherds are commonly from plates, while the porcelain at the site
includes primarily cups and tea cups.
The few decorated whiteware sherds include one rim with a black floral transfer
print, and two rims from the same vessel with a medium blue transfer-printed floral and
dot element. These are probably from plates made in the late 19th century, since these
types of decorated ceramic ware continued to be produced to this time (Sears-Roebuck
and Co. 1897).
Two sherds have maker’s marks printed on them, one unidentifiable mark on a
whiteware sherd, and a small part of a possible Royal Arms mark on an ironstone vessel
sherd. This mark shows part of the rampant unicorn mark, and although no exact matches

16
were found, this mark resembles back marks placed on whiteware and ironstone vessels
made in England and the United States dating from the 1860s to the early 20th century
(Godden 1964:23, 149; Kovel and Kovel 1986:15c; Gibson 2011:15).
There are four kinds of stoneware vessels (crocks and jugs, and a possible
serving/mixing bowl) represented in the 16 sherds of stoneware found at the site (see
Tables 1 and 2). The yellowware, lead-glazed, and salt-glazed stonewares were generally
made and used only in the 19th century, while the Bristol-glazed stoneware became
popular around the turn of the 20th century (Greer 1981; Lebo 1987; Leibowitz 1985).
More specifically, the lead-glazed wares and the salt-glazed wares were probably made
and used between ca. 1870-1900, after which these forms of stoneware greatly declined
in popularity (Lebo 1987:140). The peak production period for yellowware was in the
1860s and 1870s (Leibowitz 1985:4), but it was still made in the early 1900s.
The late 19th century lead-glazed stoneware sherds have a brown lead glaze on
both interior and exterior surfaces. Salt-glazed stoneware has been made since the first
part of the 19th century (Greer 1981:170), but beginning in the latter part of the 19th
century (ca. 1870), a brown slip tended to be added to one or both surfaces of the
stoneware vessels. Among the salt-glazed stoneware from the site, most have a gray salt
glaze (the gray being the color of the vessel body under the transparent salt glaze) on the
exterior surface, and the interior surface has brown lead-glazed interior.
Part of one toy was found at the site, indicating that children apparently lived at
the Ferguson #3 site. This was a sherd from a porcelain doll. According to Tosa
(1987:20), porcelain dolls were very popular toys from the mid-19th century to World
War I.
The bottle glass sherds at the site are from bottles of several different colors that
held different liquids, including alcohol, patent medicines, lineaments, condiments,
pharmaceuticals, etc. One of the aqua-colored bottle sherds is from a paneled patent
medicine bottle. Paneled patent medicine bottles were made between ca. 1867-1915.
Until the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, patent medicines consisted of
unregulated mixtures of alcohol, herbs, cocaine, and opium (Armstrong and Armstrong
1991:159-160; Torbenson et al. 2000).
Amethyst or purpled bottle glass has a temporal range of ca. 1880-1915,
(Newman 1970). Olive green bottle glass is commonly associated with mid- to late 19th
century wine bottles. There are definite brown snuff jar sherds in the glass collection
from the site. No snuff jar rims were present, but it is likely these snuff jars were
manufactured between ca. 1880-1910.
There are a few sherds from milk glass lid liner inserts for fruit jars in the surface
artifact scatter at the Ferguson #3 site (see Table 1). Zinc lid liners, with the milk glass lid
liner inserts, were used from ca. 1890 up until about 1940 for fruit jars. The low
frequency of the mass-produced glass fruit jars at the site suggests that there was not
much home canning or pickling of fruits and vegetables during the occupation. Instead,

17
the residents here still apparently relied on stoneware storage vessels for preserving
foods. Lebo (1987:121) has noted that there was a reduced need for stoneware vessels in
Texas by the early 20th century, as the use of both stoneware vessels and glass fruit jars
was affected by “new food preservation techniques, changes in canning, pickling, and
refrigeration, slowly reduced the need for large stoneware vessels.”
Metal kitchen items would have been found in the kitchen of the family that lived
at the Ferguson #3 site. Among those were tin can fragment, and pieces from a cast iron
stove or pot/kettle (see Tables 1 and 2).
The wire nails, brick, and window glass comprise the architectural remains of a
structure that stood on the Ferguson #3 site. The wire nails were manufactured after ca.
1891 (Wells 1998; Adams 2002). Although heavily rusted now, they were made from
steel, and had a rounded shaft section as well as a rounded head.
In addition to the historic artifacts found at the Ferguson #3 site, prehistoric lithic
artifacts were obtained from five shovel tests (ST 44-47 and ST 49) excavated on the site
(see Figure 2). The prehistoric archeological deposits are a maximum of 40 cm in
thickness (but range from18-40 cm bs) in the Gredge fine sandy loam sediments on the
landform. The density of prehistoric artifacts per shovel test is 2.4/per positive shovel
test, or ca. 19.2 artifacts per m2.
The prehistoric lithic artifacts in the shovel testing consist of a grayish-red chert
multiple platform core and seven pieces of lithic debris from chipped stone tool
manufacture/maintenance activities. The core (ST 49, 0-20 cm bs) has at least seven flake
removals; cortex remaining on the core is stream-rolled and smooth, indicating that the
raw material for the core was obtained from stream gravels. The core is 45.9 mm in
length, 25.0 mm in width, and 13.0 mm in thickness. The small pieces of lithic debris are
from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood (n=4/0), heat-treated
quartzite (n=1/100% cortical), white-gray chert (n=1), and a translucent Central Texas
honey or beeswax-colored chert (n=1, biface thinning flake; see Miller 2008:27). These
materials could have been obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel outwash sources in
Trinity River gravel beds, in upland Uvalde gravels, and the Yegua formation deposits
(see Bureau of Economic Geology 1968; Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #3 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern
disturbances include slope erosion, prison agricultural and ranch-related activities, road
construction activities, and recent well pad construction. Historic artifacts were noted in
the area of this recently-constructed well pad.
Ferguson #4 Site (41MA41)
The Ferguson #4 site has both prehistoric and late 19th-early 20th century historic
components, similar to the Ferguson #3 site (see above). This site is located on the crest

18
of an upland ridge (250-260 ft. amsl) about 100 m southwest of a tributary to Salt Branch,
in the Trinity River valley. It is currently in a pasture, and surface visibility ranges form
10-20%.
The Ferguson #4 site is on the Thomas Lamb Survey (606.63 acres). During the
period between 1887-1916, which closely matches the estimated age of this historic
archeological site, land title records indicate that the property was owned by deed by a
number of different individuals, until the Prison Commission of the State of Texas was
transferred the property by J. A. Herring on June 8, 1916.
James W. Gillespie, an Anglo-American dry goods merchant in Madisonville,
married to Fannie R. Gillespie (a Texan), took deed to the property on May 7, 1887, and
held onto it until January 7, 1900. Gillespie was born in Tennessee in 1845, but by the
time of the 1880 U.S. Census he was living in Madisonville, Texas. In his household was
his wife Fannie R., and four children, Stella (5 years old), Abner (5 years old), Allan (4
years old), and Kate (2 years old). The fact that James Gillespie lived in Madisonville and
was a business owner, suggests that the property he owned in the Thomas Lamb survey
may have been used for tenant farming, rather than run as a farm by Mr. Gillespie (see
www.familysearch.org/search/recordDetails).
In 1900, L. A. Whatley and J. A. Herring owned the property, then deeded it to a
C. E. Jones in December 1906. H. Kempner received deed to the property where the
Ferguson #4 site is located in January 1909, but he then deeded it to P. Gilbert in July
1909. There were at least seven more owners of the property between July 1909 and June
1916, after which it was deeded to the Prison Commission of the State of Texas.
The historic archeological materials from the site were recovered in five shovel
tests (ST 24-28) (see Figure 2). These indicate that the maximum extent of the Ferguson
#4 site in the proposed right-of-way is 100 x 15 m, or 1500 m2 (ca. 0.37 acres); the site’s
boundaries likely extend outside the proposed right-of-way to the north and south. The
historic archeological deposits are a maximum of 20 cm in thickness in the Chazos fine
sandy loam sediments on the landform. The density of historic artifacts per shovel test is
4.6/per positive shovel test, or ca. 36.8 artifacts per m2. The highest historic artifact
density is in ST 27 (n=13) (see Figure 2).
A total of eight historic artifacts were noted on the surface of the site. These
included two plain whiteware sherds, brown (n=1) and clear (n=2) bottle glass, one brick
fragment, and two metal fragments.
Among the 23 historic artifacts found in the shovel testing are the following:
plain whiteware body sherd (n=1)
plain ironstone rim sherd (n=2)
white milk glass fruit jar lid liner sherd (n=1)
aqua bottle glass (n=6)
amber bottle glass (n=1)

19
brown bottle glass (n=1)
brown snuff bottle glass (n=1)
thin clear glass (possibly medicinal or light bulb) (n=2)
tin can fragments (n=3)
metal lid fragment (n=1)
wire nails (n=2)
unidentified nail shanks (n=1)
hand-made brick fragment (n=1)
This range in the kind of artifacts recovered at the Ferguson #4 site suggest that there was
a post-1890 (Wells 1998) wood-framed structure at the site, probably occupied by a
tenant farmer, based on the recovery of wire nails, and it may have had a brick chimney.
The other artifacts are from the domestic consumption of liquids in aqua, amber, and
brown bottles and brown glass snuff bottles, as well as the preparation and consumption
of food stuffs on refined earthenware plates and in fruit jars and tin cans. The amber
bottle glass further suggests that the site may have been occupied until ca. 1930
(Newman 1970), although this is unlikely since the property had been transferred to the
Prison Commission of Texas in 1916; the site was certainly not occupied after it became
prison property. The fact that ceramics from the site are outnumbered 3:1 by the bottle
glass, not an unusual occurrence on historic sites dating to the late 19th century and after,
suggests that the residents had access to bottled liquids and other glass containers that
could be readily shipped by railroad.
In addition to the historic artifacts found at the Ferguson #4 site, prehistoric lithic
artifacts were obtained from four shovel tests (ST 24-27) excavated on the site (see
Figure 2). The prehistoric archeological deposits are a maximum of 20 cm in thickness in
the Chazos fine sandy loam sediments on the landform. The density of prehistoric
artifacts per shovel test is a 1.25/per positive shovel test, or ca. 10 artifacts per m2.
The prehistoric lithic artifacts in the shovel testing consist of five pieces of lithic
debris from chipped stone tool manufacture/maintenance activities. The small pieces of
lithic debris are from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood (n=1/100%
cortical), heat-treated quartzite (n=2/50% cortical), gray chert (n=1/% cortical), and a
gray chert with bluish inclusions (n=1/0% cortical); this latter distinctive chert (possibly
Georgetown chert from Williamson County, Texas, in Central Texas) was also seen on a
lithic flake in the 41MA44 archeological deposits. These materials could have been
obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds, in
upland Uvalde gravels, and the Yegua formation deposits (see Bureau of Economic
Geology 1968; Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #4 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern
disturbances include slope erosion, prison agricultural and ranch-related activities, and
bioturbation from rodent activities in the sandy sediments.

20
Ferguson #5 Site (41MA42)
This prehistoric site of probable early Late Archaic age is situated on a sandy rise
(150-160 ft. amsl) on the Late Pleistocene Deweyville formation alluvial terrace. This
rise is grass-covered, and is located at the edge of a pasture and agricultural fields to the
south and east in areas of Late Pleistocene and Holocene blackland clay. There are two
roads that cut across the Ferguson #5, dividing it into two halves. Surface visibility on the
landform ranges from less than 10% to 40-50% in the road cuts.
Prehistoric lithic artifacts were obtained from six shovel tests (ST 75-80)
excavated on the site (see Figure 3). These shovel tests indicate that the known extent of
the site within the proposed pipeline right-of-way is 2550 m2 (ca. 0.6 acres). Seven pieces
of lithic debris (single flakes of yellowish-gray chert, translucent gray chert, dark gray
chert, light gray-white chert, a banded gray chert, heat-treated quartzite, and petrified
wood) and a quartzite core fragment were also noted on the surface in a road cut.
Adjacent to ST 76, a petrified wood Morrill dart point (Turner and Hester 1999:160) was
found, likely dating to ca. 5000 B.P., at the beginning of the Late Archaic period. This
dart point has a rectangular stem and a flat base, a resharpened blade, squared shoulders,
and thick knot of material that was not removed from one face when the point was made;
it is bifacially flaked. The dart point is 53.0 mm in length, 23.2 mm in width, 9.9 mm in
thickness, and it has a stem width of 18.2 mm.
The archeological deposits are a maximum of 58 cm in thickness, but with a range
of 39-58 cm bs in the Rader fine sandy loam sediments on the landform. The density of
prehistoric artifacts per shovel test is a 2.33/per positive shovel test, or ca. 18.6 artifacts
per m2.
The prehistoric lithic artifacts in the shovel testing consist of 14 pieces of lithic
debris from chipped stone tool manufacture/maintenance activities. The small pieces of
lithic debris are from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood (n=8, no
cortical flakes), heat-treated quartzite (n=2/100% cortical), yellow chalcedony (n=1, 0%
cortical), brown chert (n=1/0% cortical), gray chert (n=1/100% cortical, with a limestone
cortex), and red chert (n=1/100% cortical). These materials could have been obtained
from Edwards Plateau gravel outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds, in upland
Uvalde gravels, and the Yegua formation deposits (see Bureau of Economic Geology
1968; Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #5 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern
disturbances include slope erosion, prison agricultural and ranch-related activities, road
construction activities, and the construction of an underground irrigation system.

21
Ferguson #6 Site (41MA43)
The Ferguson #6 site is a prehistoric site of unknown age. It was located by
shovel testing on the western edge of the Deweyville formation Late Pleistocene terrace
(150-155 ft. amsl), overlooking a small tributary of Salt Branch that is 60 m to the west;
this tributary flows north and east into Salt Branch. The pipeline right-of-way area is in a
grass-covered pasture, and surface visibility is less than 10%, except in road cuts, where
the visibility is 40-50%.
Prehistoric lithic artifacts were obtained from two shovel tests (ST 68-69)
excavated on the Ferguson #6 site (see Figure 2). Four pieces of lithic debris (three
petrified wood flakes and a heat-treated quartzite flake) were also noted on the surface.
Based on the location of positive shovel tests and the extent of prehistoric artifacts on the
surface, the estimated extent of the site within the proposed right-of-way is 120 x 15 m
or 1800 m2 (ca. 0.45 acres); the site’s boundaries may extend further to the east on the
Deweyville terrace. The archeological deposits are a maximum of 17 cm in thickness, but
with a range of 10-17 cm bs in the Gredge fine sandy loam sediments. The density of
prehistoric artifacts per shovel test is a very low 1.0/per positive shovel test, or ca. 8
artifacts per m2.
The prehistoric lithic artifacts in the shovel testing consist of only two pieces of
lithic debris from chipped stone tool manufacture/maintenance activities. The small
pieces of lithic debris are from the reduction of pebbles and cobbles of petrified wood
(n=2/50% cortical). This material was likely obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel
outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds, in upland Uvalde gravels, and in the Yegua
formation deposits (see Bureau of Economic Geology 1968; Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #6 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land), along with occasional
flooding episodes along the Trinity River. More modern disturbances include prison
agricultural and ranch-related activities, road construction activities, and the construction
of an underground irrigation system.
Ferguson #7 Site (41MA44)
This site is a prehistoric site of probable Late Archaic (ca. 3000 years B.P.) age. It
is situated on the eastern edge of a long upland ridge slope (200 ft. amsl) that overlooks
the Trinity River floodplain. The landform is in a pasture, with a surface visibility of less
than 10% to as much as 50%, but there are oak trees scattered across the pasture. The site
area is well eroded, with the B-horizon clay exposed on the surface in several places on
the landform.
Only prehistoric lithic artifacts were recovered in the investigations at the
Ferguson #7 site, including the excavation of three positive shovel tests (ST 61-63, see
Figure 2). The estimated extent of the site in the proposed pipeline right-of-way is 40 x

22
15 m, or 600 m2 (ca. 0.15 acres); the site’s boundaries likely extend to the east and west
of the proposed pipeline right-of-way. These three shovel tests had a very low density of
prehistoric artifacts (1.0 per positive shovel test and ca. 8 artifacts per m2). These
archeological materials are in very shallow (0-10 cm bs) Gredge fine sandy loam
sediments. A single gray chert (with blue inclusions, probably Georgetown chert from
Central Texas) expedient flake tool with unilateral use-wear was noted on the surface of
this site, but it was not collected.
The artifacts found in the shovel tests include one dart point (ST 62, 0-8 cm bs)
and two pieces of lithic debris in the other two shovel tests. The dart point is a Late
Archaic (ca. 3000 years B.P.) Dawson type (see Turner and Hester 1999:102) with a long
rectangular stem, with a resharpened blade, rectangular barbs, and a slightly convex base;
it is bifacially worked and made from a non-local piece of gray novaculite. It is 42.0 mm
in length, 20.0 mm in width, 5.9 mm thick, and has a 10.1 mm stem width. The lithic
debris includes a yellowish-red chert flake with a limestone-covered cortex and a reddishbrown chert non-cortical flake. These materials were likely obtained from Edwards
Plateau gravel outwash sources in Trinity River gravel beds, in upland Uvalde gravels,
and in the Yegua formation deposits (see Bureau of Economic Geology 1968; Shafer
1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #7 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land). More modern
disturbances include extensive slope erosion, and prison agricultural and ranch-related
activities.
Ferguson #8 Site (41MA45)
The Ferguson #8 site is a prehistoric site of unknown age. It is situated on a
natural sandy rise (150-160 ft. amsl) at the eastern edge of the Deweyville formation Late
Pleistocene alluvial terrace, overlooking the Holocene floodplain of the Trinity River. It
is in an agricultural field that is currently in pasture; surface visibility is 10-20%. There is
a small artificially-dug pond on the west side of the site, just outside the proposed rightof-way, along with a north-south running and 1 m deep drainage channel that parallels
the right-of-way.
Only prehistoric lithic artifacts were recovered in the investigations at the
Ferguson #8 site, including the excavation of three positive shovel tests (ST 107, 108,
and 110, see Figure 3). The estimated extent of the site in the proposed pipeline right-ofway is 80 x 15 m or 1200 m2 (ca. 0.3 acres). These three shovel tests had a low density of
prehistoric artifacts at 1.33 per positive shovel test and ca. 10.6 artifacts per m2. These
archeological materials are in shallow (0-40 cm bs) Gowker-Portersprings complex fine
sandy loam sediments. A single brown chert single platform core fragment was noted on
the surface of this site, along with three flakes of petrified wood, but they were not
collected.

23
The artifacts found in the shovel tests include four pieces of lithic debris in the
three shovel tests. The lithic debris includes a yellow chert non-cortical flake; a noncortical petrified wood flake; a heat-treated quartzite cortical flake; and a brown chert
cortical flake. These materials were likely obtained from Edwards Plateau gravel outwash
sources in Trinity River gravel beds, in upland Uvalde gravels, and in nearby Yegua
formation deposits (see Bureau of Economic Geology 1968; Shafer 1973).
Disturbances to the Ferguson #8 site in the past includes previous timber clearing
activities and agricultural activities (including plowing the land), as well as occasional
Trinity River flood episodes. More modern disturbances include prison agricultural and
ranch-related activities, pond construction, and drainage construction activities.
Backhoe Trench #1 and #2 at the Trinity River Boreholes
Backhoe trench #1 and #2 were excavated at the two bore hole areas on the west
and east side of the Trinity River floodplain along the proposed pipeline right-of-way
(see Figure 3). Although fill was either screened through 1/4-inch mesh from both
backhoe trenches, or examined with a flat shovel and trowel, no near surface or buried
archeological materials were recovered in either trench.
Backhoe trench #1 was 8 x 0.9 m in length and width, and reached to 4.5 m bs;
the water table was reached at that depth. There were 11 alternating zones of clay and
sand defined in the profile, namely:
Zone 1, 0-10 cm, dark reddish-gray clay
Zone 2, 10-35 cm, dark gray clay
Zone 3, 35-40 cm, grayish-brown sand
Zone 4, 40-89 cm, dark grayish-brown clay with strong brown mottles
Zone 5, 89-120 cm, dark grayish-brown and strong brown clay lens
Zone 6, 120-125 cm, grayish-brown sand with strong brown mottles
Zone 7, 125-200 cm, very dark gray clay with strong brown mottles
Zone 8, 200-270 cm, dense dark gray clay
Zone 9, 270-320 cm, very dark gray clay with strong brown mottles and
manganese concretions
Zone 10, 320-420 cm, very dark grayish-brown clay
Zone 11, 420-450 cm+, yellowish-brown sand
In Backhoe trench #2, a profile of the alluvial deposits on the east side of the
Trinity River extended to 4.5 m bs; no water table was reached. The alluvial deposits are
thicker here than was documented in Backhoe trench #1, as the Zone 11 yellowish-brown
sand was not encountered in Backhoe trench #2, but is apparent below 4.5 m bs in the
river cut bank profile. The alluvial zones in this profile are:
Zone 1, 0-32 cm, very dark gray clay
Zone 2, 32-210 cm, dark grayish-brown clay with strong brown mottles

24
Zone 3, 210-240 cm, dense dark gray clay
Zone 4, 240-320 cm, very dark gray clay with calcium carbonate
Zone 5, 320-350 cm, dark grayish-brown clay and strong brown clay lens
Zone 6, 350-450 cm, dark yellowish-brown loamy clay with gray mottles
The same basic profile of alternating zones of clay and zone is apparent in the
Trinity River cut bank, in an area just north of the borehole on the Eastham Unit, all
resting on a visible yellowish-brown sand near the river’s current water level (Figure 5ab). A profile cleared on the eastern bank to 4.9 m bs (the river level) had the following
eight zones:
Zone 1, 0-28 cm, yellowish-brown sand
Zone 2, 28-110 cm, very dark grayish-brown clay
Zone 3, 110-190 cm, dark grayish-brown clay with strong brown mottles
Zone 4, 190-230 cm, dense dark gray clay
Zone 5, 230-320 cm, very dark gray clay with calcium carbonate
Zone 6, 320-380 cm, dark grayish-brown clay and strong brown clay lens
Zone 7, 380-450 cm, dark yellowish-brown loamy clay with gray mottles
Zone 8, 450-490 cm+, yellowish-brown sand

Summary and Recommendations
During the course of the January 2011 survey of the proposed Ferguson Flow
pipeline right-of-way (7.03 miles in length and 42.5 acres) on both the Ferguson and
Eastham State Prison Units, in Houston and Madison counties, Texas, by personnel from
Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC, a total of eight new archeological
sites (41MA38-41MA45) were identified in the pipeline right-of-way. In most cases, it
appears that the actual boundaries of the sites extend outside the 50 ft. right-of-way for
the pipeline.
Each of the eight new sites have prehistoric archeological components, most of
them being of an unknown age, with shallow archeological deposits characterized by low
densities of only lithic artifacts (especially lithic debris from chipped stone manufacture
and maintenance activities) and a low diversity in the range of prehistoric lithic artifacts
found on the sites. Two sites each contain a single dart point, suggesting that they were
occupied during the early and latter parts of the Late Archaic period (ca. 5000-3000 years
B.P., 41MA42 and 41MA44). The eight sites with prehistoric components contain no

26
obvious surface or buried concentrations of artifacts, no midden deposits, almost no
preserved plant or animal remains, and no evidence that they have preserved burned rock
or mussel shell features, such as are seen in better-preserved Archaic sites in the region
(cf. Fields 2004; Ricklis 2004).
Two of these prehistoric sites also have late 19th-early 20th century archeological
deposits and associated material culture remains: 41MA40 and 41MA41. These historic
components are marked by mass-produced nails, window glass, refined earthenware
ceramics, stoneware, and bottle glass, along with evidence for the use of fruit jars and
other domestic goods, along with a few bricks. Although no evidence for structures,
foundations, wells, or privies were noted on these two sites, either on the surface or in the
shovel testing, it is likely that these sites represent the archeological remnants of tenant
farms (cf. Saunders 1996; Turner 1936) and/or local farmers engaged in cotton
cultivation. The historic components at these two sites contain no obvious surface or
buried concentrations of artifacts, no midden deposits, no preserved plant or animal
remains, and no evidence that they have structural or domestic features or yard
work/trash disposal areas, such as are seen in better-preserved Historic sites in the region
(cf. Moir and Jurney 1987).
In this concluding section of the Summary and Recommendations, we discuss
whether any of the sites warrant designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL),
following the Criteria for Evaluating Archeological Sites (Chapter 26.8) in the General
Rules of Practice and Procedure (Chapter 26) for the Antiquities Code of Texas. SAL
criteria for archeological sites include the following: (1) sites have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory or history of a region (such as East
Texas) by the addition of new and important information; (2) the archeological deposits
and the artifacts within each of the sites are preserved and intact, supporting the research
potential or preservation interests of the sites; and (3) the sites have unique or rare
attributes concerning a region’s prehistory or history.
Based on archeological survey-level data from the proposed Ferguson Flow
pipeline project, archeological sites documented on the project would have the potential
to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory or history of East Texas if they
could be shown to contain isolable and contextually intact components (i.e., are preserved
and have integrity) with a sufficient quantity of archeological materials to enable a
reasonable interpretation of the character, distribution, and density of material remains,
good preservation of faunal and/or floral remains, and specific classes of features.
Integrity refers to the “ability of a property to convey its significance…and to retain
historic integrity a property will always possess several, and usually most, of the aspects”
(Townsend et al. 1993:17). With respect to archeological resources, integrity is best
assessed by ascertaining if the sites have the following characteristics: (1) the
archeological deposits appear intact and well preserved, and features have either been
identified, or the potential exists for features to be present; (2) there exists, or the
potential exists, for intra-site patterning in the distribution and depth of features and
artifacts; and (3) representative samples are present from undisturbed contexts of artifacts
and/or features in different site assemblages.

27

None of the portions of the eight recorded sites in the proposed Ferguson Flow
pipeline project area warrant designation as SALs, simply because of the limited amount
of archeological and/or historical information that is available from them. Due to the lack
of integrity of the archeological deposits, along with sparse and shallow archeological
deposits, limited archeological content and potential, as well as past disturbances, these
eight sites do not have the potential to contribute important or unique information about
the prehistory or history at the local, regional, or state-wide levels. As such, those
portions of the eight sites in the project area right-of-way (41MA38 to 41MA45) do not
warrant designation as SALs because of their lack of integrity and limited research or
preservation potential. Thus, those portions of the sites in the proposed pipeline right-ofway do not warrant any further actions or consideration during the construction and
development of the proposed Ferguson Flow pipeline.
However, these construction and development areas should be confined to the 50
ft. construction easement/right-of-way. Unknown portions of each of the sites may exist
outside of the proposed right-of-way, and their SAL significance remains unevaluated at
the present time.
