INTRODUCTI ON
At the request of Central and South West Services, Inc. of
Dallas, Texas, the Texas Archeological Survey, the University of
Texas at Austin, conducted a preliminary assessment of cultural
resources known to lie within a series of proposed transmission
line corridors in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. The proposed
routes comprise a corridor 123 miles long and 3.5 miles wide from
which a 150 foot wide right-of-way will be selected. With the
addition of the alternate routes, the total area under consideration
for modification is approximately 400 miles long.
The results of this study are to serve the sponsoring agency
as a guide for planning the final route of 345KV transmission
lines connecting existing power generating stations. More specif­
ically, the objectives of this study are:
1) To conduct a thorough investigation of the files of the
Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, the Oklahoma Archeological Survey and the
Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism to
determine the location and nature of recorded historic and
archeological sites within the proposed transmission corri­
dors;
2) To examine the published and unpublished documents in
the libraries and files of the named institutions to determine
which portions of the proposed corridors have been subjected
to previous cultural resource investigations or surveys;
3) To evaluate the available information, and from this
assessment to derive a first approximation of the general
pattern of site locations in the areas of the proposed
corri dors;
4) To present recommendations for feasible measures to avoid,
lessen or minimize adverse effects to any cultural resources
within the proposed corridors; and
5) To recommend further archeological and historic studies to
be undertaken when construction plans are finalized.

RESEARCH PROCEDURES
The files of the Texas Historical Commission were checked for
historic and archeological sites listed on, or nominated to, the
National Register of Historic Places. The records of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, the University of Texas at Aust'in,
the central repository for archeological site information in Texas,
were examined. The precise location of all recorded sites within
or adjacent to the proposed corridors were plotted on U.S.G.S.
topographic maps. Descriptive information on th~ temporal and topo­
graphic placement, the present condition and the cultural affi1iation
of all sites was tabulated. The published and unpublished litera­
ture pertinent both to the specific and general areas under con­
sideration was consulted to determine the extent and quality of pre­
vious cultural resources surveys.
For information on state parks and historic areas under consid­
eration by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Mr. Ron Ralph
of Master Planning and Mr. David Ing of Historic Sites were consult­
ed.
The Oklahoma Archeological Survey plotted the location of all
previously recorded sites in areas where proposed corridors extend­
ed into Oklahom~and provided abbreviated descriptive data. Dr. Don
Wyckoff, Director of the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, provided a
commentary on general patterning of aboriginal sites and on previous
work in that area. The Oklahoma Office of Historic Preservation
files were examined for sites on the National Register of Historic
Places. Ms. Melvina Thurman, Acting Director, assisted in the iden­
tification of cultural resources in the area.
The records of the Louisiana Division of Archeology and His­
toric Preservation were searched and the following personnel of that
agency consulted: Kathleen Byrd, State Archeologist; George McCluskey
and Debbie Woodiel, Staff Archeologists; John Easterly, Historian;
Jonathon Fricher~ Architectural Historian; and Kirk Cordell, Resource
Survey Coordinator.
The precise location of all recorded sites and areas that have
been surveyed for cultural resources are indicated on the accompany­
ing U.S.G.S. topograghic maps. The sponsoring agency is requested
to restrict the distribution of this specific information in order to
minimize the possibility of vandalism to these known cultural resourc­
es. Additional information summarized by corridor is:

1) Descriptive information about the temporal and topographic

placement, the current condition and the cultural affiliation of
sites;

•

4

2) Sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places;
3) An evaluation of the intensity and precision of previous
investigations;
4) Expectations concerning archeological site sensitivity to
land modifications; and
5) Recommendations for the routing of specific lines to mini­
mize the impact of construction upon the cultural resources.
Where feasible, the specific recommendations are identified accord­
ing to mile increments originating at the southernmost station.
RecommendationsTor archeological and historic fnvs"stlgations
to be undertaken when construction plans are finalized are presented
in the Summary and Conclusions. A bibliography of literature per­
tinent to the cultural resources of each corridor and the surround­
ing area is appended.

The twelve aboriginal sites reported within the corridor are all
in Oklahoma. No sites have been recorded in the Texas segment of the
line. All of the sites are located in close proximity to creeks or
drainways. One site is located on the floodplain of an abandoned
channel, two on stream banks, one on a stream terrace, and eight are
on interfluvial knolls and ridges. Three of the sites are known to be
disturbed; there is no information on the condition of the others.
Two of the sites are chronologically placed in the Archaic
Period (8,000-1,250 B.P.); one is Archaic to Late Prehistoric (1,250­
European contact) and one is Late Prehistoric. Eight are of unknown
aboriginal origin.
Previous Archeological Investigations
The 63 mile lang corridor connecting Bowman, Texas and Lawton,
Oklahoma crosses an area in which little organized archeological investigation has taken place. Krieger (1946) discussed the area in a
general fashion, with virtually all of his data being drawn from the
collections and impressions of local amateurs (see, for example,
Henry n.d.; Witte 1935; Wright 1940), plus systematic excavations at
the Harrell Site in Yaung County. Since Krieger's regional summary,
little of a systematic nature has been added to the data base,
except for a few survey and testing projects carried out in regions
peripheral to the present inquiry. These must be mentioned, however,
since they represent the closest professional work from which we may
extrapolate.
In 1953, Jelks and Moorman, under the auspices of the Smithson­
ian Institution River Basin Survey. located 21 archeological sites in
the area to be flooded by Paint Creek Reservoir in Haskell County.
Shafer (1966) reported the discovery of five sites in the Halsell
Reservoir area, now Lake Arrowhead. The Miller Creek Reservoir
was surveyed in 1969 by Malone and Briggs (1970) and 21 archeological
sites were located prior to inundation. These surveys neither over­
lap with, nor are immediately adjacent to, the proposed corridors.
However. in conjunction with the reports of local amateurs and col­
lectors, they demonstrate that the Texas portion of the area to be
directly affected by the proposed construction is not an archeological
void.
Reports by local collectors, and interpolation from the surveys
and testing in areas peripheral to the corridor, indicate that
quite the opposite situation exists. Witte (1935) speaks of
IIhundreds of campsites and workshops" in the general area. Ray
(1955) states that surface sites are very numerous. The reservoir
surveys mentioned earlier indicate the presence of archeological
resources in areas which may be expected to be culturally similar
to the stream valleys crossed by the proposed transmission lines.

~,

7

The Oklahoma portion of the corridor also traverses an area which,
to date, has not been systematically surveyed for cultural resources.
Organized research has been limited to a few small surveys for pipe­
lines (Spivey, Ferring, Crouch and Franklin 1977) and Soil Conserva­
tion Service impoundments. Northwest of the corridor, some investi­
gations have been conducted on the Fort Sill Military Reservation
(Ferring 1978). However, most of the recorded sites in the corridor
were reported by amateurs.
Conclusions
Due to the paucity of information in this region, only general
recommendations can be offered. Archeologically sensitive areas
probably exist along the tributaries and mainstems of the Wichita
and Red rivers.
Although the active planation of the Red River
has probably destroyed the majority of sites within its floodplain,
this same erosional environment may be expected to result in the
exposure of buried cultural material in the cutbanks.
It is possible that the bulk of the hundreds of surface sites
reported by Witte in 1935 were exposed by the defoliation which
resulted from the great dust storms of the 1930'5. Many of these
shallow sites may since have been disturbed or destroyed by changing
land use patterns. The intensive agricultural modification of
large areas within this region would disrupt or destroy surface­
exposed cultural materials.

Of the 93 sites recognized within the 13 mile long Welsh-Monticello
corridor, 62 are located on interfluvial uplands, 21 on stream terraces
and 10 on the floodplains. This apparent patterning of site location
does not necessarily reflect the reality of aboriginal settlement in
the area. Prior surveys have concentrated in the reservoir areas and,
more specifically, on what were considered to be Iprime site localit­
ies', i.e. knolls and slopes adjacent to drainways. This in turn may
account for the paucity of recorded historic sites,which are usually
found in the uplands.
Largely as a result of the construction of reservoirs, 44 of the
reported 93 sites are known to have been destroyed; three are intact
and the rest are either disturbed or their condition is unknown.
Chronological assignments of the recorded sites, where possible,
indicate two Paleoindian (12,000-8,000 B.P.), 20 Archaic (8,000­
1.250 B.P.), 44 Ceramic or Formative {1,250- European contact},
eight Euro-American and 33 unknown aboriginal sites. Twelve of the
sites have been recognized as mUlti-component occupations.
Previous Archeological Investigations
The area traversed by the Welsh-Monticello corridor has long been
the subject of archeological investigations, some professiona1 and a
great many amatuer. During the Works Progress Administration years,

- -

archeologists, using information garnered from local informants,
excavated a number of Caddoan cemetaries. Other sites were also
located, but, as a general rule, only excavated sites were recorded
and only cemetaries were excavated. These sites, in addition to
any information reported directly to the Texas A;rcheol,ogical Research
Laboratory are included in the files there.
In 1935, Walter R. Goldschmidt produced a thesis (as well as
a shorter summary of it) which reported the excavation of eight of
these sites in Titus County, none of which fall within the proposed
corridor. Although local collectors seem to have remained sporadically
active in the region, there followed a hiatus in organized research
which continued until the end of the 1960's.
In 1969, D.P. Hsu published a report on archeological survey
in the proposed Titus County Reservoir, which included portions of
what are now Lakes Monticello and Bob Sandlin, on Big Cypress Creek.
The survey covered 75% of the reservoir area, a region with an ultimate
water surface of 17,650 acres. However, the boundaries of the
project area are not clearly defined and since several of the recorded
sites are located above the flood pool level, the precise limits of
this survey are not clear.
Much of the reservoir area was intensively cultivated for about
50 years prior to being converted, by means of bulldozer leveling,
into improved pasture. During the survey period, these areas of
improved pasture were covered by a thick mat of vegetation which
effectively obscured ground visibility except in disturbed areas
(rodent burrows, erosional gullies, road cuts). Some sites were
discovered on sandy knolls within the floodplain but it is likely
that the bulk of the sites had already been destroyed by agricultural
land modification. The surveyors used aerial photographs and topo­
graphic maps to pinpoint topographic situations which they expected
would yield archeological remains - sandy knolls and other elevated
areas. Forested, swampy, low-lying or heavily vegetated areas were
not equally represented in the areas surveyed.
Of the nineteen sites located by this survey, seven are in the
extreme southwestern section of the corridor.
In 1973, McCormick reported an archeological reconnaissance of
30% of a 3,000 acre area to be affected by a reservoir and electrical
generating plant on Swauano Creek. This work was done in three days
by a volunteer crew under conditions and assumptions similar to those
evident in Hsu's work. Thirty-five sites were recorded; 28 are within
the corridor.
Also in 1973, McCormick reported upon a survey in the area of lake
Monticello. Of the 68 sites located, 15 had been badly damaged or
were destroyed by ongoing constuction and another 50 have since been
inundated by the reservoir. Twenty-two of the sites fell within the
corridor.

The surveyors were again faced with handicaps similar to those
described for Hsu. An estimated 60% of the area was in improved pasture;
thus, exposed archeological material was disturbed or destroyed and
surface visibility was poor. Much of the remaining area was in timber.
Furthermore, this area has for many years been subjected to the activ­
ities,of amateur collectors.
The exact boundaries of this survey, as well as those of the two
previously described, are not marked on the accompanying quad maps, but
all three surveys are probably fairly well deliniated by the concentra­
tions of sites reported in the reservoir areas.
In 1974, McCormick reported on the mitigative excavation of six
sites in the Lake Monticello area, two of which fall within the
corridor under consideration.
During 1975, Timothy L. Sullivan reported on archeological survey,
test"ing and excavations undertaken in the 10,000 acre Lake Bob Sandlin
area during 1974 and 1975. One hundred six sites were located, seven
were tested and two further excavated. Of the sites listed in this
report, thirty fall within the bounds of the corridor. Once again,
difficulties such as heavy ground cover and previous disturbances
complicated the surveyor's task.
During the period from June through August, 1978, the University
of Texas at Austin Field School, under the direction of Or. Dee Ann
Story, surveyed or re-surveyed a large portion of the Lake Bob Sandlin
area, below the 350 MSL line. Twenty-six new sites were discovered;
only three of these fall within the corridor. In addition, a number
of previously recorded sites were reassessed. That so many new sites
were located within an area which had been previously investigated is
a further demonstration of the difficulties of survey in this area.
Thurmond (personal communication) points out that he counted at least
fifty-seven private collectors scouring the area after every rain,
often removing all surface evidence of sites. In addition, the flood­
plain area is currently subject to rapid deposition, making it probable
that sites in that area are deeply buried or have been destroyed by
channel migration.
Conclusions
An evaluation of the publications reporting upon archeological
investigations in and around the Welsh to Monticello corridor reveals
that, due to a combination of heavy ground cover and the orientation
of the research design, past surveys can not be considered to have
adequately sampled the diverse topographic and biotic zones. Surficial
examinations were often limited to floodplains, knolls and slopes

11

adjacent to floodplains. cleared stream terraces. interfluvial uplands
and erosional features where cultural materials might be evident. The
high site density in these areas indicates that the entire corridor is
situated "in an archeologically sensitive area. High site density has
been demonstrated on stream terraces, and especially on the interfluvial
uplands immediately adjacent to streams. Although there is no direct
evidence concerning the areas farther from the drainways, a general
knowledge of environmental adaptation of the aboriginal groups in this
region suggests that those areas will contain a lower, but still
significant, number of sites.
In the first two mile segment of the corridor (Mile 11-13),
initiated at the Welsh terminus, the high site density recorded is
a reflection of the reservoir surveys along Swauano Creek. Between
Miles 8 and 10 no sites have been recorded, but they probably exist
along Williamson Creek and Prairie Branch.
Several sites have been reported between Miles 3 and 7. A con­
centration along Hart Creek will probably be duplicated along each
of the tributaries to Big Cypress Creek. Between Miles 3 and 4, sites
are recorded on the southern terraces overlooking the floodplain of
the Big Cypress - once again as a result of a reservoir survey. If
the transmission line is constructed close and parallel to Big Cypress
Creek, it may be expected to conflict with a number of archeological
sites, which will probably occur with greatest frequency along the
valley margins.
The final segment of the line once again passes through an area
of proven site density. Although the reservoir surveys concentrated
on the areas adjacent to both the connected power stations, it must
not be assumed that all of the sites within the survey boundaries
have been recorded.
In areas of proven cultural resource value, such as that traversed
by this line, it is especially important that the selected 150 foot
wide corridor be intensively surveyed before engineering plans are
finalized. Such a survey, coupled with flexibility of construction
design, should permit a 150 foot wide corridor to be so situated as
to avoid disturbing any significant cultural resources.

Ninety-five sites have been recognized in the seventeen mile long
Pirkey to Martin Lake corridor. Of these sixty-two are located
on interfluvial uplands, twenty-three on stream terraces, and ten on
floodplains. This topographic distribution is virtually identical
to that of the Welsh to Monticello corridor. At present, forty
sites are intact, thirty-nine are disturbed and fourteen are known
to have been destroyed. The condition of the other two is unknown.
Chronological placement of the recorded sites, where possible,
indicates eight Archaic (8,000-1,250 B.P.), nineteen Ceramic/Formative
(1,250 B.P. to European contact), two historic aboriginal, twenty
unknown aboriginal and fifty-one Euro-American sites. Five sites
have been recognized to contain more than one temporal component.
In addition, five other historic sites have been tentatively located
within the proposed corridor. (These are indicated by upper-case
letters on the accompanying top0graphic maps.)
The significance of the historic resources in the project area
is further underscored by the fact that fourteen sites, thirteen
Euro-American and one aboriginal (41RK19), are listed on the National
Register of Historic Places.
Previous Archeological Investigations
Archeological investigations in the area of Martin Lake
extend back to at least 1931, when A.T. Jackson surveyed portions
of Panola County. In 1948, Jack Hughes carried out a cursory survey

13

of Rusk County. He recorded four sites in the vicinity of Martin
Lake, but only one, 41RK3, falls within the bounds of the corridor.
The archeological sites published on Winfrey's (1961) map are those
located by Hughes.
In a 1968 thesis, Buddy Calvin Jones reported on work at seven
historic Caddoan sites in Gregg, Rusk, Panola and Harrison counties.
Five of these sites are definitely not within the proposed construction
area, and the sixth, 41RK3, is. The seventh site, 'C.D. Marsh', can be
located only approximately from Jones' data.
In 1972, Andrew McDonald reported on a survey and testing
program carried out by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
in the 5,020 acre Martin lake area. Forty-six new sites were
discovered and reported upon. Of these, 26 are within the proposed
transmission corridor.
The survey area was found to have been cultivated and logged
since the early 1880's, with erosion becoming an increasingly serious
problem. After about 1936, the Soil Conservation Service began to
encourage terracing as a corrective measure. More recently, much
of the area has been converted to pasture. The result of all these
earth-moving activities has been to disrupt or destroy many shallow
or exposed sites. Further destruction has occurred when eroding
sites attracted notice and were exploited by collectors.
In the same year, R. Whitby Jarvis reported on testing at
41RK26, a site which was within the corridor. It has since been
inundated by the "impoundment of Marti n Lake.
An archeological reconnaissance of Hallsville was carried
out by Hayden Whitsett in 1976, in which eight archeological sites
were located irrrnediately adjacent to the corridor.
John Clark and James Ivey (1974) carried out excavations and
historical research in the Martin Lake area during 1972 and 1973.
Of the five sites excavated, only one, 41RK19, falls within the
transmission corridor. Clark and Ivey also provide a fairly
extensive recent history of their survey area, including a recon­
structed map of the 19th century town of Harmony Hill. The remains
of that community include a number of designated sites which fall
within the corridor, and which are recognized on the National Register
of Historic Places. It is clear from this work that further 19th
century historic features are likely to be uncovered in the immediate
vi c"i ni ty of Harmony Hi ll.
In November of 1976, Corbin, Price and Studer conducted a
reconnaissance of a 595 acre tract south and west of Darco and just
outside the corridor. Nine aboriginal sites were located, all on
lithe first major elevation" above Spring Creek, and usually at points
where tributaries entered the stream.

14
In 1977, David S. Dibble carried out a prel"iminary reconnaissance
of a portion of the area to be affected by the South Hallsville project.
Eight aborig"inal sites were located, six of them within the proposed
corridor. The survey was hampered by heavy vegetation.
Further work on the South Hallsville project area was carried
out in 1978 under the auspices of Espey, Huston and Associates. One
hundred five archeological sites were located; thirty-eight are within
the corridor. The survey area was dealt with in two sections - the
plant site-cooling pond area, and the mine area. The plant site was
completely surveyed, primarily by walking transects. Although twenty
sites were recognized in the area, only four of them are aboriginal.
The surveyors note that nearly all of the survey area has been subject
to surface modifications such as gravel mining, cotton cultivation,
lumbering, and bulldozing for both agricultural and brush-removal
purposes. Such activities are likely to have destroyed or thoroughly
masked a large number of aboriginal sites.
The mine area was subjected to a 20% survey which was used to
formulate a predictive model for future test"ing. Forty-nine historic
and twenty-five aboriginal sites were recorded.
At the same time, Freeman (1978) produced a preliminary assess­
ment of the historic resources of the South Hallsville area. She
reports on twenty-five historic sites located during a nineteen day
survey, as well as seventeen others whi ch coul d only be tentati vely
located. Freeman mentions that two factors were particularly import­
ant in the selection of historic site locations. Such sites tend to
cluster along the early roads and they are usually on the crests of
hills.
Conclusions
A literal interpretation of the known data from Martin Lake
suggests a particularly sensitive zone of cultural resources. The
high densities in the tributary systems of the Sabine River, demon­
strated by reservoir studies and the South Hallsville project, imply
that late prehistoric and historic sites are common throughout the area.
In the first segment of the proposed corridor, Miles 1 - 4 from
the Martin Lake terminus, most of the recorded sites are south and
east of the centerline - a function of the reservoir studies. The
same site density can reasonably be expected in the entire segment.
One National Register of Historic Places site, 41RK19, is located on
the southern per"iphery of the corridor; the remaining thirteen, in the
community of Harmony Hill, are located at Mile 3 in the eastern one­
third of the corridor.

15
Although only one site is recorded between Mile 4 and Mile 12,
a density similar to that demonstrated on the northern borders of the
Sabine floodplain can be expected. From Mile 13 to the Pirkey ter­
minus, site frequencies equivalent to the southernmost segment of
the line are displayed.
The Martin Lake area is a prime locality for lignite surface
mining and, as such, will probably be the subject of many more
cultural resource surveys. Although the area has been highly modified
in the past, future developments will presumably eradicate most of
the cultural resources.
Even in areas as archeolog;cally sensitive as Martin Lake
150 foot wide corridor can be so situated as to avoid cultural
resources, especially in areas already modified. It is of prime im­
portance in these areas of known high site density that an on-ground
survey of the 150 foot wide corridor be made at an early stage of
planning, so that flex·ibility can be exercised in line construction.

and Formative/Ceramic (1,250 B.P. to European contact) components,
twelve are of unknown aboriginal origin and 14 are Euro-American
sites, primarily the remains of German and Black homesteaders in
the area.
Nine sites are located on floodplains, six on terraces and

11 on uplands.

Previous Archeological Investigations
There has been substantial archeological investigation in
Harris and Montgomery counties, including a few works which touch
directly upon areas to be traversed by the proposed corridors.
In 1977, R.A. Taylor reported one site, 41HR324, which was dis­

17
covered during the clearing of a pipeline right-of-way.
L.W. Patterson (1978) has reported on excavations by the Houston
Archeological Society at site 41HR315. This work has been on-going
for some time.
The remaining sites which have been recorded within the corridor
boundaries were discovered during the course of a survey and assess­
ment project carried out by the Texas Archeological Survey in the
Cypress Creek watershed (Hale and Freeman 1978). The archeological
survey concentrated on a random 20% sample of the lOO-year floodplain.
The majority of the 58 sites located were situated on terraces over­
looking either the current channel or old meander scars. Only four
sites were recorded in an upland environment; three of these were on
rises close to tributary streams.
The Cypress Creek survey illustrates the high frequency of
aboriginal sites which still exist along major drainways in this
region despite the extensive land modifications resulting from
agriculture and urbanization.
Conclusions
The archeological record in the region to be traversed by the
Porter to T.H. Wharton corridor has been subjected to considerable
disruption, due to agricultural activity and rapid urbanization.
Despite these major land modifications, there are some portions of
the corridor which may be expected to retain a high degree of
archeological and historic sensitivity.

The western end of the corridor crosses Cypress and Little
Cypress creeks and portions of their tributaries and abandoned
channels. The area traversed by these drainways has demonstrated
cultural resources which reflect both aboriginal and historic
settlement. In view of the floral and depositional environments,
it is quite possible that further sites may be discovered in the area.
Further to the east, the corridor crosses Spring Creek and
the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. Both of these areas, with
their associated tributaries and relic channels, are much less
disturbed by recent modification and are likely to contain a high
density of aboriginal sites in good condition.

Previous Archeological Investigations
There are three sections of alternate corridor under
consideration; East Munday to Oklaunion, Oklaunion to Bowman, and
Oklaunion to Lawton. Of these, only the last contains any recog­
nized sites.
The Oklaunion to Lawton section includes fifteen recognized
archeological sites, all of which are in Oklahoma. Eleven of these
are located in the area which would also be traversed by the Lawton
to Bowman corridor.
Of the fifteen sites within the bounds of the Oklaunion to
Lawton corridor, two are of Archaic (8,000-1,250 B.P.) age, three
are Formative/Ceramic (1,250 B.P. to European contact) and nine are
temporally uncategorized. For one we have no information. Two
sites are located in floodplain environments, four on stream
terraces, and nine on upland knolls or ridges in close proximity
to drainways. The condition of eleven of the sites is unknown;
the other four are reportedly disturbed.
Conclusions
The same paucity of organized archeological research which
was reflected in the discussion of the Lawton to Bowman corridor
also pertains to the alternate corridors connecting East Munday,
Oklaunion, Bowman and Lawton. The sporadic activities of amateurs
have indicated the presence of substantial cultural remains without
providing data adequate to illuminate their patterning.

National Register Sites - a
Of the two sites located within this corridor, one is on a stream
terrace and the other in the floodplaih. Both sites are multi­
component occupations ranging fromArchaic (B,000-1,250 B.P.) to
Ceramic/Formative (1,250 to European contact) in temporal placement.
Previous Archeological Investigations
The bulk of the archeological work in this area is reflected
in the high site density already demonstrated along the Martin

21
Lake to Pi rkey proposed corridor. In "dditi on, a porti.on of thi s
corridor extends into Louisi:ana, necessitating a brief review of
previous archeological work in those parts of the parishes Which
are immediate to the line.
In his 1968 thesis, Buddy Calvin Jones reported upon seven
historic Caddoan occupations in Gregg, Rusk and Panola counties.
One of these sites, designated IC.D. Marsh', can be located only
approximately from Jones' data. The site ;s on the east side of
Eightmile Creek, and is probably just south of Taylor Branch,
which would place it just outside the transmission corridor.
However, it is possible (due to conflicting descriptive informa­
tion) that the site is actually further to the south, just inside
the corridor boundary. In either case, that immediate area may
prove sensitive, since Jones mentions, but fails to precisely
locate, additional sites in the vicinity of 'C.D. Marsh'.
There have been no extensive cultural resource surveys in the
Louisiana portion of the corridor area. Three brief and circum­
scribed surveys have, however, been carried out immediately to the
north of the corridor area. In 1977, Jon Gibson reported on a
reconnaissance undertaken prior to an expansion of the Shreveport
airport. Five archeological sites were located, of which two,
both apparently of 20th century origin, were not assigned numbers.
The remaining three are 19th and 20th century Anglo-European.
In the following year, Clarence Webb conducted a reconnaissance
of Westside Park for the city of Shreveport. No cultural resources
were discovered.
During 1979, Vaellinger reported on a survey of 378 acres
directly north of the town of Reisor. One site was identified.
A small portion of the surveyed area extends into the current
transmission corridor.
Despite the dearth of organized surveys in the Louisiana
portion of the corridor, there are two sites within its boundaries.
Both were located by Clarence Webb, who has identified most of the
recognized aboriginal sites in Caddo parish, and both have multl­
component temporal affiliations.
Conclusions
In view of the proximity and similarity of this corridor to
that connecti ng r~arti n La ke to Pi rkey, it is expected that the
two areas will demonstrate the same order of site density.

22

The western portion of the corridor, beginning near the town
of Tatum, is dissected by Caney Creek, Alder Branch, EUjah Creek,
Martin Creek, Clark Branch and Gandia Branch, to name only those
west of the Sabine River. Each of these creeks has, in addition,
various tributaries and abandoned channels. As a result, the area
includes an enormous number of knolls and river confluences which
are expected to yield archeological remains. East of the Sabine,
the same situation exists. One area which will present particular
difficulties is near the eastern end of the line, where the corridor
includes, and parallels, Boggy Bayou. Despite the lack of orga­
nized work in that area, the spotty recognition of sites suggests
that important mUlti-component stratified sites do exist there.
This corridor crosses substantial tracts of heavily wooded
ground. The present paucity of known sites is due, in part, to
the poor visibility which such an environment permits. The clear­
ing of this kind of heavy forest cover for line construction
often disrupts archeological remains as it exposes them.

No previously recorded sites are located within the boundaries of the
alternate corridor from Dayton to Crosby. The only systematic archeo­
logical investigation in the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
files is a small survey of a proposed park conducted in 1978 by Lohse.
Conclusions
Although no systematic archeological surveys of any extent
have been conducted within or immediately adjacent to the proposed
corridor, a review of literature pertinent to the general area (see
Bibliography - Houston area) indicates. that agricultural modifications
and current land use practices have probably obliterated or displaced
much of the surficial evidence of cultural remains in a large portion
of the area under consideration.
Under conditions such as these
the locating of archeological sites is more fortuitous than predictable.
However, in the vicinity of Cedar Bayou, the probability of
encountering prehistoric remains is high. The dense vegetation
characteristic of drainways in this area often inhibits site
recognition.
Construction of the transmission line parallel to
existing modifications will reduce the chances of affecting the
cultural resources possibly present along Cedar Bayou.

Twenty-seven of the 28 sites recorded in the Porter to Blessing
corridor are those described in the Porter to T.H. Wharton section.
A single prehistoric occupation has thus far been reported within
the remainder of this corridor. The site is Ceramic/Formative

25
(1,250 B.P. to European contact) in temporal affiliation.

It is located
on a stream terrace, and is reported to be 1n disturbed condition.
Previous Archeological Investigations
As already mentioned in the Porter to T.H. Wharton section,
a great deal of archeological investigation has been conducted
in Harris County, and some work has been done in the other areas
traversed by this corridor. However, virtually no research has
been carried out within the project boundaries outside of Harris
County. It;s this fact, rather than the complete dearth of
cultural resources, which is reflected in the near-absence of
recorded sites in the segment which crosses Fort Bend, Wharton
and Matagorda counties. However, this area has been subject to
large scale land modification, the result of urban growth as well
as agricultural activity and mineral exploitation. Many shallow
and surficial sites have undoubtedly been destroyed or thoroughly
masked. In view of these rapid and on-going changes, meaningful
statements as to the remaining archeological potential of specific
sections of the corridor must wait until the cultural resource
possibilities can be examined in conjunction with current land
use data such as that being prepared for this project by Espey,
Huston and Associates.
Despite all the recent changes to which this landscape has
been subjected, it is probable that some cultural resources remain
in the area. In order to avoid destroying those which have survived
thus far, the disruption of stream edges and confluences should be
avoided as much as possible. Several of the drainages in the corridor
have been straightened and otherwise modified, but sites may still
exist along the margins of the abandoned channels, old meanders and
ox-bows. Streams such as Buffalo Bayou, the Brazos and Colorado
rivers, and Tres Palacios Creek have elsewhere demonstrated archeo­
logical sensitivity, and their less disturbed reaches and tributaries
may do so here.
Conclusions
In view of the rapid land modification which has taken place,
many of the archeological resources of this area have already been
destroyed. A 150 foot wide corridor could cross many of these
disrupted areas with little liklihood of disturbing any cultural
resources. Certain areas, especially those on rises in close
proximity to drainways either functional or abandoned, are likely
to retain some degree of archeological sensitivity.

26

GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Evaluation of the data base: It is emphasized again that the
foregoing summation of presently recognized archeological and historic
sites present within the proposed preferred and alternate corridors
provides merely a Ilfirst approximation" of the definable resource.
As has been pointed out, these corridors cross regions which have been
the subject, in one degree or another, of special purpose surveys
(e.g. reservoir basins and other water resource developments, highway
and pipeline right-of-way, proposed surface mining, etc.) as opposed
to surveys attempting to sample regional patterns of prehistoric
settlement. Too, many of the site reportings reflect the work of
amateur archeologists including local archeological societies.
Historic site recognition (as indicated by archival records)
also varies on a region-to-region basis, the results often indicative
of the activity level of a given society, or the progress of a state
level inventory. In any event the completeness and utility of
inventories derived strictly from the literature must be viewed with
caution.
General Conclusions and recommendations:
1) Sites currently listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, or properties under process of nomination to this register,
are limited to those in the area of Harmony Hill in the Pirkey
to Martin Lake corridor. Avoidance of this area of historical
significance appears quite feasible.
2) Based solely on the extant record, it is concluded that
no serious impediment to corridor alignment in any of the
preferred or alternate corridors is evident. This statement
is premised on the lateral flexibility of line placement
within the 3.5 mile wide corridors.
3) The highly variable intensity and extensiveness of previous
archeological survey and historic site evaluation/highlighted
by this stud~has led to the present record which cannot be
depended upon to provide an adequate basis for plans to minimize
the adverse effects on cultural resources. It is clear that
on-site surveys designed to identify and assess these resources
within substantially narrowed corridors would be necessary.
Ideally, this work should precede final stages of engineering
design.

27

Research designs developed for on-site examination of the
proposed corridors should, because of widely varying conditions of
surface visibility and past depositional environments, be developed
on a project-specific basis. Special techniques, for example, could
be used to increase the probability of site detection in heavily
wooded zones.
