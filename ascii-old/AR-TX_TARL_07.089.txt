INTRODUCTION
Frontier Enterprises of San Antonio,Texas plans to turn a 57 acre
tract

south

of Rockport, Texas into a residential development called

Magic Island (Fig.

As part of the development

process,

a U.S.

Army Corps of Engineers permit to dredge channels, construct bulkheads
and dispose of fill has been requested.
