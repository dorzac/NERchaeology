ABSTRACT
The historic Comal Cemetery, with burials dating to the 1860s, is located on a high Pleistocene
terrace on the south bank of the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels, Texas. Recent ﬂooding episodes
have highlighted the potential for erosion and undercutting of the 50-ft-high bluff that forms the
northern edge of the cemetery. To protect the cemetery, the city plans to stabilize the riverbank by
constructing a line of soldier piles (vertical-shaft concrete pillars) to form a 625-ft-long continuous
retaining wall between the bluff edge and the known graves. In 2014, Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
(PAI), archeologists monitored drilling of the upper 10 ft of ﬁve geotechnical boreholes along the soldier
pile line. PAI then excavated a continuous 32-inch-wide trackhoe trench along the entire proposed
line of soldier piles. Two unmarked grave shafts were found in the African American “Freedman
Place” section, and the proposed route of the soldier pile line was then adjusted to avoid these graves.
Additional trenching in this area revealed only undisturbed natural deposits. Consequently, the
drilling of the 4-ft diameter soldier pile shafts along the ﬁnal proposed construction line will not
impact any unmarked historic graves. It is recommended that no further archeological investigations
are needed, and the bank stabilization project may proceed as planned.

CURATION
No artifacts were collected for the Comal Cemetery Bank Stabilization Project at the Comal
Cemetery. All of the project records and digital photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION TO THE COMAL CEMETERY
BANK STABILIZATION PROJECT

The City of New Braunfels, Texas, is concerned that erosion along the south bank of
the Guadalupe River is encroaching upon the Comal Cemetery, a large municipal cemetery
it owns and operates. The cemetery sits atop a high Pleistocene alluvial terrace immediately
adjacent to the river, and continued erosion could undercut and collapse sections of the
terrace, potentially causing graves to fall off into the river. The engineering ﬁrm of Freese
and Nichols, Inc. (FNI), was contracted by the city to conduct a bank stabilization project
that will protect the cemetery from failure due to continued erosion. Because the proposed
stabilization work has the potential to impact unmarked graves along the northern
boundary of the cemetery, FNI contracted with Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI), to conduct
an archeological survey to search for unmarked graves within the area of potential effect
(Figure 1).
In 2010, John Milner Associates, Inc., prepared a Historic Preservation Plan for
the City of New Braunfels that presented recommendations for the long-term care and
maintenance of two historic cemeteries within the city limits: the New Braunfels Cemetery
and the Comal Cemetery (JMA et al. 2010). This plan noted potential erosion problems
along the deeply entrenched Guadalupe River, and two measures were recommended for
the area near the Comal Cemetery: (1) investigate the rate at which the cliff edge of the
cemetery along the river is eroding; and (2) develop a plan for relocating these graves and
markers based on the results of the investigations (JMA et al. 2010:89). The location of the
threatened portion of the cemetery was portrayed on a detailed cemetery plot map showing
the oldest sections of the cemetery (Figure 2).
Following up on these recommendations, the city and its consulting engineers
determined that the best course of action to protect the cemetery is to stabilize the
alluvial cutbank of the Guadalupe River next to the old part of the Comal Cemetery. A
bank stabilization strategy proposed by FNI called for the installation of approximately
75 soldier piles along a 625-ft-long corridor running parallel to the cutbank. The soldier
piles will be 4-ft-diameter drilled vertical shafts ﬁlled with concrete that form a retaining
wall intended to prevent destabilization and collapse of the 50-ft-tall cutbank. In this case,
the proposed soldier piles will be drilled approximately 70 ft deep. They will be spaced
at 8-ft intervals, so that there will be approximately 4 ft of alluvial sediment between
the edges of each soldier pile. The line of soldier piles will be set back from the edge of
the bluff about 8 to 15 ft, but outside the areas where there are marked graves. Once in
place, the vertical soldier pile retaining wall will be just inside the edge of the bluff, and
it will act as a barrier to stop the failure of the south bank of the Guadalupe River in the
vicinity of the cemetery.
For discussion purposes, the project area is considered to be the full 625-ft length
of the proposed line of soldier piles. Because this proposed construction had the potential
to impact unmarked graves that might be present, the City of New Braunfels was
required to follow laws in the Texas Antiquities Code and the Texas Health and Safety
Code pertaining to historic cemeteries and unmarked graves. FNI contracted with PAI

Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6993 to principal investigator Doug Boyd.
The work conducted by PAI for the bank stabilization project included three
onsite tasks at the Comal Cemetery: (1) documenting the existing graves located within
approximately 30 ft of the bluff edge; (2) monitoring the drilling of ﬁve geotechnical boreholes
along the project corridor; and (3) excavating and monitoring a mechanical trench running
the full length of the project corridor. These tasks were completed in August–October
2014.
GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

New Braunfels is situated in the Balcones Fault Zone, one of the major carbonate
regions of Texas (Smith and Veni 1994:7–8). Commonly known as the Balcones
Escarpment, this fault zone is characterized by complex karst geology, with many
large artesian springs emerging where groundwater is pushed up through faults. The
presence of Comal Springs and other major springs along the Balcones Escarpment is
due to the deep geological faults that allow fresh water to emerge from the underlying
Edwards Aquifer.
The Comal Cemetery sits on a high Pleistocene terrace of the Guadalupe
River, which is deeply entrenched at this location. The soils in the project area are
characterized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1984) as Krum clay, which is a
deep soil on nearly level (0–1 percent slope) high stream terraces and valley fills. The
upper 19 inches is a dark brown clay that is essentially a cumulic A horizon formed
on the top of the ancient high alluvial terrace. Krum soils are lighter brown clay from
19 to 49 inches, and they transition to a yellowish brown clay at 49 inches. Based on
this sediment profile, it was considered likely that the fill of intrusive grave shafts
would appear as a mottled mix of dark brown, brown, and yellowish brown sediment,
and this fill would be expected to provide a good visual contrast with the surrounding
homogenous undisturbed sediments. Given the geomorphic setting of the project
area and views of the cutbank from the opposite side of the Guadalupe River, it was
expected that an intrusive grave shaft would be easily recognizable in the light-colored
sediments at depths of 3 to 5 ft. Subsequent mechanical trenching at the cemetery
proved this assumption to be valid.
THE COMAL CEMETERY HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

New Braunfels was established in 1845, and two main cemeteries served the
community in the nineteenth century (Greene 2010; JMA et al. 2010). The New Braunfels
Cemetery was platted in 1845, and some of the ﬁrst interments there were the many
victims of a cholera epidemic that were buried in a mass grave in 1846. The New Braunfels
Cemetery served as the community’s only cemetery for some 23 years (Chapter 4 in JMA
et al. 2010).

4

In 1868, the Comal Cemetery was established to provide necessary burial space
for a rapidly growing population (JMA et al. 2010).1 The Comal Cemetery ﬁrst appears
on an 1868 map of New Braunfels as a rectangular tract labeled “Graveyard”; it appears
with a German cross and a size notation of “8 ac.” (Figure 3a). This location was next to
the Guadalupe River and was well north of town when it was established.
Archival records show that the property became a formal cemetery in April 1868,
when eight acres of land were given to the city to serve as its main burial ground. The
earliest documented use of the cemetery in the sexton’s recordbook was the burial of
Fredrich (Fritz) Hartwig on August 12, 1873. The oldest part of the cemetery is the original
8 acres in the northwest corner bounded by Common Street (on the northwest side), the
Guadalupe River (on the northeast side), and it is this latter area that is most threatened
by cutbank erosion. As shown in Figure 2, the roads, grave plots, and rows of grave plots
within the original 8-acre cemetery are oriented north-south and east-west. In the later
additions to the cemetery, the roads, graves, and rows of graves are oriented differently
(skewed by approximately 45 degrees), with the axes running northeast-southwest and
northwest-southeast. Consequently, it is easy to spot the original cemetery property on any
aerial image of the cemetery.
By the time Augustus Koch created his Birds Eye View of New Braunfels in 1881,
the Comal Cemetery was well established. The cemetery appears off in the distance as a
fenced area enclosing many trees and tall headstones, and the No. 16 is listed in the map
legend as “CEMETERY” (see Figure 3). At this time, the cemetery was completely isolated
on the northeast side of town with no houses or development nearby.
Within the original 8-acre cemetery, and once enclosed by a separate fence, is a
section next to the river that was called “Freedman’s Place” (JMA et al. 2010:73, Figures
5-11, 5-12). This section was set aside for the burial of African American freedmen when
the cemetery property was ﬁrst surveyed in 1868 (JMA et al. 2010:66). The Freedman’s
Place is labeled as such on current maps used by the cemetery manager (Larry Herrmann,
personal communication 2014).
Over many decades since its creation, the Comal Cemetery continued to be used
by the city as its main municipal cemetery. It has been expanded several times, with
many sections being added to the southeast of the original 8 acres. The cemetery now
encompasses almost 25 acres and contains more than 12,500 marked graves (JMA
et al. 2010:67–68; Parks and Recreation Department 2014). The Parks and Recreation
Department (2014) and the City of New Braunfels Cemetery Committee (2014) currently
oversee the operation and preservation of the historic cemetery. The city is responsible
for the basic maintenance of the cemetery, the sale of cemetery plots, and keeping the
burial records (JMA et al. 2010:68). Maintenance of the cemetery has been contracted out
to a private ﬁrm for many years, and Larry Herrmann has been the cemetery sexton and
maintenance supervisor for the last 20 years (Larry Herrmann, personal communication
2014). The Comal Cemetery was designated as a Texas Historic Cemetery by the Texas
Historical Commission in 2000 (Parks and Recreation Department 2014).

The historical summary of the Comal Cemetery in this section is taken primarily from Chapter 5 of
the 2010 Historic Preservation Plan (JMA et al. 2010) prepared for the City of New Braunfels.

DOCUMENTATION OF EXISTING GRAVES
NEAR THE PROJECT CORRIDOR

On August 26, 2014, PAI archeologists documented all of the existing graves located
within ca. 30 ft of the project corridor. The documentation consisted of taking digital
photographs of each grave plot and headstone. The digital photographs were keyed to
sequential grave numbers plotted on large-scale aerial photographs. In addition, the Shultz
Group, Inc., another contractor working for FNI, conducted detailed mapping of the entire
project corridor. The surveyors used GPS mapping equipment to plot the Guadalupe River
water edge and bluff edge and all of the surface features on top of the bluff within at least
40 ft of the edge.
The goal of this mapping and documentation was to record the surface manifestations
of the graves nearest the project corridor so that the information could be used to restore
them to their original condition if any graves were accidentally damaged during the
construction project.
MONITORING OF GEOTECHNICAL BOREHOLES

The second ﬁeld task involved monitoring the mechanical drilling of ﬁve geotechnical
boreholes (Figure 4) spaced about 140–160 ft apart along the proposed line of soldier piles.
PAI coordinated with the geotechnical consultants, Brierley Associates, Inc., regarding the
drilling schedule. A PAI archeologist was present for the drilling of the upper 10 ft of each
of the ﬁve boreholes, with the monitoring occurring on ﬁve different days (August 26 and
27, September 16, 17, and 19). The archeologists examined all of the ﬁll and core sections
removed from the drill holes to look for any evidence that might indicate the presence of
an unmarked grave.
All of the borehole sediments exhibited the same general stratigraphic proﬁle. The
upper 18 to 24 inches was a brown (10 YR 4/3) to pale brown (10 YR 6/3 or 6/4) silty loam
to silty clay loam. The next zone was a very pale brown (10 YR 7/3, 7/4, 8/3, or 8/4) silt that
extended to a depth of 10 ft. This sediment tended to be lighter in color with depth. Some
gravel lenses, composed primarily of small pea-sized gravels with occasional larger nodules,
were observed at depths of 3 ft or deeper. All of these proﬁles denote a weak cumulic A
horizon developed on the surface of the alluvial terrace, and this upper zone was noticeably
darker than the underlying B horizon silt.
From an archeological perspective, the stratigraphy revealed by the boreholes meant
that any intrusive excavation such as a grave shaft would likely be ﬁlled with mottled
sediment (a mix of light and dark materials). Such intrusive backﬁlled holes should be
easily distinguishable from the surrounding undisturbed natural sediments, especially in
the lighter-colored sediments below 2 ft deep. After the borehole excavations were completed,
the Shultz Group surveyors mapped the locations and added the data to their project area
maps.

MECHANICAL TRENCHING OF THE PROJECT CORRIDOR

The mechanical trenching of the project corridor was conducted on three days from
September 30 to October 2, 2014. The work consisted of excavating and backﬁlling trenches
each day to form one continuous trench running parallel to the Guadalupe River cutbank,
between the known graves and the cutbank edge. The work started at the northwestern
end of the project area and proceeded to the southeastern end. The trenches were dug using
a small John Deere 75D trackhoe ﬁtted with a 32-inch-wide bucket with a smooth blade.
Near the end of the trenching, the Shultz Group surveyors mapped the locations of the
archeological trenches.
During the mechanical investigations, portions of two shafts of unmarked
historic graves were discovered in a trench, and the trackhoe was then used to dig a
shallow excavation block to expose the complete outline of each grave shaft. The grave
shaft locations were documented and mapped by the Shultz Group surveryors. After
consultation with the FNI engineers and the city project managers, the work moved to
the north of the original trench and a new trench parallel to the ﬁrst one was excavated

Figure 4. Photograph of the drilling in progress at Borehole 1. View is to the east, and the orangeﬂagged stake is the baseline mapping point 10 + 00 ft. Note the proximity of the marked graves.

away from the newly discovered graves (see the “Onsite Meeting to Discuss Unmarked
Graves” below). No additional graves were encountered in this trench. Consequently, the
project managers and engineers decided to adjust the project corridor, moving the line
of proposed soldier piles so that it follows the continuous line of archeological trenches
where no graves were found.
Figures 5, 6, and 7 are maps of the project area that show the geotechnical boreholes
and archeological trenches in relation to the Guadalupe River cutbank and the marked
graves and roads in the Comal Cemetery. The maps are sequential, from the northwest to
the southeast, and the locations of the expanded block excavation and the two unmarked
graves are shown in Figure 6. The mechanical trench segments are numbered 1-5, in the
order they were excavated, and each is discussed in more detail below. The length, depth,
and beginning and ending points for these trenches are summarized in Table 1. In the
discussions that follow, relative locations within the trenches are stated as a straight line
distance (in feet) measured from the baseline mapping stake at the northwest end of the
project corridor (stake designated as 10 + 00 ft).
Trench 1

The Trench 1 excavation started about 1 ft to the southeast of the baseline mapping
stake designated as 10 + 00 ft. The trench was excavated to the southeast, going over the
center of Borehole 1 and ending over the center of Borehole 2. This trench was excavated to
a depth of 50 to 60 inches, exposing dark A horizon sediment from 18 to 24 inches overlying
lighter colored sediments (Figure 8). This contrasting sediment was observed over the full
length of the trench. The lower zone contained sporadic concentrations of well-rounded
gravels (up to ﬁst-sized) in discontinuous layers that varied in depth from 30 to 60 inches
deep. Some of the gravels were well cemented with calcium carbonate, so much so that the
trackhoe had a difﬁcult time digging through the layer in places.
Three anomalies were observed in Trench 1. The previously excavated Borehole 1
was observed at 12 ft. It appeared from the surface down to the bottom of the trench at
54 inches. The second anomaly was a wooden fence post remnant and posthole at 19 ft.
The posthole was observed in the north wall of Trench 1 from 24 to 51 inches deep. The
wooden post remnant was in the upper part of the posthole, and this obviously represented
a post that was removed long ago, probably from an old fence line. The third anomaly was
a 20-inch-long section of corroded iron pipe, 1.25 inch diameter, lying horizontally at a
depth of 12 inches. The trackhoe broke off this section of the pipe, and its unbroken end
had an expanded coupling with interior threads that were heavily corroded. An in situ
section of the pipe found in the north wall of the trench (at 144 ft on the project corridor
line) extended northward beyond the trench. This pipe segment, in the upper A horizon,
is about the same size as the pipes used to build the old iron and wire fence along the
west side of the cemetery (the Common Street side). Some sections of the old fence are
gone and were replaced at the northwest corner of the cemetery, so this pipe segment
probably represents a piece of the old cemetery fencing that was discarded along the edge
of the cemetery.

Except for the anomalies noted above, the sediments exposed over the full length
of Trench 1 appeared natural and undisturbed. It was obvious that any intrusive grave
shafts in this sediment should be easily visible in the light-colored sediment at a depth of
3 ft or less.
Trench 2

Trench 2 started at Borehole 2 and was excavated southeast toward Borehole 3, but
it ended when it intersected the paved road (called Mather Street on cemetery plot maps).
This 104-ft-long trench was excavated between 4.5 and 4 ft deep, and it revealed the same
basic stratigraphy seen in Trench 1. However, the gravelly layer was much denser and
harder in Trench 2 than in Trench 1, and the Trench 2 gravels were much larger (several
over 10 inches in maximum size).
No features or unusual sediment anomalies were encountered in Trench 2, but
three unusual items were observed in the trench ﬁll. One is a 10-inch-long, 1-inch-diameter
section of iron pipe that had old breaks on both ends (found at about 160 ft on the corridor
line). One chert ﬂake was found in sediments from the lower part of the A horizon at about
170 ft. It appeared to be a large tertiary biface thinning ﬂake. A careful examination of the
sediment and stratigraphy in this area revealed no other prehistoric artifacts.
A very large limestone cobble that measured approximately 22x9x8 inches was found
at 194 ft. It came from the base of the A horizon, well above the natural gravel layer. It is

too large to have been a natural gravel and is most likely a manuport, perhaps brought in
as a temporary headstone and later discarded along the edge of the cemetery.
Trench 3

If we had continued trenching in a single line, Trench 3 would have started at the
southeast end of Trench 2 and cut through the paved roadway. However, the City of New
Braunfels wanted to leave this section of paved road intact if possible, since they did not
know how long it might be before the bank stabilization construction actually began. To
leave the road intact, we simply jumped to the opposite (south) side of the road from the
point where Trench 2 ended. Thus, Trench 3 started on the south side of the paved road
(Mather Street), within about 9 ft from the concrete platform over the grave of Judge R.
Whitﬁeld (1919–1970). It then followed the curve of the road (1 ft south of the pavement)
and was dug to a depth of 30 to 40 inches.
As the trench excavation was straightened out following the edge of the roadway,
a distinct soil anomaly was observed in the ﬂoor of the trench (at 312 ft) southeast end.
The excavation was halted immediately, and hand excavation was done to expose the soil
anomaly. It quickly became apparent that we had a large section of mottled ﬁll (dark,
medium, and light sediment mixed together) representing an intrusive feature, probably a
historic grave shaft. The mottled soil was visible at 12 inches below the surface in the dark
A horizon, and it continued down to the bottom of the trench at 30 inches below the surface
in the light-colored sediment. The north edge of this anomaly was a very straight vertical
line in the trench wall, and it was traced as a straight horizontal line in the bottom of the
trench. Based on the latter, it was predicted that the grave shaft continued to the south of
this trench. We used the trackhoe to scrape a large rectangular area, about 9x12 ft, down to
a depth of 12 inches. With a little hand shoveling to clean the area, we quickly exposed two
grave shafts that appeared as distinct rectangles of mottled sediment in the undisturbed
darker A horizon (Figure 9).
Onsite Meeting to Discuss the Unmarked Graves

When the two unmarked graves were discovered in Trench 3 just south of the
paved cemetery road (Mather Street), it was clear that they were inside or very close to the
Freedman’s Place section. It is not unexpected to ﬁnd unmarked graves in historic African
American cemeteries or sections within cemeteries. For many African American cemeteries,
the descendant communities have moved on or been displaced, and grave markers were often
ephemeral and disappeared through time. Numerous archeological investigations document
the prevalence of unmarked graves in nineteenth-century African American cemeteries,
and it is not uncommon for large numbers of graves to have no formal grave markers or
no surface manifestations at all (e.g., Davidson 2004; Dockall and Powell 1996; Foster and
Nance 2002; Freeman et al. 2006; Lee and Bruseth 2008; Peter et al. 2000; Tiné and Boyd
2003). There are even documented cases in which grave markers were intentionally removed
from African American cemeteries and burial areas (Chesky 2009; Young 2009).

On the afternoon after the unmarked graves were found, an onsite meeting was
held to discuss the situation and consider options for the placement of the proposed line of
soldier piles. PAI archeologists (Doug Boyd and Aaron Norment), the D&M Construction
contractor (Jimmy Owens), and the Comal Cemetery maintenance supervisor (Larry
Herrmann) met with representatives from FNI (Les Boyd and Tina Standard) and the
City of New Braunfels (Adam Michie). Based on a visual inspection of the unmarked grave
locations relative to the detailed map of cemetery plots, everyone agreed that the two
graves were probably inside historically mapped cemetery plots. Comparing the largescale cemetery plot map with the grave locations, it was determined that the unmarked
graves were probably in the last two or three plots on the northern end of Row 14 (with
the cemetery rows running north-to-south, and Row 1 being along the eastern edge of
Freedman’s Place). Shultz Group surveyors then took GPS readings on the locations of these
two unmarked graves, and their later mapping data proved these initial interpretations
to be correct. Figure 10 shows the location of the two unmarked graves relative to the
cemetery plots. The locations of the two graves are considered approximate due to the
inherent inaccuracies of rectifying our project maps with the cemetery plot maps, but the
error factor is probably minimal.
Based on the examination of the cemetery plot map during the onsite meeting, it
appeared likely that the current paved Mather Street approximates the location of an
old road that has marked the northern and northeastern boundaries of the Freedman’s
Place for many decades, perhaps since its inception. If the modern road represented an old
boundary of this cemetery section, then it seemed less likely that additional graves would
be found to the northeast.
Everyone agreed that the best option for the bank stabilization project was to dig
another archeological trench line down the paved road and just north of the unmarked
graves. This new trench (to be called Trench 4) would begin at the southeast end of Trench 2
and continue in a straight line past the south edge of Borehole 3 and about 15 ft past the
two unmarked graves (see Figures 5, 6, and 7). If no more unmarked graves were found,
this new trench segment would become the project corridor (i.e, the line of proposed soldier
piles would follow this trench centerline), with the alignment switching from Trench 4
back over to Trench 3 in the latter 15 ft where the south edge of Trench 4 and north edge
of Trench 3 overlap.
The ﬁnal decision made during the onsite meeting was that the ﬁnal trench should
begin at the southeast end of Trench 3 and continue in a straight line through the center
of Boreholes 4 and 5, ending a point 10 ft beyond Borehole 5. This ﬁnal trench (to be called
Trench 5) would cross over a long section of the Mather Street pavement, ending up with a
shorter segment running off of the pavement (on north side of Mather) at the southeastern
end.
Immediately after the onsite meeting, the D&M Construction crew made
arrangements to bring in a mechanical disk saw and a dump truck the following morning.
They would saw a 48-inch-wide cut in the paved road sections (to allow for a 32-inch-wide
trench cut) and use the trackhoe to strip up the pavement. They would then use the Bobcat
to pick up the pavement sections and place them into the dump truck, and haul all of the
pavement material offsite.

Trench 4

As planned during the onsite meeting, Trench 4 was excavated from the southeast end
of Trench 2 for 78 ft in a straight line, with the north edge of the trench running 12 inches
south of Borehole 3. This placed the south edge of Trench 4 about 16 inches away from the
northeast corner of Unmarked Grave 1 (the northernmost of the two unmarked graves).
Trench 4 was excavated 15 ft beyond the end of the expanded block excavation around the
two unmarked graves (Figures 11 and 12).
Almost all of Trench 4 was dug inside the pavement of the Mather Street roadway,
with a 4-ft-wide strip of the pavement having been cut out and removed prior to the trench
excavation. Trench 4 was dug 32 to 44 inches deep, and it revealed the same general
stratigraphic proﬁle as the other trenches. It had 18–20 inches of dark A horizon sediment

clearly intact over the entire length of the trench, and nothing unusual was found.
Trench 5

Trench 5 excavation began at the southeast end of Trench 3, and it continued in a
straight line for 112 ft. It ran directly over Borehole 5 and ended 10 ft beyond the borehole
(see Figure 13). Except for about 20 ft at the southeast end, this trench was dug under
Mather Street, with a 4-ft-wide section of the pavement having been cut and removed
before the trenching began. This trench was dug to a depth of 32 to 44 inches deep, and it
revealed the same stratigraphy as Trench 3, with few or no gravels observed in the lightcolored sediment. Nothing unusual was found and all of the sediments were undisturbed
except for the clay-ﬁlled location of Borehole 5.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The stabilization of the Guadalupe River cutbank is essential for the long-term
protection of the Comal Cemetery. The cemetery is situated on a high Pleistocene-age terrace,
and the river has begun actively undercutting this landform. The City of New Braunfels
has initiated this bank stabilization project to avoid the catastrophe that could occur if the
river continues to erode the cutbank. The goal of this archeological project was to locate
any unmarked historic graves that might be impacted by the construction associated with
the bank stabilization.

?

When this project
was in the planning stages,
it was unclear how easily
unmarked graves could be
detected at this location.
Every grave search project
is unique, and the ability
to ﬁnd grave shafts during
mechanical scraping depends
on the speciﬁc geology and
soils of each project area.
The borehole monitoring
suggested that the sediments
were undisturbed, and the
subsequent mechanical
trenching revealed that the
dark A horizon over lightercolored deposits was consistent
throughout the project
corridor—stratigraphic
conditions that were ideal
for detecting intrusive grave
shafts.

Figure 13. View of Trench 5 looking northwest down the project
corridor. The southeast end of the trench is in the foreground,
and the trackhoe is near the northwest end. The arrow points
to Borehole 5, a clay-ﬁlled circle in the bottom of the trench.

21

The mechanical
trenching was conducted
over a three-day period,
with the trenches being
excavated and backﬁlled the
same day (Figure 14). PAI
archeologists monitored the
trenching closely, but only
two unmarked graves were
discovered. These graves were
located on the northeastern
edge of the African American
section called Freedman’s

Place, and both graves appear to be among the northernmost grave plots that appear on the
Comal Cemetery plot maps (see Figure 10). Another trench segment was excavated north
of where these graves were found, and no additional unmarked graves were found. This
provided an alternate route for the construction corridor, which was realigned as necessary
to avoid these graves.
Construction activities associated with the bank stabilization project will not impact
or disturb any unmarked historic graves if the proposed line of soldier piles runs down the
centerline of the selected archeological trenches following this route (from northwest to
southeast):
•

Trench 1—entire length, ca. 151 ft (starting at baseline mapping stake 10+00)

•

Trench 2—entire length, ca. 104 ft (starting at southeast end of Trench 1)

•

Trench 4—partial length, ca. 63 ft (starting at southeast end of Trench 2 and ending near
Borehole 3)

•

Trench 4/3 Overlap—ca. 15 ft (starting in Trench 4 near Borehole 3 and running in a straight
line to end in Trench 3 directly south of the southeast end of Trench 4)

Figure 14. Overview photo of the project corridor with all of the archeological trenches backﬁlled.
View is to the northwest with the southeast end of Trench 5 in the foreground. The Bobcat in
the distance is at the location where the unmarked graves were found in the African American
section.
22

•

Trench 3—partial length, ca. 179 ft (starting at the southeast end of the Trench 4/3 Overlap, and
following Trench 3 along the south edge of Mather Street to its southeast end at the junction
between Street 3 and Mather Street.

•

Trench 5—entire length, ca. 112 ft (starting at southeast end of Trench 3 and running in a
straight line through Borehole 5, ending 10 ft beyond the borehole)

Figure 15 shows the ﬁnal route recommended for the project construction activities,
and it encompasses a total distance of approximately 624 ft. If the proposed soldier pile
drill holes are all excavated following the centerline of this alignment, no archeological
monitoring of the construction drilling is needed and no further archeological investigations
are recommended.
