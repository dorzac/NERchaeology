INTRODUCTION

The City of Blossom is proposing to modify the existing City Lake dam which is located on
Cuthand Creek and is situated north of downtown Blossom and east of Farm to Market Road 196
(Figure 1). Blossom is located in the east central part of Lamar County and is bisected by US
Highway 82. The dam is an earthen structure that has a stone and concrete spillway located at the
southeastern corner of the City Lake that according to the TCEQ was constructed in 1937 and
served as the water source for the city until wells with pumps were installed in the 1970s. Since
that time, recreational use of the lake diminished as there was less incentive for the city to
maintain the lake once it was no longer the source of drinking water. The city has determined
that they wish to stabilize the original spillway and construct a more efficient spillway west of
the original spillway structure.
The purpose of this document is to present available information about the dam and spillway in
order to review the construction and to present information about the existing spillway structure.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) will evaluate the condition and historical significance
of the spillway structure and review our recommendations with regard to the worthiness of
preserving the existing structure in place as well as determining if construction of a new spillway
will compromise the historic significance of the present structure.
The report begins with a summary of the lake and dam history beginning with reports that it
would be constructed in 1933. This is followed by a chapter containing a historic map review of
the lake that is followed by recent photographs of the present structure. The report concludes
with recommendations about the significance of the structure and how it could be preserved
while allowing for the construction of a new spillway.
The study was initiated by a request to conduct an archaeological survey of the project site but it
soon became clear that the area of concern was not that historic or prehistoric resources were not
the primary concern since construction of a new spillway was to occur on top of the already
present earthen dam. Rather the condition, restoration, and potential preservation of the historic
spillway were of primary concern. Thus a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required but
coordination with the Historic Properties Division of the Texas Historical Commission was
needed before funds could be authorized to construct the new spillway and to stabilize the
existing spillway.

RESEARCH RESULTS

Numerous local to national sources were scoured in an attempt to obtain concrete information
regarding the Blossom City Lake dam and spillway. (Note: the town of Blossom was originally
known as Blossom Prairie). Records sought included, but were not limited to, original
engineering records, a historical timeline, and historical photographs. Despite intensive research
no original engineering plans were located. Fortunately, information was located which confirms
the dam as a New Deal project.
The irrefutable piece of information was provided by the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) in Washington, D.C. According to their records, the waterworks project,
Docket Number 9173, was a result of the Public Work Administration (PWA). Unfortunately, in
1943, 60% of all PWA records were illegally destroyed, including the original engineering
records and all other data related to this project. The only remaining piece of evidence is the
docket folder. Unlike the Work Projects Administration (WPA), which involved local entities in
a project, once the PWA agreed to a project it assumed all funding and management
responsibilities, from inception to completion. According to NARA, this is important to note as it
indicates that all records regarding this project were kept in Washington, D.C. and were not
available to the local constituents. This explains why the City of Blossom does not have any
records.
Prior to receiving this information from NARA, additional agencies and organizations were
contacted in an attempt to locate information regarding the Blossom City Lake dam and
spillway. Local entities contacted included the Lamar County Extension Service, Lamar County
Clerk, Lamar County Historical Society, and the regional office of the United States Department
of Agriculture National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). None of these entities were
able to provide any additional information.
However, two local sources were able to provide information which helped develop a timeline
for the dam construction. An article which discussed the possibility of receiving a grant from the
federal governmental for the development of an artificial lake and pumping station to supply the
city's water was located at the Blossom Public Library and Museum. Entitled "Blossom
Expands," the article appeared in the Blossom Appeal, the local newspaper, on Thursday, Dec.
14, 1933. Several additional articles which support the fact that the Blossom City Lake
Dam/Spillway was a New Deal project were located on microfilm at the Paris Junior College
Library. All articles noted below are from the Paris News:

October 12, 1938 - "Blossom to get WPA on Spillway for Lake"
December 26, 1938 - "Blossom Spillway Work To Be Started Tuesday"
February 2, 1939 - "Spillway at Blossom Lake is Damaged"
August 11, 1939 -" New Blossom Dam" (WPA dam to be completed by September 15,
1939)

The discrepancy between the NARA statement that the project was a PWA project and the local
newspaper articles stating the project was a WPA project should be noted. When Mr. Gene
Morris, NARA researcher/archivist, was questioned about this, his response was that this was a
very common error as few outside the federal government realized that there was a difference
between the two programs. Further complicating the problem was the fact that the initials of the
two programs were so similar.
Although several local citizens spoke to ARC about the importance the lake had, not only as the
city's water source of, but also as a recreational area, no archival resources were located to
confirm or expound on this subject. The AM Aikin Archives at Paris Junior College has a Soil
Conservation map from the 1940s in their archives, although I was unable to arrange a viewing
with the archivist.
State entities contacted included the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, Texas State
Soil & Water Conservation Board, Texas Department of Health, Texas Water Development
Board, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). None of the agencies
were able to provide any additional information. In addition, the Fort Worth branch of the
National Archives was also contacted but had no information.

GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS
The following figures (No 2-12) illustrate the parts of the Blossom City Lake dam and spillway
and are described in the lengthy captions. Their purpose is to allow reviewers to appreciate the
construction of the spillway and to be able to evaluate why the City proposes to preserve the
spillway while at the same time being able to construct an alternative spillway that will largely
replace this important historic spillway structure without destroying it.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The rock and concrete spillway structure presents a historic structure that is clearly more than
fifty years old and is relatively well preserved. No as built architectural drawings seem to have
been preserved but the spillway could be recorded as a Historic American Building Structure and
in that way it could be preserved. ARC believes that the structure is eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D. If the THC agrees with this evaluation,
the spillway and dam could be listed as a State Archeological Landmark. Specific
recommendations follow:








The historic spillway should be stabilized and preserved in place
Stabilization could involve the removal of the tile sections that served to raise the lake
level less than a foot, or if duplicate tiles are found, the tile topping could be restored
Stabilization would also involve the removal of the tree, shrub, and weed vegetation
which has rooted in the stilling basins and through the concrete and stone slab surfaces in
order to further preserve the historic spillway
Stabilization should use bonding agents that have a projected long life
A temporary fence should be established between the western edge of the historic
spillway and the new spillway construction area in order to protect the older structure
from construction damage
