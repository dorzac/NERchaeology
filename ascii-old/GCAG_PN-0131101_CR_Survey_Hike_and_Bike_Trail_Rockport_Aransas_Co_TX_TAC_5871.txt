1.0 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
This report details the results of a Phase I cultural resources survey conducted on a
segment of a linear corridor which will be developed into a hike and bike trail within the
City of Rockport, Aransas County, Texas (Figure 1). Cultural resources are structures,
buildings, archeological sites, districts (a collection of related structures, buildings,
and/or archeological sites), cemeteries, and objects. Both federal and state laws require
consideration of cultural resources during project planning. At the federal level, NEPA
and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, among others, apply to
transportation projects such as this one. In addition, state laws such as the Antiquities
Code of Texas apply to these projects. Compliance with these laws often requires
consultation with the Texas Historical Commission/Texas State Historic Preservation
Officer and/or federally-recognized tribes to determine the project’s effects on cultural
resources. The work was completed under the requirements of TxDOT’s First Amended
Programmatic Agreement among the Texas Historical Commission (THC), The
Advisory Council, and the FHWA (2005) and the MOU between TxDOT and the THC
(2004). Review and coordination of this project followed approved procedures for
compliance with federal and state laws.
This cultural resource survey was conducted on public land for the City of Rockport.
The proposed project involves the construction of a 1.031 miles (1659 m) long hike and
bike trail that will connect a residential area with sidewalks along Enterprise Boulevard
to the Tule Woodlands and then to a trailhead near Tule Creek and the adjacent Tule
Marsh East Park which is located near State Highway 35. This trail will provide safe
recreational opportunities for the public. The alignment of the hike and bike trail will
primarily be located within the Tule Creek Watershed and is referred to as the Tule Hike
and Bike Trail. The cultural resources survey was conducted on the north segment that
is located within the Tule Woodlands. The survey was conducted on a portion of the
hike and bike trail is undisturbed the rest of the hike and bike trail has previous modern
disturbance. The segment of the corridor surveyed is approximately ½-mile (804.67 m)

long. The investigation surveyed both the proposed corridor and proposed construction
access road. No artifacts were collected and therefore, no archeological repository
curation was required.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located within the Tule Woods which are located
in the City of Rockport and is adjacent to Tule Lake, which has been silted. The APE is
within the Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fenneman 1938). Ricklis, (1991) has
defined the area of the Texas Coast from the Colorado River to the Río Grande River
as the Southern Coastal Corridor planning region of the Texas Historical Commission.
The vegetation of the Coastal Prairie is comprised of prairie-type grasses such as
cordgrasses, sedges, rushes, seashore saltgrass, marsh millet, and maiden cane.
Further inland the native flora includes the tall grasses of the Gulf prairie and some
hardwoods such as elms and oaks, which are found particularly along streambeds. The
soils found in the APE are comprised of the Galveston Mustang association and
Mustang fine sand.

These soils are comprised of deep nearly level, somewhat

excessively to poorly drained soils that are on low coastal terraces and plains (Guckian
and Garcia 1979).
The Study Area consists of a linear corridor and proposed road that will be used for
construction of the hike and bike trail (Figure 2). The total length of the propose hike
and bike trail is 1.031 miles (1659 m). The general depth of impact is 8 inches (20.32
cm). The portion of the hike and bike trail surveyed is approximately ½-mile (804.67 m)
long and 40 feet wide (12.19 m) wide. In addition, a propose construction access road
was surveyed, this access road was 0.16-mile (257.50 m) long and 40 feet wide (12.19
m) wide. No easements or temporary detours are required. The total area surveyed
was approximately 0.66-mile (1062.17 m) long and 40 feet wide (12.19 m) wide. No
easements of tem no easements or temporary detours are required
The vegetation of the Study Area primarily consists of grasses, small shrubs, and trees
(Plates 1 and 2). Prehistorically, the area could have been used as a campsite area.
Potential animal resources included bison, deer, bear, squirrels, raccoons, opossum,

2.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Gulf Coast Archaeology Group (GCA Group) conducted a Phase I cultural resources
survey on the area that will be impacted by the proposed undertaking. This area is
located within the Tule Woods in the City of Rockport, Aransas County, Texas. This
survey was conducted to: a) locate any possible cultural resources that may be located
within the Area of Potential Effect (APE); b) assess the significance of the cultural
resources following the criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP); and c) to make recommendations for avoidance or mitigation procedures for
any culturally significant properties.

These activities are specified under legislation

including the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended in 1981, and the
regulations (36 CFR 800) of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

Overall,

work was conducted in compliance with 13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy.
Report write-up was conducted under the supervision of principal investigator Anna
Enderli, RPA.

The Phase I cultural resources survey was conducted by Mr. Jorge

Garcia-Herreros, RPA and Phillip Ahearn on February 13, 2011.

3.0 RESEARCH DESIGN
The Study Area was surveyed according to Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The Phase I cultural resources survey
consisted of a systematic survey of the APE or Study Area using shovel test and
pedestrian surface survey methods.
An overview of the Study Area prior to the field survey was conducted in order to
characterize the probability of cultural resources being located within the APE.
Topographic maps and aerial photographs showed that the APE had a moderate
probability of containing cultural resources. This assessment was primarily based on
the topography of the APE and its proximity to coastal resources. A search in the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas corroborated in classifying the Study Area as a
moderate probability area because the search found six archaeological sites previously
recorded within a 1-mile radius and two archaeological sites within a 2- mile radius of
the Study Area.

The cultural resources background research of the Study Area confirmed in classifying
the area as a moderate probability area. The potential significant cultural resources
that could have been found in the Study Area consisted of prehistoric camp sites,

to the probability of cultural resources present, it was determined that intensive survey
of the APE was necessary.

4.0 RESULTS
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) surveyed by GCA Group is located in the City of
Rockport in Aransas County, Texas. The area surveyed consisted of the north segment
of the proposed hike and bike trail located within the Tule Woods (Plate 3). It also
includes the area where the access road for the construction will be located. The area
surveyed where the construction road will be located has been partially disturbed by the
construction of a drainage ditch and a Walmart that is located south of the APE (Plate
4). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) was surveyed February 13, 2011. The portion of
the hike and bike trail surveyed is approximately ½-mile (804.67 m) long and 40 feet
wide (12.19 m) wide. The portion of the construction access road that was surveyed
was 0.16-mile (257.50 m) long and 40 feet wide (12.19 m) wide.

The total area

surveyed was approximately 0.66-mile (1062.17 m) long and 40 feet wide (12.19 m)
wide, for a total area surveyed of 13,9376 feet square (4,2481.8 m square) area. The
ground visibility at the APE ranged from 10 to 100 percent. The general topography of
the APE was classified as coastal plains. The vegetation was primarily composed of
trees, small shrubs, and grasses. Surface inspection of the APE did not identify any
historic or prehistoric features. No significant historic structures were noted within the
vicinity of the APE. A Walmart store is located south of the project area.
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed APE. Ten shovel tests
were excavated within the proposed hike and bike trail easement and two shovel tests
were excavated on the proposed construction road (Figure 3). The entire APE was
pedestrian surveyed. Average spacing between shovel tests was between 30 m and 60
m.

If the spacing was larger it was because ground visibility allowed for visual

inspection or the area or it had a slope greater than 15 percent. The shovel tests
excavated ranged between 50 cm to 70 cm (19.69 in to 27.56 in) deep. The soil
stratigraphy found during the shovel testing was generally composed of a black
(10YR2/1) loamy sand to a light grey (10YR7/2) sand. This stratum was followed by a
stratum of light grey (10YR7/2) sand (Plates 5 through 7). Two shovel tests (ST1 and

ST10) showed previous disturbance. In ST1 a modern brick was found at a depth of 31
cm (12.20 in). In ST10 the soil matrix was atypical and was consistent with the soil
matrix surrounding the existing parking lot (Plate 8).
The soils excavated were screened through a ¼ quarter inch screen. The soils found
in the APE are comprised of the Galveston Mustang association and Mustang fine
sand. These soils are comprised of deep nearly level, somewhat excessively to poorly
drained soils that are on low coastal terraces and plains (Guckian and Garcia 1979).
Modern trash material was noted on the surface. Overall, the pedestrian survey and
shovel test excavations found no significant cultural features and no significant artifacts.

5.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the archeological study conducted, no further investigation is warranted.
Although the area surveyed was located within an area of low to moderate probability,
the cultural resources field investigation of the APE did not yield any cultural resources.
Over all, the Phase I cultural resources survey did not find any cultural resources that
would be adversely affected by the proposed construction.

At the same time, no

historical structures or features will be affected. Therefore, based upon the current
findings, it is recommended that no further archaeological work be conducted on the
APE. In the event that unanticipated archeological deposits are encountered during
construction, work in the immediate area will cease, and TxDOT archeological staff will
be contacted to initiate post-review discovery procedures.
