thoroughly as time would permit. and 31t arOheblogioal sites

were examined and appraised.

Surfaoe collections traa, )1 of

these sites yielded a total ot 88 lithio etitaota, 1,850

potsherds. 1 trade pipe, and 1 pipe ot Indian manutactuzoe.

6
are earmarked for

LiO at

ot the researoh recommended tor the

future.
About 15 miles due west ot the town

or

Jefferson is Site

4l-29A6-2*, situa.ted on the banks ot Cypress Creek.

Three

artitioial mounds, eaoh approximately 50 teet in diameter and

4 to 6 feet in height. project abruptly tram the level flood
plain on the north side of the oreek.
about 100 yards apart.

They are 11'1 a row,

South ot the oreek 1s another mound

ot similar dimensions. Cypress Creek. in flood at the tae
this site was visited, had r1sen over the south bank. and
thi s tOlU"th mound appeared as an 181. . . above the flood water.

High water and profusion of vegetational oover prevented the
disoovery of surfaoe artifacts, but the presence

or

the

mounds indicates with virtual certainty that here exists a

large village site of relatively great tmportanoe.

A shallow

test pit in one of the mounds yielded charcoal. and potf:lherds,
thereby oontl:rm1ng the artifioial nature of the mounds.

Ex­

tensive testing, tollo\\'ed by excavation ot the most promising
portions ot the village and at least one ot the mounds, 1s
emphatically reoommended.
3ite 41-29Al-l* t a. large vUlage s.1te at least 6 to 8
acres in extent, is located two miles north of Holly Spr1Dgs
in Camp County.

A small nattU."fll lake borders the north edge

of' the site, and the shallow ohannel of Prairie Creek meanders
through the occupation area.

Near the south sIde ot the lake

1

1s a mound, same fifteen teet in diameter and .) to 4 feet
high which has been trenohed by unknown parsons.

Re;portedl,..

one or more burials were found in the mound, and several bur­
ials and pots have been tound in oth a7t :parte of the a1 te.

Su.:r1"ace indioations in the form. ot potsherds and lithio arti­
facts are , prolific.
.

This 1s unquestionably one ot the most

'

informative a1 tea within the rea erYoir area and 1s oonsequent­

1y placed high on the priority 118t tor sites
to be excavated.
.

Four add!tional village s1t819(41-29.41-2* t 4l-29A2-1

*.

41-29A6-S*, and 4l-29A6-22*) are l"ecomnended tor exoa'fttlaa,
and two others (41-29A.6-12 and 41-29A6-15) are recommended
tor limited testing.
These eight village sites shouldprorlde a repreeen ta­

Pottery
In the reconnaissanoe ot Ferrell's Bridge Reservoir 1,8S0

potaherds were recovered. All appear to belong to corapl•••
of the Oaddoan area.6 Decorative techn1q~$ employed in the
manufaoture ot this pottery inolude brUBh1D.g, augraving, in­

GrQUlld potshC"d8 are the

most common tempering agent, al though some bc:m.e-tempce4
