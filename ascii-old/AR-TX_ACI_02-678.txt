ABSTRACT
RVE Inc. of Corpus Christi, Texas plans to expand existing wetlands on a 15-acre
tract in Aransas County to offset disturbance to another site where residences and a
marina are being constructed. Following the recommendations of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers (COE), Galveston District, Archaeology Consultants, Inc, of George
West, Texas performed an archaeological survey of approximately seven acres of this
tract on January 24 and 25, 2007 under COE permit application 23225. The remaining
eight acres consisted of wetlands and were not suitable for shovel testing. Twelve shovel
tests excavated randomly across the project area did not encounter evidence of an
archeological site, and no artifacts were collected. It is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Archeology Consultants, Inc. was contacted by Mr. Craig Bordovsky of RVE,
Inc. in Corpus Christi, Texas on December 28, 2006 and asked to perform cultural
resources investigations at a 15-acre site in Aransas County, Texas. The project area is
located adjacent to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway between Rockport and Aransas Pass
in central Aransas County, Texas. The purpose of this project is the creation and
expansion of wetland areas to offset construction at Passport Shores, a residential
development and marina to the south. According to RVE, Inc., the proposed construction
will affect the subsurface to a maximum depth of 2.5 feet. The COE Permit Application
number for this project is 23225. The cultural resources contractor is Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. of George West, Texas. William E. Moore served as the Principal
Investigator. Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by the 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle Estes, Texas (Figure 1).

METHODS
The first step in this project was the submission of a Scope-of-Work to the COE.
This document contained a map of the project area and recommended a 100% Pedestrian
Survey and shovel testing. Staff archaeologist Nicole Carole Minnichbach concurred with
the recommendations and authorized the project to proceed. Next, a check of the site
records at TARL was conducted by Jean Hughes to identify previously recorded sites in
the area. A similar search had been performed by Allegra Azulay at TARL for the earlier
Passport Shores project approximately 863 meters to the south, but a second check was
necessary since additional sites may have been identified since the earlier survey was
completed in 2004. In addition, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was checked for
previously recorded sites and surveys that might not appear on the maps at TARL.
Only seven of the fifteen acres was subjected to a pedestrian survey because of
standing water over much of the project area. At the time of this study, the ground surface
visibility in the elevated areas was estimated to be between 60% and 70% due to the
presence of weeds and patches of salt grass. The entire area was wet due to recent
rains. However, about eight acres, although wet, were not under standing water. It is in
these areas that the 12 shovel tests were excavated. According to the Scope-of-Work, the
shovel tests were to be excavated to depths of at least 100 cm. However, the saturated
soils made this impossible. The tests were terminated between 45 cm and 55 cm. In
some cases the water table began as shallow as 15 cm, and the shovel test profiles
typically collapsed between 30 and 40 cm. The soil was pushed through Â¼ inch hardware
cloth by hand due to its wet nature. This project was documented through digital
photography, field notes, and a shovel test log (Appendix I). The approximate location of
each shovel test is depicted in Figure 2.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Search
A check of the site records at TARL for the 2004 Passport Shores survey identified
several areas where archaeological surveys had been conducted and two previously
recorded sites (41AS80 and 41AS84) near the current project area. The nearest
archaeological survey to the current project area was performed by Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. in 2004 for the Passport Shores development project (Moore and Warren
2004). This project examined approximately 56 acres and found no evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site. Only modern trash was observed on the surface. Of the other
surveys in the area (south of the current project area), one was performed by Galveston
COE with negative results. The Atlas did not identify the firms associated with the other
surveys. They were also negative. The current records check identified the presence of
site 41AS97) approximately north of the project area.
Prehistoric site 41AS80 is located approximately 1267 meters south and west of the
current project area. This site was reported as an aboriginal cemetery containing at least
12 individuals. It was discovered during landscaping excavations. Investigations at the
site were carried out by E. R. Mokry, Jr. and W. S. Fitzpatrick (1980). They reported that
the burials were encountered about 2.5 feet (75 cm) beneath the existing ground surface.
Prehistoric site 41AS84 is a shell midden located approximately 3984 meters south
of the current project area. It was recorded by Leland C. Bement and Solveig A. Turpin in
1984 while working for the Texas Archeological Survey. The only artifacts observed were
oyster and conch shell scattered across the surface, two burned clay balls, and one bone
fragment that may not be associated with the shell. This site has been virtually destroyed
by prior dredging. No report is on file at TARL.
Prehistoric site 41AS97 is an unknown prehistoric site located approximately 1840
meters north of the current project area. It was recorded by Robert Marcom of Perennial
Environmental Services of Houston, Texas in 2004. The site was identified during the
Cove Harbor Phase I archaeological survey conducted in 2003. A report documenting this
project was authored by Jorge Gracia-Herreros and Cody Kathleen Johansson (2004).
The site was identified by a surface inspection and shovel tests dug to 100 cm. Artifacts at
this site consist of two chert flakes, one faunal bone fragment, and some charcoal found at
80 cm. This is a small site (5 meters x 5 meters) that is apparently undisturbed. Additional
work was recommended if avoidance is not possible.

Field Survey
No evidence of an archeological site was found during this cultural resources
survey. Modern trash was observed on the surface, but no evidence of a significant
historic site was noted. Short term sites near the shoreline usually yield few artifacts or
features, and many of these sites have been destroyed by erosion, dredging operations, or
the placement of dredge material during construction of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to
the southeast of the project area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that the project should be considered as having no effect on
cultural resources. Therefore, work should be allowed to proceed as presently planned by
the project sponsor. If evidence of a site is discovered, all work in the vicinity of the find
should be suspended until the situation can be evaluated by the COE. This project was
performed according to the Minimum Survey Standards established by the THC.
