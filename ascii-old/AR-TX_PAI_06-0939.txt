ABSTRACT
On July 31, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of two areas proposed for improvements under the 2017 Bond Program
within McAllister Park in north San Antonio, Texas. The survey was done under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8995. The two areas surveyed at the north edge of the practice field on Buckhorn
Road and a low-water crossing on Lorence Creek. Improvements to the practice field will consist
of a pavilion with associated sidewalks and picnic tables, benches, and grills; installation of a
restroom with septic field; construction of a bike park; and construction of a 1,000-ft-long trail
on the south side of the existing parking lot. At the low-water crossing, an existing rock bridge
will be removed and a new at-grade crossing will be constructed. No historic or prehistoric sites
were identified within the footprint of these improvements. Hence, Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., recommends that these improvements should proceed without additional archeological
investigations.

CURATION
Since this archeological survey did not recover any artifacts, this project does not require
artifact curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin for permanent curation.

INTRODUCTION
On July 31, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an
intensive archeological survey of two areas to be developed under the City’s 2017
Bond Program within McAllister Park in north San Antonio, Texas (Figure 1). The
survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8995. Areas surveyed are those
that will be impacted by proposed improvements and that have not been previously
surveyed. These consist of sections adjacent to the practice field on Buckhorn Road
and a low-water crossing on Lorence Creek. Improvements at the practice field will
consist of a 40x25ft pavilion, restroom with septic field, a bike park, and 1,000-ft-long
trail along the southwest side of the existing parking lot through the bike park to
Buckhorn Road. Most disturbance from these improvements will be shallow (1 ft or
less below the surface), but deeper disturbance will occur in places. At the low-water
crossing, where an existing path crosses Lorence Creek, an existing rock bridge will
be removed and a new at-grade crossing will be constructed; this will impact ca.
60x30-ft areas on both banks of the creek, with disturbance extending as deep as
3 ft below the surface. Lands to be impacted in the two areas total about 1 acre. All
work done during this survey complies with the requirements of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, VTCS
6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and Design Section of
the Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, the practice field is in an area
where the subsurface geology is Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk, while the lowwater crossing area is mapped as Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1983). The latter follow Mud Creek, which flows south through
the middle of the park, and a western tributary, Lorence Creek (Figure 2). No
Holocene alluvium is mapped in or near the park. According to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s Web Soil Survey, soils in the practice field are Crawford and Bexar
stony soils and Whitewright-Austin complex, 1–5 percent slopes. Both are upland
soils consisting of residuum weathered from Cretaceous limestone and chalk. The
low-water crossing area is on Tinn and Frio soils. Tinn and Frio soils are clayey
Holocene alluvium on floodplains. Because of its proximity to Mud Creek, the area
would have been attractive to Native Americans as a camp location. Vegetation
associated with the practice field consists of short mowed grasses and small planted
oak trees. The area surrounding the low-water crossing supports a mature oak forest
with an open understory of grasses and forbs.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
revealed that there are 10 previously recorded sites and at least a dozen previous
archeological investigations within 1 km of the project area; 3 additional sites
(41BX1410–41BX1412) found in one of the previous investigations are not on the
Atlas map but also are within 1 km. These 13 sites are 41BX172–41BX174, 41BX353,
41BX458, 41BX707, 41BX842, 41BX949, 41BX959, 41BX1410–41BX1412, and

41BX2168. Sites 41BX172 and 41BX173 were recorded in 1972 as disturbed scatters
of burned rocks, debitage, and chipped stone tools; they are on the east side of Mud
Creek within McAllister Park. Site 41BX174, also within the park east of Mud Creek,
was recorded that same year as a lithic procurement area with chert nodules, cores,
and many large flakes. Site 41BX353 was recorded in 1977 as a small scatter of
flakes and chipped stone tools on the west bank of Mud Creek within the park. Site
41BX458 was recorded in 1974 as a scatter of chert cobbles and flakes east of Mud
Creek. Site 41BX707 was recorded in 1986 as an extensive scatter of cores, flakes,
chipped stone tools within a residential development along Lorence Creek upstream
from the park. Site 41BX842, on Mud Creek at and beyond the north end of the park,
is a large site recorded as a dense lithic scatter with “burned rock mounds” that
had been bulldozed and looted. Part of the site north of the park was investigated
in 2013 and found to be heavily disturbed (Burden 2013). Site 41BX949, on Salado
Creek south of the park, was recorded in 1991 as a Native American campsite with
a possible burned rock midden. Site 41BX959, on the east side of Mud Creek in
the southern part of the park, was recorded in 1991 as a large lithic procurement
location with tested cobbles, flakes, dart points, and some burned rocks. When it
was revisited in 2005, its boundaries were expanded to include a historic farmstead
component in its east part. Sites 41BX1410–41BX1412 were recorded in 1999; the
first two are in the west part of the park, and 41BX1412 is in the east part, east of
Mud Creek. All three are lithic scatters. Site 41BX1412 subsequently saw testing
and data recovery excavations and was found to be extensively disturbed (Tomka
et al. 2002). Site 41BX2168, outside the park to the south along Wurzbach Parkway,
was recorded in 2017 as a heavily disturbed lithic scatter.
The Atlas depicts virtually all of McAllister Park as having been surveyed,
although the dates (1973–1979) and sponsoring agencies (Environmental Protection
Agency and Soil Conservation Service) listed for some of these projects suggest they
were reconnaissance rather than intensive efforts. The Atlas contains abstracts
for five projects within the park. One consisted of survey in 1999 of proposed road
extensions on the west side of the park and through the central part (Tomka and
Robinson 2000); three sites were found, one of which (41BX1412) subsequently
saw data recovery excavations (Tomka et al. 2002). Those excavations revealed
that 41BX1412 was heavily disturbed and did not warrant listing in the National
Register of Historic Places or designation as a State Antiquities Landmark. In
2001, a survey was done for proposed parking lot expansion and roadway extension
(Zapata 2002); the locations of these improvements are unknown, but the survey
identified no sites. The fourth project, done in 2005, entailed intensive survey of
eight areas to be disturbed by construction (Figueroa and Thompson 2005). The
locations of these eight areas are unknown, but some were in the vicinity of the
proposed 2017 Bond Program improvements; no new sites were found, but part
of 41BX959 was inspected. The fifth project consisted of survey in 2014 of seven
areas proposed for park improvements (Luzmoor 2014). Four of the areas surveyed
were at the locations of proposed 2017 Bond Program improvements at the practice
field on Buckhorn Road. A single shovel test there produced a few flakes, but the
remains were considered too sparse to warrant designation as a site. Not reflected
in the abstracts in the Atlas but indicated in the site records for 41BX959 is a sixth

5

project conducted in 2005. It was a survey performed by CAR-UTSA of three tracts
to be impacted by planned expansion of the San Antonio International Airport.
The locations of the areas surveyed are unknown, but at least one extended into
the south part of the park, since this was the project in which the boundaries of
41BX959 were expanded to include the historic component.
Historic aerial photographs and maps indicate that neither of the areas
included in the current survey are likely to contain historic archeological remains.
Sources indicating this are 1938 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 1953 USGS
maps and aerial photographs dating to 1952, 1963, 1971, and 1973.
METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey of the two areas within McAllister Park consisted
of 100 percent pedestrian coverage by two qualified archeologists. As per the Texas
Historical Commission’s minimum survey standards, the archeologists walked
the survey areas on transects spaced no more than 30 m apart, examining surface
exposures for evidence of prehistoric and historic artifacts and features. Shovel
testing was employed where the ground surface was obscured by vegetation.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm
in thickness. All sediments removed during shovel testing were screened through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted with a trowel when too difficult
to screen efficiently. A Shovel Test Record form was used to record brief sediment
descriptions and notes about artifact recovery for each shovel test. All shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. Photographs were taken of
survey conditions at each of the impact areas, and a photo log and a daily journal
of project activities and observations were kept by a project archeologist. All survey
methods comply with applicable standards defined or referenced in 13 TAC 26.20
and Texas Historical Commission policy.
Shovel test density for this survey meets the minimum requirements of the
Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas for projects
of this size (3 tests/acre). Three tests were placed in the area of impacts at the
practice field (see Figure 2), and both the practice field and the low-water crossing
areas have good surface visibility exceeding 50 percent. In addition, the cut banks
of Lorence Creek provide good subsurface visibility at that location.
SURVEY RESULTS
The intensive archeological survey of two areas within McAllister Park
encountered no prehistoric or historic sites. The surface exposures and shovel tests
in the impact areas at the Buckhorn Road practice field show hard dark gray clay
loam with much fractured siliceous gravel just below the surface. However, none
of the fractured rocks observed could be attributed to prehistoric lithic reduction.
The fractured gravels may be have resulted from construction of the existing
parking lot and other facilities already present in the area (Figure 3). Despite
the three shovel tests and good ground surface visibility, no archeological remains
were observed (Figure 4).

Hike-and-bike paths leading to and from the stone bridge that currently is
the low-water crossing on Lorence Creek provided ample surface exposures in this
survey area, again showing dark gray clay loam with scattered siliceous gravels
(Figure 5a). The creek banks at the crossing display a 1-m-thick cemented gravel
deposit suggesting that the creek is presently cutting through a Quaternary gravel
bar that is the source of the gravel seen on the surface (Figure 5b). No fractured
siliceous gravels were observed surrounding the crossing, and no prehistoric or
historic sites were observed in the impact area. No shovel tests were excavated here
because of the excellent surface and subsurface visibility.
RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were discovered by intensive
survey of two areas of proposed new facilities in McAllister Park. Hence, Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., recommends that no additional archeological investigation is
warranted before construction.
