ABSTRACT
On September 19-24, 2011, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource
survey investigation for a proposed residential development and marina on Matagorda Bay in
southeast Calhoun County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations were
conducted for Crouch Environmental Services, Inc., under Texas Historical Commission Section
106 guidelines, in anticipation of the submission of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers (COE), Galveston District. A total of 70 shovel tests and three backhoe trenches were
excavated. A single piece of debitage recovered from ST 42 was determined to be an isolated
find and was reburied at its original location at the end of the survey. No additional evidence of
prehistoric or historic remains was identified by the investigations. Consequently, no further
archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

INTRODUCTION
of a single access channel and two
breakwaters (approximately 3.75 acres total
work in Matagorda Bay) that will provide
access to a marina basin that will be
excavated within uplands (Figure 3). The
access channel/breakwaters will extend
approximately 1630 feet into Matagorda
Bay and will be 130â wide (the access
channel is 100â wide and each breakwater is
15âwide).

On September 19-24, 2011, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed residential development and
marina on Matagorda Bay in southeast
Calhoun County, Texas. The objectives of
the investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0923)
were
conducted
for
Crouch
Environmental Services, Inc., under Texas
Historical
Commission
Section
106
guidelines, in anticipation of the submission
of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers (COE), Galveston District.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination (Figure 4; see Appendix 1 for
details). A total of 70 shovel tests (STs 170) and three backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-3)
were excavated. The field investigations
were conducted by project archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technician
Abidemi Babatunde Babalola. David Driver
served as the projectâs principal investigator.

The project is depicted on the Port
OâConner, Texas 7.5â USGS topographic
map (Figures 1, 2). The project area totals
183 acres, and will include the construction

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
Calhoun County is located within
the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

insure the temperatures are less than those in
inland areas. Annual precipitation averages
39 inches (98 cm).

The property is depicted on sheet 37
of the Soil Survey of Calhoun County, Texas
(Mowery and Bower 1978). Two types of
soils have been identified in the project area,
Placedo clay (Pc), and Galveston complex,
undulating (Gc).
The Placedo and
Galveston soil types are included in the
PALM predictive model developed by
Abbott (2001).
Galveston soils are
described as coastal barrier sandy
littoral/Aeolian deposits with a high
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites. Placedo soils represent
coastal marsh clayey recent alluvium with a
low-moderate potential for containing
deeply buried prehistoric sites.

Flora and Fauna
Calhoun County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

Hydrology
The project is located on the
southwestern shoreline of Matagorda Bay, a
major bay on the Texas coast (Leatherwood,
2011). The bay is ringed by several smaller
bays including Tres Palacios Bay, Turtle
Bay, Carancahua Bay, Keller Bay, Cox Bay,
and Lavaca Bay. Prior to the construction of
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the ship
channels to Palacios, Port O'Connor, and
Port Lavaca, the only access to Matagorda
Bay from the Gulf was at its southern end,
through a narrow gap in Matagorda Island
called Cavallo Pass. In terms of potable
water, the major sources closest to the
project area are small bayous (Boggy,
Broad, Big Dam, and Huckleberry Bayous)
and the unnamed drainages that feed them.

Climate
The modern climate of the Calhoun
County study area is considered humid
subtropical and is marked by warm summers
(Mowery and Bower 1978). During the
winters, the prevailing gulf breezes result in
warmer temperatures than in inland areas,
while during the summers, those sea breezes

6

may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This

repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.

1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.

the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archaeological
sites are located within the project area, or
within Â½ kilometer of the tract.

The literature search revealed that a
number of varied projects have been
conducted in the project region (Moore
1993). These include magnetometer surveys
and other offshore work, numerous small
area surveys by private contractors, and inhouse and contracted projects by the Corps
of Engineers (COE), Galveston District, and
the Texas State Department of Highways
and Public Transportations (TSDHPT)
projects. Many of the surveys, especially
those performed by COE and TSDHPT,
resulted in negative findings. Much of the
remaining archeological investigation in the
county has been related to oil and gas
production.

The current project is located along
the southwest coastline of Matagorda Bay,
in northern Calhoun County. While a
number of archeological sites have been
identified within the county, 95 terrestrial
sites and 63 shipwrecks, all of these sites are
located along the shores of bays, lakes, or
coastlines, with none located in inland areas.

The earliest mention of the county
in the literature is in an Annual report of the
Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution in the 19th century (Roessler
1882). In this volume general statements
regarding the aborigines and antiquities of
Texas are made with specific examples from
Calhoun County.

A previous review noted that
disturbances at these sites is common
(Moore 1993), with a significant amount of
erosion impacts at sites located along the
active coastlines. The majority of the sites
in the county appear to be campsites with no
architectural features reported. More than
half of the sites are described as shell
middens.

A major study of the area is that by
Coast Environments, Inc. (Weinstein 1990)

This study of the archeology and

of
the
Lower
Guadalupe/San Antonio Bay region is a
major project for this area.
Several general works have been
published that are germane to a better
understanding of the project area region.
These include bibliographies by Bailey
(1987), Moore and Moore (1986), and the
statistical overview by the Texas Historic
Commission. Other major efforts include a
survey of the archeological and historical
resources of the Matagorda Bay area (Fritz
1975), a summary of the archeological and
historical resources in the San Antonio and
Guadalupe river basins (Hester 1975), an
examination of Spanish forts and mission on
the Guadalupe River (Jarrett 1966),
discussions of historical Indian groups
(Newcomb 1961; Campbell 1988), artifact

Previous investigations by Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc, in the region
of the current project include a survey for
the Formaso Plastics plant expansion near
Coxâs Bay (Moore et al. 1988), a survey of
the Seadrift E-3 pipeline project (Moore and
Moore 1990), a survey of the Guadalupe

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
areas for containing prehistoric cultural
resources (due to their proximity to water),
the tests were placed at intervals of
approximately 50 m. These areas included
the immediate coastline, the area along the
tractâs east boundary and closest to Boggy
Bayou, and on the west along the shoreline
of Broad Bayou and the unnamed drainage
which feeds it. In the central portions of the
tract, shovel tests were located along four
roughly spaced transects, with intervals of
150-200 m between tests.

The fieldwork was conducted on
September 19-24, 2011, and consisted of a
100% pedestrian survey that included
systematic
shovel
testing,
backhoe
trenching, and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.
The project is depicted on the Port
OâConner, Texas 7.5â USGS topographic
map (Figures 1, 2). The project area totals
183 acres, and will include the construction
of a single access channel and two
breakwaters (approximately 3.75 acres total
work in Matagorda Bay) that will provide
access to a marina basin that will be
excavated within uplands (Figure 3). The
access channel/breakwaters will extend
approximately 1630 feet into Matagorda
Bay and will be 130â wide (the access
channel is 100â wide and each breakwater is
15âwide).

A single chert flake fragment was
recovered from ST 42. Although five
additional shovel tests (STs 43-46, 48) were
placed in the immediate vicinity of the
flakeâs location, no additional cultural
materials were identified. Consequently, the
flake was designated as an isolated find (IF
1) and was reburied in its original location at
the completion of the survey. No other
prehistoric or historic materials were
identified in any of the remaining shovel
tests.

The property appears to be fairly
undisturbed and sits within a large game
preserve.
The tract is only accessible
through the larger preserve and is located
approximately 8-10 miles from the paved
road. Vegetation in the project property
consisted of a mix of short woodlands and
open grassy areas (Figures 5-8). Trees
include live oak, mesquite, huisache, Texas
persimmon, bluewood, spiney hackberry,
blackbrush. Grasses included Indian grass,
switch grass, and big and little bluestem.

Three backhoe trenches were placed
in areas containing Galveston soils
recognized by the PALM as having a high
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites. The Galveston soils are
located in a narrow zone that extends
through the middle of the property and is
somewhat marked by absence of dense
vegetation and what appears to be some
previous clearing (Figures 3, 4). Each of the
backhoe trenches measured 5 m in length
and 1 m in width, and they ranged from 2.50
to 2.70 m in depth (Figures 9-14). The
trenches revealed the subsurface stratigraphy
to consist of a thin sandy loam humic layer
atop thick strata of fine sands. No evidence
of cultural materials or features was
identified in any of the trenches.

A total of 70 shovel tests (STs 1-70)
and three backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-3) were
excavated. Each of the shovel tests were
excavated in 10 cm levels and screened
through Â¼â mesh (Figure 4; Appendix 1),
and all were recorded and plotted on the
project map.
In the portions of the tract
considered to represent high probability
