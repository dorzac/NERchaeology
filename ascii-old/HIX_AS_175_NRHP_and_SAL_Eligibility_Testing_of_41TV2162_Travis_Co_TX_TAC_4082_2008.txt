Abstract

In April and May of 2006, Hicks & Company conducted National Register of Historic Places eligibility
testing of site 41TV2162 within the Additional Properties of the proposed SH 130. Site 41TV2162 is located
at the base of an upland slope on the edge of the Onion Creek floodplain. A total of 15.7 cubic meters of
site sediments was excavated by hand and 6,890 cubic meters of site sediments were machine excavated.
Cultural material collected or recorded from the site included one hearth feature, 325 lithics, six stone tools,
five bone fragments, 215 mussel shell fragments (446.5 g), 1047 fossil mollusk fragments (2.10 kg), and
4869 fragments of burned rock (26.87 kg). Dates from radiocarbon samples collected from within the hearth
feature consistently fall within the 2-sigma calibrated period ranging from 6650-6310 B.P., with all samples
overlapping at 6410 B.P. This date places the site at the latter end of the Early Archaic.
As a result of the testing at 41TV2162, the investigators concluded that the portions of Site 41TV2162
within the Additional Properties are not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or
for listing as a State Archeological Landmark. This was based on the lack of significant numbers of intact
features, poor organic preservation, a lack of in situ diagnostic artifacts, and the low density of cultural
material across the site. However, it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that Site 41TV2162 extends
east, beyond the edge of the SH 130 right-of-way, and these areas should be investigated prior to any future
ground disturbing activities related to federal or state undertakings. The Texas State Historic Preservation
Officer concurred with this recommendation in a coordination letter dated June 20, 2006.

Chapter 1
Introduction

State Highway 130 is a proposed toll road that
extends from IH-35, north of the City of Georgetown, Texas, to IH-10, near the City of Seguin, Texas
in Williamson, Travis, Caldwell, and Guadalupe
Counties. As required by the National Environmental Policy Act, an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) was prepared to address the impact to environmental and cultural resources along several alternatives. During the preparation of the EIS, the proposed SH 130 right-of-way was divided into three
segments, Segment A, Segment B, and Segment
C. Following approval of the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS), PBS&J was contracted by
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
to perform archeological investigations within the
proposed SH 130 right-of-way. The area investigated by PBS&J represents the final schematic of
the proposed SH 130 as it existed at the time of the
Exclusive Development Agreement (EDA) between
Lone Star Infrastructure (LSI), Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT). The SH 130 project is
under the jurisdiction of the TxDOT Austin District.
The final schematic generally follows the preferred
alternative selected as a result of the FEIS. For the
purposes of this report the final schematic surveyed
by PBS&J is referred to as the EDA schematic.
TxDOT contracted LSI to construct the proposed SH 130 right-of-way. LSI utilized a âdesignbuildâ approach that allowed for minor adjustments
to the design footprint over the course of the construction. This design-build approach resulted in the
creation of additional areas of right-of-way outside
of the EDA schematic. These Additional Properties consisted of drainage easements, maintenance
facilities, and design changes to accommodate the
main highway located outside of the schematic

right-ofâway that will be acquired in connection with
the project and controlled by the State of Texas. The
EDA schematic combined with the Additional Properties is referred to as the âUltimate Schematicâ.
Hicks & Company was retained by LSI to manage
environmental compliance with the FEIS and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, as amended. As part of the environmental
compliance team Hicks & Company conducted archeological investigations for all of the Additional
Properties along the proposed SH 130 right-of-way.
During the course of the survey investigations of the
Additional Properties, Hicks & Company identified Site 41TV2162 within the floodplain of Onion
Creek and, based on the results of the survey, recommended testing at Site 41TV2162 to determine the
eligibility of the deposits identified at the site for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). This report presents the results of the testing investigations within the Additional Properties
at Site 41TV2162 in Segment B of the proposed SH
130 right-of-way.
All investigations were conducted in accordance
with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended, and 36 CFR 800, the Texas Antiquities
Code (13 TAC 26), the Secretary of the Interiorâs
Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and
Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), and
the Secretaryâs Standards for Identification (48 FR
44720-44723), the Protocol for Historic Property
Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment for the
SH 130 Project, the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, TxDOT, Texas
State Historic Preservation Officer (TSHPO), and
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP), and TAC Permit #4082. All archeological deposits identified within the project area were

1

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

evaluated using the NRHP criteria of significance
(36 CFR 60.4) and the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Criteria for Evaluating Archeological
Sites (13 TAC 26.8). All collected artifacts and
project materials will be permanently curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
in Austin, Texas.
Site 41TV2162 was identified on the floodplain
of Onion Creek as well as the adjacent upland
slope and ridge (Plate 1). Cultural materials identified on the upland slope and ridge were limited to
the surface and consisted of both prehistoric and
historic age artifacts. Based on the results of the
survey investigations, the portions of 41TV2162 on
the upland slope and ridge were determined to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Therefore,
the testing investigations at the site were focused
on the floodplain of Onion Creek at the base of the
upland slope on the margins of the floodplain. The
current channel of Onion Creek lies several hundred
meters to the northwest of the site; however, the
deposits at Site 41TV2162 lie within alluvial deposits. Colluvium, deposited from the nearby upland,
overlies the site to depths between approximately
one and four meters below the ground surface. At
the time of the investigations the site was located in
pastureland with tall grasses and reeds and sparsely
scattered mesquite trees. The adjacent upland slope
and ridge was dominated by cedar and mesquite
trees and sparse grasses.
Testing investigations included the excavation
of three machine-excavated blocks, Blocks A, B, and
E, to provide for hand-excavated units. An additional
four machine-excavated blocks, Blocks C, D, F,
and G, in the form of linear trenches, were opened
to explore the site limits and the stratigraphy of the
site. A total of eight hand excavated two meter by
two meter (4 m2) units were placed within the three
blocks, three (TU 1, TU 2, and TU 3) in Block A,
three (TU 4, TU 5, and TU 6) in Block B, and two
(TU 7 and TU 8) in Block E. Hand excavations removed a total of 15.7 cubic meters of sediment out
of the 17.6 cubic meters sediment proposed during
the research design. Cultural material collected
or recorded from the site included 325 lithics, six
stone tools, five bone fragments, 215 mussel shell
fragments (446.5 g), 1,047 fossil mollusk fragments (2.10 kg), and 4,869 fragments of burned
rock (26.87 kg). The majority of these artifacts

were recovered from Block E, which accounted for
96 percent of the total recovered cultural material.
Block E was located adjacent to the upland to the
south and the eastern edge of the right-of-way. One
feature, Feature 6, was identified during the testing
in Test Unit 7 and consisted of a concentration of
burned rock, mussel shell, and lithics. Sediment
sample radiocarbon dating indicated the hearth
feature dates approximately to the Early Archaic
Interval in central Texas (6650-6310 B.P.).
Based on the results of the testing investigations, Site 41TV2162 was found to be ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as an SAL. This
was based on the paucity of intact features, poor
organic preservation, a lack of in situ diagnostic
artifacts, and the low density of cultural material
across the site. Survey and testing of the buried
components at 41TV2162 combined yielded a total
of five features in an estimated 8,360 cubic meters
of hand and machine excavated sediment (three excavation blocks, four trenches, and eight test units)
and no significant evidence of organic preservation
or diagnostic artifacts. Although numerous artifacts
were recovered from the site, 96 percent of the total
identified artifacts were recovered from Block E in
the southern portion of the site. Given the proximity
of Block E to the southern bedrock contact in the
upland, the oldest area of cultural activity within
the right-of-way was very small and appears to be
isolated to the activities related to Feature 6. Therefore, Hicks & Company recommended no further
work for the site within the Additional Properties
and submitted their results and recommendations in
an interim report to TxDOT in May 2006. TxDOT
and the TSHPO concurred with Hicks & Companyâs
recommendations on June 20, 2006.
Project Personnel
The background research for this Additional
Property was conducted by John A. Campbell and
Kurt Korfmacher and consisted of a review of the
files at TARL, the THC, and TxDOT. Survey investigations were conducted between October 31,
2005 and December 22, 2005 and testing investigations took place between April 18, 2006 and May
12, 2006. James W. Karbula served as the Principal
Investigator for the project and John A. Campbell
served as Project Archeologist. S. Christopher Caran

Chapter 2
Environmental Setting

Site 41TV2162 lies within the Blackland Prairie
division of the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic
province (Fenneman 1946; Ferguson 1986; Hatch
et al. 1990). Rivers and most large streams traverse
this region in a southeastward direction and have
low channel gradients. Major waterways in close
proximity to the site include the Colorado River
and one of its tributaries, Onion Creek. These areas
would have provided numerous valuable resources
to both prehistoric and historic settlers. Food, fuel,
and other resources could be obtained from each of
the adjacent aquatic, riparian-margin, and upland
environments, which also provided permanent water
and a variety of lithic materials as channel gravels.
The level terrace surface probably served as both a
transportation corridor and occupation site. This rich
multi-resource context was almost certainly utilized
by prehistoric populations on a continual basis, and
provided conditions suitable for early historical exploitation. In addition, the terrace of Onion Creek
also affords conditions that enhance potential site
preservation. Flood events are frequent enough to
bury cultural materials soon after each occupational
episode. However, the terrace is relatively high, such
that only the upper part of the water column has
reached the terrace surface during much of the Holocene, even during extreme floods. This part of the
flood flow carries only fine-grained sediment, which
is deposited as the flood energy wanes. Aggradation,
therefore, occurs under low-energy flow conditions,
resulting in minimal site disturbance.
Caran (1998) noted that the Onion Creek terrace
grades into the First Street terrace of the Colorado
River near the mouth of the creek. The age of the
Onion Creek terrace deposits can, therefore, be approximated by that of the First Street terrace sediments. From the results of trenching and analysis of

the First Street terrace deposits along the Colorado
River in downtown Austin, Feit et al. (2003:10) state
that in general the First Street terrace deposits have
a maximum age of greater than 30,000 years. The
radiometric dating of sediment samples from their
âDeep Trench 3â determined that the age of the terrace fill from below 11.7 meters was greater than
41,000 B.P., the fill between 11.7 meters and 2.5
meters below surface dated between 41,000-11,200
B.P., and the upper 2.5 meters of deposits postdated 11,200 B.P. (Feit et al. 2003:19). The authors
conclude that there is âlow site density, but a high
potential for preservation of site integrity to depths
of 2.5 meters or moreâ (Feit et. al. 2003:19). Data
from previous geoarcheological investigations along
Onion Creek support the conclusion that the local
cultural record could extend to depths approaching
three meters or more for the First Street terrace.
Overbank deposition has been the dominant
geomorphic process affecting the local flood terrace
throughout the Holocene, producing thick fluvial
deposits. There is, however, strong evidence that the
main channel and/or an ephemeral chute channel of
Onion Creek traversed the flood terrace, carving a
new channel segment along the base of the valley
wall. After that segment was abandoned, it was filled
with as much as seven meters of terrace deposits. A
later flood cut a shallower chute channel through this
part of the terrace. It, too, was filled. The erosional
events that created these channel forms may have
stripped away some cultural materials, but it is clear
that the channels then became loci of human activity,
which was preserved through subsequent overbank
deposition during lesser floods (Figure 1).
Site 41TV2162 is located on the distal edge
of the southern flood terrace and on the proximal
lower valley wall of Onion Creek, a tributary of the

Environmental Setting
Colorado River (Plate 1). Elevations within the site
range from approximately 470 to 500 feet (143 to 152
meters) above mean sea level, but the valley wall rises
to approximately 520 feet (159 meters) immediately
to the south (Geological Survey 1973). Caran (1998)
reported the highest historic flood levels of Onion
Creek and the Colorado River in this area, which
were 38.0 feet (11.6 meters) and 45.9 feet (14 meters)
above their respective datum points. Flood records
show that Onion Creek and the Colorado River have
repeatedly inundated most of the site.
As mapped by Garner and Young (1976), Onion
Creek fluvial deposits underlie the entire flood terrace, whereas Upper Cretaceous mudstones of the
Sprinkle Formation are exposed in the valley wall.
The terrace sediment consists of Quaternary-age
gravel, sand, and mud. The Quaternary Period is the
interval from 1.64 million years ago to the present,
which includes the Pleistocene Epoch from 1.64
million to 10,000 B.P. and the Holocene Epoch from
10,000 B.P. to the present (Harland et al. 1990).
Garner and Young (1976) reported that the average
thickness of the Onion Creek terrace fill was 19.7
feet (6.0 meters). Caran (1998) provided detailed
descriptions of the stratigraphy of Onion Creek terrace and flood-plain deposits to depths as great as
18 feet (5.5 meters), concluding that the age of these
deposits was Holocene. Onion Creek terrace deposits at depths exceeding 18 feet (5.5 meters; shallower
locally) may be as old as Late Pleistocene.
The Sprinkle Formation mudstones are weakly
consolidated and easily eroded. They yield a large
amount of fine-grained sediment, which is transported onto the terrace margin by runoff. Heavy and
prolonged precipitation also causes the mudstones to
become water saturated. They become so unstable
that they âflow,â resulting in soil creep and small
landslides. In this area, Pleistocene gravels of the
ancestral Colorado River overlie the mudstones and
protect them; but when Onion Creek incised its valley,
the gravel deposits were breached, allowing the valley
walls to erode quickly. The gravels were transported
down-slope, forming a veneer or lag deposit. These
gravels included raw lithic materials suitable for tool
manufacture that were heavily utilized by the ancient
peoples inhabiting the Onion Creek valley.
Werchan et al. (1974) mapped the soils of Travis
County, including the area of Site 41TV2162, wherein they recognized two soil series: Houston Black
and Lewisville. The Houston Black soils are verti-

7

sols, which developed through in situ-weathering of
the calcareous mudstones in the valley walls and in
the colluvial deposits along the terrace margin. The
Lewisville soils are mollisols, consisting of silty
clays of stream terraces. The observed soils on the
site are depicted on Plate 3 and described in Tables
4-7 in the Results of Investigations chapter.
Large tracts of cleared land are abundant in this
region of Travis County and it has been estimated
that 98% of the Blackland Prairie native grasslands
have been converted to cropland or seeded with
non-native grasses such as Johnson grass, bermuda
grass, bluestem, and others (Riskind and Collins
1975). The clayey soils and topographic qualities
of the project area are ideal for cultivation, which
has been the dominant activity in the region since
historic times. These changes are most evident in
croplands that have gone fallow. Poor agricultural
management practices were widespread and have
hastened erosion in some areas. Regional drainages
often have deep sediments with soils eroded from
the surrounding croplands. Other kinds of present
day land use for the current project area include
residential and commercial development.
Portions of the surrounding area on the Colorado River and Onion Creek flood terraces are currently used as open aggregate quarries, including
property immediately west of the site (Geological
Survey 1973). The areas immediately surrounding
the quarries are abandoned agricultural fields with
high weeds, reeds and secondary growth grasses.
Several areas have large open pits remaining and
some of the pit areas have recently been filled,
leaving large rounded fill mounds on the surface
of the landscape. In addition, extensive agricultural
activities have impacted the landscape considerably
over time, although the depth of impacts is limited
to the upper 30 centimeters of sediment. However,
the areas outside of the gravel pits appear to be intact
and have a high potential for archeological deposits.
Historically, the majority of these areas were probably cultivated for grains, cotton, hay, or improved
grazing (Werchan et al. 1974). Prior to land clearing
for intensive cultivation, dense riparian woodland
probably covered much of the project area, with post
oak woodlands at the highest elevations (Anderson
1904). Today, land use has reduced the natural
vegetation and maintained crop and grazing plants
dominate. Native species are found primarily along
field margins and in poorly drained areas.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

Cultural Background

to the waterways. However, cultural and territorial
forces must also be acknowledged. The fact is, the
Blackland Prairie is located at the intersection of
several archeologically distinctive culture areasâ
the hunter-gatherer burned rock cultures of the west,
the coastal groups to the east, and the Caddoan
tribes of the Post Oak Savannah/Eastern Woodlands. One final explanation for the low occurrence
of prehistoric sites on the Blackland Prairie is that
many prehistoric archeological sites were no doubt
destroyed by farming and intensive agricultural use
of the Blackland Prairie during the latter half of the
nineteenth century.
Based on what is known about the prehistoric
environment it seems probable that prehistoric
occupation of the Blackland Prairie would have
required the utilization of both plateau and prairie
resources with considerable seasonal mobility
between the two (Potter 2006; Ricklis and Collins
1994). Most of the occupation sites in the Blackland
Prairie represent short-term campsites in open,
unprotected areas situated on alluvial terraces
adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). Many
central Texas archeological sites located along the
larger waterways, such as the Colorado River, the
San Gabriel River, and Brushy Creek, have also been
deeply buried by Holocene alluvium (Johnson 2000).
A typical open occupation site in central Texas
contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken
chert tools, fragmented burned rock, land snails,
fragmented animal bone and charred plant remains
within the context of a cooking facility such as an
oven or a stone hearth. An additional characteristic
of open sites is the presence of diagnostic stone
tools, often representing occupations from different
periods or phases and ultimately suggesting
repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands

The archeological context of Site 41TV2162
includes both prehistoric and historic archeological sites. The prehistoric cultures of central Texas
are defined as nomadic hunter-gatherers from the
Paleoindian until well into the historic period.
Most of the chronologies for central Texas are
based on four distinct time periods, representing a
12,000-year sequence of occupation. This sequence
from Ricklis and Collins (1994) and Johnson (1995)
is as follows: Paleoindian (ca. 9200-6000 B.C.),
Archaic (6000 B.C.-A.D. 600), Post-Archaic (A.D.
600-1600), and Historic (A.D. 1600-present). Although these divisions represent arbitrary temporal
categories, they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected
in changes in lithic and other technologies. Central
Texas is one of the better-known regions of the State
archeologically. More sites have been recorded,
tested and excavated in this area than in any other
part of the State (Black 1989).
Site 41TV2162 falls within the Blackland
Prairie archeological region, which is somewhat
underrepresented in terms of prehistoric site density.
Intact prehistoric sites tend to be clustered along first
order streams, with only occasional minor sites in
between. It has been suggested that prehistoric utilization of this region was intermittent, or confined
mainly to the riparian arteries along major waterways (Brownlow 2003). Researchers have tended
to link the low archeological site density within the
Blackland Prairie to limited water supply and the
lack of large mammals such as bison and pronghorn antelope (Shafer and Bryant 1976), forcing
the nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved through
this region on their seasonal migrations to adhere

9

of years. Buried intact prehistoric occupation sites
are typically considered archeologically significant
when identified.
Lithic open sites, containing only the debris
from stone tool-making activities, are most frequently found in upland areas and are often referred
to as lithic procurement, quarry, or workshop sites.
Numerous surveys conducted in the central Texas
area suggest that lithic sites are the most common
site type. The remains from such sites are believed
to be the result of specialized, short-term activities,
such as tool maintenance, tool manufacturing, or
intensive chert resource procurement. These sites
most frequently are not well buried, and often lack
integrity. Sites of this type are not usually considered
archeologically significant.
Another site type that is relatively uncommon
in the Blackland Prairie but frequently recorded
for the ecotonal region between the prairie and the
Edwards Plateau are burned rock middens. Burned
rock midden sites are considered to be characteristic
of central Texas archeology (Black 1989). These
fire-cracked and discolored limestone rock features
are found in terrace or upland settings and have other
cultural materials within and around them indicating an open occupation site (Black 1989). Burned
rock middens are circular, mounded accumulations
some 10-25 meters across, having a basic annular
(concentric) morphology (i.e., a dense ring or rocks
surrounding a distinct center and surrounded by a
thinning periphery; Black et al. 1997). The wide
variety of plant and animal remains found within
middens suggests that these ovens served as communal plant and animal processing facilities. Ultimately, it is believed that burned rock middens are
a consequence of perhaps hundreds of cooking fires
that were used and reused in one place over many
years (Black et al. 1997).
Burial sites are another class of prehistoric site
that could be present in the area of Site 41TV2162.
While burial sites are typically rare within the
Blackland Prairie (the Loeve-Fox Site-41WM230 is
a notable exception), a number of them (41TV1198,
41TV88, and 41WM539) have been documented in
the ecotonal region between the prairie and Edwards
Plateau, and in the Interior Gulf Coastal Plain.
Within the ecotonal region, prehistoric burials are
more likely to be one or two interments associated
with larger site occupations. Prehistoric cemeteries
(none have been documented in Guadalupe County

but many have been unearthed in neighboring counties to the south and east) with multiple interments
occur more frequently within the Interior Gulf
Coastal Plain region.
One final prehistoric site type that may occasionally occur in this region is the rock shelter site.
These are occupation sites that are situated within
shallow dry caves or rock overhangs. These rock
formations usually occur along creek or stream
bank margins. Rock shelter sites often contain midden debris and abundant cultural material that can
include not only lithics, but also faunal material,
seeds, pottery, and even the remains of basketry.
Within the SH 130 corridor, rock shelters are most
likely to occur along the western edge, where there
are a number of creeks bordered by high limestone
cliffs. Because faunal and plant material are often
well-preserved in rock shelter sites, if intact, these
are generally considered archeologically significant
for their inherent data value.
In the area surrounding Site 41TV2162, historical archeological sites are common. Settlement
occurred sporadically throughout the historic period.
During the Spanish Colonial period a number of
expeditions crossed into the area, including ones
led by Domingo Teran and Fray Damian Mazanet
in 1691, Gregorio Salinas Varona in 1693, Domingo
Ramon in 1716, and the Marques de Aguayo in
1719-1722 (Robbins 1998). As the Spaniards began
to establish presidios and missions within east and
northeast Texas they established the Camino Real
de los Tejas, the network of roads linking those
outposts to each other and, more importantly, to the
supply towns in Mexico. The Camino Real crossed
the Colorado River near Onion Creek in Austin and
ran in a northeasterly direction from there, crossing
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River near the
SH 130 corridor.
More definitive settlement began during the
Mexican period, starting in the 1820s. The earliest
tracts settled were Mexican period ranchos such
as that of Jose Antonio Navarro near present day
Seguin. In the 1830s, Anglo settlements sprang up at
Hornsbyâs Bend on the Colorado River, Montopolis
on the Colorado River, Kenneyâs Fort along Brushy
Creek, Fort Colorado on Tannehill Creek, in Austin,
and Seguin. However, most settlement prior to 1840
was hindered by bad roads, poor supply networks,
and frequent Indian raids. One such raid took place
on Kennyâs Fort in 1840 (Scarbrough 1976). And

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
one of the largest fights between Indians and white
settlers, the Battle of Plum Creek, took place in
1840 (Brice 1983), partially within the SH 130 corridor several miles south of Site 41TV2162. The
battle began approximately three miles southeast of
Lockhart and continued for approximately 15 miles
westward. That battle resulted in a decisive victory
for the white colonists that enabled them to push
settlement farther westward.
During the 1840s and 1850s towns such as
Lockhart, Round Rock, Manor, Martindale, and
Prairie Lea were established. These towns served
as regional centers for outlying plantations, farms
and ranches that began to spring up during the
latter half of the nineteenth century. During the
years prior to the Civil War, these farms tended to
be widely dispersed, based on early Mexican or
Republic of Texas era land grants (Mexican grants
were typically 4,428.4 acres, Republic of Texas
grants were typically 640 acres). However, the end
of slavery precipitated a new pattern of land ownership and tenure, resulting in smaller farms operated
by single families or tenants (Britton et al. 2002,
OâNeal 1997). Many communities developed with
strong ethnic or cultural affiliations. For example,
toward the end of the nineteenth century a wave of
Swedish immigrants purchased land and began to
settle between Pflugerville and Webberville. African
American communities such as Turnersville and
Bluff Springs, southeast of Austin emerged.
The most common historic archeological site
type relates to homestead and tenant farm settlement
of the late nineteenth century. These sites typically
occur on hilltops or hillsides overlooking creeks or
springs. They generally contain one or more combinations of foundation remnants, cisterns, wells,
barns, and artifact scatters. Individually such sites
are often not considered archeologically significant;
however, sites that contain unusual features or complexes of historic farmsteads representing vanished
communities may be archeologically significant.
Historic era cemeteries and family burial plots
are also fairly common. These sites do not always
contain grave markers, and if they do, mapped site
boundaries often inaccurately reflect the number of
interments. This is particularly true for Anglo family
cemeteries that contain pre-1870 interments. Often
these cemeteries contain unmarked burials of African American slaves or servants.
Less common are sites pertaining to the Spanish

11

Colonial Period, Mexican Period, early settlement
and military sites. These typically contain no extant
standing structures or features visible on the surface.
Such sites are almost always considered archeologically significant, since limited historical data about
them exists.
Previous investigations
Several archeological sites have been recorded
in the area surrounding Site 41TV2162 as a result
of previous investigations. Many significant prehistoric sites along Lower Onion Creek were originally
recorded in 1979 during the first cultural resource
survey ever conducted in this area (Whitsett and Fox
1979). This survey, funded by the Texas Department
of Water Resources, focused on the lower 15 miles of
Onion Creek, where investigators identified 75 prehistoric and 28 historic sites. No subsurface testing took
place during this survey; only pedestrian inspection
was conducted and, as such, only sites visible on the
surface or in cut banks were recorded. Site descriptions given at the time of the original documentation
were very minimal; however, many of these sites were
revisited during more recent archeological investigations. PBS&J revisited seven of these sites (41TV454,
455, 453, 410, 421, 456 and 457) while conducting
survey investigations for the SH 130 project. Two of
these sites (41TV410 and 456) were recommended for
further testing. Due to the large number of archeological sites recorded in the area of Site 41TV2162, this
section of previous investigations will focus on nearby
prehistoric sites with buried components, Early to
Middle Archaic sites in the region, and nearby historic
sites of local significance.
Site 41TV410 was originally recorded by Whitsett and Fox (1979) as a prehistoric open campsite
comprised of a surficial lithic scatter and a deeply
buried component that was observed in an erosional
cut bank, located approximately two miles northeast
of Site 41TV2162. PBS&J excavated a total of 36
shovel tests on the site, all of which were negative
(Rogers et al. 2002; Hales et al. 2002). Although no
cultural material was observed during their survey,
a recommendation for backhoe trenching was made
for Site 41TV410 based on the high potential for
deeply buried, intact archeological deposits within
recent Holocene alluvium (Hales et al. 2002). Hicks
& Company conducted investigations at the site in

12

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

2004 and recovered a single piece of lithic debitage
and a fragment of burned rock at 130 centimeters
below ground surface and a single piece of debitage
between 140 and 150 centimeters below ground surface (Campbell et al. 2004). These investigations,
conducted for the Kinder Morgan pipeline, overlapped the SH130 Additional Properties ROW. Site
41TV410 was determined ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP within the Kinder Morgan pipeline corridor and the subsequent pipeline construction impacted approximately a 10 to 15 meter wide portion
of the SH130 Additional Property, along the eastern
edge. Hicks & Company most recently updated
the site record during additional investigations for
SH 130, at which time three backhoe trenches and
eight shovel tests were excavated within the site
(Campbell et al. 2007). All of the shovel tests were
negative for cultural material, however, two of the
excavated trenches were positive. Each backhoe
trench was excavated to an approximate depth
of 460 to 630 centimeters below ground surface.
One backhoe trench contained a single fragment
of burned rock identified at 80 centimeters below
ground surface and a charcoal sample collected at
150 centimeters below ground surface. Artifacts
identified in the other positive trench were all
recovered from a 0.25 m2 test unit. This test unit
contained a single bone fragment between 20 and
30 centimeters below ground surface, one flake
between 170 and 180 centimeters below ground
surface, and mussel shell and charcoal between 240
and 250 centimeters below ground surface. No other
artifacts were recovered from the site within the
Additional Property. The paucity of artifacts within
the Additional Property indicated that this portion
of the site was low density and had a low research
value, and therefore, no further investigations were
recommended for site 41TV410 within the SH 130
Additional Property (Campbell et al. 2004).
The multiple-component Site 41TV456 was
also recommended for further testing by PBS&J.
This site is approximately 3.5 miles northeast of
Site 41TV2162, between Onion Creek and Hornsby Bend on the Colorado River. The historic
structure reported by Whitsett and Fox (1979) was
no longer standing and no artifacts or structural
remains were observed during these investigations
(Rogers et al. 2002). Although only one of the 19
shovel tests excavated at this time was positive for
cultural material, artifacts were encountered while

backhoe trenching at a depth of approximately 80
to 90 centimeters below the surface. Based on these
results, and the perceived potential for intact, stratified archeological deposits, it was recommended
that test excavations be conducted to determine the
siteâs NRHP eligibility (Rogers et al. 2002). Hicks
& Company conducted more intensive excavations
on this site during SH 130 Additional Properties
investigations. Six shovel tests were excavated, all
of which were negative for cultural material, and
three backhoe trenches were excavated within the
mapped site boundaries of Site 41TV456. Each
backhoe trench was excavated to an approximate
depth of 300-320 centimeters below ground surface. No cultural material was observed in the first
backhoe trench excavated. From the second, a single piece of lithic debitage was recovered at a depth
of approximately 30 centimeters below ground surface. A 50 x 50 centimeter test unit was excavated
in the third trench to investigate the vertical depth
of cultural deposits at Site 41TV456. A single flake
was recovered from the test unit at a depth of 107
centimeters below ground surface. No other cultural material was observed or recovered in any of
the trenches. Site 41TV456 was considered to have
poor integrity and low research potential within the
SH130 Additional Property, therefore no further
archeological work was recommended.
Site 41TV541 is a sparse prehistoric lithic
scatter located on the floodplain of Onion Creek,
adjacent to Site 41TV2162. This site was identified
during a 1981 survey for the planned Onion Creek
Wastewater Treatment Plant (Brown 1981). A subsequent site revisit, conducted by PBS&J recovered
one Pedernales projectile point (Middle Archaic/
Late Archaic I) on the surface of Site 41TV541
(Hales et al. 2002). No artifacts were recovered
from shovel tests excavated on the site. The site
was reported to be heavily disturbed by natural
and artificial impacts. Site 41TV541 was again reevaluated by Hicks & Company as a part of SH130
Additional Properties investigations, at which time
a total of six shovel tests and one backhoe trench
were excavated. Only one shovel test was positive
for cultural material, with a single flake between
20 and 30 centimeters below ground surface. The
backhoe trench was excavated to 342 centimeters
below ground surface to explore the potential for
deeply buried deposits. Soils were dense silty clays
with deep fissures and slickensides. The soils are

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
similar to the adjacent upland soils and the slickensides may be the result of soil creep from the
adjacent upland or shrinking and swelling activity.
This trench was negative for cultural material and
was terminated due to severe instability with the
trench walls. Due to the paucity of cultural material within the project area, no further work was
recommended for site 41TV541.
Site 41TV285 is a deeply buried prehistoric
site located approximately half a mile northwest of
Site 41TV2162 on the north bank of Onion Creek,
in the area of Mooreâs Crossing. This site was first
identified by workers of a gravel quarry when a
rock hearth was uncovered on the north side of
Onion Creek downstream from Mooreâs Crossing.
Following investigation by Elton Prewitt, the site
was reported to consist of three fire hearths, deeply
buried at approximately 20 feet (six meters) below
the ground surface (Prewitt 1974). No artifacts
were found in association with the hearths during
this investigation. Although no firm date could
be ascertained, the site was estimated to date to
approximately 7,000 B.P. based on the depth of
deposition. Whitsett and Fox (1979) later expanded
the site boundaries and encountered cultural features to a depth of eight meters below the surface.
This site was later surveyed by Hicks & Company
during investigations for the new Austin airport. At
this time artifacts were encountered on the surface
and in shovel tests to a depth of approximately
50 to 60 centimeters below the surface. Hicks &
Company tested the site in 1998, at which time it
was clear that much of the site had been destroyed
by the prolonged quarrying activity in the area. Test
excavations revealed a number of activity locales
resulting from a variety of social functions (Lohse
and Iruegas 1998). Although the site contained
intact, stratified deposits, the highly disturbed
nature of the site limited the research value, and
therefore, investigators determined that the site was
not eligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL. No
further investigation was recommended.
Site 41TV2161 was identified by Hicks &
Company archeologists during survey investigations
for SH130 Additional Properties, at which time
Site 41TV2162 was also recorded. This site was
recorded as a prehistoric open campsite on a
low terrace on the floodplain of Onion Creek.
The site is located approximately 328 feet (100
meters) southwest of the base of an upland ridge

13

and approximately one kilometer southeast of
the current Onion Creek channel. The site area
is currently located in a cattle pasture that has
been plowed in recent years. Soils on the site are
primarily calcareous silty sandy clays deriving
from Onion Creek. A total of 13 shovel tests and
10 backhoe trenches were excavated on the site,
of which, five shovel tests and seven trenches
were positive for cultural material. In addition, 11
test units were excavated in the trenches to define
cultural occupations. Four features were identified
within the backhoe trenches, and a total of 1,034
artifacts were recorded on site 41TV2161 including
588 lithic debitage, 399 burned rock, 10 tools, three
cores, 15 bone, two burned earth, and 17 shell
fragments. The five positive shovel tests contained
a total of 18 artifacts that occurred between 0 and
90 centimeters below ground surface.
Feature 1 was identified in the easternmost
trench excavated on the site. This feature consisted
of a concentration of burned rock with no discernible pattern or staining identified between 35 and 48
centimeters below ground surface within a transition
zone between the plow zone and the underlying alluvial sediments. Flotation samples were collected,
however, the charcoal observed in the samples was
too small to positively identify as charcoal. No
charcoal or organic material was observed during
the excavation of Feature 1. Features 2 and 4 were
located in a trench excavated towards the western
edge of the site. In this trench, a second occupation
was discovered between 220 and 275 centimeters
below ground surface, which contained the two
features. Feature 2 was located between 266 and 274
centimeters below ground surface and was a scatter
of six burned rocks, three flakes, charcoal, burned
earth, and a high density of snail shells that extended
across the floor of the trench. Feature 4 was located
at a depth of 251 to 254 centimeters below ground
surface and consisted of a dense concentration of
burned clay. Although no artifacts were recovered
within Feature 4, four burned cobbles, a bison tooth,
and several pieces of charcoal were recorded in the
surrounding test unit between 247 and 276 centimeters below ground surface.
Feature 3 was located in a trench excavated at
the northeastern edge of the Onion Creek floodplain. This feature was located between 200 and
230 centimeters below ground surface and consisted of a dense concentration of burned rock, burned

14

fossil shells, lithics, bone, and a concentration of
charcoal. The feature was circular in plan view
and the profile exhibited a basin shape. Elevations
of the rocks on the exterior edges ranged from 208
to 220 centimeters below ground surface and were
generally larger than the rocks in the interior, which
ranged in elevation from 220 to 228 centimeters below ground surface. Beneath the rocks was a band of
dense black sediment (originally thought to be charcoal) between 223 to 229 centimeters below ground
surface. Eight radiocarbon samples were collected
throughout the feature and two humate samples
were collected from directly beneath the rocks. In
addition, seven flotation samples, comprising the
majority of the feature fill, were collected. Feature 3
appears to be an intact rock lined basin and possibly
the remnants of a prehistoric oven. The burned rock
assemblage consisted of 201 rocks, of which 80 to
90 percent were quartzite with the remaining rocks
consisting of chert or limestone. There were 53
fossil mollusks, representing 21 percent of the total
burned rock assemblage. These fossil mollusks are
common in the nearby uplands.
Features 5-7 were located in another trench
excavated near the western site boundary. Feature
5 was recorded at 245 centimeters below ground
surface as a concentration of six burned rocks
with associated charcoal. Adjacent to this feature
was Feature 6, a dense concentration of charcoal,
burned earth, and oxidized and reduced sediment at
244 centimeters below ground surface. There was
no discernible function to Feature 5; however its
close proximity to Feature 6 suggests that Feature 5
represented material raked out of a hearth or campfire. Based on the vertical distribution of artifacts
within the trench, they were most likely associated
with the lower occupation. Feature 7 was recorded
at the base of this trench (350 centimeters below
ground surface) and consisted of two circular stains
with burned earth, reduced and oxidized soil, charcoal, and a large limestone cobble. This feature was
not excavated, but four radiocarbon samples were
collected from within the feature.
Based on the vertical distribution of artifacts
across the site, there appeared to be a high density
of intact buried cultural material between 30 and 235
centimeters below ground surface in the northern
portion of the site. The occupational zone in these
trenches lies within and below a transitional soil
zone between the upper plow zone/slope wash sedi-

ments and the underlying alluvial sediments (light
yellowish brown to brown silty clay). Although
Feature 1, Feature 3, and the high-density lithic
concentration were all stratigraphically associated,
organic preservation within Feature 1 and the upper
one meter of sediment was very poor. Feature 3
exhibited excellent organic preservation including
bone and a high density of charcoal. A second occupational zone was recorded between 210 and 353
centimeters below ground surface. Features 2, 4, 5,
6, and 7 were all located within this zone, with an
associated low-density artifact distribution. In all of
the features, except for Feature 1, charcoal and bone
were well preserved, indicating that organic preservation at the site is excellent for both occupations.
In addition, the occupations at the site appear to be
intact cultural deposits.
The only diagnostic artifacts recorded on Site
41TV2161 were charcoal and mussel shell. However, when the charcoal samples were submitted to
Beta Analytic, all of the samples were determined
to lack any charcoal. Therefore, no date could be
established for the site. Given the density of artifacts at the site, the potential for additional intact
features, and organic preservation, Site 41TV2161
was recommended for NRHP eligibility testing if
construction impacts were to reach below one meter below the ground surface. Although construction impacts were not likely to exceed one meter
in depth, TxDOT recommended that the site should
be investigated further, and, in an effort to accommodate the construction schedule, they conducted
data recovery investigations in portions of the site.
TRC Companies, Inc. was contracted to conduct
this work under a separate permit.
Robert Ricklis and Michael Collins identified,
tested, and performed data recovery operations on
several sites within the Onion Creek valley as a part
of investigations for the proposed FM 1626 right-ofway in Hays County (Ricklis and Collins 1994). One
of these, the Barton Site (41HY202), was comprised
of multiple prehistoric occupations, beginning with
a significant Early Archaic component. The site was
subdivided into areas based on the recovery of artifacts dominated by a particular time period (Ricklis
and Collins 1994). Although the site contained a
Late Prehistoric (Toyah) component as well, this site
discussion will focus on the Early Archaic findings,
as they relate directly to data recovered from Site
41TV2162 during the current field investigations.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
The Barton Site is located in east-central Hays
County, on a terrace between the relict Onion Creek
channel and Mustang Branch. Quarrying operations had removed the northern portion of the site,
and although cultural material was observed to the
east and west along the terrace, investigations were
limited to the proposed FM 1626 ROW (Ricklis
and Collins 1994). Although the bulk of diagnostic
Early Archaic material was recovered from one area
of the site, a limited number of artifacts and features attributable to this temporal occupation were
located within other site areas dominated by later
occupational remains. Ricklis and Collins (1994)
determined that many of these earlier artifacts were
displaced from their primary contexts and reused by
later inhabitants of the site.
Within the area of Site 41HY202 defined as
dominantly Early Archaic (Ricklis and Collins
1994), archeologists found evidence of two components during the testing phase. The upper component was identified within the plow zone and had
been thoroughly disturbed by agricultural activity,
whereas the lower component appeared to be a
relatively intact Early Archaic occupational zone.
Three burned rock features were documented within this zone that was estimated to be approximately
20 centimeters in thickness. Holocene deposits
across the site ranged from approximately 20 to 50
centimeters deep (including the 15 to 20 centimeter
disturbed plow zone). In a poorly defined, disturbed
area of the site, archeologists identified one additional burned-rock feature. The feature was a
roughly circular, loose assembly of medium-sized
and small rocks, with no discernable pit or organic
material present. From this same area, one Uvalde
dart point (Early Archaic) and four Perdiz arrow
points (Late Prehistoric) were recovered. However,
all of these, with the exception of one of the Late
Prehistoric points, were found out of context on a
pile of excavated dirt (Ricklis and Collins 1994).
Prior to TARL excavations at the site, a magnetometer survey was conducted over a portion of the site
extending from the group of features. This attempt
to locate additional features was unsuccessful due
to extensive interference.
Data recovery excavations on this portion of
the site included a total of 60 test units that were
excavated following mechanical removal of the
disturbed plow zone. These excavations resulted in
the identification of eight burned-rock features and

15

one flint-knapping area (Ricklis and Collins 1994).
The burned rock features consisted of five hearths,
a hearth/oven feature, a pile of discarded rocks,
and one unidentified feature. The hearth features
generally consisted of a single layer of burned
rock arranged in roughly circular patterns, ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.3 meters. The hearth/oven
feature consisted of a central platform surrounded
by burned rock. Although the discard pile implies
an accumulation of unwanted or unused rocks,
their usefulness is largely unknown (Ricklis and
Collins 1994). The flint-knapping area consisted
of 2,055 heavily patinated flakes, interpreted as
representing production by âa single knapper over
a short period of timeâ (Ricklis and Collins 1994).
Debitage analysis attributed four of the flakes to the
production of at least one Andice dart point. As a
result of excavations at the Barton Site, a total of
15,468 chert artifacts were recovered from the Early Archaic component. All but three of these were
heavily patinated. Diagnostic artifacts recovered
include 23 Angostura (n=1), Wilson (n=1), Gower
(n=1), Bell/Andice (n=11), Uvalde (n=4), Early
Triangular (n=3), and two unidentified dart points
and fragments. Comparative site analysis temporally associates the site with the Jerrell interval (ca.
8500 to 5000 B.P.; Ricklis and Collins 1994).
The Wilson-Leonard Site (41WM235) represents one of the most complete temporal sequences
at a single site in central Texas (Collins 1998).
Cultural occupation at this site spans approximately 11,000 years from the Paleoindian to Late
Prehistoric periods. The site, located in Williamson
County near the headwaters of Brushy Creek, was
first discovered in 1973 during investigations for
the FM 1431 right-of-way (Collins 1998). Since
that time, excavations and testing of the site have
occurred on numerous occasions, the latest of
which took place in 1993. The site drew the most
publicity, however, during excavations conducted
between 1982 and 1984 when a late Paleoindian
human burial was discovered. As with the previous discussion of Site 41HY202, this site discussion will focus on the Early Archaic site component, which relates to the current testing on Site
41TV2162. Although the site is located a considerable distance away from the Onion Creek deposits of
41TV2162 (40 kilometers), the Wilson-Leonard Site
contains comparably aged Early Archaic deposits
also near the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau.

16

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

The Archaic material recovered at this site was
composed of burned rock, lithic tools and debitage,
ground stone, bone, a small amount of shell, and
a few specimens of charred plant remains (Collins
1998). Of these materials, 2,878 tools, more than
220,000 pieces of debitage, and 100 features with
associated plant and animal remains were attributed
to the Early Archaic component (Collins 1998),
representing the majority of Archaic artifacts.
This temporal period also demonstrated better
stratigraphic isolation than the Middle and Late
Archaic components. Two categorical point types
characterize the projectile point recovery from Site
41WM235. Lanceolate forms included primarily
Angostura, Thrall, and other miscellaneous types,
along with small numbers of Golondrina-Barber
and St. Maryâs Hall, whose production may have
carried over into the Early Archaic. Clovis, San
Patrice, Scottsbluff and Wilson points were found,
but considered intrusive from the Paleoindian
period. Stemmed point types included Hoxie,
Gower, Jetta, and other similar types, with Uvalde,
Baker, Bandy, and Martindale types becoming
more prevalent later in the period (Collins 1998).
Other tools recovered include Clear Fork tools
(bifacial and unifacial), perforators, burins, manos,
metates, Waco sinkers, unifacial tools, bone tools,
and hammerstones. Additionally, the only pestle
found on the site is attributed to the Early Archaic
occupation, as well as five small shell beads
(Collins 1998).
Of the 100 features attributed to the Early Archaic at the Wilson-Leonard Site, over half were
burned rock clusters; likely hearths, hearth remnants, and discard piles. Several of these exhibited
evidence of in situ burning (Collins 1998), including two areas of burned sediment. One of these
could not definitively be associated with cultural
activity. Five burned rock basins were attributed
to the Early Archaic, many of which are a part of
larger, complex midden features (Collins 1998).
Faunal remains from some of these cooking features included turtle, fish, rodent, amphibian, (bird)
eggshell, snake, and rabbit. The Early Archaic occupational component at this site revealed a heavy
consumption of fish that had continued from the
Paleoindian period, but more importantly, the use
of earth ovens to cook geophytes; representing a
significant addition to subsistence and technology
(Collins 1998).

Previous Site 41TV2162
Investigations
Between November 14 and November 29, 2005,
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive survey of the SH 130 Additional Properties,
at which time Site 41TV2162 was identified. This
site, located on Parcel 366, was recorded as a prehistoric open campsite and historic artifact scatter.
The northern half of the site lies on the floodplain of
Onion Creek and extends to the southwest along the
slope and atop the ridge overlooking the floodplain
(Plate 1). The historic age artifacts were limited to
the upland ridge whereas the prehistoric occupation
encompassed both the upland and the floodplain.
The site area was dominated by thick mesquite
along the upland ridge and along its slopes, while
the floodplain was covered with dense, tall reeds and
grass with sparsely scattered mesquite. A total of 34
shovel tests and five trenches were excavated on the
site, of which 23 shovel tests and four trenches were
positive for cultural material. In addition, three test
units were excavated to define cultural occupations
within the trenches. In total, 1,470 prehistoric artifacts and 37 historic artifacts were recovered from
the site. Of the 1,470 prehistoric artifacts recovered,
there were 395 lithics, 1,063 burned rocks, two bifaces, two cores, and three possible chert tools. The
37 historic artifacts consisted of 22 pieces of glass,
three ceramics, and 12 pieces of metal all recovered
from shovel tests.
Of the 34 shovel tests excavated, 23 were positive for cultural material between 0 and 70 centimeters below ground surface. Soils in the shovel tests
consisted of very dense, very dark grayish brown to
black silty clays. The upland and slope portion of
the site had been severely affected by argilliturbation
and severe overgrazing. These areas were dominated
by mesquite and broomweed that offered 0 to 75 percent ground surface visibility while the floodplain
was covered with dense grasses and reeds affording
0 to 10 percent ground surface visibility. A total of
89 lithics, 11 burned rock, two informal tools, and
one core comprised the prehistoric artifacts recovered from the shovel tests. As stated earlier the 37
historic artifacts consisted of 22 pieces of glass,
three ceramics, and 12 pieces of metal.
Trenches 11 and 15 were located completely on
the floodplain of Onion Creek and had very similar
sediment profiles. Trench 11 was the northernmost

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
trench on the site. A chert core and a single piece of
burned rock were recorded between 60 and 80 centimeters below ground surface. No other cultural material was recorded in Trench 11. Trench 15 was located south of Trench 11 and contained four burned
rock features, 219 lithics, 1,010 burned rocks, and
one biface. Burned rock was scattered across the
whole of the trench between 50 and 130 centimeters
below ground surface. Test Unit M was excavated in
the southeast wall of the trench surrounding Feature
1, a burned rock concentration identified in profile
during trenching. Test Unit M was 50 centimeters
by 100 centimeters and was excavated to between 97
and 150 centimeters below ground surface. Feature 1
was located at 105 centimeters below ground surface
and consisted of a cluster of six burned rocks. Six
lithics were recovered from between 100 and 110
centimeters below ground surface and one lithic
between 120 and 130 centimeters below ground surface in TU-M. Features 2 and 4 were both scattered
burned rock concentrations that did not resemble
hearths. Feature 2 was located between 108 and
117 centimeters below ground surface and Feature 4
was located between 95 and 111 centimeters below
ground surface. Neither Feature 2 nor Feature 4 contained lithics. Feature 3 was a very dense concentration of burned rock and lithics and was a possible
earth oven. The feature was located between 52 and
78 centimeters below ground surface and contained
207 lithics and 964 burned rocks. The feature was
circular and concentrated primarily in a 2.25 square
meter area, but was spread over a 4.5 square meter
area. The feature was bisected and was observed as
flat in profile. In the middle of the feature were rocks
comprised of gravels densely consolidated within
baked clay. It could not be ascertained whether the
clay surrounding the gravels was burned, however
field results suggest that the gravels and clay consolidated in situ.
No charcoal or organic material was observed in
any of the features during the excavations in Trench
15. Flotation samples collected from Features 1, 2,
and 3 only yielded <0.1 grams of possible charcoal between 72 and 78 centimeters below ground
surface and <0.1 grams of bone between 65 and
74 centimeters below ground surface in Feature
3. However, the possible charcoal fragments were
too small to positively identify. Flotation samples
from Features 1 and 2 yielded no organic material.
Humate samples were also collected from the trench

17

profile, but these samples were not processed. Since
the investigators knew the site would be tested, the
decision was made to forego dating the bulk humate
samples in the hope that better samples for dating,
such as burned wood or plant material, would be
recovered from intact archeological contexts during testing. This decision was also based on the
cost of dating the bulk humate samples with regard
to the poor organic preservation evident in feature
contexts and in the site sediments in general, and the
questionable accuracy of those dates as opposed to
the more accurate dates derived from burned wood
or plant material.
Backhoe Trench 12 was located south of Trench
15. This trench along with Trench 14, was located at
the toe slope of the upland ridge. Both trenches had
thick upper zones of colluvium from the adjacent
upland. Trench 12 had a very dark gray to black
silty sandy clay zone to a depth of 248 centimeters
below ground surface overlying Onion Creek alluvial deposits. Trench 14 had colluvial deposition to a
depth of 422 centimeters below ground surface. S.C.
Caran, consulting geomorphologist, recorded trench
profiles in Trenches 12 and 14 and concluded:
Deep excavations within Parcel 366 exposed the abandoned channel segment, its bedload, and inter-tonguing overbank and colluvial
deposits, to depths as great as 6.5 meters. Sloperelated processes in most parts of the valley
resulted in only limited sedimentation. In Parcel
366, however, the effects of colluvial processes
(mass movement, lag deposition, and slope
wash) and related pedoturbation were significant. As mapped by Garner and Young (1976),
Onion Creek Terrace deposits underlie the entire project area. Current on-site observations
indicate a more complex stratigraphy, however.
Along the toe of the bedrock valley wall, at the
distal edge of the Onion Creek flood terrace, a
series of deep trackhoe trenches exposed thick
deposits of highly calcareous silty clay. These
deposits contained small amounts of siliceous
gravel (chert and quartzite) and fossilized shells
of marine mollusks. The sediment composing
these deposits derived from the adjacent bedrock
slopes as slope-wash, landslides, and soil creep,
which moved downslope and interfingered with
the overbank deposits composing most of the
Onion Creek Terrace fill. Bedrock exposed in
the valley wall consists of weakly consolidated
calcareous mudstone and marl. Weathering destabilizes these strata, producing large amounts

18

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas
of loose silty clay sediment. Moderate runoff
conveys this sediment downslope as slope
wash, but if the slope becomes water saturated,
mass movement can occur. The wet sediment is
cohesive and generally moves slowly through
soil creep, although excessive fluidization may
cause small landslides. Soil-creep deposits are
characterized by steeply dipping slickensides,
often exhibiting striations on the glide surfaces. Landslide deposits may preserve chaotic
bedding orientations and inverse grading of
sediment, whereby fine-grained sediment varies
upward to coarser textures. Large fossil mollusks are relatively common in these deposits of
displaced bedrock. In addition, the valley wall
is capped by Colorado River terrace gravels. As
the soft bedrock slopes are eroded, these terrace
deposits are undercut, releasing pebbles and
cobbles of extremely hard chert and quartzite.
This siliceous gravel is too dense to be washed
far downslope by runoff and too erosion resistant to degrade in place. Gravel therefore accumulates as a thin lag deposit partly mantling
the slope. Prehistoric peoples undoubtedly collected siliceous pebbles and cobbles from both
the Capitol Terrace fill and the lag deposits and
utilized them for raw materials. Evidence of in
situ lithic reduction was documented at several
buried occupation sites in this area (Campbell
et al. 2005).

Trench 14 contained one lithic between 120 and
130 centimeters below ground surface within the
colluvial sediment and most likely derived from the
adjacent upland ridge. Several lithics were observed
in the colluvial sediments in Trench 12, however due
to the nature of soil to crumble into massive peds it
was impossible to ascertain the provenience of the
artifacts. A total of 89 lithics, 35 burned rocks, two
mussel shells, one biface, and a hammerstone were
recovered from Trench 12. These artifacts were
recovered from Test Unit K and L. Test Unit K was
a one square meter unit excavated between 443 and
510 centimeters below ground surface in the base of
the trench. Artifacts from this test unit included 79
lithics, a biface, a hammerstone, two mussel shells,
35 burned rocks, and four radiocarbon samples,
the majority of these occurring between 450 and
470 centimeters below ground surface. Test Unit L
was a 50 centimeter x 50 centimeter unit excavated
between 378 and 458 centimeters below ground
surface in the west wall of the trench and contained
seven lithics. Although the occupation observed

in Trench 12 was at 450 to 470 centimeters below
ground surface, the presence of approximately 250
centimeters of colluvium in Trench 12 suggested
that the occupations in both Trench 12 and Trench
15 were associated.
The prehistoric occupation at Site 41TV2162
appeared to be manifesting as two possibly separate
occupations. The first was the surface scatter and
material observed during shovel testing and surface
inspection of the upland ridge. The surface of this
ridge was covered with Colorado River terrace
deposits and was most likely an area that prehistoric
people utilized for lithic resources. The artifacts
were likely disturbed by argilliturbation associated
with the clayey soils, and therefore were appearing
at varying depths. The second occupation, located
within Trench 15 and Trench 12, consisted of a broad
intact, buried, high-density zone of burned rock and
lithics within the Onion Creek alluvium between 50
and 470 centimeters below ground surface. This wide
range of depth of the cultural occupation is due to
the toe slope of the adjacent upland that extends over
Trench 12 and the decreasing depth of the colluvial
toe slope downhill overlying the alluvial deposits in
Trench 15. Hundreds of burned rocks and flakes were
recorded and/or collected from this zone. Artifacts
recorded during the survey indicated a dense and
highly variable lithic assemblage including numerous
small, late stage biface thinning flakes and pressure
flakes. In addition to early stage reduction debris,
quartzite flakes, burned potlidded flakes, and stone
tools were present. Several bifaces, including early
stage unfinished pieces and finished utilized tools
and one pecking stone were collected. This type of
assemblage was suggestive of a prehistoric open
occupation site. The presence of formal tools in the
assemblage within a highly variable flake assemblage
suggested that projectile points were likely present
(although not recovered during survey). Thus, there
was the possibility that additional investigations
would determine the relative age and socio-cultural
interval of this zone, which contained possible earth
ovens, through diagnostic artifact recovery. Trench 15
features lacked organic preservation and diagnostic
artifacts. However, there were suggestions of organic
preservation in the lower zone of Trench 12. The
occupation located in Trench 12, primarily between
450 and 470 centimeters below ground surface (upper
2.5 meters is colluvium), was likely associated with
the occupational debris in Trench 15. Two reasonable

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
pieces of charcoal were collected from this zone,
which contained late stage biface thinning flakes and
pressure flakes, and numerous burned limestone rocks.
Flakes in association with this lower area suggested
a prehistoric open occupation site where a variety of
different types of behavior and subsistence practices
occurred. The presence of charcoal suggested the
possibility of dateable subsistence and fuel remains.
Only a small area of this intact zone overlapped the
Additional Property.
The historic component of this site was limited
to the upland ridge. Three shovel tests were positive
for historic artifacts in this area containing 22 pieces
of glass, three ceramics (whiteware), and 12 pieces
of metal. Several historic artifacts as well as modern
trash were present on the surface. A house with three
outbuildings was located on the site. The house was
built after 1950 and was currently occupied. One
of the outbuildings was a garage and a dilapidated
barn sat less than 100 meters to the southeast of the
house. This property was a part of the Noel M. Bain
grant, according to the 1894 General Land Office
map, and buildings were present at this location on
both the 1946 Travis County General Highway Map
and the 1955 USGS Montopolis 15' quadrangle.
Although Elroy Road was not depicted on the 1910
USGS Mt. Bonnell quadrangle, the southern boundary of Bainâs grant appeared to be the location of

19

Elroy Road today. The upland ridge was heavily
overgrazed and littered with modern trash in the
vicinity of the house and structures. The mixed assemblage and deflated nature of the landform had
left this site with very poor integrity. No further
work was recommended for this portion of the site
within the Additional Property.
Based on the results of the survey investigations,
it was the opinion of the investigators that the upper
prehistoric component had a poor integrity, lacking
organic preservation, diagnostic artifacts, and was
most likely mixed. No further work was recommended for this occupation. The lower component
on Site 41TV2162, primarily located between 50
and 470 centimeters below ground surface in Trench
12 and Trench 15, warranted further investigation
(colluvium to 2.5 meters in Trench 12). This component was considered potentially significant based on:
1) alluvial setting, 2) intact deposits, 3) several features, including a possible earth oven, 4) a dense and
highly variable lithic assemblage, and 5) evidence of
organic preservation as recorded in the lower zone.
Therefore, additional testing was recommended to
ascertain the nature and context of these artifacts and
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
Hicks & Company conducted testing investigations
at Site 41TV2162 in April and May of 2006 under
a separate permit, TAC #4082.

Research Design

All archeological deposits identified within
the project area were evaluated using the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) criteria of significance (36 CFR 60.4).

eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
(36 CFR 60.4)
Typically the most applicable criterion for
evaluating archaeological properties is criterion d.
In general, prehistoric and historic sites containing subsurface deposits in the form of features or
middens that are considered for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) fall
within criterion d. Sites that are viewed as likely to
contain intact subsurface deposits are determined by
occupation intensity, function or type of site, and the
degree of disturbance. Site integrity and condition
are key factors in evaluating NRHP significance.
NRHP significance determinations generally
parallel State Archeological Landmark qualifications
under the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 26.8). As
this project falls under the TAC, the tested portion
of the site must also be evaluated for SAL status. An
archeological site exhibits the potential to be eligible
as a SAL if at least one of the following criteria are
met: a) materials are sufficiently preserved to allow
application of standard archeological techniques to
advantage; b) the majority of artifacts are in place so
that a significant portion of the siteâs original characteristics can be defined through investigation; c) the
site has the potential to contribute to the cumulative
history by the addition of new information; d) the
site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes and/
or e) the site offers a unique or rare opportunity to
test techniques, theory or method of preservation,
thereby contributing to scientific knowledge.
The primary goal of the testing was to provide
qualitative information about the site to establish
relative significance and provide a recommendation
of NRHP or SAL eligibility. The NRHP eligibility
of this site was tied to the presence/absence of intact
hearth features and diagnostic artifacts and good

The NRHP criteria are as follows:
The quality of significance in American history,
architecture, archaeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects of
state and local importance that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and
a. that are associated with the events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
b. that are associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past; or
c. that embody the distinctive characteristics of
a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that
possess high artistic value, or that represent
a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction;
or
d. that yielded, or may be likely to yield, information on prehistory or history.

organic preservation. At issue is the presence of the
types and distributional patterning of artifacts with
the potential to provide behavioral or technological
information, or the potential for new insights or
new data on the central Texas archeological record.
Important research issues deal with chronology, site
function and site type related to the many archeological sites documented in central Texas. These
types of data, if present within temporally isolated
sediment/occupation zones, have the potential to
provide behavioral and systemic information on subsistence, chronology and technological organization
of prehistoric populations along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau and the central Texas archeological region. These are the important criteria, and
testing must establish whether these data sets are
present and well preserved to the extent that would
allow reconstruction of actual behavior during or
between specific intervals of time.
The testing strategy was designed to address the
following questions. Is there unique preservation at
the site, or unique sets of artifacts or features? Is
there a unique set of preservation circumstances that
allows for a reconstruction of paleoenvironmental
data? Do the preserved remains represent relatively
undocumented time frames or new information on
prehistoric subsistence or site structure/function?
Based on the testing data, if the answer to any of
these questions is âyesâ, then consistent with the
Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards and Guidelines
the site may be recommended as NRHP eligible.
Within a cultural ecological approach to
the interpretation of prehistoric hunter-gatherer
behavior, the NRHP testing of Site 41TV2162
focused on a determination of the siteâs context,
content, integrity, chronology and potential for
new and unique information in the central Texas
archeological record. Hand excavations and
total data station mapping of the larger materials
and features was conducted to establish relative
densities of cultural material, and the presence/
absence of hearth features and concentrated activity
areas, at the macroscale level of resolution. A
variety of excavation and recording techniques
were employed to determine whether or not
the deep component at Site 41TV2162 exhibits
intact archeological patterning and site structure.
Geomorphic studies were a primary tool in the
determination of intact context. The reconstruction
of the depositional history of the terrace established

which strata exhibit the potential to contain
unmixed archeological deposits, and relative ages
of the sediment zones. These excavations also
estaÂ­blished the horizontal boundaries of the lower
prehistoric component identified on the site within
the Additional Properties.
Site significance was largely determined on
the basis of presence/absence of numerous hearth
or other intact features with well preserved organic
remains including direct associations with identifiable charcoal that could be submitted for radiocarbon dating. Site significance was also based on the
relative density of artifacts, whether these could be
attributed to a temporally narrow range of prehistoric occupations, within an intact, isolated sediment
zone, and on the presence or absence of diagnostic
artifacts. Hand excavations, piece plotting, artifact
analysis, radiocarbon dating and the water screening/flotation of sediment samples from trench and
feature contexts were utilized in the determination
of site context at 41TV2162. These techniques
contributed to the reconstruction of distributional
patterning (vertical and horizontal), assemblage
composition and artifact densities at the site. Flotation analysis established the presence/absence and
type of preserved organic remains from different
âcontextsâ of the prehistoric component of the site.
Because features may be more than clusters of
burned rocks, structural remains, or lithic debris,
a rigorous approach to feature identification was
employed. This approach considered features to be
any anomaly within the context of each trench or excavation unitâlithic scatters, soil stains, or patches
of loosely consolidated matrixâthat may have a
potential to yield data about overall site structure
and site formation processes.
These data were synthesized and critically
examined for evidence of intact archeological patterning versus disturbed contexts. At issue was: 1)
whether features are the result of prehistoric activity,
are structurally intact and exhibit good organic preservation in the form of charcoal and/or bone (do the
features exhibit the potential to provide significant
subsistence and structural data) and; 2) does the
distributional patterning, assemblage composition
and artifact density data, in conjunction with feature morphology, indicate intact, isolated occupation zones or alternatively, culturally overprinted
mixed palimpsests of cultural material. The rigorous
sampling efforts and specialized studies conducted

Research Design
during the testing strategy will establish the presence/absence of data sets important to address the
proposed research issues.
Field Methods
Excavations on Site 41TV2162 targeted the
lower prehistoric component in the areas around
Trenches 12 and 15. These excavations consisted
of one 54 square meters and two 100 square meters machine excavated blocks (Blocks A and B),
eight 4 square meters hand excavated units, and
four linear trenches (Blocks C, D, F, and G; Plate
2). The final block to be excavated was Block E.
This block was located south of Block B and was
established after the identification of deeply buried,
intact cultural materials during scraping. Block E
was mapped arbitrarily as a 6 x 9 meter block. The
machine-excavated blocks were used to remove the
predominantly sterile overburden around Trenches
12 and 15 to target the occupation zones in these
trenches. A total of 15.7 cubic meters of sediment
was hand excavated across the site. This amount
of sediment is less than the 17.6 cubic meters that
was proposed in the original research design and
was due to the excessive rains and flooding that
occurred within the blocks and the low density of
cultural material observed.
The elevations given in this report reflect vertical elevations relative to the main site datum, not
actual elevations above mean sea level. The main
site datum elevation was arbitrarily set at 100
meters. In some cases, vertical provenience is also
related in depths below ground surface, however,
relative elevations are also provided. This is done to
relate data collected in the testing phase with data
collected during the survey investigations.
In the research design it was stated that Block
A would target the occupation around Trench 15 between a depth of 50 to 120 centimeters below ground
surface to begin hand excavations below the sterile
colluvium covering the site. However, upon excavation of Block A the colluvium was found to extend
deeper, and the block was excavated to a depth of 90
centimeters below ground surface (elevation= 99.13
meters), where hand excavated units could extend
between 90 and 160 centimeters below ground
surface. Block B was excavated adjacent to Trench
12 and was scraped to a depth of 440 centimeters

23

below ground surface (elevation= 97.66 meters).
Three hand-excavated units were excavated within
the block between 440 and 480 centimeters below
ground surface. Block E was located immediately
south of Block B to explore the cultural materials
extending to the south.
One of the linear trenches (Block C) was excavated to establish a stratigraphic sequence between
Blocks A and B to determine if the two occurrences
of cultural material were associated. Block D was
a linear trench 26 meters (after benching) in length
and excavated to a depth of 5.2 meters below surface
(elevation= 94.32 meters). This block was located
north and east of Block A and was excavated to
clarify the horizontal limits of the site to the north.
Block F consisted of a linear trench excavated to the
south of Block B to establish the horizontal limits of
the site to the south and the bedrock contact where
the floodplain and the upland ridge meet. Block G
was excavated west of Block E to establish the horizontal limits of the site to the west and the vertical
limits of the occupation adjacent to Blocks B and E.
The excavations of Blocks B, C, E, and F resulted
in a massive excavation that allowed for a continuous stratigraphic profile approximately 90 meters in
length extending from Block A south to the bedrock
contact in Block F. It is important to note that during the course of the excavations the site suffered
numerous heavy rainfalls that frequently flooded
the blocks and units with water and sediment, necessitating the pumping of water and re-excavation
of buried units.
Machine excavations on the site consisted of
carefully scraping the surface of each block with
a trackhoe while being carefully monitored by a
qualified archeologist. Overburden removed from
the blocks was hauled offsite by dump trucks. Test
units were hand-excavated by shovel skimming
and by trowel. All units were excavated in 10
centimeter thick levels, and sediment removed from
these levels was screened through Â¼-inch mesh
hardware cloth. A 1,000 cubic centimeters sediment
sample was collected from each level out of the
southwest corner of each unit to serve as a control
flotation sample. Features, when encountered, were
exposed in plan view and then bisected along their
longest axis. A flotation sample no larger than 10
liters was collected from each half of the bisected
feature. Soil humate samples were also collected
from beneath in situ burned rocks in features for

radiocarbon dating. Burned rock was sorted, counted,
and weighed according to material type in the field
and discarded. All other artifacts were collected and
bagged according to provenience. The methodology
included careful piece plotting of all artifacts, and the
systematic collection of notes, forms and photographs.
Charcoal and macrobotanical remains were collected
for potential identification and radiocarbon dating.
A comprehensive site map was created using
a Sokkia SET5F total data station with SDR33
Data Collector to record the limits of excavation,
location of features and artifacts, and the relative
topography of the site. Provenience on the site was
established through the use of a total data station
and laser level. Block and unit excavations were
mapped according to a permanent site datum.
Horizontal provenience within excavated units was
recorded using arbitrary datum points at the corner
of each unit. Vertical measurements were taken
with a laser level by hand to control the recovery
of material. The elevation of the laser level was
established at the onset of the testing excavations
and remained consistent throughout the project.
Collected materials were bagged according to type
and provenience. All data recovered from block
and unit excavations was recorded on standardized
forms and within a daily journal.
Photographs and maps were used to document
the machine and hand unit excavations. Unit and
feature plan views were photographed and mapped
at the base of each unit level. Feature, unit, and
trench profiles were photographed and mapped. All
photographs were taken using a Canon Rebel Digital
SLR camera at 3072 X 2048 (pixels) resolution.
A geomorphic study was undertaken to define
the major depositional units and relative sediment
ages of the terrace deposits. Representative trenches
were profiled and the sediment zones described according to a consistent terminology. Developing a
three-dimensional profile of sediment zones and relative ages was proposed utilizing radiocarbon ages
from charcoal and bulk humate samples developed
from the different stratigraphic zones within the
trenches. However, datable organic cultural material
was not identified in the trench profiles and the soil
humate samples were not dated due to the paucity
of cultural material at site. Geomorphic and archeological evaluation was conducted on the profiles of
all trenches to correlate the sequence of sediment
deposition to identified archeological zones.

Laboratory Methods and
Analyses
Upon completion of the fieldwork all collected
artifacts were temporarily curated at the laboratory
facilities of Hicks & Company. All collected artifacts were washed, counted, weighed, and sorted
based on type, material, and function. Analysis of
each artifact was limited to a macroscopic inspection augmented, in some cases, with a 10X hand
lens. Burned rocks identified on the site, in general,
were not collected but were counted, weighed, and
characterized by rock type and the degree of thermal
alteration in the field.
The artifacts brought to the lab were first
washed and dried to facilitate analysis. Once dry
the artifacts were then sorted into the following
broad categories: bone, mussel shell, chipped
stone, burned rock and unmodified lithic materials
including chert, limestone and fossilized mollusk
shell. Within each category, the artifacts were then
counted, weighed and any relevant metric information recorded on specimen inventory sheets. Specific
characteristics that were recorded for each artifact
class are noted in the appropriate section. Weight for
smaller samples were taken using a J-Scale CJ-300
scale with weights taken to the nearest tenth of a
gram. Because the J-Scale CJ-300 only measures
weights up to 300 grams, larger samples were
weighed on an Adams Equipment QT-2000. The
QT-2000 only weighs in grams, so all larger samples
are simply weighed to the nearest gram. All metric
measurements were taken using standard calipers
with measurements rounded to nearest millimeter.
Finally, all artifacts were labeled with the site trinomial and a lot number using Zig Millenium archival
ink coated with Acryloid B-72. Artifacts were then
bagged in 4-mil archival quality plastic bags with
identification tags printed on acid and lignin free
paper. All cultural artifacts with the exception of
burned rock will be permanently curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
Chipped stone artifacts were sorted into two general
categories and eventually placed into more specific
divisions based on form, function, or debitage type.
The two general categories that chipped stone artifacts will be separated into are Tools and Debitage
and are subdivided as follows:
In addition to the artifacts collected at the site,
soil and flotation samples were collected for dating

and the recovery of prehistoric floral or faunal
remains. Sediment samples collected from all subÂ­
sistence feature contexts and in columns collected
from all test units were subjected to flotation analyses
to confirm the presence or absence of associated
macrobotanical remains. Charred materials and
macrobotanical remains collected from discrete
feature contexts were subjected to radiocarbon
dating to determine socioâcultural affiliation,

and to define numbers of, the chronological
sequence of, and the presence/absence of individual
archeological components. Column samples
allowed the recovery of the very small fraction of
cultural and macrobotanical material, which is not
captured on the Â¼-inch, screens in the main test unit
excavations investigations. In addition, these column
samples serve as control specimens for comparing
feature and non-feature sediments.

cm3) was collected from each level out of the
southwest corner of each unit. Artifacts collected
or recorded from Block A included 43 lithics, one
tool (retouched flake), seven fossil mollusks, and
44 burned rocks (5.55 kg). The number of lithics
recovered from the units were evenly distributed
across the three units, however TU 3 contained the
bulk of the burned rock recovered from the block.
The distribution of artifacts by type and elevation
are presented in Tables 1-3.
A total of 21 sediment samples were collected
from Block A and floated in the laboratory. A total
of 19 burned and 11 unburned seeds, small charcoal
flecks, and burned earth were collected from the
light and heavy fraction of the sediment samples.
Because of the lack of clear feature associations
for the burned seeds recovered from Block A, the
material was not analyzed. Unburned seeds are not
commonly analyzed as potential food materials. The

As stated earlier, three machine-excavated
blocks (Blocks A, B, and E) were opened to provide for hand-excavated units (Figure 2). An additional four machine-excavated blocks (Blocks C,
D, F, and G), in the form of linear trenches, were
opened to explore the site limits and the stratigraphy of the site. A total of eight hand excavated
two meter by two meter (4 m2) units were placed
within Blocks A, B, and E, three (TU 1, TU 2, and
TU 3) in Block A, three (TU 4, TU 5, and TU 6)
in Block B, and two (TU 7 and TU 8) in Block E
(Plate 2). Cultural material collected or recorded
from the site included 325 lithics, six stone tools,
five bone fragments, 215 mussel shell fragments
(446.5 g), 1,047 fossil mollusk fragments (2.10
kg), and 4,869 fragments of burned rock (26.87
kg). A summary of the testing, by block, at the Site
41TV2162 is provided below.
Block A
Block A was 10 meters by 10
meters (100 m2) in size and was
machine-excavated to an elevation
of 99.13 meters (approximately 90
centimeters below ground surface
in this area). No cultural material
was observed during the excavation
of the block. Three two meter by
two meter (4 m2) hand excavated
units (TU 1, TU 2, and TU 3) were
placed at random within the block

levels were excavated in each
unit and a sediment sample (1000

recovery from the sediment samples is outlined in
Appendix B.
The cultural material recovered from Block A
appears to be an eastern expansion of the material
identified in Trench 15 during the initial survey of
the site. This cultural material is primarily concentrated between 99.05 meters and 98.45 meters in
elevation, a 60 centimeter zone approximately 90
to 150 centimeters below ground surface in this
area. Trench 15 contained a considerable amount of
cultural material, including 219 lithics, 1010 burned
rocks, a biface, and four burned rock features between 50 and 130 centimeters below ground surface.
Based on the distribution of artifacts within Block
A it appears that the cultural material across both
Block A and Trench 15 is sloping down from west
to east, although the cultural material in both areas
is within a Bt1 soil horizon. Due to the extremely
low density of cultural material compared to that
recovered from Trench 15, it is likely that the area
of Trench 15 represents the core activity area of this
component on the site. In addition, very little datable organic material in both Trench 15 and Block
A was recovered, all of which was recovered from
flotation in the form of burned or unburned seeds
and small charcoal flecks. There were no features
identified in Block A.
Block B
Block B was 10 meters by 10 meters (100 m2)
and was excavated south of Block A in an area
adjacent to Trench 12, which was excavated during
the initial survey. To ensure the safety of the block,
which was at 4.4 meters below ground surface, a 25
meter by 25 meter (625 m2) area was machine excavated and benched along the east and west sides of
the block (Figure 4, Plate 3; Tables 4-7). The north

and south ends of the block were ramped allowing
vehicle access to the block to remove overburden.
Block B was excavated to an elevation of 97.66
meters. This elevation was established as being 4.4
meters below the ground surface at the location of
Trench 12 within a Bt1 soil horizon. Three two meter by two meter (4 m2) hand excavated units (TU 4,
TU 5, and TU 6) were placed at random within the
block. A total of 45 lithics, two tools (retouched flake
and multidirectional core), five bone fragments, 18
fragments of fossil mollusks, and 60 burned rocks
(1.779 kg) were recovered from the three units. The
majority of the artifacts were recovered from TU 4,
which accounted for 32 lithics, two stone tools, five
bone fragments, 16 fossil mollusks, and 49 burned
rocks (1.522 kg). The material found in Block B was
concentrated between 97.66 meters and 97.28 meters
in elevation, approximately 440 to 480 centimeters
below ground surface in this area. In addition, five
charcoal samples were collected from TU 6. The
distribution of artifacts within Block B is outlined
in Tables 8-10. Sediment samples (1000 cm3) were
collected out of each level from the southwest corner
of each unit within Block B. A total of 10 samples
were collected and floated in the laboratory resulting
in the recovery of one unidentified seed and mostly
charcoal flecks out of the light and heavy fractions of
the sample. The recovery from the sediment samples
is outlined in Appendix B. There were no features
identified in Block B.
It was discovered after the excavation of Block
C, which established a long profile extending to
the north from Block B, that over 60 percent of the
Block B was located within a previous channel of
Onion Creek. This was not readily apparent during
the excavation of Block B as the southern edge of
the block lies within a transition zone between the
channel fill and the intact alluvial terrace sediments

Results of Investigations
to the south. Therefore, it was discovered that TU 5
and TU 6 were both within the channel fill portion of
Block B. This promulgated the excavation of Block
E to the south to more adequately assess the cultural
occupation in this portion of the site.
Block C
Block C consisted of a linear trench 50 meters
long extending north from the northern edge of
Block B to a point overlapping with Block A. The
depth of this trench varies below ground surface,
but its deepest point is at an elevation of 95.7
meters, approximately 5.5 meters below ground
surface in this area. The purpose of this trench was
to establish a profile of the stratigraphy between
Blocks A and B to ascertain whether there is an
association between the occupation identified in
Trenches 15 and 12 during the initial survey. This
hypothesis was presented based on the occurrence
of cultural material in both trenches within the Bt1
soil horizon and the possibility that the 2.5 meters
of colluvium identified in Trench 12 may account
for the extreme difference in depths of cultural
material below ground surface. Upon examination
of the profile it was discovered that a former
channel of Onion Creek, or later intrusive channel,
divides Blocks A and B and in fact overlaps the
majority of Block B. A single biface was recovered
during the excavation of Block C at an elevation
of 97.53 meters. No other cultural material was
observed within the block. No hand-excavated
units were placed within Block C.

33

Block D
Block D was a linear trench excavated north
and east of Block A to explore the northern limits
of the site. No hand-excavated units were placed in
this trench; however, a sample of the backfill was
screened at intervals during the trench excavations.
No cultural material was observed within Block D.
After benching the trench for safety the block was
26 meters long and 15 meters wide and excavated to
a depth of 5.2 meters below ground surface (94.32 m
in elevation; Plate 4). The profile was measured
near the center of the trench at its deepest point
and the descriptions of soils are outlined in Table
11. The soil profile of the trench shown on Plate
4 are arbitrary, however, with the exception of the
3C horizon all soil horizons generally paralleled
the ground surface. The dotted lines in the trench
profile represent the locations of benches in profile
excavated for trench safety.
Block E
Block E was excavated south of and adjacent to
Block B. Investigations were shifted to this area due
to the identification of cultural material during the
scraping of the Block B ramp on the south end of
the block. Prior to excavating this block the primary
goal was to remove the overburden to an elevation
of 97.66 meters (4.4 meters below ground surface),
the same elevation of Block B, and explore the
nature of the cultural material to the south. During
the excavation of the block, two concentrations of
cultural material were observed at an elevation of

98.22 meters (3.84 meters below ground surface).
Machine excavation was stopped and Block E was
established within the arbitrarily scraped area as a
six meter by nine meter block (54 m2). Two twometer by two-meter (4 m2) hand excavated units (TU
7 and TU 8) were placed within the block over the
two areas where cultural material was concentrated.
These two units and specifically TU 7 comprised approximately 96 percent of the total cultural material
recovered from the entire site. A total of 237 lithics,
three tools (two retouched flakes and one bifacial
core), 215 fragments of mussel shell (352.3g), 1,022
fragments of fossil mollusk, and 4,765 fragments of
burned rock (19.54 kg) were recovered or recorded
from Block E. The majority of these artifacts were
concentrated in and around Feature 6 in TU 7. The
burned rock recovered from Block E is predominantly burned chert that is shattered and spalled. Test
Unit 7 was excavated between an elevation of 98.14
meters and 97.87 meters (three levels). Excavation
in this unit ceased following thorough documentation of Feature 6 and repeated severe flooding of the
unit with water and sediment, which eventually filled
both of the units with sediment. Test Unit 8 was excavated to between an elevation of 98.22 meters and
97.77 meters (384-429 centimeters below ground

35

surfaceâfour levels) as a 4 square meter unit. Below
elevation 97.77 meters only the northeast quadrant
(1 m x 1 m) of TU 8 was excavated to an elevation
of 97.27 meters. The distribution of artifacts within
Block E is outlined in Tables 12 and 13.
Feature 6, the only feature identified during the
testing investigations, was a concentration of burned
rock (primarily burned chert and fossil mollusks)
and lithics in the center of TU 7 occurring between
97.97 meters and 97.77 meters in elevation, approximately 4.1 to 4.3 meters below ground surface in this
area (Figures 5 and 6, Plates 5 and 6). Material
recovered from Feature 6 consisted of 20 lithics, one
bone fragment, 62 fragments of mussel shell (123.5
g), 261 fragments of fossil mollusks, and 2,497 fragments of burned rock (10.36 kg; Table 14). Burned
rock recovered from Feature 6, as well as from TU 7
and TU 8, was predominantly chert with some fragments of calcite. No limestone or sandstone was observed. Charcoal was also prevalent within the feature
and several samples were collected, however Beta
Analytic indicated the charcoal is of a denuded nature
and more like soot than actual cohesive charcoal.
Two samples from the surrounding test unit at
an elevation of 97.94 meters (approximately 4.12
meters below ground surface) were dated as or-

ganic sediment fractions. These samples returned a
2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon age of 6650 to 6330
B.P. (Beta # 216656) and 6670 to 6410 B.P. (Beta
# 216657). The function of Feature 6 is unknown
based on the recovered cultural material, but may
represent either the remains of hearth or the refuse
from an adjacent hearth. A total of 11 sediment
samples were collected from the test units in Block
E and 5 sediment samples from Feature 6. Cultural
material from sediment sample processing consisted
of one unidentified seed from TU 8 and charcoal
flecks and larger charcoal samples from both unit
and feature contexts. The recovery from the sediment samples is outlined in Appendix B.
Block F
Block F was a linear trench, 51 meters long,
excavated south of the southern edge of Block B to
explore the southern limits of the site, and to locate
the bedrock contact point between the floodplain
and the adjacent upland. This trench was excavated
to an elevation of 97.1 meters at its deepest point,
approximately 4.97 meters below ground surface
in this area. A low density of cultural material
was observed during the excavation of this trench,
including a small concentration of artifacts on the
western bench of the block. Additional hand excavated units were going to target this concentration
of cultural material, however heavy rains flooded
the block and eroded the walls of the block before
formal documentation of these deposits could be
completed. Based on the observations made during
the excavations, it is evident the site does extend
south and east of Block E, however the density of
material is considerably lower in this portion of the
site compared to Block E. Block F also established
the bedrock contact at an elevation of 98.06 meters
and approximately 27 meters south of Block E.
Block F identified the sloping bedrock contact point
and established that only a small (4 x 6 m) area of
low density site deposits remains at the south end of
the site, within the right-of-way.
Block G
Block G was a small linear trench 9.5 meters
in length excavated to an elevation of 95.6 meters,
approximately 6.53 meters below ground surface
in this area. This trench was placed approximately

39

five meters west of Block E to explore the western
boundaries of the occupation in Block E. The trench
was oriented north to south due to the limited space
within the larger block. A very low density of cultural material was identified in this trench including
eight lithics between 99.4 meters and 98.9 meters in
elevation, approximately one meter above the cultural material in Block E. No features or additional
cultural material was identified in Block G.
The only diagnostic artifacts, excepting charcoal, recovered from the site were two projectile
point bases. Both of these point bases were found in
the vicinity of Blocks B and E within the overburden
removed during trench excavation. The overburden
where these points were found comes from the upper
two meters of sediment and is colluvium, or slope
wash, from the adjacent upland. The projectile point
bases were identified as a Martindale and Uvalde
point types, which both date to the Early Archaic.
Although these points are not in a reliable context
and have most likely been transported downhill from
the adjacent upland, comparing them to the radiocarbon dates from samples taken in Block E may
indicate a relationship between the occupation on
the hill and slope and the deeply buried occupation
that was targeted during testing.
Radiocarbon Dating
During the course of the Testing phase of
excavations at 41TV2162, 36 charcoal samples were
collected from both feature and general contexts
for radiocarbon dating (See Appendix A). In the
Hicks & Company laboratory these samples were
individually evaluated and all carbonized materials
separated as well as possible from the surrounding
matrix. In general, the samples were observed to
contain very little actual intact charcoal. Of these
samples, the most promising six were chosen for
AMS dating at Beta Analytic (Table 15). The
additional 30 samples were retained as backup
samples. The samples chosen for dating were all
from Test Units 7 and 8, where they were associated
with intact archeological Feature 6. After receiving
the radiocarbon samples, Beta Analytic contacted
Hicks & Company archeologists to report that after
initial processing they did not find any separable
charcoal present. The samples were sieved to <
180 microns in hopes of recovering some charred
material but any that was there broke down to âsootâ

sized particles and could not be recovered separately.
Two of the samples contained too little carbon to
be dated at all. As a result, those samples with
sufficient carbon were analyzed as acid washed
and sieved âorganic sedimentâ fractions. Organic
sediment fraction dating is potentially less precise
than dating individual carbonized materials because
of the uncertain provenance of the carbonized
material and the potential inclusion of organics in
the sample either at the time of deposition or from
subsequent intrusion. Nonetheless, these samples
are generally considered accurate in contexts
where no significant disturbance is anticipated.
Given the low organic recovery at the site in
general, the careful selection and separation of
the sample material both in the Hicks & Company
lab and at Beta Analytic, and the recovery of
the soot within the context of an intact hearth
feature, the integrity of the radiocarbon samples
was considered sufficient to justify dating. The
results of the radiocarbon dating fell within the 2
sigma calibrated period ranging from 6650-6310
B.P., with all samples overlapping at 6410 B.P.
These dates situate the occupation component in
Test Units 7 and 8 as dating to the latter end of
the Early Archaic. These Early Archaic dates that
were derived by the dating are in general agreement
with temporally diagnostic projectile points
found elsewhere on the site, providing secondary
evidence supporting the validity of the occupation
of 41TV2162 during this period.
Summary
Based on the results of the survey and testing, it
is apparent that there are four separate components
to the site. These four components are delineated
on Plate 2, which appears earlier in this chapter.
The first two are the historic (Component 1) and

2 Sigma Date

prehistoric (Component 2) components, located on
the surface both on the floodplain and on the upland
ridge (Plate 2). The historic component is limited
to the upland ridge only and consisted of 22 pieces
of glass, three ceramics, and 12 pieces of metal
recovered from shovel testing. The upland ridge is
heavily overgrazed and littered with modern trash in
the vicinity of the structures. The mixed assemblage
(prehistoric, historic, and modern) and deflated nature of the landform had left this portion of the site
with very poor integrity.
Component 2 represents the upper prehistoric
occupation at the site. This occupation covers the
entire site area (Plate 2). Due to the severe argilliturbation on the site, all artifacts recovered from
shovel testing were included within the surface
component. A total of 89 lithics, 11 burned rock,
two informal tools, and one core comprised the
total recovered artifacts from shovel testing within
this component during the survey investigations. In
addition, several hundred artifacts were observed
on the surface on the upland ridge, its slope and
the adjacent floodplain. This component is within
a poor environment for organic preservation and
no associated features or diagnostic artifacts were
found within the component. It was the opinion of
the Principal Investigator that the artifacts within
this component are out of context and have a poor
integrity. Components 1 and 2 were both dismissed
by TxDOT and the TSHPO subsequent to survey and
were not subject to further investigations.
Component 3 is the prehistoric occupation in
Block A and Trench 15. This component was identified at the survey level by four burned rock features
(Features 1, 2, 3, and 4), several artifacts, consisting
of 1,010 burned rock, 219 lithics, one biface, no
diagnostics, and poor organic preservation between
an elevation of 99.45 meters and 98.35, approximately 50 to 160 centimeters below ground surface.

Results of Investigations
The vast majority of identified materials from this
component were recovered from Trench 15 during
the survey phase of the project. The testing phase in
Block A resulted in a low density of cultural material
(43 lithics, one tool, seven fossil mollusks, and 44
burned rocks) and no features. The boundaries of
this component are defined by the negative recovery
and lack of associated cultural material to the north,
west, and east in survey Trenches 11 and 14 and testing Blocks C and D. The southern boundary of this
component is the remnant stream channel identified
in Block B (Plate 2).
The area around Block B and E represents Component 4 of the site at an elevation of 98.07 meters to
97.28 meters, approximately 400 to 480 centimeters
below ground surface in this area. This component
is characterized by a single concentration of burned
rock and associated scatter of artifacts (Feature 6),
consisting of several thousand pieces of burned and
shattered chert, charcoal, lithics, and mussel shell,
no diagnostics, and moderate organic preservation.
Radiocarbon dates from charcoal recovered from
Feature 6 place this component within the Early
Archaic period of central Texas. The density of
this occupation drops off considerably in Blocks F
and G, however it is likely that this component of
the site extends further east beyond the edge of the
right-of-way. The site boundaries of Component 4
are defined by the negative or low recovery from
survey Trench 13 and Block G to the west and the
remnant stream channel to the north. To the south,
the site is bound by the bedrock contact of the upland ridge and to the east by the right-of-way edge,
to which investigations were limited (Plate 2).
Block F identified the sloping bedrock contact point
and established that only a small (4 x 6 meter) area
of low density site deposits remains at the south end
of the site, within the right-of-way.
The remnant stream channel of Onion Creek
divides the two buried prehistoric components
(Components 3 and 4) between Blocks A and B
and is the primary argument for attributing these
deposits to separate occupations. However, it is
also possible that the components in Blocks A and
B are associated. Overall the site area within the
right-of-way exhibits poor to moderate organic
preservation, a lack of in situ diagnostic artifacts
such as tools or projectile points, and a low density
of cultural material in all but Test Unit 7. Although
five features were identified on the site (including

41

survey), the poor organic preservation and lack of
diagnostic artifacts within the features prohibits
a clear association between the three prehistoric
components.
Artifact Analysis and
Summary
The testing phase of investigation at 41TV2162
recovered a small collection of faunal material and
lithic tools and debitage as well as a large quantity
of heat shattered chert. Generally speaking the artifacts indicate that the area tested at 41TV2162 had a
low density of artifacts associated with the occupation. This section provides a descriptive overview
of the artifacts recovered and a discussion of the
implications of the contextual analysis of the collection for understanding site type and technology
associated with the site occupation. The subsequent
sections present the results of the analysis of each
of the following artifact classes: faunal material
and lithic tools and debris. This includes both the
raw data collected during the analysis as well as
a discussion of any trends in style, distribution, or
type present in the collection and its implications
for our understanding site type and technology of
the inhabitants.
Faunal Materials

A small collection of bone and a more sizable
collection of mussel shell were recovered in the
course of the excavation of the test units. All bone
was counted and weighed. Mussel shell fragments
were weighed, but only the umbos of the specimens
were counted owing to the high rate of exfoliation
and generally poor condition of the shell.
Bone
The total recovery of bone amounted to six
pieces weighing 0.3 grams. All of the bone consisted
of small, poorly preserved fragments with surfaces
that were heavily exfoliated. None of the fragments
possessed diagnostic attributes that would permit the
identification of the species beyond the level of unidentified vertebrate. Because of the very small sample
size and the poor state of preservation, the recovered
bone was not subjected to specialized analysis.

42

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

The highest concentration of bone consisted
of five very small and poorly preserved fragments
weighing 0.2 grams that were recovered in Block B,
Test Unit 4, Level 2 (97.56-97.46 meters). Recovered
in association with the bone were lithic debitage and
burned rock, but no features were identified.
A single very small bone fragment (0.1 gram)
was recovered from Block E, Test Unit 6 within
the burned rock concentration designated Feature
6 (97.87-97.77 meters). Although recovered in
association with a burned rock feature, a single
poorly preserved piece of bone cannot provide
sufficient data from which to either determine the
function of Feature 6 nor the nature of any associated activities.
Mussel Shell
Mussel shell was the most common type of faunal
material to be recovered. In total 352.3 grams of fragmented shell were recovered. Of this, 61 pieces were
umbos. A basic minimum number of 31 individuals
can be formulated by taking the total umbo count
and dividing it by two. Though the fragmented state
of the mussel shell in the collection makes species
identification difficult, comparison of the specimens
with examples in The Freshwater Mussels of Texas
(Howells et al. 1996) suggest they are all likely Texas
pimplebacks (Quadrula houstonensis; Ibid.:119).
Today these mussels occur in the Guadalupe and Colorado River Systems in mud or gravel, either shallowly
in faster flowing river systems or more deeply (0.5-1.0
meters) in slow moving waters (Ibid.:119-120). The
recovery of these types of mussels at 41TV2162 may
indicate similar stream or river conditions in the vicinity of the site during the Early Archaic.
The most interesting aspect of the mussel shell
collection is the spatial restriction of its recovery to
Block E, Test Units 7 and 8. Test Units 7 and 8 are
contiguous, and within Unit 7 is Feature 6, a burned
rock feature. Though speculative, the recovery of
the mussel shell in relation with the evidence for a
hot rock-cooking device strongly suggests that part
of what was being processed were mussels. Mussel
shell can be opened and cooked by both boiling and
steaming/grilling. Given the recovery of shattered
chert FCR as the primary cooking stone, it seems
most likely that the type of cooking being carried
out here would have been grilling or baking.

Discussion
The limited amount of faunal material and lack
of strong contextual associations restricts what can
be said about the subsistence practices of the Early
Archaic inhabitants of 41TV2162. Clearly protein
was derived from multiple sources. Proportionally,
fresh water mussel seems to have been an important
resource for the site and it was processed using heat
rock cooking devices. The small recovery of bone
does, however, indicate at least some small-scale
hunting was occurring.
Lithic Tools and Debris
The lithic tools and debris recovered during
the testing excavations included five bifaces and
biface fragments, two projectile points, four edge
modified flakes and 316 pieces of debitage. Metric
data on all lithic tools is provided in Appendix C.
The most common lithic artifact recovered was
burned rock. This burned rock was primarily heatshattered chert of poor quality, though limestone
and fossilized mollusk were also present. Aside
from noting the preponderance of the burned rock
as a type of artifact present in the site collection, no
additional analysis of this material will be provided
in this section.
Projectile Points
Two stemmed projectile points (Unique Items
131 & 146), both Early Archaic dart point forms,
were collected during the testing phase of excavations (Figure 7). In both cases, the dart points were
not recovered from the formal excavation units,
but from back dirt piles that accumulated during
the mechanical removal of the overburden in order
to expose the excavation blocks. Projectile point
Unique Item 146 matches the type description for
Martindale darts (Turner and Hester 1999:151-152).
Unique Item 131 most closely matches the type
description of a Uvalde style point (Lot 131; Turner
and Hester 1999:191). Both types have been consistently associated with deposits of an age comparable
to those at 41TV2162, and the radiocarbon dates
obtained from contexts in the excavation units
and recovery of these projectile point types in the
surrounding deposits mutually reinforce the Early
Archaic age of the site deposits.

right) Uvalde-like (UI#131), Martindale (UI#146).

Bifaces and Biface Fragments
Two complete bifaces and three biface fragÂ­
ments were recovered during the excavations. One
of the bifaces and the three biface fragments were
collected from the backdirt outside of the excavation
units. These artifacts consist of a Stage 2 biface
(Unique Item 145), two Stage 2 biface proximal

43

fragments (Unique Items 130 and 152), and an
indeterminate stage biface fragment that appears to
have been reworked into a possible drill (Unique Item
147). Metric attributes are provided in Appendix
C. Because they lack clear provenience, no further
discussion of these artifacts will be provided.
Only Unique Item 114 was recovered from an in
situ excavation context. Unique Item 114 is a large
Stage 1 biface recovered in Block C at an elevation
of 97.5 meters (Figure 8). It was manufactured from
a chert cobble with a pocked cortex, which still covers approximately 40 percent of the artifact. The
material is medium grained grey-brown chert with
clear quartz occlusions. This artifact has large flakes
removed bifacially from about 60 percent of the
cobble circumference, leaving a very sinuous edge
in the area of flake removals. Many of the flake scars
terminate abruptly due to flaws in the material. One
large âflakeâ scar is very angular and looks recent,
and might have occurred as a result of being struck
by the backhoe during excavation. One knapped face
has some form of brown precipitate adhering to the
surface. The poor quality of chert and occlusions

44

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

seem likely reason artifact is discarded. Evidence for
possible use wear is present in the form of crushing
along the edges, but this may also be a result of platform preparation.
Edge Modified Flakes
âEdge modified flakeâ is used as a descriptive
cover term to categorize all flakes that exhibit modification to the edges that appears to be a result of
usage or the intentional retouching of the edge. Four
artifacts were recovered during the excavations that
were assigned to this category (Figure 9).
One lateral edge has tiny flakes removed from
both sides, seemingly the result of use-wear, though
most heavily on the side with an approximately a 40
degree edge angle.
Unique Item 110-1 is a roughly rectangular edge
modÂ­ified flake that exhibits use-wear on three edges.
This artifact is a secondary flake with a well-defined
platform. The distal end has several small parallel
flakes removed from the dorsal face suggesting it
has been utilized and possibly retouched, perhaps
to remove the cortex. Both lateral edges have tiny
flakes removed as a probable consequence of usage.
Modification is primarily on the dorsal face with the
exception of one tiny nick on the ventral face of one
lateral edge.
Unique Item 133-1 is an oval shaped large,
thick tertiary flake with a single flake removal near
the distal end of the flake. The flake removal leaves
a small concavity 1.6 centimeters wide with minor
edge damage on the dorsal side likely indicative of
use a scraping or cutting tool, but this may be the
result of a flake removal. The material is a medium
grain tan chert with an area of finer grain material
in area of the said flake removal.
Unique Item 133-2 is a thick flake that has subsequent crude flake removals from both lateral and
distal edges in a bifacial manner. It is possible that
this artifact is a flake that was considered for bifacial
reduction, but subsequently abandoned, but perhaps
utilized for some expedient task. Some faint white
banding on the surface may be patination, or may be
natural chert variation. Of note is a concavity created
on one edge by a flake removal that is 1.6 centimeters
wide and very similar to that observed on Unique
Item 133-1 recovered from the same unit and level.
Though small in number, edge modified flakes
recovered during the testing excavations indicate that

Figure 9. Edge modified flakes (from left to right) 110-1,
133-1, 133-2, and 95-1.

at least some tasks were performed using expedient
flake tools. The recovery of two edge modified
flakes from Level 3 in Test Unit 8 in association with
Feature 6 may be indicative of their application to
activities associated with this burned rock feature.
Cores
Cores are pieces of lithic material that exhibit
indicators of utilization, but only exhibit evidence
of negative flake scars, indicating flake removal.
Cores are understood to have served primarily as
parent material for the production of other lithic
tool forms and flakes, though many show evidence
as having been utilized as chopping or battering
tools. Though cores can be considered a form of
debitage, their use and the types of cores present
on a site can provide insight into site function and
local technological practice.
Only one artifact identified as a core was recovered during the excavations (Figure 10). Unique
Item 110-2 is a river cobble that was has been
knapped such that it is a multidirectional core with
one face still covered in cortex. Eight flake scars are
visible on the surface of the artifact and they average approximately three centimeters in length and
2.3 centimeters in width. Flake removals are poor
due to the material having poor knapping qualities
and poor flake quality seems the primary reason the
artifact was discarded.
A single artifact is not sufficient to make much
comment regarding the nature of core technology
at the site as a whole. It can be stated that from
this single example we have evidence that a core
technology was employed and that lithic resources

were either collected from locations near the site or
were transported to the site in a minimally worked
fashion. However, the lack of significant amounts of
primary and secondary debitage in the test units, and
the lack of much debitage in general, would seem to
suggest that core reduction was not a primary activity at the site. Rather core reduction may have been
a relatively expedient activity related to particular
needs such as the production of flakes for applications in various situations.
Debitage
In this analysis debitage is understood to encompass all byproducts of lithic production. The
analysis was structured toward a batch as opposed
to individual flake analysis (Carr and Bradbury
2001:134), and was explicitly aimed at providing
basic information concerning the density of debitage
on site and the most basic information concerning
the types of behaviors it represents. To facilitate the
analysis, flakes were divided into four categories
based on a limited set of attributes. The specimens in
each group were then counted and weighed and the
information entered into the project database files.
The categories are as follows. The first were complete flakes that were then subsorted by the amount

of dorsal cortex into Primary (100%), Secondary
(99-1%), and Tertiary (0%) flakes. Broken flakes were
a separate category and all specimens placed into this
group were organized by the portion of a flake they
represented: proximal, medial, distal, or longitudinal.
A third category was indeterminate shatter. This category served as a catchall group for pieces of chert
that were clearly fractured from the results of direct
human action but were not burned and did not possess
any standard flake attributes such as bulbs of percussion or platforms. For the most part these represent
angular and wedge shaped chunks of chert.
All chert that was clearly burned and heat fractured were grouped as Heat Shatter. This category
did not include flakes that exhibit evidence of heat
treatment. Rather this category consisted solely of
pieces that were potlidded or crazed and lacked
any regular flake attributes. For the purposes of this
analysis heat shatter is not considered a part of the
chipped stone tool technology of the site inhabitants,
but rather a byproduct of the use of chert as a source
of cook stone.
The debitage collected from 41TV2162
amounted to 315 pieces. The analysis of the debitage
was complicated by the presence of a large amount
of fractured chert that resulted from the heating of
chert cobbles in rock oven features, especially in

46

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

Block E. Though most burned rock was identified
and quantified in the field, a significant amount
nonetheless was sent to the lab for sorting. In the
lab, analyzing this material presented the problem
of having to separate legitimate, intentionally
knapped flakes and debris from the 4,186 pieces of
exploded chert that often exhibited morphological
characteristics typical of debitage. In other words,
it presented something of a correlate to the Infinite
Monkey Theorem: If multiple chert cobbles explode
at random, eventually they will create a flake
in the typology. In some cases it was relatively
straightforward to discount the burned chert that
exhibited wild angles, extensive potlidding or crazing.
Other pieces, however, were not so readily selfevident. As a result, in these units a fairly conservative
approach was taken that emphasized only identifying
as debitage those flakes that clearly demonstrated a
platform or bulb of percussion or were unburned. The
idea of identifying the types of angular shatter often
recovered in debitage assemblages was quickly found
to be nearly impossible because too many pieces were
equivocal as to their assignment. Was that blocky
piece of chert a piece of heat shatter, a piece of shatter
from the knapping of a heated chert cobble, or was it
shatter that was heated?
Of the collected debitage, 101 pieces were whole
flakes. Of these examples, only one flake from Block
E, Test Unit 8, Level 3 (97.97-97.87 meters) was a
primary flake with full cortical coverage on the dorsal face. Of the remainder of the collection, 30 were
secondary flakes and 70 tertiary flakes. The most
common piece of debitage was indeterminate shatter,
with 157 pieces (168.5 grams) collected. In addition
to whole flakes, 54 broken flakes were recovered.
Twenty-nine of the broken flakes (43.1 grams) were
distal fragments. Six of the broken flakes (2.7 grams)
were medial fragments. Nineteen of the broken flakes
(26.1 grams) were proximal fragments.
The whole flakes show a distinct pattern in the
frequency of primary, secondary and tertiary types.
As noted above, only one primary flake was recovered. The remaining 100 flakes were overwhelming
tertiary flakes (n=70/69%) and secondary flakes
(n=30/30%). While it is typical for assemblages
with lithic reduction activities to have proportionally
higher secondary and tertiary flakes, the assemblage
collected from the test units at 41TV2162 is much
skewed toward the latter two categories. Such a
pattern most likely signals that lithic reduction

activities, at least in the areas tested, were restricted
in nature to flake production from prepared cores
or tool performs. As Pecora (2001) illustrates in his
discussion of debitage density, reduction junctures,
and occupation intensity, the types and quantities
of debitage associated with particular sites is highly
contingent on the spatial organization of lithic technology. Sites where the full reduction process occurs
will by their nature have the highest density of debitage as well as a more diverse debitage assemblage,
whereas those in which only the latter stages of tool
finishing or refurbishing are expected to have a low
debitage density as well as a higher relative number
of small flakes, particularly tertiary flakes. This latter scenario appears to hold for 41TV2162.
We can thus deduce from the lithic collection the
likelihood that lithic production was derived from
one of two possible paths. The first path is that the
debitage was generated from core reduction for the
production of flakes to use as tools from previously
prepared cores. The four flakes that were recovered
showing clear edge modification were all secondary
or tertiary flakes. Their partial to zero cortex coverage is presumed to be the result of previous steps to
remove cortex from cobbles to create platforms for
removing subsequent flakes. The only core recovered (Unique Item 110-2) clearly demonstrates that
removal of cortex was a necessary aspect of a lithic
technology that utilized cobbles. Some authors have
suggested that within an assemblage the presence of
broken flakes can function as an indicator of core
or biface reduction, with the assumption that higher
broken flakes and shatter are associated with a core
technology as opposed to one focused more on
bifaces (Sullivan and Rozen 1985; Prentiss 2001).
Clearly shatterâthe most common debitage type
recoveredâis a large component of the debitage
assemblage at this site, and this observation can be
provisionally interpreted as pointing to, along with
the edge modified flakes and core, an orientation in
the lithic technology toward core reduction by the
site inhabitants.
The second path that these flakes could have
been generated by is through the process of biface
production. There are examples of Stage 1 and
Stage 2 bifaces present on site. Assuming that the
tools are manufactured by either reducing cobbles
or reducing flakes from cobbles, the debitage may
be the byproduct of a biface production sequence.
The lack of primary flakes, however, would suggest

Results of Investigations
that initial reduction was happening off site, perhaps
in a nearby lithic âquarryâ, and that this site is a
later stage reduction juncture (Pecora 2001) in the
life of a biface. Proportionally, tertiary flakes are
far more abundant, suggesting it is primarily later
stage reduction that is occurring. In summary, the
debitage assemblage taken in concert with the tool
assemblage can be interpreted to indicate that both
biface and flake production were occurring on site,
and that this production was based on the utilization
of chert cobbles which were likely to have undergone
initial stages of preparation elsewhere.
Discussion
The information presented by the small debitage
and tool collections suggests that tool manufacture
was not an activity given particular emphasis by
the inhabitants of 41TV2162. The presence of a
single core and primarily secondary and tertiary
flakes indicate that some flake production was being
conducted, but that the early stages of biface or core
reduction were likely carried out off site. Second, the
overall lithic tool assemblage does not appear to be
specialized. The tools recovered were bifaces and
biface fragments and edge modified flakes. Bifaces
are ubiquitous in central Texas archeological sites

47

and can function in a variety of contexts. Edge
modified flakes, also ubiquitous, represent a simple
and expedient tool type that has many possible
functional applications. Activities related to the
use of lithic technology during the Early Archaic
occupation of 41TV2162 thus appear focused on
bifacial tool maintenance and finishing and flake
tool production.
Based on the patterns of lithic recovery observed
in the 41TV2162 testing collections, lithic resource
utilization at the site appears focused on the collection
of chert cobbles for use as heating elements for stone
cooking features. These materials were collected from
either exposed gravels on the hill slope or possibly
from the Onion Creek streambed. Though primarily
of poor quality chert cobbles, the co-occurrence of
fossilized shell and other stone types is interesting in
the sense that collection of burned rock feature stone
does not seem to have been highly discriminatory,
but rather interested in bulk collection. If collection
was being conscientiously undertaken it stands to
reason that the assemblage would show some bias
in the collection, but it does not. In contrast, a lithic
material bias is indicated in the lithic tools and
debitage. These artifacts clearly show a preference
for finer grain materials for lithic tool manufacture,
presumably owing to the inherently superior flaking
characteristics of finer grained chert.

Conclusions and Recommendations

Survey and testing of the buried components at
41TV2162 combined yielded a total of five features
in an estimated 8,360 cubic meters of hand and machine excavated sediment (three excavation blocks,
four trenches, and eight test units) and no significant
evidence of organic preservation or diagnostic artifacts. As a result of these investigations a total of four
archeological components were identified on the site.
The first two components are the historic (Component
1) and prehistoric (Component 2) components located
on the ground surface on the floodplain and on the
upland ridge. Both of these components as defined
within the Additional Properties of SH 130 were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
as a result of the survey investigations.
The historic component is limited to the upland ridge only and consisted of 22 pieces of glass,
three ceramics, and 12 pieces of metal recovered
from shovel testing. The upland ridge is heavily
overgrazed and littered with modern trash in the
vicinity of the structures. The mixed assemblage
(prehistoric, historic, and modern) and deflated nature of the landform had left the site with very poor
integrity. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that the historic archeological component on the
site does not contain significant deposits that would
contribute to the eligibility of Site 41TV2162.
Component 2 represents the upper prehistoric
occupation at the site. The surface distribution of
prehistoric artifacts defines the overall site boundaries within the SH 130 right-of-way. Due to the severe
argilliturbation on the site, all artifacts recovered
from survey and shovel testing were also included
within the surface component. A total of 89 lithics,
11 burned rocks, two informal tools, and one core
comprised the total recovered artifacts from shovel
testing within this component. In addition, several

hundred artifacts were observed on the surface on
the upland ridge, its slope and the adjacent floodplain. This component is within a poor environment
for organic preservation and no associated features
or diagnostic artifacts were found within the component. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator
that the artifacts within this component are out of
context, have a poor integrity, and do not contribute
to the eligibility of Site 41TV2162.
Component 3 is the prehistoric occupation in
Block A and Trench 15, located between an elevation
of 99.45 meters and 98.35, approximately 50 to 160
centimeters below ground surface. This component
was identified during the survey by four burned rock
features (Features 1, 2, 3, and 4) and non-diagnostic
artifacts including 1,010 burned rocks, 219 lithics,
one biface, and poor organic preservation. Features
1, 2, and 4 were small burned rock scatters with
no discernible function and Feature 3 was a dense
concentration of burned rock. All four features
were poorly preserved with less than 0.1 grams of
total charcoal recovered from Features 1, 2, and 3.
The vast majority of identified materials from this
component were recovered from Trench 15 during
the survey phase of the project. The testing phase
in Block A resulted in the recovery of a low density
of cultural material (43 lithics, one tool, seven fossil mollusks, and 44 burned rocks) and no features.
The boundaries of this component are defined by the
negative recovery and lack of associated cultural material to the north, west, and east in survey Trenches
11 and 14 and testing Blocks C and D (Plate 2). The
southern boundary of this component is the remnant
stream channel identified in Block B. In survey and
testing combined, a total of 241.3 cubic meters of
hand and machine excavated sediment within Component 3 yielded four poorly preserved features and

49

50

Eligibility Testing of Site 41TV2162 Travis County, Texas

a low density scatter of artifacts. Based on the lack
of organic remains sufficient for analysis or dating, a
low density of cultural material, a lack of diagnostic
artifacts, and poorly preserved features it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that this component
does not contain elements that would contribute to
the NRHP eligibility of Site 41TV2162.
The area around Block B and E represents the
fourth component of the site located at an elevation
of 98.07 meters to 97.28 meters, approximately 400
to 480 centimeters below ground surface in this area.
This component is characterized by a single concentration of burned rock (Feature 6) and associated
scatter of non-diagnostic artifacts, consisting of several thousand pieces of burned and shattered chert,
charcoal, lithics, bone, mussel shell, and moderate
organic preservation. The density of this occupation
drops off considerably in Blocks F and G, however it
is likely that this component of the site extends farther east, beyond the edge of the right-of-way. This
low density scatter of artifacts and single feature
(Feature 6) in Component 4, were recorded within
82.6 cubic meters of hand and machine excavated
sediment. The site boundaries of Component 4 are
defined by the negative or low recovery from survey
Trench 13 and Block G to the west and the remnant
stream channel to the north. To the south, the site
is bound by the bedrock contact of the upland ridge
and to the east by the right-of-way edge, to which
investigations were limited. Block F identified the
sloping bedrock contact point and established that
only a small (4 x 6 meter) area of low density site
deposits remains at the south end of the site, within
the right-of-way.
Dates recovered from collected radiocarbon
samples in Feature 6 consistently fall within the
2-sigma calibrated period ranging from 6650-6310
B.P., with all samples overlapping at 6410 B.P.
(mean date). Six radiocarbon samples were submitted and only four contained enough carbon for
dating. However, the four radiocarbon samples
submitted for dating did not contain enough intact
charcoal for dating and therefore, organic sediment
dates were obtained by submitting the entire sample
(sediment and soot) for AMS dating. Although the
four sample dates all occur within a 340 year period
it should be noted that dating of the combined soot
and organic sediment may not produce the most accurate dates due to the potential for contamination
from intrusive organics such as roots.

Radiocarbon dating of Feature 6 possibly
indicated a relatively narrow time interval of occupation during a poorly understood period of the
Early Archaic, but a very low density of artifacts, no
diagnostic artifacts, and no other meaningful organic
associates (charred plant remains). Although the materials are present within an isolated, undisturbed occupation zone and may represent a relatively narrow
time interval, the density of associated artifacts does
not contribute to an understanding of the artifact distributional patterning and thus, artifact discard behavior. Many charred lithic fragments were found in
the feature, heavily burned, but there were very few
artifacts around the feature to contribute to an understanding of the distributional patterning. The feature
was essentially in isolation with limited organic remains and no diagnostic associations. Furthermore,
these materials were present in a very restricted area
of the Additional Property in which virtually all of
the archeological deposits in the right-of-way were
explored. Additional intact, important Early Archaic
site deposits may be present to the east on private
property outside of the SH 130 right-of-way. It is the
opinion of the Principal Investigator that the Early
Archaic component (Component 4) does not contain
significant archeological deposits within the SH 130
right-of-way that would contribute to the eligibility
of Site 41TV2162.
The elevations of the two buried prehistoric
components (Components 3 and 4) differ by approximately 30 centimeters. However, these two
components are divided by a remnant stream channel identified in the profile of Blocks B and C and
are likely the remains of different occupations based
on the separate geomorphic contexts. In addition,
artifacts identified in Block A are distributed vertically over a range of 110 centimeters and artifacts in
Blocks B and E are distributed vertically over a range
of approximately 80 centimeters, and the broad vertical distribution of artifacts could be associated with
multiple occupations. However, another argument
can be made for artifact transport via argilliturbation
and pedoturbation. Pedoturbation and argilliturbation
at the site would be the result of soil creep and soil
expansion/shrinking at the contact between upland
soils and the underlying alluvial sediments essentially recycling sediments allowing for the movement
of clasts within the horizon. Feature 6 is an exception
to this as the distribution of cultural materials within
the feature appears to be intact.

Geomorphic Evaluation and Site Stratigraphy
The results of the analysis of the artifacts from
Component 4 at 41TV2162 provide data that can be
used to infer some of the activities associated with
the site and the basic technology of the inhabitants.
The paucity of faunal material limits what can be
said about the subsistence practices of the Early
Archaic inhabitants of 41TV2162. The recovery
of mollusk shell and animal bone indicate that
the collection of a variety of foods was occurring.
Though a lack of macrobotanical evidence makes
ascertaining the role of vegetal foodstuffs difficult,
they would have presumably been utilized. Given
the presence of a burned rock feature, it seems likely
these resources were also being prepared as well
as consumed on site. The information presented
by the small debitage and tool collections suggests
that lithic tool manufacture was not an activity given
particular emphasis by the inhabitants of 41TV2162.
The lithic assemblage consists primarily of the
remains of late stage tool production and is not particularly specialized. The presence of a single core
and primarily secondary and tertiary flakes indicate
that some flake production was being conducted, but
that the early stages of biface or core reduction were
likely carried out off site. Moreover, lithic resource
utilization at the site appears focused on the collection of chert cobbles for use as heating elements
for stone cooking features. The use of primarily
chert within Feature 6 is relatively unique and may
provide new information for a poorly documented
time frame, but the poor sample size (lack of other
related features and no diagnostic artifacts) and poor
preservation within the feature limits the research
potential of the site within the Additional Properties.
The combined faunal and lithic assemblages suggest the site was a short-term campsite where both
vertebrate and molluscan resources were collected,
processed and consumed. Overall, the low recovery
of artifacts seems to indicate that this component of
the site was not a site of intensive, long-term occupation. Rather it would appear to have been occupied
briefly and abandoned.
Overall, the portions of Site 41TV2162 within
the Additional Properties lack a sufficient sample size
to allow the investigators to come to any definitive
conclusions with regard to the overall site function,
subsistence, preservation, or cultural history. An
estimated 4 x 6 meter area of sediments abutting the
sloping bedrock contact at the eastern edge of the site
and the eastern edge of the right-of-way is all that

51

remains unsampled in the oldest component. Feature
6 represents a potentially unique feature within the
archeological record of the Early Archaic in central
Texas, however, without comparable features across
the site, it is difficult to determine the behavior associated with this feature. In addition to the small
sample size, organic preservation on the site is poor to
moderate. Of the 36 radiocarbon samples collected in
the field, only four of these were sufficient for dating
and these samples were determined to be soot rather
than charred plant material.
Although the archeological record for the Early
Archaic period in central Texas is far from complete,
the potential for additional substantive data from
41TV2162 is low. The research potential for the
portions of Site 41TV2162 within the Additional
Properties has, in all likelihood, been exhausted.
In addition, where the archeological record for the
Early Archaic is deficient is with sites that have
well-preserved macrobotanical remains in feature
contexts. Site 41TV2162 lacks substantive botanical remains and they are poorly preserved across
the site. So, the single Early Archaic feature and
component lacking significant organic remains and
diagnostic artifacts does not represent new or unique
information with regard to the archeological record
within the Additional Property.
Although the portions of Site 41TV2162 within
the Additional Properties lack significant deposits,
it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that
the site extends to the east of Block E beyond the
edge of the SH 130 right-of-way. The areas east of
and adjacent to the SH 130 right-of-way should be
thoroughly investigated prior to any future ground
disturbing activities if they are subject to the TAC
or the NHPA.
After applying the research questions to the
results of the testing investigations, the Principal
Investigator concluded that Site 41TV2162 within
the Additional Properties does not contain significant archeological deposits that are unique to the
archeological record of central Texas. Furthermore,
the archeological deposits on Site 41TV2162 within
the Additional Properties failed to meet the NRHP
criteria of significance (36 CFR 60.4) and the SAL
qualifications (13 TAC 26.8). Although additional
investigations to the east of the SH 130 right-ofway may provide further insight into the function
and structure of the site, those areas were outside
of the scope of the current project and not subject

52

to the NHPA or the TAC. Therefore, the Principal
Investigator recommended that the portions of Site
41TV2162 within the Additional Properties are not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no ad-

ditional archeological investigations were warranted
for the site within the Additional Properties. TxDOT
and the THC concurred with this recommendation
on June 20, 2006.

Appendix A 59
During the course of the testing phase of excavations at 41TV2162, 36 samples were collected from
both feature and general contexts for radiocarbon dating (Tables A-1 and A-2). Of these samples, six were
chosen for AMS dating at the Beta Analytic and 30 were retained as backup samples.
Selection Methodology
In the field, C-14 samples identified in intact contexts were mapped on level forms and maps and a C-14
sample form completed. Samples were assigned both individual bag numbers and a C-14 sample number by
the field crews. Samples were then collected with a trowel, often being retained in the surrounding matrix
to minimize unintentional destruction of the sample. Samples were then placed in 4mm acid free curation
bags for transport to the Hicks & Company lab.
C-14 samples that were delivered to the Hicks & Company lab from the field, had all provenience
information pertaining to the sample - including the Bag # and Sample # - recorded in a Microsoft ExcelÂ®
spreadsheet. Each sample was then transferred from its original field bag and placed in a 4mil acid free curation bag. The sample was weighed to the nearest tenth of gram and the weight recorded in the database. A
bag tag was created for each sample and placed with the sample. Samples were then allowed to temporarily
remain open to permit any excess moisture to evaporate and prevent mold growth.
C-14 samples selected for dating were treated in the following manner. Each sample was examined
under a 10X magnification illuminated diopter lens. The sample contents were sorted based on their size,
apparent structure and lack of adhered matrix. By structure it is meant that they exhibited preserved grain
or vascular structures indicative of carbonized wood. Once the sample had been sorted, the largest pieces
and all that exhibited evidence of intact structure were selected and weighed, packaged in aluminum foil
and shipped to the Beta Analytic for AMS dating. At the time that samples were submitted for analysis,
an identification number was assigned to each sample following Beta Analyticâs guidelines. The remaining samples were archived for future study if necessary. The following six samples were selected for
radiometric dating and sent to Beta Analytic in two batches: Lots 118-14, 118-16, 118-9, 134-1, 136-5,
and 136-11.
Results
After receiving the first batch of radiocarbon samples, Beta Analytic contacted Hicks & Company archeologists to inform them that the material sent was not charred material but rather soot. Dating proceeded
without difficulty. The second set of samples was also determined to be soot, but two samples had insufficient
carbon for dating. The results of the radiometric dating are presented in Table A-1.

The dates consistently fall within the 2 sigma Calibrated period ranging from 6650-6310 B.P., with all
samples overlapping at 6410 B.P. This date places the site at the latter end of the Early Archaic following
the chronology set out in Collins (2005:113).

Appendix B
Summary of Material Recovered from Flotation
of Sediment Samples

Appendix B 63
Flotation Method
A total of 47 flotation samples were collected during excavation, five directly within and beneath the
only feature discovered during testing, Feature 6, and 42 column samples were collected from test units
(10 cm3 column sample). The research design called for sediment samples collected from all subsistence
feature contexts and in columns collected from all test units to be subjected to flotation analyses to confirm
the presence or absence of associated macrobotanical remains. Column samples allowed for recovery of the
very small fraction of cultural and macrobotanical material, which is not, captured on the Â¼ -inch screens
in the main test unit excavation investigations. In the laboratory, each flotation sample selected for analysis
was weighed (g) and measured (L). Each flotation sample was then poured into a water-filled bucket and
agitated to break up the loamy matrix and to allow the light fraction material to float and suspend on the
surface of the water. All material (mostly modern plant remains) was poured from the surface of the water
and collected. The remaining soil was then washed using U.S.A. Standard Sieve Series sieves of fine-mesh
screen with 2mm, 1mm, 500Î¼, and 335Î¼ openings. Sieves were stacked with the narrowest opening on bottom and widest on top. Soil was poured into the sieve stack and water was used to break up and wash the
soil, leaving particles larger than the mesh size in the sieve. This residue was then collected for each sieve.
Material that was skimmed off the surface and the residue primarily in the 2mm and 1mm sieves were
analyzed. The residue in the 1 mm and 500 Î¼ screens were too small in size to differentiate the material.
The collected residue was analyzed for the presence of material with potential cultural significance, such
as charcoal, charred seeds or other plant remains, burned bone and shell, lithics and FCR. The number and
weight (to the nearest 0.1g) were recorded. Each sample was carefully examined using a hand lens (20X)
and an illuminated magnifier light (3-diopter lens). All 47 soil samples were analyzed and observations were
made for material with potential cultural significance.
Flotation Results
The results of this initial analysis are summarized in Table B-1, which lists only the significant material
observed. Of the 42 column samples analyzed, only two were completely without cultural material, including charred plant remains, heat shattered stone or debitage in any of the size grades analyzed. From the
light fraction, a total of 31 seeds or hulls were observed from the 42 column samples analyzed, 19 of which
appeared burned or blackened. Although charcoal initially seemed prevalent, only a total of eight samples
appeared to have no charcoal or burned earth, most of the charcoal recovered in flotation analysis was more
akin to soot and not suitable for radio carbon data analysis. No faunal material was present in any of the
column samples. Fifty-eight pieces of debitage were recovered from the 2mm screen, many exhibiting heat
alteration characteristics like potlidding, blackening, reddening or shattering.
Five samples were collected from Feature 6 located in Unit 7 Levels 3 and 4, and Unit 8 Level 9. From
the 2 mm heavy fraction, 92 pieces of debitage with flake-like characteristics were recovered and 529 pieces
of chert fire-cracked rock. Charcoal or charcoal-like burned earth was present in all of the feature samples.
No bone was recovered in any of the feature sediment samples. One seed was recovered from Unit 8 Level
2 column sample. Mussel shell was also present in three samples from Feature 6, Unit 7 Level 3.
