Management Summary
The Trinity River Authority has proposed the construction of approximately 1.2 miles of 48-inch sewer
line along Red Oak Creek in Ellis County, Texas. The proposed interceptor would extend from just
east of Farm-to-Market Road 342/South Central Boulevard to the Red Oak Creek Regional Water
System Plant in Red Oak, and would be constructed within a 100-foot-wide combined temporary and
permanent easement. The entire line is proposed for open trenching, except at Shawnee Road near
the north end of the project, where the pipeline will be bored. Depths of impacts are expected to be
no greater than 15 feet. An existing pipeline is located within the 100-foot-wide easement. The
proposed archeological area of potential effects for this project is approximately 15 acres in size.
The Trinity River Authority is a subentity of the State of Texas; therefore, the Antiquities Code of
Texas (9 TNRC 191) applies to the project. Additionally, Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, as amended (16 USC 470; 36 CFR 800) applies due to the necessity of a Section
404 Permit for the project.
On November 28, 2017 and March 9, 2018, intensive and reconnaissance archeological surveys with
mechanical trenching were completed in order to evaluate potential impacts associated with the
proposed project to archeological sites or deposits. Two previously recorded archeological sites are
located within or immediately adjacent to the project easement and were revisited. Melissa M. Green
(Principal Investigator) and Brett Lang of Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc. carried out the
survey for the Trinity River Authority under Texas Antiquities Permit 8221, as required under the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
Ground visibility ranged from 0 to 50 percent across the majority of the project corridor, with some
areas exhibiting 80 to 100 percent ground visibility due to sparse vegetation in wooded areas, a
worn two-track road, and clearing for geotechnical drilling. Eleven shovel tests were excavated within
the corridor, including two shovel tests in the vicinity of site 41EL150, an early twentieth-century
scatter; no archeological deposits, materials, or features were observed or encountered during the
survey. Site 41EL151, recorded as bison bone eroding out of the creek bank, was also revisited; one
shovel test and three backhoe trenches were excavated in the vicinity of the site but no evidence of it
was observed. It is believed that both of these sites have been destroyed.
All materials (notes, photographs, administrative documents, and other project data) generated from
this work will be housed at the Center for Archeological Studies at Texas State University where they
will be made permanently available to future researchers as per 13 TAC 26.16–17.
If any unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation, or
construction, the work should cease in that area and Texas Historical Commission personnel should be
notified immediately. During evaluation of the finds and coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission, clearing, preparation, and/or construction could continue in any other areas along the
corridor where no such deposits or materials are observed.
The Texas Historical Commission concurred with the findings and recommendations of this report on
April 10, 2018.

Introduction

Overview of the Project
The Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA) proposes the construction of approximately 1.2 miles (1.9
kilometers) of 48-inch sewer line along Red Oak Creek in Red Oak, Ellis County, Texas. The proposed
interceptor would extend from just east of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 342/South Central Boulevard
to the Red Oak Regional Water System Plant in Red Oak and would be constructed within a 100­
foot-wide (30.4-meter-wide) combined temporary and permanent easement (Figure 1). The entire line
is proposed for open trenching, except at Shawnee Road near the north end of the project, where the
pipeline will be bored. Depths of impacts are expected to be no greater than 15 feet (4.5 meters).
An existing pipeline is located in the 100-foot-wide (30.4-meter-wide) easement. The proposed
archeological area of potential effects (APE) for this project is approximately 15 acres (6.0 hectares)
in size.
The purpose of the investigation described in this document is to identify archeological resources within
the footprint of the proposed sewer line corridor in Ellis County, Texas. Cox|McLain Environmental
Consulting (CMEC) was contracted by CH2M Hill, the engineering contractor to the TRA, to conduct the
archeological survey prior to construction.
Melissa M. Green (Principal Investigator) and Brett Lang of CMEC performed the fieldwork on
November 27, 2017 and March 9, 2018. Seventeen shovel tests were placed within the corridor,
eight of which were placed in the vicinity of previously recorded sites 41EL150 and 41EL151. These
sites were previously recorded as being in or immediately adjacent to the current 100-foot-wide
easement; shovel testing and mechanical trenching were conducted to determine whether these sites
still exist.

Regulatory Context
This investigation was conducted in fulfillment of the TRA’s obligations as a political subdivision of the
State of Texas under the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191). Texas Antiquities Permit 8221 was
assigned to this project by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The project is also subject to Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended (16 USC 470; 36 CFR 800). All
materials generated from this work will be permanently housed at the Center for Archeological
Studies (CAS) at Texas State University.

Structure of the Report
Following this introduction, Chapter Two presents environmental parameters for the study area;
Chapter Three presents a brief cultural context, including a summary of previous archeological
research in and near the APE; Chapter Four discusses research goals, relevant methods, and the
regulatory considerations underlying them; Chapter Five presents the results of the survey; Chapter
Six summarizes the findings and provides recommendations; and Chapter Seven lists references.

Environmental Context

Topography and Drainage
The 15-acre APE is located at elevations between approximately 495 and 521 feet (150.8 and
158.8 meters) above mean sea level in north-central Ellis County, Texas. The project area falls in the
Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion of Texas, which is characterized by fine-textured, clayey soils and
predominately prairie potential vegetation (Griffith et al. 2004).

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the APE is underlain by Late Cretaceous Austin Chalk (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS]
2017a). According to Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) data, the proposed interceptor
project is mapped on eroded Austin silty clay on 2 to 5 percent slopes, frequently and occasionally
flooded Frio silty clay on 0 to 1 percent slopes, Lewisville silty clay on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and wet
Trinity clay and occasionally flooded Trinity clay on 0 to 1 percent slopes (NRCS 2017).

Vegetation and Land Use
According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Vegetation Types of Texas map and
accompanying descriptions, the vegetation of the project area is mapped as “Crops” (McMahan et al.
1984:19). The designation “Crops” is characterized by cultivated cover or row crops that provide
food and/or fiber for humans or domestic animals. It also can portray grasslands associated with crop
rotations. Much of the area around the APE was once agricultural; however, it is rapidly becoming
more urbanized. Along the creek, the vegetation is riparian with mixed hardwoods and grasses. The
project area is located on undeveloped land on the terraces above the Red Oak Creek floodplain in
north-central Ellis County.

Cultural Context

Archeological Chronology
The APE lies within the western part of the north-central Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004a).
The standard cultural chronology for the region has changed little in the last two decades; thus, the
periods and date ranges established by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1990), and Yates and
Ferring (1986) still apply (Table 1). The general prehistoric framework for north-central Texas is
similar to that used in other areas of Texas, and indeed throughout much of North America. The
framework has the first unequivocal human occupations occurring approximately 11,500 radiocarbon
years before present (BP), or approximately 13,000 calendar years ago, and most of the prehistoric
record is contained within a long Archaic period lasting nearly 8,000 years.

2004a:14, Note 1).

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian occupation is the least known period in the prehistory of north-central Texas, due
primarily to three factors: the light population density of Paleoindian peoples, the great age of the
occupation (up to 13,000 calendar years), and taphonomic factors such as severe erosion and deep
sedimentation, depending on location (Ferring 1989, 2001; Holliday 2004). Although initially seen as
narrowly specialized big-game hunters, Paleoindian groups such as Clovis are being reevaluated in
light of recent discoveries such as the Aubrey site north of Dallas-Fort Worth. At Aubrey, investigators
found evidence of a more balanced, flexible subsistence strategy, with remains of big game such as
bison and mammoth along with fish, birds, and other small game (Ferring 2001). Generally,
Paleoindian people are thought to have been more mobile than subsequent populations, utilizing lithic
and other resources from broad geographic areas.

RED OAK INTERCEPTOR SEGMENT 40RO-1 ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

Archaic Period
Usually divided into three roughly equal parts, the Archaic Period encompasses the bulk of northcentral Texas prehistory. The Archaic record is clouded by mixed deposits (Hofman et al. 1989;
Prikryl 1990) and possible large-scale erosion in the middle of the period (as has been documented
further to the west by Blum and colleagues [1992]). Still, the available data show that Archaic
peoples were more likely than their predecessors to make projectile points and other stone tools out
of local raw materials, potentially indicating more spatially restricted territories and/or subsistence
areas and perhaps reflecting seasonal rounds through a specific series of resource-gathering zones
(Ferring and Yates 1997; Peter and McGregor 1988). Generally, the size of the population is thought
to have increased throughout the Archaic Period, perhaps in response to stabilizing climatic conditions.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric Period is defined technologically, as the beginning of the period is typically
marked by the appearance of arrow points and ceramics. Aside from the addition of these extremely
important technologies, the overall trajectory of subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric is usually
thought to represent a continuation of trends seen in the later part of the Archaic, with an even more
dramatic focus on very local resources and broad-spectrum foraging (Ferring and Yates 1997). In the
latter part of the period (Late Prehistoric II), the picture shifts, with ceramic and lithic evidence
indicating links to Plains populations to the north and west (Prikryl 1990).
Protohistoric and Historic Periods
The beginning of the Protohistoric Period is marked by the first appearance of Europeans in Texas:
the Spanish explorers, priests, and speculators who began moving into the state from colonies to the
south and west in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries A.D. Although technically historic (i.e.,
characterized by the use of writing), this earlier phase is often separated from the more formally
designated Historic Period due to the relative infrequency of direct Spanish incursions into northcentral Texas, in contrast to the high-profile early Spanish occupations in south and south-central Texas
(Campbell 2003). Even without the missions, military outposts, and other facilities characteristic of the
Spanish presence to the south, the effects of trade, disease, and other factors on native populations
were still dramatic, and indigenous groups of the Protohistoric Period are little known apart from
sporadic finds of European trade goods at native sites (Stephenson 1970).
The last two centuries are considered the Historic Period. In brief, the landscape and material culture
of north-central Texas during this time are characterized by the overwhelming dominance of
European-derived populations, the expansion of railroads, the discovery and exploitation of
petroleum resources, the supplanting of small tenant farming by mechanized agriculture and urban
sprawl, and various waves of commercial and industrial development—the most recent example
being the rise of the service and information economy (Campbell 2003).
For further general background information, particularly regarding prehistoric periods, the reader is
referred to the major reports mentioned above, as well as to Perttula’s statewide synthesis, The
Prehistory of Texas (Perttula 2004b). Although the latter does not include a chapter devoted
specifically to north-central Texas archeology, the introductory chapter includes an invaluable side­
by-side comparison of cultural chronologies from all of the archeological regions in Texas (Perttula
2004a: Table 1.1). For later periods, the reader is referred to Randolph B. Campbell’s Gone to Texas:

A History of the Lone Star State (2003), now considered the standard comprehensive overview of
historical events, demographic changes, social movements, industrial developments, and other aspects
of Texas history.

Previous Investigations and Previously Identified Cultural Resources
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) maintained by the THC and the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory was conducted in order to identify archeological sites, historical
markers or Official Texas Historic Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, properties or districts
listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
cemeteries, or other cultural resources that may have been previously recorded in or near the APE, as
well as previous surveys undertaken in the area. A larger 1-mile study area around the APE was also
examined.
According to the Atlas survey coverage data search, the project APE has not been previously
surveyed and no previously recorded cultural resources are mapped within the APE. Five
archeological sites (two of which [41EL150 and 41EL151] are adjacent to the APE), as well as the Red
Oak Cemetery and its associated historical marker have been recorded within the APE or within the 1­
mile study area surrounding the APE (THC 2017; see Figure 1). Available details regarding each
resource are presented in Table 2.

Originally the Kemble Cemetery, a family plot for Abraham and Mary Kemble
dating to 1867; family gave land to Liberty Baptist Church (now First Baptist
Church Red Oak) in 1892, which became a public cemetery at the beginning of
the twentieth century. As of 205, there were 2,723 interments (Tipton 2017).

In addition to these resources, three cultural resources surveys are mapped within the 1-mile study
area surrounding the APE (THC 2017). In 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey for TRA for the 25-acre Red Oak Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant where the current project
APE terminates; no archeological materials, deposits, or sites were identified (Todd 2007). A
combination reconnaissance and intensive pedestrian survey of the Interstate Highway (IH)-35 corridor
was conducted in 2009 for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) by Geo-Marine, Inc.
(now Versar, Inc.); no archeological materials, deposits, or sites were identified (Tiné 2009). A linear
survey that crosses the project corridor near the location of site 41EL150 was noted on the Atlas;
however, no additional information on that survey was available.

Research Goals and Methods

Purpose of the Research
The present study was carried out to accomplish three major goals:
1. To identify all historic and prehistoric archeological resources located within the APE defined in
Chapter One
2. To perform a preliminary evaluation of the identified resources’ potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and/or for listing as a SAL (typically performed concurrently)
3. To make recommendations about the need for further research concerning the identified
resources based on the preliminary NRHP/SAL evaluation and with guidance on methodology
and ethics from the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)

Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended (16 USC 470; 36 CFR 800), directs federal agencies
and entities using federal funds to “take into account the effect of their undertakings on historic
properties” (36 CFR 800.1a), with “historic property” defined as “any prehistoric or historic district,
site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of
Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior” (36 CFR 800.16).
In order to determine the presence of historic properties (with this phrase understood in its broad
Section 106 sense) an APE is first delineated. The APE is the area in which direct impacts (and in a
federal context, indirect impacts as well) to historic properties may occur. Within the APE, resources
are evaluated to determine if they are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and to determine the
presence of any properties that are already listed on the NRHP. To determine if a property is
significant, cultural resource professionals and regulators evaluate the resource using these criteria:
…The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
a. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history; or
b. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c.

that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or

d. that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history. (36 CFR 60.4)

Note that significance and NRHP eligibility are determined by two primary components: integrity and
one of the four types of association and data potential listed under 36 CFR 60.4(a–d). The criterion
most often applied to archeological sites is the last—and arguably the broadest—of the four; its
7

RED OAK INTERCEPTOR SEGMENT 40RO-1 ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

phrasing allows regulators to consider a broad range of research questions and analytical techniques
that may be brought to bear (36 CFR 60.4[d]).
Occasionally, certain resources fall into categories which require further evaluation using one or more
of the following Criteria Considerations. If a resource is identified and falls into one of these
categories, the Criteria Considerations listed below may be applied in conjunction with one or more of
the four National Register criteria listed above:
a. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction
or historical importance; or
b. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily
for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with
a historic person or event; or
c.

A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no
appropriate site or building directly associated with productive life; or

d. A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent
importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic
events; or
e. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and
presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other
building or structure with the same association has survived; or
f.

A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value
has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or

g. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional
importance. (36 CFR 60.4)

Resources that are listed in the NRHP or that are recommended eligible for the NRHP are treated the
same under Section 106, and are generally treated the same at the state level as well.
After cultural resources within the APE are identified and evaluated, effects evaluations are
completed to determine if the proposed project has no effect, no adverse effect, or an adverse effect
on these resources. Effects are determined by assessing the impacts that the proposed project will
have on the characteristics that make the property eligible for listing in the NRHP as well as its
integrity. Types of potential adverse effects considered include physical impacts, such as the
destruction of all or part of a resource; property acquisitions that adversely impact the historic setting
of a resource, even if built resources are not directly impacted; noise and vibration impacts evaluated
according to accepted professional standards; changes to significant viewsheds; and cumulative
effects that may occur later in time. If the project will have an adverse effect on cultural resources,
measures can be taken to avoid, minimize, or mitigate this adverse effect. In some instances, changes
to the proposed project can be made to avoid adverse effects. In other cases, adverse effects may
be unavoidable, and mitigation to compensate for these impacts will be proposed and agreed upon
by consulting parties.

RED OAK INTERCEPTOR SEGMENT 40RO-1 ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

Antiquities Code of Texas
Because the City of Arlington is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to
the Antiquities Code of Texas (9 TNRC 191), which requires consideration of effects on properties
designated as—or eligible to be designated as—SALs, which are defined as:
...sites, objects, buildings, structures and historic shipwrecks, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest including, but not limited to, prehistoric
American Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, aboriginal paintings,
petroglyphs, and other marks or carvings on rock or elsewhere which pertain to early
American Indian or other archeological sites of every character, treasure imbedded in the
earth, sunken or abandoned ships and wrecks of the sea or any part of their contents, maps,
records, documents, books, artifacts, and implements of culture in any way related to the
inhabitants, prehistory, history, government, or culture in, on, or under any of the lands of the
State of Texas, including the tidelands, submerged land, and the bed of the sea within the
jurisdiction of the State of Texas. (13 TAC 26.2)

Rules of practice and procedure for the evaluation of cultural resources as SALs and/or for listing on
the NRHP, which is also explicitly referenced at the state level, are detailed at 13 TAC 26. An
archeological site identified on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas may be of sufficient
significance to allow designation as a SAL if at least one of the following criteria applies:
1. the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4. the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and
5. there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected. (13 TAC 26.10)

For archeological resources, the state-level process requires securing and maintaining a valid Texas
Antiquities Permit from the THC, the lead state agency for Antiquities Code compliance, throughout all
stages of investigation, analysis, and reporting.

Survey Approach and Methodology
CMEC conducted intensive survey per Category 2 under 13 TAC 26.20 and using the definitions in 13
TAC 26.3. Field methods and strategies complied with the requirements of 13 TAC 26.14, as
elaborated by the THC and the CTA.
Shovel tests were placed along the project easement in areas where ground surface visibility was
below 30 percent, soils appeared to be of sufficient depth to contain subsurface cultural materials,
historic maps indicated high potential for historic archaeological sites, and/or previous disturbances
9

RED OAK INTERCEPTOR SEGMENT 40RO-1 ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

appeared to have been minimal. All shovel tests were excavated in natural levels to subsoil or at least
60 centimeters (24 inches), whichever was encountered first. Excavated matrix was screened through
0.635-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth as allowed by moisture and clay content. Deposits were
described using conventional texture classifications and Munsell color designations. Detailed notes
supplemented by digital photographs were taken and included location markers, contextual integrity,
vegetation, topography, hydrology, land use, soil exposures, general conditions at the time of the
survey, and field techniques employed. Any deviations from THC and CTA standards are explicitly
justified.
Mechanical trenching was proposed at the location of site 41EL151. Three trenches were proposed
within the pipeline easement at the north end of the corridor, one at each of the proposed bridge
footings on the creek banks. Although the depth of impacts would extend to approximately 9.14 m
(30 feet) below the surface, the maximum depth of the excavated trenches was limited to the length
of the bucket arm, approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet). The typical width of the trenches was 1.06
meters (42 inches), and the length averaged 5 meters (17 feet). Access into the trenches was not
allowed to ensure safety from potential cave-ins. Where the environmental setting allowed, the
minimum recommended length for trenches was 3 meters (10 feet), and the length could be extended
based on in-field observations. If cultural remains were found during mechanical trenching, a small
hand-dug excavation unit was to be placed over the deposit, as allowed by soil conditions and trench
safety protocols.

Review of Historical Photographs and Maps
A review of available historic aerial photographs and topographic maps on Google Earth Pro™, the
Nationwide Environmental Title Research (NETR) website, and the USGS Historical Topographic Map
Explorer was undertaken to determine how the project APE has been utilized over time (Google Earth
2017, NETR 2017, USGS 2017b). The earliest aerial photographs available, produced in 1968,
revealed that the area was mostly covered by agricultural fields with FM 342, Shawnee Road, and
Bells Chapel Road extant. Subsequent aerial photographs (1972, 1979, 1995, 2001, 2003–2005,
and 2008–2016) show that the APE has not changed significantly over time, although the area
becomes less agricultural and more forested along the creek, and minor residential development
increases along Bells Chapel Road (NETR 2017). The large pond immediately south of and relatively
parallel to the APE first appears on the 2001 Google Earth aerial imagery (Google Earth 2017).
The earliest topographic maps available date to 1954, 1958, and 1963, and show that no structures
or disturbances are present within the APE. The 1961, 1973, 1978, and 1979 maps show structures
and gravel pits along Bells Chapel Road, just north of the APE (NETR 2017; USGS 2017b).

Survey Results
The intensive pedestrian survey was conducted on November 28, 2017 and mechanical trenching at
site 41EL151 was conducted on March 9, 2018. Both days were bright, sunny, and a little breezy,
with temperatures in the 70s most of the day allowing for good field conditions. Survey began on the
southeast end of the 1.2-mile-long corridor at the wastewater treatment plant, and moved northwest
along the corridor (Figure 2a-b). Since the corridor crosses Red Oak Creek twice, once at the south
end and once at the north end, time was needed to move from one access point to another along the
route. Right-of-entry was granted to 100 percent of the combined permanent and temporary 100­
foot-wide right-of-way.
Ground visibility ranged from 0 to 50 percent across the majority of the project corridor, with some
areas exhibiting 80 to 100 percent ground visibility due to sparse vegetation, a worn two-track road,
and clearing for geotechnical drilling. Due to the time of year that the survey occurred, leaf litter was
particularly heavy in some of the wooded areas, though visibility was still high since vines and grasses
that would have hindered both visibility and progress were light. In more open areas, tall, thick
grasses were encountered while short, sparse grasses mixed with briars, variably dense underbrush,
and young saplings and trees were encountered in wooded areas. One small drainage flowing to the
southwest crosses the APE near its center mark and enters the large man-made ski lake on the west
side of the APE (see Figure 2a). Shovel tests RO05 and RO06 were placed on either side of this small
but incised (about 3.5 feet or 1 meter deep) drainage (Figure 3).
Disturbances appear to be restricted to near the ground surface, except in the existing pipeline
portion of the corridor. These shallower disturbances included push piles from vegetation removal for
geotechnical drilling, animal burrowing, small- to medium-sized tree falls, a two-track road along the
corridor, past agricultural practices, and erosion resulting from all of the above.

Eleven shovel tests were excavated along the corridor. Generally, the profiles for shovel tests
indicated that the soils mapped in the APE are consistent, with very dark brown or very dark grayish
brown clay A Horizons over black or brown clay B Horizons with some gravels and calcium carbonates
occurring with depth (Figures 4 and 5). Specific details of each shovel test are found in Table 3.

41EL150 Revisit
Other than the mapped location, no information about site 41EL150 was available in the Atlas
database. However, information was found in the final report for the Superconducting Super Collider
(Yedlowski et al. 1998). The centroid for the site is mapped just north and outside of the current 100­
foot-wide easement between two large meanders of the creek (see Figure 2b and Figure 8). The site
was recorded in 1991 during an initial Super Collider footprint survey. It was reported as an early
twentieth-century historic site based on the seven artifacts (2 ceramics, 3 glass shards, and 2
architectural items―no additonal information was given) observed in the backdirt from the installation
of the existing pipeline in the easement. A walkover and visual inspection of the area both in and on
either side of the easement was undertaken; this inspection yielded no evidence of any cultural
remains other than a few modern aluminum cans and plastic bottles. In addition, eight shovel tests
were excavated in the vicinity of the site’s mapped location; no archeological artifacts, features, or
unusual soil deposits were encountered in any of these shovel tests. These shovel tests are detailed in
Table 3. Because no artifacts or features were observed or encountered, it is believed that the site
has been destroyed.
The only detail of interest was a scatter of small clam shells across the easement in this location. Since
these shells were the only items observed, a sample was taken for identification. The Asian clam
(Corbicula spp.) is an invasive species first reported in the United States in Oregon in 1938 and was
first observed in Texas in 1966 (Ryan Blankenship and Garrett Weiberg; personal communication,
December 1, 2017). This was the first observed occurrence of these clam shells in the APE, although
additional small scatters were also noted along the corridor as the survey moved north toward
Shawnee Road.

41EL151 Revisit
Recorded during the initial Super Collider footprint survey in 1991, site 41EL151 was a prehistoric
site of undetermined age along Red Oak Creek. It was identified by the occurrence of a feature
containing burned bone and charcoal, located approximately 4 meters below the ground surface in
the north cutbank of Red Oak Creek (Figures 9 and 10), and one secondary thinning flake and bone
observed in the backdirt from the installation of the pipeline (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The bone was
identified as bos/bison, and a few of the rib fragments collected exhibited cut marks. Due to the
ongoing construction of the pipeline at that time, more detailed examination of the feature was not
possible. However, three radiocarbon samples were collected from the feature in the cutbank. None
of the samples provided sufficient organic carbon for conventional radiometric dating, but one sample
was pretreated for Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) dating. The results yielded a measured 14C
age of 1250±60 B.P., a 13C/12C ratio of -26.6 0/00, and a conventional 14C age of 1220±60 B.P.
The tree-ring calibration for this sample yielded a calendrical date intercept of A.D. 800, with 1
sigma calibrated results of A.D. 720–735 and A.D. 760–885 with a 68 percent probability (Jurney
1998:513).
No evidence of site 41EL151 was observed during this revisit. Jurney mentions that the face of the
cutbank had recently (in 1991) been “exposed by increased stream flow during January and
February of that year” (Jurney 1998:513). Large stream flows in the subsequent 26 years have
continuously eaten away at the bank, and overburden has slumped considerably, particuarly in the
proposed construction easement. One shovel test (RO11) was excavated above the mapped location
of 41EL151 (see Figure 2a), but no artifacts were encountered; details can be found in Table 3.

Figure 10. Location of Site 41EL151 in creek bank as mapped on Atlas; view northwest. This location is between
Trenches 2 and 3.

In addition to the shovel test, three backhoe trenches were excavated in the easement; one west of the
current pipeline and two east of the current pipeline (see Figure 2a). Trench 1 was placed at the
western edge of the easement, with the anticipation of locating more of the large stain designated
41EL151 in 1991; Trench 2 was placed just east of the current pipeline, and Trench 3 was placed at
the eastern edge of the corridor. All three trenches were approximately 5 meters long,
approximately 1.06 meters (42-inch bucket) wide, and excavated to a depth of at least 510
centimeters the below surface (5.10 meters or 16.7 feet, or the extent of the bucket arm). If site
41EL151 extended beyond the original pipeline trench sighting, it should have been encountered
within this depth. The water table was encountered in two of the three trenches. No evidence of the
stain, artifacts, or faunal materials originally encountered were observed or found in any of these
trenches. Details for each trench is presented in Table 4. Profile photographs were taken for each
trench and are found as Figures 11–13.
A burned, basin-shaped non-cultural feature was encountered in the east wall of Trench 1, located
roughly at the center of the trench. The non-cultural feature was at a depth of 1 meter, and extended
about 30 centimeters down (to a depth of roughly 130 centimeters below the surface). A ring of
charcoal outlines the feature with light sand underlain by ash and a thin rind of burned soil. Other
than the organics mentioned in the wall profile or feature, no artifacts were observed within or near

20

this deposit. It is thought to be the result of a natural tree or vegetation burn due to what was likely a
root extending off of the base of the non-cultrual feature (see Figure 11).
It is believed that impacts from the previous installation of the wastewater pipe destroyed the larger
part of the site, as it was located within the construction area at that time. If any portion of the site
remains, it is most likely a small deposit located outside of the current trenching areas. However,
erosion and slumping along the creek bank have likely removed any additonal deposits. No evidence
of a paleosol or archeological materials were noted in the cutbank within or outside of the easement.
It is believed that the site has been destroyed.

Summary and Recommendations

On November 28, 2017 and March 9, 2018, archeological pedestrian survey augmented by shovel
testing and mechanical trenching were conducted along the 1.2 miles of proposed wastewater line.
Disturbances along the corridor APE were minimal and restricted to surficial and shallow soils, with the
notable exception of the previous pipeline installation within the APE. Ground visibility was typically
high, except for some areas where leaf litter obscured the ground surface. Historic aerial photographs
indicated that little to no occupation or utilization have occurred directly within the project APE. No
archeological artifacts, features, or deposits were encountered or observed on the surface or during
subsurface investigations.
In addition to the survey, previously recorded sites 41EL150 and 41EL151 were revisited. Shovel tests
were excavated in the vicinity of each site, and additional intensive pedestrian walkovers and close
visual examinations were conducted at the sites. No evidence of either site remained in surficial or
subsurface contexts. Site 41EL150 was identified by the presence of seven artifacts found in the
trench spoil from the installation of an existing wastewater pipeline within the current APE. It is quite
likely that the site was destroyed during that installation, or that other materials have been removed
through maintenance of the corridor by the landowner, local Red Oak Creek Regional Water System
Plant staff, or from subsequent flooding events. Likewise, site 51EL151 was impacted by the
installation of the existing wastewater pipeline in 1991. No evidence of any intact portions of the site
was observed in the trenches or shovel tests excavated nearby. It is likely that the majority of the site
was destroyed and has been further damaged by the continuous eroding of the creek bank in which
bones eroding were originally observed.
Although no archeological materials were recovered, all notes, photographs, administrative
documents, and other project data generated from this project will be housed at CAS where they will
be permanently available to future researchers.
If any unanticipated cultural materials or deposits are found at any stage of clearing, preparation, or
construction, the work should cease in that area and THC personnel should be notified immediately.
During evaluation of the finds and coordination with the THC, clearing, preparation, and/or
construction could continue in any other areas along the corridor where no such deposits or materials
are observed.
