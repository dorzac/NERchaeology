Abstract

Raymond K. Vann & Associates, LLC of Lufkin, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas
Archaeology to conduct a cultural resources survey of a water pipeline right-of-way (ROW)
along FM1818 from south east of Shady Grove to Prairie Grove, and along a short two-track road
from Water Treatment Plant #2 to Sherwood Circle, both in northwestern Angelina County,
Texas. The total length surveyed was 2.19 miles.
On January 27, 2010 the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer (SHPO) advised that the
new water pipeline would be placed in an area that had not been previously disturbed, and that
part of the project would occur along FM1818 in the flood plain of Stovall Creek where there
was a likely potential for prehistoric cultural materials to exist. Therefore, the SHPO advised that
at a minimum, an archaeological survey should be conducted along the proposed water line for
2,000 feet on either side of Stovall Creek.
Federal funding was provided under the guise of a Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Community Development Grant administered by the Texas Department of Rural Affairs, and the
ROW follows FM 1818, a public easement. As such, this project was undertaken under Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and Texas Antiquities Permit #5694 was
obtained from the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted the survey on 20 and 21 July, 2010. A thorough
pedestrian survey of the surface area was conducted, and 12 shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed either on or below the
surface, and therefore no artifacts were collected or curated.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended to the SHPO that the installation of the
new waterline be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further
recommended that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during
development, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.

Introduction
The County of Angelina and the Prairie Grove Water
Supply Corporation proposed to install approximately
2.19 miles (11,540 feet) of water line southeast of
Diboll, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Federal funding for
this project was provided by a Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) Community Development Grant
administered by the Texas Department of Rural
Affairs, and the right-of-way follows FM 1818, a
public easement. As such, this project was undertaken
under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, and an Antiquities Permit
was required from the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) before a cultural resource survey could begin.
These guidelines were synthesized in a January 27,
2010 letter from Mr.
Bill Martin at THC to
Ms. Sonja Payne of
Raymond Vann &
Associates, LLC of
Lufkin, Texas, the
project manager.

the flood plain of Stovall Creek, where there was a likely potential for prehistoric cultural
materials to exist. Therefore, the SHPO advised that at a minimum, a cultural resources survey
should be conducted along the ROW within 2,000 feet of both banks of Stovall Creek. On July
20 and 21, 2010 Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of the 2.19
miles of water pipeline right-of-way (ROW), and excavated 12 shovel tests within 2,000 feet of
the Stovall Creek crossing.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area where the new
development is to be located is further
illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Over 95
percent of the project area overlies
Caddell formation (Eca) clay and quartz
sand of Eocene age (ca. 38-56 million
years). It is described as very fine
grained sand with common glautonic
ironstone concretions over lignitic
brown sandy clay. The remaining
approximately 5 percent lies on both
sides of the Stovall Creek channel
(colored in yellow) and is mapped as
sand, silt, and clay alluvium of
Holocene age (<10,000 years) that
occurs on point bars, in natural levees
and stream channels, and on indistinct
Figure 3. Geologic map of the project area (Fisher
terraces (Fisher 1993).
1993)
The soil along both sides of Stovall Creek is Koury loam (Kp). These alluvial soils are extremely
acidic and recent, they occur on bottomland slopes of less than 1 percent, and are occasionally
to frequently flooded. As such, there is a low probability of intact cultural deposits to exist in the
Koury soils immediately adjacent to Stovall Creek (Figure 2).
Rising in elevation away from the creek, the pipeline right-of-way courses through small areas
of Diboll series (DbB), strongly acidic, fine sandy loam. These soils are found in poorly drained
concave “basins” within the uplands, with a perched water table approximately 15-45 cm below
the surface in winter and early spring. These concave land forms do not appear conducive to
human occupation sites, and thus there is a low probability of intact cultural deposits to exist.
However, rising further in elevation away from Stovall Creek, the soils consist of Keltys series
2

fine sandy loams (KcB). Unlike Koury
and Diboll series loams, the Keltys
series are well drained, and occur on
nearly level to strongly sloping
interstream divides and sideslopes.
Because of these characteristics and
their locations on the landscape they are
very conducive as ancient habitation
locales, and the probability of intact
cultural deposits to exist in these areas
is high. A typical pedon of Keltys soils
consists of an ‘A Horizon’ about 15 cm
thick, underlain by a much older,
eluviated ‘E Horizon’ from about 15
cm to perhaps as deep as 105 cm below
the surface (Dolezel 1988:94; Sheet
33).

Modern Physiography and Climate
Angelina County is located in the East Texas Timberlands. The Angelina River forms its
northern boundary, and the Neches River its southern boundary. It is predominately densely
forested in the Piney Woods with a variety of pines and hardwoods over gently rolling terrain
(Boon 1937; Biesele 1996).
The average monthly high temperature of 940F occurs in June, and the average monthly low
temperature of 390F occurs in January. An ameniable temperate climate with nearly 43 inches
of rainfall per year results in an average annual growing season of 244 days (Boon 1937; Biesele
1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
Angelina County is located in the southern portion of the Northeast Texas archaeological region.
Formal archaeological research in Northeast Texas can be traced to the 1930s when a number
of sites and cemeteries of prehistoric age were excavated by the University of Texas (Pearce
1932; Jackson 1934, 1934). Since that time, most of the archaeological sites within the region
have been recorded either by avocational archaeologists, or as the result of professional surveys
3

and excavations during large-scale reservoir and lignite mine projects. All dates given in the
following discussion are approximate and given as years before present (B.P.), i.e, before A.D.
1950 when radiocarbon analysis was refined.
Paleoindian Period
This period spans the period estimated at between 11,500-7950 B.P. in the Pineywoods of
Northeast Texas (Perttula 2004). The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the
Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early Paleoindian interval (ca. 11,500-10,00 B.P.) include
Clovis points and elongated blades expediently used as tools. Discoveries of Paleoindian artifacts
in Northeast Texas suggest that these early inhabitants of the region were tethered to major
stream basins and valleys.
In general, the early Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently,
emphasis has been placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by
these early Americans (Fields and Tomka 1993:82), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons (Collins 2004; Collins and Brown 2000), although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include
killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins 2004).
As the warming trend that marked the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began
to take effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic
shift is also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, and camel
before 10,000 B.P., and giant bison (Bison antiquus) by 8,000 B.P. The descendants of Bison
antiquus have survived into modern times. During this late Paleoindian interval in Northeast
Texas that can be roughly dated to ca. 10,000-9000 B.P., stone tools such as Dalton, Plainview
and various forms of laneolate-shaped points and tools
Archaic Period (7950-2150 B.P.)
The Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods in Northeast Texas are poorly dated, but it is
generally accepted that the Early Archaic interval begins around 7950 B.P (Perttula 2004). The
extinction of large herds of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
stimulated a behavioral change by the Prehistoric inhabitants. While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. However, it appears that the small Indian groups of this period remained highly
mobile, moving frequently across the landscape hunting and foraging, but often returning to the
same site locations repeatedly, perhaps seasonally.
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites in major basins in the region, a more diverse
hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of plant foods
as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths, ovens and
4

burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and cooking of plant resources was
important (Perttula 2004). Valuable lithic raw material and tools were traded were likely
exchanged across the region (Fields and Tomka 1993:92).
Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major
streams by springs in the uplands, and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic,
populationdensity may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites
and greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread
distribution of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined
territories, and regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).
Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. [2150 B.P.] 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely
identified by plain ware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and by Gary projectile
points. At sites near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while
at other sites in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not
as common. One explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food
processing and diet during this period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of
sedentism between regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods than they had during the
Archaic period. There are some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) in which pottery
making is linked to sedentism, perhaps giving reason for these long stays. In some cases, such
as at the Ray Site, small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated
occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the
region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of sites in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river
basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when
they occur, they are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or on terraces of larger
streams, and also by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland-period burial mounds
have been documented in the region.
Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddoan periods (ca. AD
1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and smaller
tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were primarily
chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent settlements
that included structures, middens, pits, and cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and ceramics
were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads with
rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities, such as the George C. Davis Site on the Neches River, are also
encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan period and
5

continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).
Middle Caddoan Period
The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan period (ca.
AD 1200–1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements
with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan period. One example of such a site
is the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize and
other crops until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).
Late Caddoan Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches river basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoanperiod
archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily used
from AD 1400 to 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound shaft
burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples that lived in the northeastern portion of the Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur and
Sabine rivers. These Caddo peoples lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society. They
constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with statusranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus Phase
sites are usually found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and
permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
Historic Caddoan Period
Europeans in the region define the Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680–1860) as the sustained
European presence in and occupation of the Caddoan area. It is during this period that the Caddo
and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were eventually moved
from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the region were small
farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities were composed of
many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts recovered from these sites
6

include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone, stone, and wooden
tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan sites after ca. AD 1740 and
include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes,
lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

History of Northeast Texas Archaeological Region through the 19th Century
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries
The Spaniards
In part to stifle French encroachment into east and northeast Texas, as well as to convert the
Caddo Indians (both Tejas and Kadohodahos) to Catholicism, the Spanish decided to establish
up to seven missions in what is now east Texas. In 1689 the first Spanish mission, Mission San
Francisco de los Tejas, was established west of the Neches River for the Tejas Indians near Alto
(Chipman 1992:89). Two years later, while isolated in east Texas, Fathers Bodoy and Jesús
María founded a second mission, Santismo Nombre de Maria, about five miles northeast of San
Francisco de los Tejas (Chipman 192:97). These missions were founded while Bodoy and Jesús
María were waiting for Father Massanét and Governor General Terán de los Rios to help
establish the other missions. Terán made it to the Kadohodachos, but the remaining missions
were not attempted. After that, Terán left Mission San Francisco and returned by ship to Vera
Cruz, leaving only “three religious and nine soldiers” at the missions (Chipman 1992:97-98).
Hostile attacks finally forced the demise of the mission, and after burying the mission bells and
military cannon at Mission San Francisco de los Tejas, the three padres remaining there set it on
fire and fled back toward Coahuila in 1693 (Chipman 1992:99).
Mission San Francisco was reestablished in 1716 for the Neches Indians and others, east of the
mission established in 1690 on the other side of the Neches River. It was renamed Nuestro Padre
San Francisco de los Tejas. In July 1716, Mission Señora de la Purisma Concepción was
established on the Angelina River, abut 15 miles west of Nacogdoches, to serve the Hainai
Indians. Later in July 1716, Mission Señora de Guadalupe was founded at present-day
Nacogdoches to serve the Nacogdoche tribe. Mission José de los Nazonis was established north
of modern-day Cushing in July 1716 to serve the Nazoni Indians. In early 1717, Mission Nuestra
Señora de los Dolores was established near modern-day San Augustine to serve the Ais Indians.
Also in early 1717, Mission San Miguel de los Adaes was established near modern-day Robeline,
Louisiana to serve the Adais Indians. In 1721, Governor San Miguel de Aguayo established
Presidio Señora de Pilar on the Red River in western Louisiana near Natchitoches and then refounded Presidio Delores near San Augustine to protect the six east Texas Indians (Chipman
1992:113-123).
In 1718, the first mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero, was established in San Antonio, and
José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established in 1720. On May 13, 1721, the new Governor San
Miguel de Aguayo crossed the Rio Grande with 500 men, 2,800 horses, 4,800 cattle, and 640
sheep and goats to supply Mission San José in San Antonio. He then departed for east Texas. His
7

was the first cattle drive through Texas, and the beginning of Spanish ranching in Texas
(Chipman 1992:121). However, by their own admission, early Spanish settlements in east Texas
produced only enough agricultural goods to feed themselves, most likely due to the remoteness
of the area and not because of a lack of rainfall or fertile soil (Chipman 1992:6). The remoteness,
reluctance of the Indians to stay in the missions, and disease led to the ultimate decline of the
east Texas missions, Finally, in July 1730, the Presidio de los Tejas was closed at the
recommendation of Father Miguel Sevillano de Paredes. Three east Texas missions, Señora de
la Purisma Concepción de Acuña, San Francisco de la Espada, and San Juan Capistrano, were
also closed and moved first to Barton Springs in Austin in July 1730, and then relocated to San
Antonio from March to May 1731 (Chipman 1992:131).
The English
After a disastrous sea battle between the English slave trader Sir John Hawkins and the Spanish
navy off the port of Vera Cruz in 1568, a crew of 114 that included David Ingram landed on
northern Mexico shores. They walked through Texas en route to Cape Breton off Nova Scotia,
but only three men survived. David Ingram eventually reported vast riches in land, minerlas, and
fur to the English authorities. Yet the English were wary of Spain’s dominance in the Gulf of
Mexico and would not attempt organized expeditions into Texas until after the end of the Seven
Years’ war and the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Although small numbers of Englishmen were
reported near Natchitoches and the Trinity River in 1772, the Spanish did not find them.
However, they did encounter Indians with English-made firearms. In 1775, on group of
Englishmen farmed for a season on the Neches River, possibly attempting colonization in
northeast Texas, and in 1777 a boat loaded with bricks ran aground in the Neches (Cutrer
1985:7-12). These early activities by the English did not result in permanent settlements in
Texas.
The French
France’s first notable attempt at colonizing Texas came with the building of La Salle’s fort on
Garcitas Creek near Matagorda Bay in 1687 (Chipman 1992:79). The expedition was a failure
and La Salle was murdered in east Texas near the Trinity River in 1687 (Chipman 1992:84). The
sixth land expedition to look for LaSalle’s fort was led by Spanish explorer Alonso de León, Jr.,
accompanied by Father Damián Massanét. They found the ruins on April 22, 1689. They later
returned to the Fort St. Louis (La Salle’s fort) en route to establish a new mission (San Francisco
de los Tejas) in east Texas, and Father Massanét is the one alleged to have set fire to the ruins
(Chipman 1992:89). Frenchman Sieur d’ Pierre Lemoyne Iberville sailed into the mouth of the
Mississippi and established a French fort near modern-day Baton Rouge in April 1699, further
threatening Spain’s fledgling efforts to protect its interests in Texas (Chipman 1992:101).
Alliances were formed between early French traders and Native American tribes for economic
reasons during the first half of the eighteenth century. In an attempt to extend their trade network
from Louisiana to santa Fe, french traders sought peaceful relations and trade agreements with
Wichita villages in Oklahoma. The Wichitas provided valuable otter, mink, beaver, and muskrat
furs, as well as buffalo robes in exchange for French guns, ammunition, knives, cloth, and other
hardware (Morris 1970:79-80). In 1747, the French were instrumental in helping the Wichitas
8

form a trade alliance with the Comanches, who were encroaching on the western periphery of
the Wichita’s territory in modern-day western Oklahoma. The wide-ranging Comanches were
able to provide more furs from territories they controlled to the west. The Wichita acted as
middlemen in the French-Comanche trade; the Wichitas accepted Comanche furs in exchange
for French muskets and other goods. The Osage raids and hunting forays from Missouri into
northeastern Oklahoma occupied by the Taovaya, a band of the Wichitas, forced most of the
Taovaya into southeastern Oklahoma in 1757, joining other Wichita bands in the area and
establishing Twin Villages across the Red River from each other, in Jefferson County, Oklahoma
and Montague County, Texas. In response, a new French trading post was established at
Natchitoches on the Red River (Morris 1970:80-81).
The French/Wichita/Comanche alliance proved costly to both the French and Spanish. In 1758
the Comanche, Wichita, and tawakoni Indians (a Wichita group) attacked Mission San Sabá on
the San Saba River near present-day Menard in south-central Texas. The mission was established
at the request of the Apaches, enemies of the Comanches. The massacre of the mission
inhabitants by the Comanches and Wichitas was carried out with French muskets (Weddle 1964).
In retaliation, Spanish Colonel Diego Ortíz Parrila led an expedition into north Texas where he
enjoined the Wichitas in battle. His command was defeated and he retreated to San Antonio
(Chipman 1992:158-161). French and Spanish relations in Texas were strained from that time
forward. Across the Atlantic, however, Spain and France had forged a different relationship. In
return for Spain’s support of France in the Seven Years’ War, France ceded Louisiana to Spain
in 1763.
The Spanish wisely appointed Athanase De Mézières, a Frenchman, as the lieutenant governor
of Louisiana. De Mézières enforced Spanish laws against trading with the Indians for guns,
ammunition, horses, mules, and Indian slaves. This in effect curtailed the French and taovaya
Indian trade. Reluctantly, the Taovaya agreed to Spanish rule in 1771. De Mézières then allowed
Spanish traders access to the Taovaya at Twin Villages. However, the Taovaya preferred the
guns, horses, and mules that French traders could provide them, and trade with the French
generally increased. De Mézières countered by offering higher payments to the Taovaya for deer
skins and buffalo robes, which returned favored trading status to the Spanish. After De Mézières
died in 1779, Spanish traders refused to pay the higher prices, and trade with the Taovaya
effectively ceased (Morris 1970:81).
Meanwhile, the Taovaya were harrassed by their dreaded Osage enemies. In 1782, gifts in the
form of guns, ammunition, and assorted sundry articles from the Spanish village of Nacogdoches
to the Taovaya helped forge an uneasy and short-lived trading alliance. The Nacogdoches firm
of Barr and Davenport, formed in 1798, successfully lobbied the Spanish Government to grant
an exception to the trade laws. This allowed them to trade Louisiana goods for east Texas Indian
furs, horses, and hides. The firm was also granted a legal exemption that allowed them to export
horses to Louisian (Faulk 1964:96-97).
Because of the many changes in political possession of northeast Texas and Louisiana and the
almost constant warfare between Indian tribes, the smuggling of tobacco, cloth, and horses was
9

commonplace throughout the eighteenth century. Ironically, Spanish law encouraged this
activity. First, the laws denied Spanish citizens the right to trade with French Louisiana. Scond,
as goods moved between Mexico and Texas, they were taxed heavily as they crossed each
provincial boundary. Finally, unscrupulous governors and presidio captains would often ignore
the laws (Faulk 1964:97-98).
Nineteenth Century
Taovaya Abandonment of the Area
Although trade relations were re-established with the Taovaya after 172, the Spanish broke the
alliance by transferring ownership of Louisiana back to France in 1800. Three years later France
sold Louisiana to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase (Morris 1970:82). Although Spain
objected, the United States quickly took control of the Red River and began trading with the
Taovaya. However, constant attacks by the Osage on trading parties, most notably that of Captain
Anthony Glass, again stemmed the Indian trade. The Wichitas had also had enough of the
relentless Osage; in 1811 they abandoned Twin Villages and headed south to join with the
Tawakonis, presumably around present-day Waco and Palestine (Krieger 1996:213; Morris
1970:82).

Angelina County History
Hasanai Caddoan and Atakapan Indians were known to occupy the area during initial contact
with Spanish missionaries and soldiers in the late 17th century. Even at that time the Hasanai
were part of a complex social organization with an abundant food supply; this contrasts sharply
with those hunter-gatherers of the Plains and regional Central Texas groups (Boon 1937; Biesele
1996).
Governmental regulations and appropriations came early to Angeline County, as the first
recorded Spanish deed for 5.5 leagues of land was issued in 1801 to a chief of the Bedias
Indians. Nineteen years later, in 1820, white settlers established their ownership when the Burris
family settled in northern present-day Lufkin, and the settlement was then called Burris Prairie
(Boon 1937; Biesele 1996).
In 1846, a year after Texas’ accession as a state, Angelina County was formed from a part of
Nacogdoches County. An abundance of good timber and farmland, along with rivers navigable
by steamboat on both sides of the county provided ample opportunity for new settlers and
businesses so that by 1850 the population of Angelina County reached nearly 1,200 people, with
about 200 of those being slaves owned by large plantation owners who emigrated to the area
from the southern United States. By 1882, the Houston, East and West Railway reached what is
now Lufkin, further advancing the prosperity of the county. Over the next century the burgeoning
lumber industry and the discovery of oil and gas in Angelina County have contributed immensely
to the area’s economy and quality of life (Boon 1937; Biesele 1996).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around both prehistoric and historic patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and
social systems for the Northeast Texas Archaeological Region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator reviewed the Texas Archeological
Site database to determine what archaeological sites had been recorded within one mile of the
project area. Following that, a thorough review of the literature pertaining to the area was
conducted, and site and survey reports from the area were examined. Then, USGS 7.5 quadrangle
maps, a soils map, and a geological atlas sheet were consulted.
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey
Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian
survey of the pipeline ROW was conducted.
Surface visibility ranged from 10 to 100percent within the ROW. In addition, rodent
backdirt piles and crayfish chimneys were
common, a bladed bar ditch ran the entire
length of the pipeline ROW along FM1818, a
1 to 3-meter cutbank exposure was examined
along FM1818 east of Stovall Creek, and the
two-track road leading to Water Treatment Figure 5. Crayfish chimneys and rodent
Plant #2 provided greater than 50 percent
burrow backdirt piles were common along the
ROW.

surface visibility (see, for example Figures 5-7); all of these exposures were visually inspected
for the presence of cultural material.
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated over 4,000 feet of the pipeline ROW; six on each side
of Stovall Creek as shown in Figure 4. Shovel tests were excavated to a depth of at least 70 cm;
or if shallower, to the depth of sterile Pleistocene soils. The Scope of Work approved by the
Texas Historical Commission specified that if cultural materials were encountered from 60-70
cm, then additional levels would be excavated in an attempt to determine the vertical extent of
cultural deposits. All shovel test locations were mapped on field maps, and their locations
recorded with a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS).
Sediments from the shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments, and screened through 1/4inch wire mesh. The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms. The
Scope of Work specified that if cultural materials were encountered that indicated the likelihood
of an archaeological site, then additional shovel tests would be excavated at closer intervals
within the ROW in order to further define the horizontal extent of the site.
Cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the
surface or within shovel tests was not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented
via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Following that they would be returned to the
surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of shovel tests. Exceptions were to be those artifacts
which could be considered as particularly significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory,
such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. Those were to be
collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator
and/or the Project Archaeologist.

In addition, any buildings 45 years or older that were located on or adjacent to the pipeline ROW
were to be documented with photographs and included in a Draft and Final report of
investigations.

Results of the Investigation
Although modern trash items were observed on the surface and within the upper 20 cm of a few
of the 12 shovel tests, no prehistoric cultural material was observed, and no historic items that
would suggest a pre-1950s occupation. Locations of the shovel tests within the project area are
shown in Figure 4, and although the results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel
Test forms, a synthesis of the results is presented in Table 1.

Structures Around the Project Area that are, or Possibly Could Be, Older
than 45 Years
At the request of the 27 January 2010 letter from the SHPO, TAA took photographs of ‘possible’
1965 or earlier structures around the project area. They are included in Appendix A. Without
question, the Prairie Grove Missionary Baptist Church at the corner of FM1818 and Prairie
Grove Road pre-dates 1965, as there is an historic marker at that location suggesting that the
current church building was constructed in about 1921. However, the ages of the other frame
structures that are illustrated in Appendix A are only surmised as possibly being constructed
before 1965. To more accurately determine the ages of these structures, an architectual history
study beyond the scope of this Phase I cultural resources survey would be necessary.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility of sporadic
composites of barren soil within the project area was conducted, but no evidence of neither
prehistoric nor historic occupation of significance was found. In addition, no cultural materials
of significant value were found in any of a total of 12 shovel tests excavated. Therefore, we
recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor. The
project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archaeological
Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further archaeological work.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, work should
immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras
Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
