ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological assessment of two proposed gas line segments
(26,422 feet) and a proposed meter station site (150 square feet) on the Ellis prison unit
in northeast Walker County, Texas was performed in September and October 2000 by
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) under Texas Antiquities Permit 2405 with
William E. Moore the Principal Investigator. The total number of acres is 30.8. One
Late Prehistoric site (41WA259) was found within the 50 foot construction easement on
a sandy knoll overlooking Harmon Creek to the north. Cultural materials recovered
include chert, quartzite, and silicified wood debitage; one dart point fragment; one distal
tip; one scraper; and several ceramic fragments. An alternate route avoiding the site
was surveyed, and it is recommended that site 41WA259 be subjected to Phase II
testing if it cannot be avoided and protected. The artifacts and records have been
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
Mason L. Fargason of Via Oil Company in Houston, Texas contracted with BVRA
to perform a Phase I archaeological assessment of two proposed gas lines in northeast
Walker County, Texas (Figure 1) totaling 26,422 feet in length with a construction
easement of 50 feet and a meter station 150 square feet in size. Walker County
contains numerous significant archaeological sites. The location of the proposed routes
on elevated landforms near major streams such as Harmon Creek is considered to be a
likely area for the presence of prehistoric sites. Recognizing this potential, the Texas
Historical Commission requested an archaeological investigation. A research design
was submitted to the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, and Texas
Antiquities Permit number 2405 was issued to BVRA with William E. Moore the Principal
Investigator.
The first segment, designated by BVRA as Area A, is depicted on the Trinity
West topographic quadrangle (Figure 2) dated 1960 and photorevised 1972. It is
11,576 feet long. The 50 foot construction easement is 35 feet to the north of the center
line and 15 feet to the south of the center line. The stations are numbered from east to
west, and the average depth of the line is four feet. Total acreage for Area A is 13.3
acres.
The second segment, designated by BVRA as Area B, is depicted on the
Riverside (dated 1997) and Trinity West topographic quadrangles (Figure 3) and is
14,846 feet long. The 50 foot construction easement is 35 feet to the west of the center
line and 15 feet to the east of the center line. The stations are numbered from north to
south, and the average depth of the line is four feet. At the south end of Area B is a
meter station 150 square feet in size. Total acreage for Area B is 17.5 acres.
Although this report is the result of a collaborative effort by several individuals,
any conclusions presented are the sole responsibility of the Principal Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Walker County is located within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by
Blair (1950) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern
Texas. The western boundary of this province in Texas is approximated by a line
running north from western Harris County to western Red River County. The western
boundary of the Austroriparian is also the western boundary of the main body of the
pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf coastal plain (Blair 1950:99). According
to Thornthwaite (1948), these forests are limited on the west by available moisture.
The Project Area is located within the loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, and upland
hardwood plant community as defined by the United States Forest Service for the four
National Forests in East Texas. According to Ippolito (1983:6-7), the major forest cover
types in this community include loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, slash pine, post oak,
southern red oak, white oak, black oak, blackjack oak, black gum, sweet gum, American
elm, red maple, hickories, and beech. Approximately 70 percent of East Texas is
currently occupied by the Piney Woods with Post Oak Savannah and Blackland Prairie
in the rest of the region (Boyd and Howard 1988:4). Keller (1974:139-156) believes that
deciduous trees may have been more numerous during most of the Holocene and were
probably more important resources to prehistoric populations than the modern flora
would suggest.
The vertebrate fauna of the Austroriparian is considered typical of that to the
east. Blair (1950:99) states that at least 47 species of mammals occur or have occurred
there in recent times. Known types include at least 29 species of snakes, 10 lizards, 2
land turtles, 17 anurans, and 18 urodeles. Ippolito (1983:11) states that there is an
inadequate sample of faunal material for the area in an archaeological context.
Therefore, assumptions concerning prehistoric exploitation of animals must be based on
historical accounts and current populations.
A study by Keller (1974:78-81) of the paleoecology of the middle Neches region
lists those mammals most likely to have been hunted in the area. They are Whitetail
deer, Cottontail rabbit, Swamp rabbit, Grey squirrel, Fox squirrel, Flying squirrel,
Raccoon, Opossum, Red fox, Grey fox, Woodchuck, Bobcat, Spotted skunk, Striped
skunk, Mink, Otter, Long-tailed weasel, and Muskrat. According to Ippolito (1983:11),
this list excludes many species of birds, especially migratory fowl, and fish that can still
be found in the area. Species not found in the area today include Black bear, beaver,
and wild turkey. These were once numerous but were eradicated by uncontrolled
hunting and timber harvesting that irreparably altered their habitats.

5

The following climatic data were taken from McClintock et al. (1979). The
weather in Walker County consists of hot summers and cool winters. An occasional
cold front may cause temperatures to drop below freezing, sometimes quite suddenly.
The average winter temperature is 51 degrees Fahrenheit with an average daily
minimum of 41 degrees. In summer, the average is 82 degrees with an average daily
maximum of 94 degrees. The growing season has 234 days above freezing each year.
Prevailing winds are from the south-southeast. Rainfall is uniformly distributed
throughout the year, and snowfall is rare.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Although several significant studies involving prehistoric and historic sites have
been conducted in Walker County, most of the site data are based on survey level
studies with little or no subsurface testing. As a result, much of the information for
Walker County is taken from projects in surrounding areas such as Lake Livingston in
Polk and San Jacinto counties (McClurkan 1968; Ensor and Carlson 1988); Lake
Conroe in Montgomery County (McNatt 1978; Shafer 1968; Shafer and Stearns 1975);
Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National Forests (Fields 1979);
Davy Crockett National Forest (Bond and Moore 1980); Lake Creek Reservoir (Bement
et al. 1987); and the Gibbons Creek Mine in Grimes County (Rogers 1993, 1994, 1995).
Several overviews have been published which provide valuable data for Walker County
and vicinity. These are Indians of the Upper Texas Coast by Aten (1983), Comments
on Woodland Cultures of East Texas by Shafer (1975), and An Overview of the
Archaeology of East Texas by Story (1981).
More recently, five studies have been published which are worthy of mention.
These are Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document
compiled by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993);
Roger G. Moore's (1995) Ph.D. dissertation entitled The Mossy Grove Model of LongTerm Forager-Collector Adaptations in Inland Southeast Texas; Volume 66 of the
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society which reviews the current state of
Archeology in Texas and contains a chapter devoted to Southeast Texas (Patterson
1995); an archaeological study by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at the
Huntsville Fish Hatchery (Davis et al. 1994:20-33); and a survey for the Trinity River
Authority by Moore Archeological Consulting (Moore and Moore 1996:6-12).
The work by Moore Archeological Consulting (Moore and Moore 1996) is
particularly noteworthy because of the database created from encoding site data for all
known sites in Walker County at the time of this project. This database, presented in
Moore and Moore (1995), was an attempt to define settlement rules specific to Walker
County through the application of an empirical analysis cross-tabulating site data with
environmental variables and was based, as stated above, on the computerization of
data from all of the existing TARL site records for the county. In all, 181 sites were used
for this study; however the analyses utilized only those sites with prehistoric
components since the sample size for historic sites is inadequate and the settlement
criteria for historic sites location are much different and currently more ambiguous than
for prehistoric sites. This study found that prehistoric sites seem to be found throughout
the county where suitable landforms (sandy ridges and knolls) exist in close proximity to
dependable water sources. The only large concentrations of prehistoric sites are the
result of large area surveys. Single sites along major drainages should not be
interpreted as sparse use of an area; rather, these sites were probably recorded by
individuals with restricted access to larger areas.

7

Chronometric dates for inland Southeast Texas are rare. Many sites in this area
have been assigned to cultural periods by other means such as cross-dating artifacts
with similar types from sites in other areas where absolute dates have been obtained.
Only six prehistoric sites in Walker County have been formally tested by
professional archaeologists. These are 41WA82 (McNatt 1978), 41WA97 (Boyd and
Howard 1988), 41WA105 and 41WA108 (Davis et al. 1994), 41WA185 (Gaddus and
Fields 1997), and 41WA218 (Kingsborough and Mangum 2000).
The Kaygal site (41WA82) was tested by Texas A&M University in 1977 (McNatt
1978) and represents the first reported subsurface investigation of a prehistoric site in
Walker County. Based on the association of sandy paste ceramics with contracting
stem dart points, the site was assigned to the Early Ceramic Period (200 B.C. - A.D.
900). One contracting stem arrow point fragment may indicate a Late Ceramic Period
occupation (A.D. 900 - A.D. 1700). The excavators state that additional work at this site
will not yield new information regarding the prehistoric life ways of the region.
Therefore, mitigation was not recommended.
Site 41WA97, located in the Sam Houston National Forest, was tested by Prewitt
& Associates, Inc. in 1988 (Boyd and Howard 1988). This investigation revealed a
multi-component site containing Early and Late Ceramic period occupations. Due to
extensive bioturbation and a lack of features and natural or cultural stratification, it was
not possible to separate the components into discrete analytical units. Therefore, no
further work was warranted.
Site 41WA105 (Davis et al. 1994) on a high sandy terrace overlooking Harmon
Creek was tested by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1989. Backhoe
trenching and hand excavation encountered cultural deposits to a depth of three meters
and identified Late Ceramic, possible Early Ceramic, and Archaic occupations in a
relatively stratified sequence. Calculating the recovery from those units where
volumetric control was maintained, the site has a composite lithic artifact density of 31
specimens per cubic meter (Davis et al. 1994:59). The prehistoric component is buried
in sandy sediments and is represented by quantities of debitage (chert, quartzite, and
silicified wood); arrow points, dart points, and other chipped stone tools; sandy paste
and tempered ceramic sherds; burned nut shell; and ground and pecked stone artifacts
(Davis et al. 1994:52-59). One feature was encountered; a grouping of sandstone rocks
that are described by the authors (Davis et al. 1994:61) as "a complete nut processing
and milling tool kit." Site 41WA105 was judged to be eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D: the property may be likely to yield
information important in prehistory (United States Department of the Interior 1982:1).
Site 41WA108 (Davis et al. 1994) is a prehistoric/historic site on a high alluvial
terrace approximately ten meters above Harmon Creek was tested by the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department in 1989. Due to the low density of cultural resource materials
and lack of diagnostic materials or features, the site is not considered significant (Davis
et al. 1994:69).

8

Site 41WA185 was tested by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. (Gaddus and Fields
1997) in 1996. Diagnostic artifacts, four radiocarbon dates, and vertical distribution of
artifacts suggest that the site contains two primary components; early and middle Late
Prehistoric period and Woodland-Late Prehistoric transition. Because these
components are isolable, and because they contain sufficient artifacts to permit
interpretation, the site has the capacity to yield important information regarding the
prehistory of the Walker County area. Therefore, the site was recommended for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places and as a State Archeological
Landmark (Gaddus and Fields 1996:v).
Site 41WA218 was tested under the supervision of Walter D. Kingsborough of
the National Forest and Grasslands office in Lufkin in March 2000 using volunteer labor.
This project is one of the largest conducted in the area with 40 cubic meters of earth
being excavated to a depth of 3.36 meters. Over 6000 artifacts were recovered
including a number of diagnostic points in a chronologically stratified archeological
deposit that reflects relatively little mixing due to turbation. Only arrow points were
found in the upper levels with a clear separation between them and dart points. At 2.20
meters, a gray chert Bulverde point was recovered, and a non-diagnostic scraper was
found at 2.60 meters. Flakes were found at 3.36 meters. No historic material below the
root matte and no plow zone were encountered (Walter D. Kingsborough, personal
communication to William E. Moore, May 28, 2001). The report is still in draft form.

FIELD METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator checked the site records at
TARL on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin for the presence of previously
recorded sites in the project area and vicinity.
The main focus of this investigation was a Phase I pedestrian survey of the entire
project area. Two separate segments are proposed for the gas line installation. These
were designated as Area A and Area B (see Introduction above). Area A was surveyed
first on September 26, 2000. Shovel tests were concentrated in undisturbed areas and
on the single sandy hill in this area. All excavated dirt was screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was kept (Appendix I). The majority of tests were
excavated to clay (50 cm or less), while a few of the deeper tests (greater than 50 cm)
on the sandy hill did not reach clay after excavating at least two negative levels. There
were several disturbed areas where soils were shallow and visibility was excellent. No
shovel tests were excavated in these areas. In all, 28 shovel tests were dug in Area A.
The investigation of Area B began on September 27, 2000. The same survey
methods followed at Area A were practiced here. The shovel tests are documented in
Appendix II. The soil in this area contained more areas of deep sand than in Area A.
After crossing Harmon Creek, one shovel test (49) revealed the presence of a
prehistoric site (1 flake). This test was dug to 90 cm, and no clay was encountered.
The site was found in the area where the line turns at Point-of-Intersection (PI) 7. This
locality was assigned the temporary number PI 7 (later changed to 41WA259).
Additional tests were excavated in the area of the discovery test to determine site
boundaries, depth, and hopefully to recover diagnostic artifacts. Flakes, shatter, and
ceramics were recovered in three of the tests (50-52). In all, 24 tests were dug.
The crew returned the next day (September 28, 2000) and excavated twenty
tests in the site area (Appendix III) and continued surveying along the proposed right-ofway. Additional flakes and a dart point base were found in Shovel Test 53. Shovel
tests 54-72 were sterile. Although several areas south of site 41WA259 appeared to be
high probability areas for prehistoric sites based on the topographic map, no sites were
found.
On September 29, 2000, the crew returned to site 41WA259 and dug 23 shovel
tests (Appendix IV). Tests 73 and 74 produced artifacts.
All artifacts were collected and bagged for future analysis and curation. Field
sketches were made of each shovel test profile, and the artifacts were cataloged by
level; the tests were dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels. The crew continued to survey the
route and found no additional sites. In all, 66 shovel tests were dug in Area B along the
original right-of-way. At the southern end of the right-of-way a meter station is
proposed. One shovel test in the center and one was placed at each corner.

10

The client was informed of the possibility of having to test 41WA259 and elected
to survey an alternate route that would avoid this site. On October 5, 2000, the crew
returned to the area and, in cooperation with the engineers, surveyed a route to the
west of 41WA259. The new route is in a low area below the edge of the knoll on which
site WA259 is located. Five shovel tests were dug in this area (Appendix V) with one
(96) on the western slope of the hill producing flakes and one ceramic fragment. The
final number of shovel tests dug on this project is 100.
Shovel tests were concentrated along the centerline where the gas line will be
placed. Although the construction easement is 50 feet in width, the actual area where
the subsurface will be affected is much less. According to Gene Woods (personal
communication, October 6, 2000), a 3" pipe will be used and may be installed using a
trenching machine that will only disturb an area of about 6" in width. The depth of the
trench will be 30" of fill over the pipe, resulting in a 36" deep trench. The rest of the
construction easement is for the use of vehicles and equipment storage during
construction. All new pipe placements will be in open areas, and no trees or other
major shrubs will be cut down.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The archival research indicated no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. No historic sites were observed; however, the field surveyors identified
and recorded prehistoric site 41WA259 on a sandy hill overlooking a tributary of
Harmon Creek to the north (Figure 3). The main channel of Harmon Creek is
approximately 300 meters north of the site. Since the survey was restricted to a
predetermined right-of-way, the entire site area was not shovel tested. The only
statement that can be made in terms of the size of 41WA259 is that artifacts were found
in shovel tests over an area approximately 38 meters north-south and 20 meters eastwest. A local informant told the field survey crew that the site does extend to the east
outside the project area boundaries. Figure 4 depicts the site boundaries as well as the
new centerline that was surveyed in order to miss the main site area. The shovel tests
in the site area are identified by symbols that indicate kinds of artifacts found in the
positive tests. It should be stated here that additional shovel tests were excavated to
the north and west of Shovel Test 97 and the new Point-of-Intersection 7; however, they
are too far away to be depicted on Figure 4. The sandy soils that were encountered in
the site area and during shovel testing are relatively shallow with clay found between 20
and 50 cm below the existing ground surface with clay closer to the surface to the north
where the landform slopes to the creek. It was also noted that the color of the sandy
horizon was uniform throughout the project area with the exception of mottling just
above the underlying clay.
There is not enough evidence to make a definite statement as to the function of
site 41WA259. Normally the presence of pottery, tools, and lithic debitage are viewed
as indicators of a campsite, and there is no reason to believe otherwise. The artifacts
recovered consist of lithics and ceramics. The lithic sample consists of 46 pieces of
lithic debitage, two projectile point fragments (a distal tip and a base of a Gary or Kent
dart point), and 1 modified flake (made into an end scraper) that were analyzed by
William A. Dickens (Appendix II). The majority of flakes was made from local materials
such as quartzite and silicified wood. The dart point base is fragmentary; therefore,
measurements for this specimen were not taken. It resembles the Gary type, but this is
only conjecture. It is illustrated in the Lithic Analysis section of this report (Appendix VI).
The ceramic sample numbers 15 sherds. After matching broken sherds and
eliminating one specimen that was found to be less than 3/8 inch in size, only eight
sherds were analyzed by Linda Wootan Ellis (Appendix VII). The ceramics consist of 5
sandy paste (Goose Creek) specimens, 1 grog-tempered sherd, and two bone-and-grog
tempered specimens. According to Ms. Ellis, the two "bone-and-grog tempered sherds
are relatively rare in the Upper Texas Coastal region." She also states that this may be
a function of under-reporting rather than rarity of occurrence. According to Ellis, the
small sample size "makes it difficult to draw specific conclusions about the 41WA259
ceramic assemblage...” See Appendix VII for detailed analysis of the ceramic
assemblage.

Although the age of site 41WA259 can't be stated with any degree of certainty, it
can be said that it dates to the Late Prehistoric period during which time pottery was in
use. The presence of one dart point resembling the Gary and Kent types may date the
site to the Middle to Transitional Archaic period with time ranges from 2500 B.C. to A.D.
800. The location of 41WA259 is consistent with some of the findings by Moore
Archeological Consulting as a result of the computerized database created from the
Walker County site records at TARL. It is located in close proximity to a natural source
of fresh water. According to the database, slightly more than 68 percent of sites in the
county are situated 150 meters or less from water. It is located on an upland terrace
(based on the presence of Falba soils) and, according to the database, 81.3 percent of
Walker County sites occur within landforms unambiguously classifiable as topographic
high points such as hills and ridges. In summary, the environmental setting where site
41WA259 is situated is ideal for prehistoric utilization, an upland sandy terrace
overlooking a confluence of two streams in close proximity to the site area.
The significance of site 41WA259 is not known; however, there is reason to
believe that it may possess research potential. Lithics and ceramics were found in
virtually every shovel test excavated in the site area (Figure 4) and were obviously
made from local gravels and clays. Flakes were uniformly distributed vertically
throughout the sandy mantle, while ceramics were only found between 41 and 70 cm.
This may signal a separate, isolable ceramic component. The confinement of ceramics
to a relatively narrow zone may indicate the preservation of some degree of cultural
stratigraphy. The presence of flakes above and below this zone may be an indicator
that some of the debitage has moved vertically due to natural forces such as turbation.
If the latter is the case this could be a single component site.
The presence of bone-and-grog tempered sherds within the sample of ceramics
suggests additional interesting and perhaps rarely documented pottery specimens may
be present at this site. This could provide useful data for the ceramic period of the
Upper Texas Coast. While the lithic sample is not particularly large, an average of 5.75
flakes were recovered from each positive shovel test.
Significance testing is necessary to ascertain the degree of integrity within the
site. It is admitted here that the above statements regarding potential site significance
are based on limited shovel test results.
The Minimum Survey Standards published by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division regarding linear projects was followed during this study. In
addition, a Research Design was submitted with the permit application that outlined the
methods to be followed.

14

RECOMMENDATIONS
No sites were found in Area A. It is, therefore, recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed in this area as planned.
One prehistoric site (41WA259) was found in Area B. Although the site is viewed
by BVRA to contain research potential, its significance has not been confirmed.
Because of the potential for significance, the client elected to survey a route to the east
in order to bypass the site. This was done; however, flakes and ceramics were found in
shovel test 96 at the eastern boundary of the new right-of-way (Figure 4). It is
recommended that additional shovel tests be excavated in the alternate route or that the
area be subjected to monitoring in order to ensure that significant deposits are not
destroyed.
Should significant cultural deposits be found in the new right-of-way, all
construction must stop until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division,
Texas Historical Commission. If the original route is selected additional shovel tests
and test units are recommended prior to construction.

APPENDIX VI: LITHIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
Three lithic artifacts and 46 pieces of debitage were recovered from eight
shovel tests at site 41WA259. The artifacts include two fragmentary projectile
points and one edge modified flake utilized as an end scraper. The artifacts were
sorted into categories, and each specimen was individually analyzed with the
data recorded on coding forms. The results were statistically computed and
studied.
Artifacts
Projectile Points (n = 2)
The fragments of two projectile points were recovered. These were
identified as a stemmed base (Shovel Test 53, Level 8) and a tip (Shovel Test
73, Level 3) of two separate dart points. The basal fragment (Figure 1) is a crude
example, as it contains only a single shoulder. There is some basal damage
preventing an exact assignment by type, but the remaining portion resembles
both the Gary and Kent types. These points are common forms for the Middle to
Transitional Archaic (2500 B.C. - A.D. 500-700) of East Texas as described by
Turner and Hester (1985:101, 110). The basal specimen is made of quartzite
that has been subjected to fire that has turned the surface of the material a dark
red. The tip, like the basal fragment, cannot be identified by type other than as
part of a dart point. It is also made from quartzite and, like the basal fragment,
has been subjected to fire, resulting in potlids and a color change.

Figure 1. Dart Point Base.

Edge Modified Flakes (n = 1)
A single flake (Shovel Test 73, Level 3) was use modified into a very small
end scraper. It is made on a small flake, having one edge that is turned down
slightly. This edge has been modified into a unifacial micro-flaked edge that was
created when the flake's edge was scraped across a hard surface. This is a
common type of expedient tool made on a waste flake could be used for a
number of activities such as hide processing and wood working. The polishing
activities of the soil from which it was found has polished the entire surface to a
glossy state that makes it impossible to identify use wear of this specimen. It is
made of a very good grade of silicified wood that has been heated by fire that
turned the entire flake a dark red.
Debitage (n = 46)
The analysis of flake debitage is an invaluable tool in determining a
number of activities and strategies that were conducted at a particular site. To
accomplish this, a number of attributes were coded for and recorded for a
statistical evaluation. This process began with the size grading of each flake. It
has been determined that reductive processes and stages of reduction for
bifacial tool manufacture can be defined through the maximum size of a flake
(Ahler 1989; Stahle and Dunn 1982:86). Each flake was size graded through a
series of eight nested screens. The screen sizes are: (1) 50 mm; (2) 37.5 mm;
(3) 25 mm; (4) 19 mm; (5) 12.5 mm; (6) 9.5 mm; (7) 6.3 mm; and (8) less than
6.3 mm.
Additional debitage variables coded for included material type,
presence/absence of cortex, heat treatment, striking platform preparation, type of
bulb of percussion, and flake termination. The type of raw material is useful in
determining the method and range of material procurement, preparation,
reduction, and ultimate artifact morphology (Dockall 1991; Shafer 1971). The
presence and amount of cortex helps determine the type and degree of reduction
applied to a core or flake. For example, some of the local raw materials found in
the project area are small chert cobbles that are completely covered with a hard
cortex that is unsuitable for tool use. Thus, as the cobble is reduced during tool
manufacture this cortex is removed and, as the cobble is further reduced, the
amount of cortex is proportionately reduced until finally removed. Three cortex
categories have been established: (1) primary decortication flakes (those
completely covered with cortex on the platform and most of the dorsal surface),
(2) secondary decortication flakes (those partially covered with varying amounts
of cortex on the platform and dorsal surface), and (3) tertiary decortication (flakes
that have no cortex).

2

The identification of heat alteration can help determine whether
purposefully annealing has occurred, or if heating was from some other factor.
The platform is the flat surface on top of a flake where the blow removing the
flake was received (Whittaker 1994:14). These are either natural (cortex
covered) or prepared, and their use is a variable controlled by the knapper
(Whittaker 1994:91). Thus, the recognition of platform types can help to further
determine reduction strategies.
The type of bulb of percussion (a swelling located immediately below the
platform) is usually an indicator of whether a hard hammer (stone) precursor or a
soft hammer (bone or wood) precursor was used. Very prominent bulbs usually
indicate hard hammer use and more flattened, and diffuse bulbs indicate soft
hammer use (Whittaker 1994:185).
Finally, successful tool manufacture is dependant on each successive
flake removal. When a flake is removed from a core or biface, a "scar" is left on
the core or the surface of a biface, and the type of termination of the scar can
determine whether additional flakes can be removed with desired results. The
most desirable termination type is known as "feathered." Flakes exhibiting
feather terminations contain distal and lateral edges that are thin and sharp. This
flake type will allow additional flakes to be removed with little problem. However,
"stack" or "hinge" terminations may prevent additional flake removal by failing to
detach evenly or smoothly. Such terminations usually result in a buildup of
materials and/or diving into the surface forming "valleys," both of which could
result in unsuccessful reduction and failed tool manufacture.
Results
Walker County lies within a region containing few quality raw materials.
The local chert occurs as small gravel mixed with varying quantities of quartzite,
jasper, and silicified wood. Silicified wood is an abundant material found
throughout the region. It occurs in varying forms of quality. By far, the most
abundant form is of poor quality not suitable for tool manufacture, but some
forms are highly "silicified" and are excellent for flaking and tool manufacture.
The chert gravels are highly variable in form and quality and, as
mentioned previously, are usually small, especially when compared to the chert
gravels of the Brazos River (Dickens 1995:179-181). Regardless of their size,
these gravels were used extensively for tool manufacture. Jasper, and
occasionally chalcedony and opalized wood, are raw materials occasionally
used.

A list of the raw material types and counts from the testing is provided in
Table 1. It can be seen from this table that the most commonly utilized materials
are quartzite with 27 flakes (58.7%) and silicified wood with 10 flakes (21.7%).
Quartzite, although knappable, is not usually a favored material. It tends to be
difficult to thin and often results in flake step and hinge fractures. The abundant
presence of this material probably indicates its abundance within the region. A
single opal/opalite flake was recovered. This is a beautiful material that is usually
of excellent knapping quality and is distinguished by a clear translucency or
occasionally a slightly opaque white color. Chert was also represented (10.7%)
but less than either the quartzite or silicified wood indicating a lesser availability
of this material within the region.
Table 1. Totals of Debitage by Material and Shovel Test.

Nineteen flakes are complete, twenty are proximal portions, and the rest
are fragments of shatter. This means that most of the flakes were complete
enough to record most of their attributes. Table 2 provides a list of the flake
grades by shovel test. Reviewing this table, it can be seen that the majority of
the flakes fell within Grade 7 with grades 6 and 8 the next most abundant. No
flakes were larger than 12.5 mm or 1/2 inch. Table 3 lists the presence of cortex
for each of the flakes by shovel test. From this table it can be seen that the
majority (87%) of the flakes are tertiary or interior. In addition, twelve flakes were
recognized as "pressure" flakes, or those removed by use of a small antler tine or
bone sliver by a slow application of pressure rather than by hitting or striking it
with a large hammer precursor. This indicates that the primary lithic activities
conducted at the site were probably for tool maintenance and/or rejuvenation.
This is further supported by the majority of the platforms (59%) being natural
(cortex removed) or prepared and thirty (65%) with diffuse bulbs of percussion.
The fact that almost 70% of the artifacts were subjected to heat indicates that the
region was subjected to a number of fires. Whether these fires were natural or
culturally initiated cannot be definitely ascertained.

Conclusions
The results of the analysis of the artifacts recovered in the eight shovel
tests suggest that the site was used for hunting or other procurement activities
that also includes tool re-sharpening and/or maintenance tasks. There is no
evidence, such as large or primary flakes or unfinished bifaces, that would
indicate that primary tool manufacturing tasks had occurred. The two fragmented
projectile points and the single flake scraper supports the conclusions for tool
maintenance.
The presence of so much heated material may indicate that fire was
responsible for the damage to the projectile points; however, this is probably
doubtful. Quartzite, for example, does not fracture easily from minor contacts
with fire. In fact, it is often used for "boiling" stones in cooking activities as the
material will stand up and resist fracture during repeated episodes of heating in
fire and cooling by submersion in water. However, it will turn color, such as red,
which is a result of the presence of iron within the material's mineral composition.
Although not discussed above, Table 4 shows that the distribution of the
debitage is spread equally throughout levels 1 through 7 with the majority found
within levels 1 through 5. This indicates the density of the site to be located in
the upper 50 centimeters. The basal fragment, however, occurred in Level 8,
indicating a possible disturbance from animal or plant turbation that may have
caused the piece to work itself deeper into the site.
