ABSTRACT
During the middle of September 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 4.31 miles of
proposed water pipeline route which is to be constructed by the Golden
Water Supply Corporation. The archaeological survey was done for
Resource Management and Consulting Company which is doing the
environmental permitting. The proposed pipeline route is located
approximately 1.25 miles northeast of Grand Saline in Van Zandt County,
Texas. This upland route crosses four upland ridges and the headwaters of
four unnamed, intermittent tributaries. Part of the route parallels an
abandoned railroad route and half of the route parallels farm-to-market
roads. Surface visibility in the upland area was good and the subsoil was
generally shallowly buried or was exposed on the surface. All of the
pipeline route, except for the portion of the route adjacent to the railroad,
was surveyed for cultural resources. Shovel testing was done where
ground visibility was less than 50 percent but not along roads where
surface exposure was good and the ground had been disturbed from road
construction and buried telephone cable in places.
No cultural resources were seen on the ground surface or found in 12
shovel tests. The absence of cultural resources is attributable to the lack of
perennial water. Although roads and the railroad are present, no historic
sites were observed and recorded. Based upon the absence of
archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that Golden Water
Supply Corporation be allowed to construct the pipeline. In addition, we
recommend that if buried cultural materials are found during construction,
work should stop in that area immediately and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified. Work should not
continue until discussions with the Texas Historical Commission have
been concluded.

INTRODUCTION
The Golden Water Supply Corporation intends to construct approximately 4.31 miles of
water pipeline route approximately 1.25 miles northeast of Grand Saline in Van Zandt
County, Texas. During the middle of September 2007, archaeologists from AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed
pipeline route for Resource Management and Consulting Company which is doing the
environmental permitting for the Golden Water Supply Corporation. The proposed
pipeline route is divided into three connected portions (Figure 1). The first portion begins
south of and parallel to FM 1815 approximately 2,865 feet east of the intersection of FMs
1815 and 1829 and runs southwest to the intersection. The route then continues southwest
for approximately 2,160 feet southwest of the intersection. At this point, the proposed
route crosses an existing railroad berm and departs FM 1829 and parallels the northwest
side of the railroad berm for about 2,365 feet. The route then crosses the berm going east
for approximately 725 feet before turning south for about 1,185 feet where it terminates.
The second portion begins approximately 950 feet southwest of the intersection of the
railroad berm and FM 1829. The route runs at an angle to FM 1829 where it turns south
and terminates approximately 1,545 feet north of Rodgers Cemetery. The third portion
parallels FM 1829 on the east side and begins approximately 2,920 feet north of Rodgers
Cemetery, runs south and terminates about 2,980 feet south of the cemetery. It should be
noted that FM 1829 runs in a large U-shaped pattern so that the proposed pipeline route
encounters it twice (Figure 1).
The archaeological survey was done after a request from the Texas Historical
Commission dated August 24, 2007. The portion of the pipeline route along the old
railroad berm was excluded from the survey. Although portions of the area were surveyed
in 1971, the archaeological survey standards today are much stricter and the 1971 survey
was for a lake and not an upland pipeline route.
The scope of the project included a records review and a summary of fieldwork done in
the surrounding area, a field survey of the possible site situations, and a final report. This
report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(ND). The following report contains a brief of the natural environment and then a
summary of previous investigations in the area as known from published sources. This is
followed by a research design and methodology and a description of the field findings.
The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the survey. A list of references
cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Van Zandt County lies within the Western Coastal Plain, Texas Claypan Area and the
Texas Blackland Prairie. The topography ranges from gently undulating to rolling. Soils
formed under timber and savannahs are generally lighter in color than those formed under
prairie grasses. Numerous creeks and streams drain the area. Streams north of Canton and
Wills Point flow north into the Sabine River while streams west of Wills Point and
Canton drain into the Trinity River. Streams in the southeastern part of the county flow
into the Neches River (Stringer 1998:1).
The underlying geology of the entire area is the undivided Wilcox Group which is an
Eocene age formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1965). This formation is composed
of mostly silty and sandy clay.
The soils in the immediate area are categorized as belonging to the Woodtell-Freestone
Soil Association (Stringer 1998: General Soil Map). The Woodtell-Freestone Soil
Association contains very gently to sloping upland loams. The surface soils usually aare
loams that have a clay subsoil, and the subsoil becomes less clayey with depth. The
Woodtell and Freestone soils formed under post oak, red oak, blackjack oak, hickory,
sweetgum and elm trees (Stringer 1988:5). Specific soils along the proposed pipeline
route consist of Freestone sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes, frequently flooded
Nahatche loam and Woodtell loam with 2 to 5 and 5 to 12 percent slopes (Stringer
1988:Sheets 10 and 11). The E horizon for the Freestone and Woodtell series is at 5
inches (12.5 cm) below the ground surface while the subsoil for the Freestone series is 16
inches (40 cm) and for the Woodtell is 8 inches (20 cm) below the ground surface
(Stringer 1988:67, 80-81). The drainage crossed by FM 1815 and the closest one
southeast of FM 1829 contain frequently flooded Nahatche loam and its subsoil is listed
as being (20 cm) below the ground surface (Stringer 1988:72).
All drainages present within the study area are mapped as intermittent and the proposed
pipeline route crosses their headwaters close to their mapped origins.
The study area is located in the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest plant community which is
part of the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987:
Figure 1). Major timber trees are pine, oak, hickory, cedar elm, and sweet gum. Other
hardwood associations are found in low, wet bottomlands. Understory vegetation
includes green briar, sumac, poison ivy, yaupon, wild grape, crape myrtle, dogwood, and
many other species. This is in the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950: 99). The
province also contains 47 mammal species, 29 snake, 10 lizard, 2 land turtles, 17 anuran
and 10 urodeles species. Five mammal species, 2 snake and 8 urodeles species reach their
western limit in this province.

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The only major archaeological investigation carried out in Van Zandt County was the
WPA excavation of the Yarbrough site which is located in the northwestern part of the
county just south of the Sabine River (Johnson 1962). In addition, an archaeological
reconnaissance of the floodpool for the proposed Mineola Reservoir (Malone 1972)
resulted in recording ninety sites but the study indicated that site density decreased as
upstream distance increased.
To summarize the archaeology of the area, it has been shown that settlement began some
time during the Late Archaic period probably before the time of Christ (Story 1981; Story
et al. 1990). In 1975, the Lake Fork Reservoir was surveyed by Southern Methodist
University (Bruseth et al. 1977). Of the approximately 27,690 acres surveyed, 109 new
recorded prehistoric sites were recorded and 21 prehistoric sites were revisited. The sites
ranged in age from circa 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 1500. Thirteen sites were recommended for
further research which was done by Bruseth and Perttula (1981). Site types found during
excavation consisted of lithic scatters with associated storage pits, and scattered burials to
possible residences. Organized cemeteries are indicated but no direct evidence was
found. The analyses of the excavated sites indicated that through time, the occupation
shifted away from Lake Fork Creek and its tributaries to Caney Creek and its drainages,
possibly due to the climate becoming drier and the Blackland Prairie moving eastward. .
No evidence of historic Native American settlement has been reported in the immediate
area (Perttula 1992:177), although Indian groups are reported in the region during the
1800s.
Historic European settlement began in the early 1800s. The Tyler area, including the
study area, was settled well before the Civil War (Thoms 1998, 2000). In fact, the Neches
Saline to the south and Steen Saline east of Lindale provided salt for the TransMississippi South during the Civil War. Historic occupation has continued to the present
although numerous changes in land use and community organization have occurred over
the past one hundred and fifty years.
Previous Investigations
Drainages within the study area were surveyed during the archaeological survey for the
proposed Mineola Reservoir (Malone 1972), but no archaeological sites were discovered
(Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2007).
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2005) conducted an archaeological survey of two ridges
west of Grand Saline Creek and south of town of Grand Saline. No archaeological sites
were found on the surface or discovered in six shovel tests. Also, AR Consultants, Inc.
(Skinner and Kent 2000; Todd 2006, 2007) has conducted two archaeological surveys of
pipeline routes that start at Lake Tawakoni in Van Zandt County that run southwest. One
site, 41VN8, was monitored during the construction of the pipeline. No significant
cultural features or burials were uncovered.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design outlined below was to insure that fieldwork made a
contribution to better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement not only for
Van Zandt County, but the State of Texas as well.
It is predicted that prehistoric sites will not be present in the upland due to the significant
distance from perennial water. The drainages in the area are mapped as intermittent and
close to their headwaters. No evidence of reliable springs is noted on the USGS, SCS or
by the earlier lake survey.
Historic sites might be present close to transportation routes, but no residences but no
residences older than fifty years are shown on the 1959 Grand Saline, Texas 7.5’ USGS
map, the proposed pipeline route. Therefore, no historic sites are expected.
Methodology
The area of potential effect for these new lines will be a construction easement that is
fifty feet wide. The pipeline will be placed in the center of the easement. It is anticipated
that pipes will have three feet of fill over them and the trenches will be four feet deep.
The bottom of a trench will be at least six inches wide which is the largest pipe size.
Nearly all of the line will be installed in trenches excavated by trenching machines.
In order to address the Research Design questions, the creek crossings and upland areas
adjacent to the creeks were surveyed and shovel tested, where appropriate, for evidence
of prehistoric occupation as suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). The
portion of the pipeline route along the railroad berm was not surveyed due to the
disturbance of the land during its construction. Based on the depths to the subsoil,
backhoe trenching was not done. Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 35 cm
below the ground surface due to the upland setting and the loamy soil was screened
through a 1/4-inch hardware cloth screen. The pit walls were visually examined for
cultural materials. Notes were made on the topography, vegetation, soils, and other
relevant material and photographs were taken.

RESULTS
In this portion of the report, the archaeological survey is described as well as the study
area. The proposed pipeline route consists of three connected portions and each portion is
described separately. Shovel tests are described generally in the text and specific
information is provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations are plotted on Figure 1.
From west of and adjacent to FM 1815 to southeast of railroad berm.
The survey began at a fence marking a residence boundary at the east end of FM 1815.
The proposed water pipeline route begins here and runs west paralleling FM 1815 on the
south side. Vegetation along this portion of the route consisted of oak and hackberry trees
and understory vegetation of bermuda grass, saw green briar, berry vines and other grass
species. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 to 100 percent. The ground visibility
on the ridge where the pipeline route begins is shown in Figure 2. Eye-height visibility
was excellent throughout this portion of the survey.

No shovel tests were excavated on the ridge because of the excellent ground visibility.
However, shovel test 1 was excavated 3 m from the east bank of a mapped unnamed
intermittent tributary of Caney Creek and shovel test 2 was dug 3 m from the west bank.
The tributary is approximately 2 m wide and 4 m deep. Water was flowing over a sandy,

loamy clay substrate and was less than 0.25 m deep. No buried cultural materials were
seen in the vertical creek banks.
Shovel test 1 uncovered 37 cm of sandy loam that contained traces of clay at the bottom
of the shovel test, and shovel test 2 encountered 28 cm of clayey loam overlying sandy
loam that extended to 35 cm below the ground surface. Both shovel tests were culturally
sterile.
From shovel test 2 east to the next ridge, sand had been placed in large piles along the
slope; therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. The ground visibility along the second
ridge was about 80 percent and no shovel tests were excavated. From the ridge to where
the proposed pipeline route encounters the railroad berm, the pipeline route is to be
constructed in front of residences. The USGS map shows a residence southwest of the
drainage but actually two wooden houses are present and are less than 50 years old. The
other housed along FM 1829 also are constructed of wood and are less than 50 years old.
No evidence of prehistoric occupation, knappable lithic resources, signature plants or
historic structures was seen.
At the railroad berm, the proposed pipeline route continues southwest and parallels the
northwest side of the berm. This portion of the route was not surveyed due to the
disturbance from construction of the railroad berm.
The proposed pipeline route then turns east crossing the railroad berm and then turns
south. Vegetation similar to that already described is present as well as hackberry
saplings that have approximately 1 to 2 inch thick trunks. Shovel test 3 was excavated
along the pipeline route although most the route had 60 to 80 percent ground visibility
from cows walking adjacent to the fence which the route parallels and due to erosion. The
shovel test uncovered 36 cm of sandy loam. The proposed route then turns south and two
shovel tests (4 and 5) were placed in hay pastures where the ground visibility was less
than 20 percent. The shovel tests uncovered 35 and 37 cm sandy loam, respectively. The
area between the two hay pastures was extremely eroded and had ground visibility of
approximately 90 percent (Figure 3). The sandy loam surface had scattered
goethite/limonite rocks with a few pieces of petrified wood covering it.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or found in the
five shovel tests during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey from the beginning
of the proposed pipeline route south of and adjacent to FM 1815 to southeast of the
railroad berm.
From the railroad berm to FM 1829 north of Rodgers Cemetery.
Survey began at the railroad berm and went northwest. The proposed pipeline route runs
northeast of and parallel to a TXU electric transmission line through improved (Figure 4)
and unimproved pasture. Vegetation consisted of johnson grass, saw greenbriar, berry
vines, snow-on-the prairie and other grass species. Ground visibility ranged from less
than 10 to 80 percent. Eye-height visibility was excellent. Although shovel tests were

excavated northeast of the existing transmission line corridor, ridges southwest of the
corridor were examined. No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface of the
ridges despite the excellent ground visibility (Figure 5).

Figure 3.

Eroded area between the two hay pastures after proposed water pipeline
route turns south. Note the good to excellent ground visibility. View is to
the north.

Seven shovel tests were excavated on benches along the proposed pipeline route where
the ground visibility was less than 50 percent. Shovel tests 6 through 10 encountered
sandy, loamy clay that ranged from 35 to 41 cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 11
encountered 42 cm of loamy clay and shovel test 12 uncovered 37 cm of mottled loamy
clay. All of the shovel tests were culturally sterile.
Three tributaries to Caney Creek were encountered during this portion of the
archaeological survey. The drainage between FM 1829 and FM 1808 is approximately 2
m wide and a meter deep. No shovel tests were excavated due to the good ground
visibility on both sides of the drainage. The two drainages between FM 1808 and the
western FM 1829 ranged from about 2 to 3 wide and 1.5 to 2 m deep. The southeastern
drainage was dry while the northeastern one contained ponded water. Both substrates
consisted of sandy, loamy clay and goethite/hematite. No buried cultural materials were
seen in the vertical banks. These drainages already had been surveyed during the Mineloa
Reservoir survey; therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. In addition, ground visibility
was good, at least 50 percent, on both sides of the drainages.

East side of FM 1829 north and south of Rodgers Cemetery.
This portion of the proposed pipeline route was evaluated based upon its location and the
lack of cultural materials found on the surface and in the shovel tests in the other portions
of the proposed pipeline route. The proposed pipeline route runs through unimproved and
improved pasture as well as in front of two residences. The northernmost residence was
constructed of wood while the southern one was built of brick. No locations likely to
contain prehistoric archaeological sites or knappable lithic materials were seen. Also, no
standing historic features or signature plants were seen. A buried telephone cable runs
parallel to FM 1829 on its east side.
Conclusions
No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or in twelve shovel tests during the
archaeological survey of the proposed Van Zandt Water Pipeline route to be constructed.
The absence of prehistoric archaeological sites is probably the distance from the Sabine
River which is about a mile to the north and the absence of knappable lithic resources.
The absence of historic sites is probably due to the narrow width of the pipeline route
which usually allows historic structure to be avoided.

RECOMMENDATIONS

It is AR Consultants, Inc.’s conclusion that no prehistoric or historic (older than 50 years)
cultural resources will be impacted as a result of development of the proposed pipeline
route. It is consequently recommended that development proceed as planned. Should any
archaeological resources be discovered during construction, work should cease in that
area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
contacted. Work should not continue until consultations with the Texas Historical
Commission have been completed.
