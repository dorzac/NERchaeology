ABSTRACT
A reconnaissance survey and monitoring of a 96.46 square mile area
(61,734 acres) within the Kisatchie National Forest was conducted by Dixie
Environmental Services Co., LP (DESCO) under the direction of Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) and Consulting Archaeologist Edward P. Baxter. The
archaeological reconnaissance was performed from November 12, 2007 to April 6,
2008 and included all or parts of Kisatchie National Forest compartments 1-41, 45,
46, and 115 in Natchitoches and Winn parishes, Louisiana. The monitoring was
conducted from April 6, 2008 until August 12, 2008. The monitors were John C.
Hogg Kris Underwood, and Phil Bishop. The goal of this project was to make
sure that the 3-D seismic activities associated with Seismic Exchange, Inc’s
Bodcaw Phase II and III 3-D seismic survey avoided any previously recorded or
newly discovered cultural resource sites. Archaeological investigations consisted
of surface and subsurface investigations at pre-determined source point locations
in order to find, delineate, and record any previously unrecorded cultural
resource sites or isolated finds. At the time of this survey there were 199
previously recorded archaeological sites and isolated finds within the project
area. These sites were marked in the field and were avoided by the drillers.
This survey recorded forty-two previously unrecorded archaeological sites
(16NA639 - 16NA656 and 16WN490- 16WN513) and forty-two isolated finds.
Thirty of the newly discovered archaeological sites date to the prehistoric period
of Louisiana based on the presence of lithic debitage, ceramics, unifacial and
bifacial tools, and projectile points; 10 sites are historic; while 2 sites contain both
prehistoric and historic components. Forty-two localities contain four artifacts or
less and are described in this report as isolated finds following the criteria
established by the Louisiana State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). These
isolated finds are documented by USDA, Forest Service numbers 08060400642
– 08060400683. All of the isolated finds are prehistoric. This field survey did not
collect enough information to determine the eligibility of the forty-two newly
recorded sites. The isolated finds are considered to be not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places. All artifacts and records have been
prepared for curation according to the guidelines established by the Louisiana
Division of Archaeology and transferred to the Supervisor’s office at the Kisatchie
National Forest in Pineville, Louisiana.

INTRODUCTION
Seismic Exchange, Inc. of Houston, Texas conducted a 3-D seismic survey
project in Bienville, Natchitoches, Red River, and Winn parishes. The purpose
of this survey was to provide a high-resolution image of the subsurface
geological features that will allow the client to effectively evaluate the
hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area. The Bodcaw Phase II and III
3-D project area encompasses approximately 61,734 acres of the Kisatchie
National Forest and is found in compartments 1-41, 45, 46, and 115. As part of
the USDA permitting process on Kisatchie National Forest land, Seismic
Exchange, Inc. was required to conduct a cultural resources survey to ensure
that proposed operations would not adversely affect cultural resources. The
portion of the project within the Kisatchie National Forest defines the
archaeological project area and is confined to portions of Natchitoches and Winn
parishes (Figure 1). The field survey was began on November 12, 2007 and
ended on April 6, 2008.
The project consisted of five main tasks. First, the previously recorded
archaeological sites were identified on the project maps, and a 30-meter buffer
was placed around them so that seismic source points placed in the field would
avoid them. Second, each source point was investigated by surface inspections
or shovel testing. This was done in order to determine if any cultural resources
were present at the source point locations. Third, all sites were delineated, their
boundaries were buffered and avoided by the seismic activities. Fourth,
avoidance plans were developed and approved by the Kisatchie National Forest
so that drilling could proceed. Fifth, all drilling activities were monitored to insure
that avoidance was accomplished and to investigate any new locations resulting
from source point moves.
Due to the size of the Bodcaw Phase II and III 3-D project area, the
seismic portions within the National Forest were divided into three smaller
sections (avoidance areas 1, 2, and 3) with regard to both biological and cultural
resource survey efforts in order to expedite the USDA permitting process and
allow project operations to proceed in a timely manner. Avoidance plans, based
on the findings of the cultural resources surveys, were submitted to the USDA as
each area was completed (Appendix I). The Forest Service then authorized
seismic survey drilling activities in each area based on the implementation of the
plan to insure protection of sensitive resources. Appendix II describes the
seismic survey methods as they relate to this project. Appendix III depicts the
points investigated during this project, areas considered previously surveyed by
the Forest Service, source points drilled, previously recorded sites and isolated
finds, and newly recorded sites and isolated finds.

The avoidance area boundaries were based on the seismic phases and
geographical boundaries. Avoidance Area 1 was established on the USDA
Forest portion of the Bodcaw 3-D Phase II project area. Areas 2 and 3 were in
the USDA Forest portion of the Bodcaw Phase III project area and are divided by
parish boundaries. Area 2 is in the Natchitoches Parish section, and Area 3 is in
the Winn Parish section.
The seismic project activities consisted of the placement of wooden stakes
by surveyors at selected points along both source lines and receiver lines. The
drilling of each source point location was conducted using highland drill rigs with
environmentally compatible tires. The geophones were placed by hand along the
receiver lines. Minimal vegetation clearing was also accomplished by hand. The
policy of the Kisatchie National Forest was to not allow drills to be used when the
moisture level was great enough to create rutting from the drill rigs. The only
ground disturbing activity associated with the project was the drilling of a fourinch diameter hole at each source point location. Archaeological investigations
were conducted at each source point location prior to drilling to determine if an
archaeological site was present. When a site was found, all drill activities were
moved at least 30 meters outside the boundary of the newly discovered site.
Therefore, no sites were impacted by the project.
The administrative office of the Kisatchie National Forest is in Pineville,
Louisiana. The project area supervisor operates from the Winn Ranger District in
Winnfield, Louisiana. The Winn Ranger District contains 164,149 acres, and it is
located in Grant, Natchitoches, and Winn parishes. All artifacts and records have
been transferred to the Supervisor’s office at the Kisatchie National Forest in
Pineville, Louisiana for permanent curation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the Coastal Plain of Louisiana (Pirkle and
Yoho 1977). It is located in the western portion of central Louisiana. Elevations in
the two parishes range from about 90 feet above mean sea level to slightly more
than 40 feet above mean sea level. Local relief in the area rarely exceeds 100 feet.
There are two prominent surface features in the project area. They are the alluvial
valley of the Red River and the older Kisatchie Hills, a rugged Tertiary and
Quaternary highland that trends across the southern part of Natchitoches Parish
(Gregory and Curry 1978). Otherwise, the general topography consists of low,
rounded hills and small valleys with bench-like terraces that date to the Quaternary
period and flank the Red River Valley. In general, the soils in the project area are
light in color, having developed under forest cover where the portion of plant root
per unit mass of soil is small (Gregory and Curry 1978). The material to be
converted into soils in this region consists of clays, silts and mixed sand, silts, and
clays with heavy clay very common.
Pre-settlement vegetation consisted mainly of longleaf pine. The dominant
hardwoods were red oak, post oak, and dogwood. Ground cover probably
consisted of grasses, sedges, and legumes (Delcourt 1976). Tributary bottomland
hardwoods adjacent to tributary streams included ironwood, white oak, hickory,
sweet gum, beech, bay, holly, maple, and sassafras. Keller (1983) states that the
entire Winn Ranger District, with the exception of isolated longleaf tracts and the
alluvial bottoms of the Red River and associated streams on its western boundary,
is found within the mixed deciduous loblolly-shortleaf pine range. According to
Keller (1983:11), the Kisatchie National Forest, “despite its relatively small area and
spatial extent, displays considerable ecological variability.” He also states that
some of the ecological zones in the forest still provide an “informative picture of the
environment before the massive timber removals of the early 20th century …”
Presently, 45 species of wild mammals live in the study area and adjacent
lands (Lowery 1974). Swanton (1946) states that deer, squirrels, and rabbits
provided staple meat supplies for Native Americans in the Southeast. Other
mammals that may have been hunted in the area include bears, opossums, and
raccoons. According to a recent study by DESCO (2008:Table 1), 51 species listed
by the Kisatchie National Forest as “Threatened, Endangered, Sensitive, and
Conservation” species have recorded occurrences within the Winn Ranger District.
These include 48 species of plants, 2 avian species, and 1 reptile species. Beavers
provided a basis for trade between the Indians, trappers, and fur dealers, while
deer and bovids also provided meat supplies for the early explorers as well as the
Indians. Tribes in the project area probably consumed several families of birds
such as geese, ducks, cranes, and thrushes in the late fall and early winter.
Resident birds such as doves, turkeys, and pigeons were available the year round.

Today, the Winn Ranger District is covered in a mixed deciduous, loblolly,
and shortleaf pine forest situated in the dissected rolling uplands. Nine habitats are
present within the Kisatchie National Forest. These are described by DESCO
(2008) as riparian forests, bayhead swamps/baygalls, forested seeps, bogs, interior
salt flats, saline prairies, calcareous prairies, saline-oak woodlands, and sandy
woodlands. These habitats are discussed in detail in the environmental study by
DESCO cited above.
The terrain in the project area is drained predominantly by Saline Bayou and
tributaries of the Dugdemona River. Saline Bayou has been designated as a
National Wild and Scenic River and is protected from commercial development.
Elevations range from 125 feet to 400 feet above mean sea level, but relief rarely
exceeds 100 feet. In the higher elevations, soils are composed of silty clays and
silts of the Cane River formation of the Claiborne Group that dates to the Eocene.
Prairie Terrace deposits of clay, sandy clay, silt, and gravel are found along the
lower slopes adjacent to the stream valleys of Saline Bayou and the Dugdemona
River (Groat 1984). The interested reader is referred to the general soil maps for
Natchitoches and Winn parishes published by the United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, for more data regarding soils in the parish.
Figure 2 illustrates a typical view of the uplands, and Figure 3 depicts a view of the
bottomland forest.
The climate in a broad area that encompasses the current project area is
described in a handbook published by the United States Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service (2006). According to this document, the
average annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 63 inches, increasing from
northwest to southeast. Most of this rainfall occurs as frontal storms during the
spring and early summer. High intensity convective thunderstorms occur in late
summer and during the fall. The average annual temperature ranges from 61 to 68
degrees Fahrenheit, and the frost-free period averages 270 days.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY
The project area is located in a part of Louisiana where most of the sites
date to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of Southeast prehistory. Much
of the information in this section was taken from an annual report prepared by
Jeffrey S. Girard (2007) that documents work in 13 parishes in northwestern
Louisiana, an in-depth report documenting cultural resources along the Pearl
River in Louisiana and Mississippi by William E. Moore (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1982), and a cultural resources overview for the Kisatchie National
Forest by John E. Keller (1983). The interested reader is referred to these
reports for additional data regarding the prehistory of northwest Louisiana.
Paleoindian Period
The earliest period of prehistory in Louisiana is referred to by most
archaeologists as the time of Paleoindian occupation that lasted for about 7000
years (circa 12,000 B.C. to circa 5000 B.C.). According to Shuman and Shuman
(2004), the entire state of Louisiana was inhabited by Paleoindian groups who
hunted now extinct megafauna. In woodland areas, mastodon was more
commonly exploited, while mammoth and the giant bison were hunted on the
prairies. Some archaeologists believe that large animals were only a portion of
the Paleoindian diet, as plants and nuts were also exploited. The artifact most
often associated with this early period is the Clovis point. This fluted, lanceolate
artifact is sometimes found in association with other tool forms such as end
scrapers, side scrapers, gravers, and knives (Collins 1999). Although lanceolate
points have been found in northwest Louisiana, no sites with in situ specimens
have been documented. Gagliano and Gregory (1965) discuss the occurrence of
Paleoindian points in Louisiana. According to Girard (2007), most Paleoindian
points in northwest Louisiana have been found as isolated surface finds on
eroded Tertiary ridges or as aberrant specimens in collections dominated by
artifacts dating to later temporal periods. It is believed by some archaeologists
(Meltzer 1988; Anderson 1996) that similar situations are found throughout the
Southeastern United States due to high residential mobility of the Paleoindian
groups as they exploited extensive, dispersed food resources. According to
Keller (1983), evidence of this period is found throughout the Kisatchie National
Forest. The San Patrice point is viewed by Keller (1983) and Jennings (2008) as
a type that emerged during the transitional period between the Paleoindian and
Early Archaic periods. Keller believes this point dates from 6000 B.C. – 5000
B.C. However, more recent research by Jennings suggests this point dates from
10,400 B.P. to 9000 B.P. The lone example of this period in the current project
area is site 16NA521 in Natchitoches Parish where a San Patrice point was
found.

7

Archaic Period
Following a major climatic change, the large animals present during
Paleoindian times became extinct, and a shift was made to hunting smaller game
and gathering seeds and nuts. According to Shuman and Shuman (2004), in situ
Archaic sites are relatively rare in floodplain settings and more numerous in
upland areas. Haag (1961) believes that this disparity is probably the result of
alluvial deposition over Archaic sites rather than an indication that these areas
were avoided during this period. During the Early Archaic period (8000 B.C. to
6000 B.C) prehistoric groups ranged over the landscape in pursuit of plants and
animals for their subsistence.
There is some confusion as to when this period began, but Girard (2007)
believes that it first appeared about 8000 B.C. and lasted until about 500 B. C. It
is not known if the San Patrice point should be considered as a time marker for
the late Paleoindian, Transitional period, or the Early Archaic period in the
Southeast. Even though many aspects of the technology associated with the
San Patrice point, such as the use of fluting to thin the base of the point,
resemble the technology associated with fluted points dating to the Paleoindian
period, there is a marked difference between San Patrice and other projectile
points used during the Paleoindian period. Unlike Paleoindian points found in the
region, for example, San Patrice specimens from northwest Louisiana were
made from local chert. Saunders and Allen (1997) have assigned them to the
Early Archaic period because they are far more numerous and often found as
clusters at certain sites. Also, their distribution is more regional relative to the
earlier forms. According to Girard (2007), the context in which San Patrice points
have been found has not been dated by radiometric means. Therefore, the
chronological position of these points is unknown. Numerous San Patrice points
have been found at Fort Polk in Vernon Parish, and San Patrice points have
been found at the John Pearce site (16CD56), a small campsite in southern
Caddo Parish (Webb, et al. 1971). Excavations at the John Pearce site yielded a
variety of chipped stone tools such as scrapers, retouched flakes, burins, and
gravers. No ground stone or features were observed, and no charcoal for
radiocarbon dating was present. Two Clovis-like points at this site may represent
an earlier component.
The Middle Archaic period in northwest Louisiana lasted from circa 6000
B.C. to 2000 B.C. (Girard 2007). Saunders and Allen (1997) believe that the
beginning of this period is marked by the Evans point horizon and the beginning
of mound construction, circa 4000 B.C. Girard (2007) states that it is difficult to
identify point forms or other tools that are diagnostic of specific time periods that
belong to this period. The only isolated and dated Middle Archaic period context
in northwest Louisiana is the Conly site (16BI19) located along Loggy Bayou in
Bienville Parish (Girard 2000a). Projectile points recovered at this site include a
variety of stemmed forms that have been typed as Bulverde, Carrollton, Ellis,
Jones Creek, and Macon.

Fragmented specimens made from novaculite have stems with concave
bases and are similar to the Johnson type, a Middle Archaic point according to
Schambach and Early (1982). It should be stated here that the Evans point was
widely used during the latter half of the Middle Archaic in northern Louisiana and
southern Arkansas (Saunders and Allen 1997:Figure 4), and this type has been
found at most of the Middle Archaic period mound sites in Louisiana. The Conly
site (16BI119) is buried beneath three to four meters of alluvium, and this has
resulted in one of the most extensive and best preserved assemblages of faunal
specimens for this period in the Southeast. Faunal analysis revealed that both
aquatic resources (catfish, freshwater drum, turtles, and shellfish) and upland
resources (deer, squirrel, and hickory nuts) were exploited (Dering 2000; Scott
and Jackson 2000; Jackson and Scott 2001).
During the Middle Archaic, populations probably continued to be mobile,
but concentrations of debris at some sites, such as Conly (16BI119), suggest a
greater redundancy in use of specific places and territories relative to the
Paleoindian period (Girard 2007). During the Middle Archaic, middle Holocene
climatic conditions induced river aggradation and stabilization in the southeastern
United States that resulted in channel meandering and the emergence of rim
swamp and oxbow environments. Smith (1986) states that these areas, which
are rich in biotic resources, became focal points for human exploitation during
this time. This statement is based on site distribution patterns and subsistence
remains. According to Girard (2007), most Middle Archaic sites in northwest
Louisiana are in upland settings, and artifacts are often mixed with those from
later times, making it difficult to identify chronologies. Girard states that the Conly
site (16BI119) demonstrates the potential for well-preserved Middle Archaic sites
to be buried beneath more recent floodplain sediments. He believes that such
deeply buried sites might be found within the floodplain of the Red River and
along the lower reaches of its major tributaries. These sites can be difficult to
locate without the aid of a backhoe, but they may represent relatively limited
temporal spans of occupation that can allow for the construction of “fine-grained”
chronologies (Girard 2007:10).
According to Bense (1994) and Smith (1986), the Late Archaic period
(circa 2000 B.C. to 500 B.C.) is often interpreted as a time when floodplain
aquatic resources were intensively used. This period also was a time when
populations increased and long distance trade networks were established.
Bense and Smith believe that Late Archaic groups became more dependent on
indigenous starchy and oily seed plants for food and this eventually culminated in
gardening and incipient cultivation of these plants. They refer to the “container
revolution” as a time when vessels evolved from stone (steatite) to gourds and
finally pottery. Girard states that the Late Archaic period is poorly understood in
northwest Louisiana. Various points were produced, but point chronologies are
not well understood, and there was a general trend from rectangular and
expanding stem forms to the more common contracting stem Gary point that
occurred during this period.

9

Girard also states that Late Archaic points are commonly found at sites on
upland ridges, and they are sometimes mixed with earlier or later occupations.
Few sites dating to this period have been identified within the Red River
floodplain, and not one of these sites has been investigated systematically.
Girard believes that an absence of Late Archaic sites in the floodplain of the Red
River should not be interpreted as a lack of activity during this period. He
believes that most Late Archaic floodplain sites were probably destroyed or
buried by sediments deposited in the “highly dynamic river.” During the period,
from circa 1500 B.C. to 500 B.C., the Poverty Point culture flourished in the
northeastern part of Louisiana, but a separate Poverty Point period is generally
not recognized in the current project area. During the Early Woodland Period
(circa 100 B.C.), the Marksville culture emerged and persisted into the following
Late Woodland period until it ended about A.D. 300. According to Keller (1983),
evidence of the Archaic period is found throughout the Kisatchie National Forest.
Woodland Period
The Woodland Period is believed by many archaeologists to have begun
about 500 B.C. when pottery first appeared as a major artifact type, and it lasted
until circa A.D. 900 when the Caddoan culture made its appearance in northwest
Louisiana. The first pottery type to appear in the Woodland Period is classified as
Tchefuncte, which was made with an untempered, often poorly wedged and
laminated paste. It is commonly found in the Catahoula Basin, but it is rare along
the Little River and in areas to the north and west (Girard 2007). The origin of
the Tchefuncte culture is not known, but archaeological evidence suggests it
lasted from 750 B.C. until A.D. 250. According to Haag (1978), it probably
originated in the Lake Pontchartrain area and diffused slowly to the north along
the Mississippi Valley. Evidence of this culture has been found as far west as the
Texas border. The first description of Tchefuncte culture was provided by Ford
and Quimby (1945) who excavated several Tchefuncte sites in south Louisiana.
In Girard’s Management Unit 1, which includes Bienville, Bossier, Caddo,
Claiborne, DeSoto, Grant, Natchitoches, Rapides, Red River, Sabine, Vernon,
Webster, and Winn parishes, no Early Woodland Period sites have been isolated
and studied, even though this pottery type has been reported from sites in
southern Natchitoches Parish by Gregory and Curry (1978) and at the Swan
Lake site (16BO11) in Bossier Parish (Girard 1995). According to the overview
by Keller (1983), no sites associated with the Tchefuncte culture had been
recorded in the Winn Ranger District as of 1983.

10

Girard (2007) states that the use of pottery in northwest Louisiana was
sporadic until the Middle Woodland period (circa 100 B.C.). At that time, thick,
grog-tempered pottery was used throughout the region. Girard reports that
Middle Woodland pottery has been found only in small amounts in his
Management Unit 1, and it usually is present with later materials. Low numbers
of ceramics associated with the Marksville culture of the Lower Mississippi Valley
(100 B.C. to A.D. 300) have been found at several sites in northwest Louisiana,
and similar ceramics have been reported at sites in Arkansas (Schambach 2001)
and Texas (Perttula 1999). According to Keller (1983), sites associated with the
Marksville culture have been reported in the western part of the Winn Ranger
District.
Most of the information regarding the Middle Woodland period in Girard’s
Management Unit 1 comes from solitary mound sites on ridges overlooking the
Red River floodplain or along major tributaries such as Bodcau Bayou. Most of
these sites have little evidence of habitation near the mounds. All of these
mounds are located north of the mouth of Boggy Bayou in southern Caddo
Parish (they are also found in Bossier and DeSoto parishes), and they typically
contain small amounts of thick, grog-tempered or grog and bone-tempered
pottery known as Williams Plain. Radiocarbon dates place them between 200
B.C. and A.D. 500 (Girard 2002). Girard believes that it is likely that relatively
mobile settlement systems with subsistence economies based on fishing,
hunting, and gathering of nuts and plants continued into the Middle Woodland
period. Perttula (1999) states that research in East Texas suggests that
Woodland period sites represent more sustained occupations by larger groups
relative to those during the Late Archaic. According to Girard (2007), habitation
sites of the Middle Woodland period have yet to be isolated and studied in
northwest Louisiana.
The Late Woodland Period (A.D. 400 to A.D. 900) includes the Baytown
culture, and it was a time marked by changes in human social and economic
systems in the Natchitoches area and along Little River. The Baytown period is
an indistinct period of transition between the decline of the Marksville culture and
the later emergence of Coles Creek. Brain (1971) views it as the least
understood period in the entire Post-Archaic era. In economic terms, it was
potentially the most significant. Time markers for Baytown include grog-tempered
pottery, small, thin arrow points such as the Collins type, and Gary and Ellis dart
points which suggest the atlatl was still in use. A stone tool inventory that
includes many implements that could have been used for cultivation, a variety of
grinding stones, and shell hoes are viewed by Brain (1971) as evidence of plant
domestication. McGahey (1975); however, feels that there is not enough
evidence to demonstrate the presence of agriculture, and he believes that
subsistence during this period was still based primarily on hunting and gathering.
According to Keller (1983), no sites associated with the Baytown culture have
been reported in the Winn Ranger District as of 1984.

11

A major site of the Late Woodland period in northwest Louisiana is
Fredericks (16NA2). This site is located near the lower end of Black Lake Bayou
and has five mounds and a rich midden area (Girard 2000b). The ceramics at
this site are similar to those associated with the Troyville culture in the Lower
Mississippi Valley, but they differ markedly from the Fourche Maline sites in the
Shreveport area. A major technological change that occurred during this period
is the abandonment of the atlatl and the introduction of the bow and arrow.
During this time the Catahoula arrow point appears. This is one of the earliest
arrow points in the region, and it is commonly found in central Louisiana. At this
time, it is not possible to attribute the Catahoula point to a specific group. No
Catahoula points have been reported in the project area. Another important Late
Woodland site is Montrose (16NA37), which is located south of Natchitoches
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1985). This site contained a large of pit
features, several human burials, and numerous ceramics. According to Keller
(1983), no sites associated with the Troyville culture are known to be present in
the Winn Ranger District as of 1983.
Girard (2007) states that the Fredericks and Montrose sites are an
indication of intensive use of particular places in the landscape, evidence of
which is lacking for earlier periods. Radiocarbon dates indicate that these sites
were occupied sometime between A.D. 400 until about A.D. 800. Small amounts
of Coles Creek pottery were found at both sites, and this artifact type probably
represents the latest occupations. The Coles Creek period began circa A.D. 700
and lasted until circa A.D. 1000. Phillips (1970) believes that Coles Creek culture
developed in the southern part of the Lower Mississippi Valley and diffused to the
north into the area where the Baytown culture persisted. It became perhaps the
most widespread culture in Louisiana and lasted for three hundred years. Coles
Creek sites include both oval and pyramidal mounds, with the latter being a late
development. Pure Coles Creek components are difficult to isolate, but the
earliest assemblages include distinctive pottery (incised and punctuated types),
Gary dart points, and Alba and Scallorn arrow points (Brain 1971). A typical
Coles Creek site consists of two or three pyramidal mounds arranged around a
central plaza. According to Keller (1983) sites associated with the Coles Creek
culture have been identified throughout the Kisatchie National Forest, especially
east of the Red River. The function of the mounds is not yet fully understood, but
it is assumed to have been ceremonial because they served as the bases of
temples (McGahey 1975). On the basis of pottery, it has been hypothesized that
the Coles Ceek culture enjoyed a much wider distribution than Baytown. It is
found as far north as the upper reaches of the Lower Mississippi Valley and as
far west as Texas and Oklahoma (Haag 1978). Girard (personal communication)
believes that the Coles Creek culture did not extend into Texas and Oklahoma.
Several small habitation sites that might date to this period have been recorded,
but not one has been the subject of a significant investigation. On the
southeastern edge of Girard’s Management Unit 1, substantial occupation of the
Little River drainage appears to have taken place during the Late Woodland
period.

12

Caddo Period
According to Girard (2007), a widespread cultural tradition known as
Caddo became established in the Red River floodplain and along the adjacent
uplands about A.D. 900 and lasted until A.D. 1700 (Late Caddo) when Caddoan
groups became exposed to European explorers. The Early Caddo period
spanned the period from A.D. 900 to A.D. 1200 and was one of considerable
change in human lifeways in Girard’s Management Unit 1, particularly in the Red
River drainage. Catahoula arrow points are found at the very early Caddo sites.
According to Girard, these changes, in terms of the archaeological record, are
evident in the ceramic assemblages, site locations, and mortuary traits. By the
Early Caddo period, four distinct aspects of settlement in the Red River drainage
can be identified, and most of these persisted throughout this late period of
Louisiana prehistory (Girard 2007). These four aspects are (1) floodplain villages
consisting of clusters of households dispersed in lineal patterns along secondary
streams; (2) Areas within these villages that contain solitary mounds or special
ceremonial structures; (3) Ceremonial centers containing multiple mounds and
plaza areas; and (4) Small clusters of households in peripheral floodplain
settings, particularly around rim swamps and marshes in the lower reaches of
tributary streams. Girard (2007) states that these traits did not appear all at once,
not one was present before A.D. 800, and all appeared in some places
throughout the Caddo region prior to A.D. 1000. Girard (2007) identified six traits
that distinguish Caddo from earlier Woodland period cultures in Louisiana.
•

A broadening of the diversity of pottery vessels made and used. New
forms such as the bottle and carinated bowl appear.

•

Changes in the manner in which pottery was decorated. Particularly
distinctive is the appearance of engraved vessels with polished surfaces.

•

A tremendous increase in the number of sites situated in the Red River
floodplain. The sites appear to represent the formation of villages
consisting of small clusters of houses dispersed over distances of several
kilometers.

•

Construction of mounds in the floodplains of the Red and Sabine rivers
and termination of mound construction on upland ridges.

•

Distinctive mound burials consisting of deep shaft graves that contain
multiple individuals and many grave goods.

•

Possibly an increase in the importance of farming, particularly the
cultivation of maize.

13

The Early Caddo period coincided with the emergence of the Early
Mississippian period, and they lasted from circa A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500. During
this period, the archaeological record for the Caddo area in Girard’s Management
Unit 1 is the Bossier Focus (now referred to as the Bossier Phase). This focus
was initially defined on the basis of pottery traits that differed from those of the
Early Caddo period (Girard 2007). The major change was the frequent use of
brushing on utilitarian vessels such as Pease Brushed Incised. Clarence Webb
(1948) based the Bossier Focus on investigations at several sites located
primarily in Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto parishes, but he recognized similar sites
as far to the east as the Ouachita Valley, south to the Natchitoches area, and
east into the Cypress Creek drainage. According to Webb, most Bossier Phase
village sites are located on bluffs adjacent to the Red River floodplain in southern
Bossier Parish and along major upland drainages such as Bodcau Bayou.
The late Caddo period lasted from about A.D. 1500 to A.D. 1700 and in
the area around present-day Shreveport it is marked by distinct changes in both
ceramic technology and decorative styles (Girard 2007). This period is known as
the Belcher Focus (now the Belcher Phase) (Webb 1959). Ceramic vessels
during this time differ from the earlier forms in that they have thin walls, hard
pastes, and frequent use of shell temper. According to Girard (2007), few
habitation sites dating to this period have been identified. It is believed that
mound sites of the late Caddo period in the Great Bend region of the Red River
were abandoned by A.D. 1650 prior to sustained European contact (Perttula
1992). The continued use of mounds is depicted in a map drafted in 1691-1692
by the Spanish explorer Don Domingo Teran′ de los Rios (Perttula, et al. 2008).
Some sites that date late in the period probably were occupied by the historic
Yatasi and related groups. These sites are 16BO19, 16BO236, and 16BO237.
According to Keller (1983), Caddoan sites are very common in the Caney,
Kisatchie, and Winn ranger districts.
The Mississippian culture is the last major prehistoric culture in North
America, and McGahey (1975) considers it to represent the highest prehistoric
civilization in eastern North America and possibly the entire continent. This
culture developed along the northern reaches of the Mississippi River and
spanned the time from about A.D. 1000 to European contact (circa A.D. 1700).
The majority of Mississippian sites are found along the fertile Yazoo basin of
Mississippi, an area that was ideal for an agricultural economy. According to
Brain (1971), the classic marker of this period is its pottery that is characterized
by the use of shell temper. Keller (1983), in his overview of cultural resources of
the Kisatchie National Forest, states that sites associated with this culture are
found throughout the forest, especially east of the Red River. Although pottery
recognized as being Mississippian (based on shell temper) was found in the
project area, this does not mean that distinct Mississippian cultures were present.

14

The advent of shell tempering allowed the fabrication of larger containers.
Vessel shapes such as bottles, plates, and jars are viewed as diagnostic of the
period. Other diagnostic artifacts include a number of chipped and ground stone
artifacts such as triangular and leaf-shaped arrow points such as Cahokia,
Madison, and Nodena types. Additional traits of this period include burials that
contained elaborate grave offerings. Ceramics found in Mississippian graves are
considered by some as perhaps the most outstanding art work in North America.
Agriculture was a major part of this culture, and it supplied the major portion of
food consumed. Large surpluses made it possible to construct large mounds,
fortifications, and the ability to wage war instead of small-scale raids. With a
predictable food source, the concentration of people into towns and cities was
now possible (McGahey 1975).
In eastern Louisiana, most sites that date to the Early Mississippian period
are associated with the Plaquemine culture, which is characterized by changes in
ceramic assemblages and expansion of mound construction often attributed to
intensive contacts with Mississippian groups to the north (Rees and Livingood
2007). New mounds and plazas were constructed, and mantles were added to
existing mounds in large ceremonial centers in the lower Yazoo region and at the
Raffman (16CE20) and Fitzhugh (16MA1) sites in the Tensas region (Kidder
1993). Although few studies of food remains have been conducted, it is often
assumed that maize agriculture was a major form of subsistence (Jeter and
Williams 1989).
No Plaquemine sites have been recorded along Little River (Thomas et al.
1983), but major sites are known to be present in the Catahoula Basin. Temple
and mortuary mounds exist in the Catahoula and Lower Ouachita regions along
with extensive sheet middens (Gregory et al. 1987), but these traits are
apparently absent in the Natchitoches area and rare in the Red River drainage to
the north. The historic Natchez are generally thought to be the descendents of
prehistoric Plaquemine groups located on the bluffs east of the Mississippi River
near the present city of Natchez.

15

HISTORIC INDIANS
At the time of European contact, there were several Native American
groups living in the areas now referred to as Natchitoches and Winn parishes.
According to Keller (1983), the earliest documentation of these groups was noted
by the DeSoto expedition in 1541. He states that the groups encountered by
DeSoto may have been populations associated with the Belcher Focus (A.D.
1500 – A.D. 1700). There is no evidence, however, that he passed through the
project area. Following the DeSoto expedition, there are no additional recorded
contacts with native Indian groups until A.D. 1700 when it is thought that Iberville
encountered a group of Avovel (Swanton 1946). The Ayovel inhabited the area
around the rapids of the Red River in present day Avoyelles Parish, outside the
boundaries of the Winn Ranger District. Other explorers such as Henri de Tonti
and St. Denis also encountered Caddoan groups in the vicinity of present day
Natchitoches at a somewhat later date (Keller 1983). Keller (1983:25) also
states that “ethnographic evidence for other native populations is nonexistent,
giving the impression of a somewhat uninhabited region existing at this time
between the Mississippi and Red rivers until the arrival of migrant populations
from across the Mississippi.” Other tribal groups that may have been present in
or near the Winn Ranger District are discussed below.
The Alabama Tribe was apparently scattered about the state throughout
the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Part of this tribe settled on the Red River
about 16 miles above Bayou Rapides (Tanner 1820; Sibley 1832), and they
could have passed through or inhabited the Winn Ranger District. Major
migration of this tribe from Alabama and Mississippi occurred circa 1763 when
France ceded her territory east of the Mississippi to England.
By 1764, Choctaw settlements were located on the Red River, and bands
of this Tribe may have been present in the areas now known as the Kisatchie
and Winn ranger districts. Choctaw villages along Bayou Chicot circa 1785
probably utilized the resources of the Winn Ranger District. The largest remnant
cluster of Choctaw in Louisiana remains in the area around Jena, Louisiana.
The Koasati were first encountered by early Europeans in the Tennessee
River area of Alabama. A band of this tribe settled briefly on Bayou Chicot in the
vicinity of the Winn Ranger District circa 1800 prior to settling on the Sabine
River about 80 miles south of Natchitoches (Sibley 1832). According to Girard
(personal communication), the Koasati had a settlement in Bossier Parish on the
bluffs overlooking Red River, and they probably had another settlement in Red
River Parish.
The Pascagoula lived at the mouth of the Red River prior to 1787. Circa
1798, a village of Pascagoula was believed to be present about 60 miles below
Natchitoches. Another group located near the town of Coushatta could have also
exploited the Winn Ranger District (Morse 1822). Also, there was a Pascagoula
village north of Alexandria.

16

The Ouachita originally lived near the present town of Columbia, Louisiana
just outside the Kisatchie National Forest approximately 30 miles northeast of the
Catahoula Ranger District. It is very likely that they could have been in the Winn
Ranger District as well.
The Natchitoches was the southernmost Caddoan group represented in
Louisiana. Tonti first reported them in 1690 when they were living near the
modern city that bears their name (Swanton 1946). It seems likely that they
utilized the resources in the Winn Ranger District. Although this group is known
mainly for their villages in the Natchitoches area, they probably hunted and
gathered plants in the uplands of the Winn Ranger District.
The Doustioni were a small tribe associated with the Natchitoches. Tribes
identified by Swanton (1946) as the Doustioni are included in listings of Caddoan
tribes by Casanas. When first visited by Bienville in 1700, their village was
located one league (3.4 miles) downriver from the Natchitoches village (Swanton
1942). They probably camped and hunted in the Winn Ranger District.
The Yatasi were a Caddoan group first identified in the Shreveport area.
Later, they moved to DeSoto Parish to the north of Natchitoches.
By the early part of the 19th century, Caddoan groups were reduced in
number, and they moved to the margins of the Red River floodplain and near
lakes on major tributaries. Discussions of changes in settlement locations are
described by Sibley (1922), Swanton (1942), Williams (1964), Webb and Gregory
(1986), Perttula (1992), Smith (1995), Girard (1997), Kelley (1998), and Girard
and Gregory (2002). Historic Indian sites in Natchitoches Parish where
European trade beads have been recovered are discussed by Gregory and
Webb (1965) in their article that was published in Florida Anthropologist.

17

HISTORIC PERIOD
Colonial Period (1540-1803)
The first Europeans to traverse the region of the project area were
members of Hernado DeSoto’s expedition in the 16th century. After the death of
DeSoto in 1542, the remainder of the expedition passed through northwestern
Louisiana in an attempt to reach Mexico. In 1687, Robert Sieur de La Salle was
in central Louisiana and may have visited the Natchitoches village. He was
exploring the Mississippi River for France and claimed the entire state of
Louisiana for his country. In 1690, a group of Franciscan missionaries attempted
to establish a religious post at Grand Rapides on the Red River. This site, now
the city of Pineville, Louisiana, was unsuccessful due to the arrival of the French
in the area. St. Denis established Fort Saint Jean Baptiste at Natchitoches in
1713 and may have established a small trading post near the rapids on the Red
River either at Alexandria or Pineville (Gulf South Research Institute 1974). The
trading post became an active trade center and attracted French settlers to the
area. Girard (personal communication) believes the location was Natchitoches
because there was little or no settlement in the Red River floodplain above
Natchitoches because of the rafts. During the period of Spanish rule (17621803), immigration increased considerably with settlers arriving from France,
Spain, the Canary Islands, Santa Domingo, and the United States (Gulf South
Research Institute 1974). Settlement was still sparse and largely confined to the
alluvial Red River Valley and alluvial floodplains of the larger rivers draining the
uplands. Much of the area that is within the present-day boundaries of the
Kisatchie National Forest was still viewed as “forest primeval” (Lewis 1973).
Early American Period (1803-1840)
In 1803, the Louisiana Territory was sold to the United States, and
northern and central Louisiana became the western frontier of the United States.
During this time, immigration increased rapidly; however, United States land
patents indicate that the upland areas were still only sparsely settled at the end
of the 19th century (Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). According to Woods
(1972), many of the early settlers only cultivated about eight acres per family and
grew such crops as corn, potatoes, and peas while raising hogs and cattle. They
tended to settle along small creeks and on the second bottoms. Since an
inspection of United States Land Patent books indicates that most of the area
within the Kisatchie National Forest was not claimed or patented until the 1850s
or later, it is unlikely that this area was more than sparsely occupied. On April
10, 1805, Natchitoches Parish was created when the Orleans Territory was
divided into twelve parishes.

18

Ante-Bellum Period (1840-1861)
By the early 1840s, plantations covering thousands of acres were
common on the alluvial plains of the larger rivers, and they formed the hub of the
economy and, in general, dictated the lifestyle of most of the people in the area
(Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). Because plantations were mainly located
on alluvial plains of major drainages, it is unlikely that evidence of these
settlements will be found in the Kisatchie National Forest. In addition to the large
plantations, small farms were also common. They were largely owned and
operated by subsistence farmers and were located in the uplands. According to
Newton (1970, 1972), the small upland farmer tended toward a pattern of many
small fields interspersed with forest-covered areas. Newton (1974) states that
these farmers raised cattle, hogs, mules, cotton, tobacco, strawberries, corn,
peas, and beans. Basically, they raised any crop that allowed them to make a
profit. Since the Kisatchie National Forest is located mainly in the uplands,
evidence of these small farms may be present within certain ranger districts,
although these remains may be sparse. It was during this time (1851) that Winn
Parish was officially created by the Louisiana State Legislature. It was officially
organized in 1852.
Civil War Period (1861-1865)
During the Civil War, Louisiana was sharply divided according to loyalties
to the North and South, and Winn Parish was known as “The Free State of
Winn.” Between April 17, 1862 and May 18, 1864, twenty major Civil War battles
were fought on Louisiana soil. The major objectives were control of the port at
New Orleans and the Mississippi River, a major transportation artery. In the
vicinity of the project area, the Red River Valley was the scene of considerable
military activity. Several engagements of the Red River Campaign in 1864 took
place near the project area. These include the Battle of Mansfield on April 8th,
the Pleasant Hill Skirmish on April 9th, the Blairs Landing Skirmish on April 12th
and 13th, the Campti Skirmish on April 13th, and the Monett’s Ferry Skirmish on
April 23rd. One of the goals of the Red River campaign was to drive General
Taylor’s army from Louisiana. The Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant
Hill were the last two important battles of the Civil War fought on Louisiana soil.
The Union army was stopped, and the Union General retreated to Alexandria
where his fleet was trapped when the waters of the Red River fell to levels to low
for boat traffic. The success by General Taylor delayed the Union victory be
several months. This was a time of turmoil for the South as many towns and
plantations were burned and looted by the Union Army during their march to the
coast. Virtually no new settlement occurred during this period, and no land was
patented (Heartfield, Price & Greene 1989). During the war, Union forces
occupied New Orleans, and this forced planters along the Red River to market
their cotton upstream to Texas (Nardini 1963).

19

Reconstruction Period (1865-1877)
This period was also a time of great turmoil for the South, as it took many
years for the region to regain its former prosperity. The population in some
Louisiana parishes decreased in number during this time. Many of the former
residents fled to Texas to escape the carpetbaggers that governed Louisiana
until 1877 (Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). During this unstable period,
gangs of African-Americans and Anglo-Americans roamed the area, robbed the
settlers, and committed numerous murders and acts of terrorism. According to
Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. (1989:20), sites dating to this period probably
exist within portions of the Kisatchie National Forest, “but it may be very difficult
to identify specific site locations and/or components of this period from late
occupational debris.”
Post-Reconstruction Period (1877-1930)
With the arrival of the railroad and the emergence of the lumbering
industry, the upland areas of north-central Louisiana experienced a boom period
in the 1890s and 1900s (Parker 1969; Burns 1982). Prior to 1880, for example,
only the alluvial parts of the region were well settled. The railroad provided
access to markets outside the region and created new markets for products
manufactured from timber such as fuel, crossties, bridges, railroad cars, and
telegraph poles (Tottenham 1974). The years 1889 to 1907 were peak years for
the logging boom in central Louisiana.
By 1900, large corporate sawmills were decimating the large stands of
longleaf pine and (according to Gregory and Curry 1978), cross-tie operations
and small sawmills owned by individuals were cutting the remaining hardwoods
by the 1930s. In 1907, there was a money panic among the Wall Street lumber
interests, resulting in a depression that was hard on the lumber industry. Due to
the lack of conservation practices by the railroad and lumber companies, much of
the land stood devoid of trees and many of the boomtowns became ghost towns
virtually overnight (Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). Burns (1982) states
that this “cut-and-get-out mentality” produced a migrant population that left small
subsistence farms and devastated eco-systems in its wake.
In 1910, Louisiana State Act 261 provided funds to help owners of cutover
land plant new stands of pine, and the position of State Forester was established
(Kerr n.d.). In 1924, the Clarke-McNary Act authorized the federal government to
purchase timberlands. As a result of this act, purchases were proposed and
approved in three areas in Louisiana in 1928. In Natchitoches and Vernon
parishes, 50,000 acres were set aside. The first purchase, however, was not
made until December 26, 1929.

20

By the late 1920s, many of the big companies had exhausted their
holdings, and they moved to other forests. The bottomlands had been largely
untouched because it was difficult to operate the skidder sleds in these areas
(Thomas et al. 1982). During the 1930s, the rise of unemployed laborers caused
a decrease in population of the area as they followed the lumber companies as
they moved to other parts of the country. Those who remained behind in the
uplands relied on farming, and they grew such crops as corn, cotton, sugar cane,
and potatoes. Another common practice throughout portions of the upland areas
of Louisiana, including the Kisatchie National Forest, was the collection of sap
from longleaf pines for the manufacture of turpentine. According to Heartfield,
Price & Greene, Inc. (1989), many sites of this period undoubtedly exist within
the Kisatchie National Forest. The remains are likely to be in the form of small
farmsteads, remains of railroad tram grades, and logging roads. It is also
possible that turpentine cups may be found in certain ranger districts.
Modern Period (1930 – Present)
In 1928, the office of the National Forest Service in central Louisiana was
established with the purpose of appraising and purchasing parcels of land to form
a national forest. Catahoula, Kisatchie, and Vernon were the first three units to
be established. In 1933, appropriations were made by Congress to proceed with
the establishment of a national forest in Louisiana. Between July 1, 1934 and
June 30, 1935, the area now referred to as the Kisatchie National Forest,
experienced its greatest growth with the purchase of 272,554 acres by the United
States Government. In 1936, all of the United States lands in the Catahoula,
Evangeline, Kisatchie, and Vernon units were designated as the Kisatchie
National Forest. Between 1933 and 1942, the Civilian Conservation Corps
(originally called the Emergency Conservation Work) established eight camps
within the Kisatchie National Forest. One of these camps was located near
Winnfield. The Corps planted by hand over 100,000 acres with pine trees,
constructed the Stuart Forest Nursery, the Gum Springs Recreation Area, Stuart
Lake, Valentine Lake, 156 buildings, 18 fire towers, 261 vehicle bridges, 298
miles of truck trails, and 212 miles of telephone lines throughout the forest.
During World War II, the United States Army selected land within the Kisatchie
National Forest in central Louisiana for large-scale maneuvers. In 1941, Camp
Polk (now Fort Polk) was officially established on Kisatchie National Forest land
in Vernon Parish. Other portions of the forest were also utilized, and they
included parts of the Winn Ranger District. Specifically, 3000 acres were used
for the Eagle Mountain, Bandit Hill, and Gum Springs bombing ranges. After the
war, much of the land was returned to the Kisatchie National Forest. A general
population shift occurred following the war from the country to urban areas. Jobs
were scarce in the rural areas, and there were more opportunities in the urban
areas because of the increase in industrial centers as a result of the war.

21

The boom following the war allowed for more people to purchase cars that
gave them the mobility to travel widely and experience outdoor activities in the
Kisatchie National Forest. The manufacturing and marketing of timber remains
one of the principal occupations throughout the area, and Winn Parish is referred
to as “The Forest Capital” of Louisiana. In addition to timber, the parish also
produces agricultural products such as cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, and
livestock.

22

LUMBER INDUSTRY IN THE KISATCHIE NATIONAL FOREST
According to Michael Williams (1994), the clearing of the forests that once
covered half of the country was the single greatest factor in the making of the
American landscape other than the creation of cities. Timber was abundant, and
it was the major building material for houses, bridges, fences, ships, and even
roads in some areas. Williams (1994:152) states “Until the early years of the 19th
century lumber activity and agricultural settlement were coincident.” The rise of
logging was a response to “an increasing demand for lumber from a growing
population and an increasingly industrialized economy and society” (Williams
1994:152). Eventually, lumber companies began operations throughout the
forested areas of the United States, especially the south where large virgin
stands were present.
Although timber was probably utilized by plantations and subsistence
farmers during the early days of Louisiana history, it was not until the 20th century
when the large lumber companies moved to the state and began to harvest the
virgin pines and some hardwoods in a systematic manner. Michael Williams
(1994) claims that the clearing of the forests that once covered nearly half the
country was (other than the creation of cities) the single greatest factor in the
making of the American landscape. Much of this section was taken from his
chapter in the book The Making of the American Landscape (Cozen 1994). The
clearing of the forests was, according to Williams (1994), the outcome of three
natural processes: making farms and settling the land; logging to supply timber
for construction needs; and cutting to provide fuel for homes, industry, and
support. During the days of the plantations in the South, slaves were used to
clear the forests and help with construction of buildings that were valuable to the
plantation. Cleared fields were often used for planting cotton and tobacco until
the nutrients in the soil were depleted. In 1620, much of the eastern part of the
United States contained large virgin forests. By the 1900s, however, these once
vast stands of timber had been reduced to small areas in a few southern states
(Williams 1994:Figure 8.4).
As the lumber industry expanded, so did the mills. Lumber mills sprang
up throughout Louisiana along major rivers and, with the coming of rail, easy
transportation made the lumber industry a gold mine. Additionally, the arrival of
the railway system coincided with the replacement of the double bladed axe with
that of the crosscut saw. The introduction of railroads and the crosscut saw
made possible the large-scale market of virgin Longleaf pine. Mills were supplied
by the major railroad lines that stretched into vast acres of virgin Longleaf pine.
Longleaf pine trees were felled and skidded by oxen drawn teams to the main
line. As timber surrounding the main line was cut, new temporary spurs or lateral
roads were constructed to the main line. These spurs were often called “dummy
lines” because of their temporary use and the fact they went nowhere (Hoffman
1998:viii). These logging lines were operated by the small, Shay steam
locomotives and became the driving force for the logging industry in Louisiana.

23

Small logging camps were often set up in the middle of large tracts of
Longleaf pine. There, the logging crews lived their day-to-day lives. Although
during this period in history, jobs were separated by segregation, both AfricanAmerican and Anglo-Americans were able to earn a living working in the woods.
Large Longleaf pine trees were felled and loaded onto the eight-wheeled Lindsey
wagons drawn by teams of oxen. At these temporary camps, earthen
embankments were constructed adjacent to the rail line for log loading creating a
series of loading ramps paralleling the rail line (Hoffman 1998). Once an area
was cleared, the crew moved on to a new parcel of land and the process began
again. Evidence of forest and lumber activities can be found throughout the state
and occasionally within the project area.
Historical Overview of the United States Forest Service
The USDA, in general, is considered the steward of over 200 million acres
of public lands nation wide. It is responsible for the management of natural as
well as cultural resources within its jurisdiction. These resources include public
recreation, timber management, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat and
restoration, and the focus of this investigation - cultural resources.
Overwhelmingly, the natural resource most utilized and managed by the
USDA is timber. The USDA is charged with prescribing the type of timber
harvest, treatment of timber stands to improve growth, timber harvest sales and
preparation, and re-establishing new forest growth after harvest has been
completed. By tending to the growing forest, the USDA not only caters to the
growth of new and old trees, but it also enhances and encourages other natural
resources to grow and flourish in their natural environment. These resources
include several threatened and endangered wildlife and plant species.
The history of the USDA began in 1876 when Congress appointed Dr.
Franklin B. Hough as the first forestry agent for the United States Federal
Government. He was assigned to the Department of Agriculture and was
presented with the task of compiling a statistical inquiry on the present conditions
of forests located in the United States. The result of Hough’s study, Report on
Forestry (1878-1884) by West (1992), presented a call for the management of
Federal timber lands, the creation of Federal Forest experiment stations and
reserves, the implementation of tree planting, and public education on forest
conservation, thus paving the way for the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 which was
signed by President Benjamin Harrison. This act was the accumulation of nearly
two decades of debate by the Congress on public land policy and timber
management practices (West 1992).

24

Fourteen years later on February 1, 1905, Congress formally transferred
the administration of the Federal forest reserves from the Department of the
Interior’s General Land Office to that of the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of
Forestry. A month later on March 3, the Bureau of Forestry became the USDA.
Two years later, all Federal forest reserve lands formally were renamed National
Forests (West 1992).
After the formation of the USDA, forest reserves across the country were
set aside for the purpose of establishing National Forests. While the West was
one of the last frontiers to be populated and still maintained, a vast amount of
lands that could be set aside from the public domain and most of the forest lands
within Mississippi were already within the hands of private individuals. The
upside is that much of the lands had already been farmed out or were barren
cutovers after the great timber rush of the late 19th century and early 20th century
and could be purchased from the landowner for little to nothing because of high
tax debts. These lands were ideal for the reestablishment of longleaf timber and
conservation efforts (Fickle 2001). Two additional sources that discuss the
lumber industry in Louisiana are an unpublished manuscript by Kerr (n.d.) and a
doctoral dissertation by Stokes (1954). In 1924, the Clarke-McNary Act was
passed as a way for the United States Government to purchase land for the
conservation of natural resources.
The Kisatchie National Forest is the only National Forest in Louisiana. It
covers 604,000 acres of public land, and it was established in 1930 in an effort to
re-establish forests over extensive cutover areas in central and northwest
Louisiana. It is divided into five managed unites called ranger districts. These
are Calcasieu, Caney, Catahoula, Kisatchie, and Winn. Kisatchie is a Choctaw
word for Reed River, and is the probable origin of the name of the forest. The
Bodcaw Lumber Company sold much of its cutover lands to the National Forest.
Bodcaw Lumber Company
The Bodcaw Lumber Company (formally of Stamps, Arkansas) was
incorporated by William Buchanan in Texarkana, Arkansas (Miller County) in
January of 1889 in order to engage in purchasing, manufacturing, and selling
lumber. Its main office was moved to Stamps, Arkansas in 1891 (Mayor 1988)
Buchanan started the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad to further his mill
expansion into Louisiana. This railroad grew southward, as did Buchanan’s mills.
It ran between Stamps, Arkansas to Alexandria, Louisiana with another branch
that ran to Jena, Louisiana and on to New Orleans. Soon, he created the original
Bodcaw Lumber Company in Stamps, Arkansas, the Pine Woods Lumber
Company in Springhill, Louisiana, the Minden Lumber Company in Minden,
Louisiana.

25

Next was the Grant L & L and the Grant T & M Company in Selma,
Louisiana and three mills in LaSalle Parish, Louisiana. The Trout Creek Lumber
Company was established in Trout in 1905, the Good Pine Limber Company in
Good Pine in 1906, and the Tall Timber Lumber Company in Good Pine in 1913
(Mayor 1988). These were all linked by the railroad.
The Arkansas-based company was dissolved in 1917. The company’s
assets were transferred to Good Pine, Louisiana. The mills and their
landholdings were incorporated into the assets of the Bodcaw Lumber Company
of Louisiana, Inc. that continued operations until International Paper Company
purchased the company in 1970. The Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad
remained a separate business.
Prior to the acquisition of the project area by the Bodcaw Lumber
Company, the project area consisted of tracts of land of various sizes owned by
individuals who used their holdings for farming and ranching. Once it was
acquired by Bodcaw, the systematic cutting of timber for shipment to Bodcaw
owned mills began. Five sites (16WN494, 16WN497, 16WN498, 16WN510, and
16WN511) believed to be associated with the lumber industry under the
ownership of Bodcaw were found during this survey. Some of these sites contain
various features associated with timber storage and transportation, and they are
discussed in the section entitled Historic Features below. In addition to the
features associated with these five sites, recorded and unrecorded trams are
viewed as part of a major industrial complex that is represented by the five sites
found in the current project area. The presumed function of this complex was to
collect felled timber and move it to areas utilizing the process of cable skidding
and donkey engine winches. The timber was then stored in containment ponds
prior to loading onto small trams that transferred the timber to a larger collection
point where it was stored and loaded onto mainline railway cars of the Louisiana
and Arkansas Railroad. The railroad had stops within the current project area at
the towns of Chestnut, Goldonna, Coldwater, and Calvin, Louisiana.

26

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
There are 130 previously recorded archaeological sites and 69 isolated
finds in the current project area (Appendix IV). There was no information for nine
localities; therefore, it is not known if they are sites or isolated finds. Eighty-seven
sites have official trinomials issued by the SHPO, 33 are identified by numbers
assigned by the USDA, and 9 sites have no State trinomial or Forest Service
number. Additional sites in the project area that have been identified as
segments of trams associated with the lumber industry. On some site forms,
“chips” are listed as part of the artifact assemblage. The recorders of these sites
do not define the term chips, and the reader can only infer that they represent
debitage or shatter that may or may not be cultural. Normally, chips or shatter
are not considered cultural. However, when found in association with known
artifacts a case can be made that they may have cultural origins. During the
review of site forms that document previously recorded sites, a decision had to
be made in terms of referring to the area as a site or an isolated find based on
the artifacts noted on the form. Since the artifacts were not seen by the lithic
analyst, we refer to all sites with four artifacts or less as isolated finds in
Appendix IV even if the number of chips combined with the number of artifacts
exceeds four specimens. Sites with diagnostic artifacts and/or features that allow
for an interpretation as to site age and or function are identified in Appendix V.
Most of the previous work in the Kisatchie National Forest has been
conducted by USDA archaeologists. These in-house surveys are typically
conducted prior to timber sales, construction projects for recreational facilities,
and following natural disasters such as the recent hurricanes Rita and Katrina.
Work in the forest by private contractors typically relate to oil and gas activities
and usually consist of investigations associated with well pads and pipelines.
There have been no large-scale seismic surveys such as the one described in
this report conducted in the forest. During the records check, an attempt was
made to identify every in-house survey performed by USDA archaeologists and
private contractors. Unfortunately, many of the known sites in the project area
could not be linked to specific reports. Therefore, it was decided not to include a
partial list of past surveys. The actual acreage that is considered by the USDA to
be previously surveyed is not known. However, a map depicting previously
surveyed areas was provided by the Kisatchie National Forest, and these areas
are depicted in Appendix III on a compact disc in the back of this report.
Other reports that contain information relevant to the project area are
Natchitoches Parish, Cultural and Historical Resources (Gregory and Curry
1978), Prehistoric and Historic Settlement in the Cane River Basin (Campbell et
al. 1978), An Archaeological Survey of the Lower Dugdemona River, Winn
Parish, Louisiana (Gregory et al. 1989), and Fish Hatchery 2 (16NA70): A Late
Prehistoric Site on the Caddo-Lower Mississippi Valley Margin (Girard et al.
2008).

27

The data used to compile this section were taken from site forms on file at
the Kisatchie National Forest (Winn Ranger District) in Winnfield, the Louisiana
Division of Archaeology in Baton Rouge, a cultural resources overview by Keller
(1983), and a personal communication with Lee Stewart, Staff Archaeologist at
the Winn Ranger District. Previously recorded prehistoric sites within the forest
with diagnostic artifacts date to the Paleoindian period (n=1), Archaic period
(n=2), and Late Prehistoric period (n=5).
The Transitional period between the Paleoindian Period and the Archaic
Period is represented at one site by a San Patrice point at 16NA521. The Archaic
period is represented by Marcos points at 16WN433 and X16NA-AR. The Late
Prehistoric period is represented by an Alba point perform and ceramics at
16NA328 and plain ceramics at 16NA522, 16WN144, 16WN423, and X16WN-BI.
Grog-tempered sherds were found at sites 16NA422 and 16WN423, and this
ceramic type is typically associated with the Baytown cultural period. No sites
were identified as dating to the Proto-historic or Historic Indian periods.
Prehistoric sites and isolated finds lacking datable artifacts or features are
classified as “Unknown Prehistoric,” and they account for the majority of known
sites in the project area. Prehistoric sites in the project area consist of seasonal
residential base camps, temporary special use camps, short-term base camps,
and isolated finds consisting of four artifacts or less. No prehistoric earthen
mounds have been reported. The majority of previously recorded prehistoric sites
in the project area are located on side slopes and tops of upland ridges. Others
are found on terraces and small rises in floodplains. Site disturbance consists
mainly of logging and related activities within the forest. Oil and gas exploration
and the construction of areas for recreation have disturbed portions of the forest,
but these tasks are usually preceded by cultural resource investigations that
allow for significant resources to be avoided and protected. Historic sites with
identifiable artifacts and features have been classified on site forms as trash
scatters (possible dumps), houses, farmsteads, a recreational facility, fire tower,
military tower, military fortification, cemetery, a single grave, and segments of
trams associated with the lumber industry (Appendix IV). The majority of historic
sites date from the latter part of the 19th century through the early part of the 20th
century and to the present. Of the 130 previously recorded sites in the project
area, only one prehistoric site (16NA521) and four historic sites 16NA444,
16WN290, 16WN431, and 16WN433) are believed by USDA archaeologists to
be potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. *
______
* Distance from potential eligible sites to the nearest seismic activity (per the Avoidance Plan)
16NA521 is 190 meters
16NA444 is 204 meters
16WN290 is on private land
16WN431 is 57 meters
16WN433 is 186 meters

28

High probability areas in northwestern Louisiana have been defined by
other archaeologists. According to a report by Ecology and Environment, Inc.
(1992), areas of high probability for prehistoric sites in this part of Louisiana are
found on or in close proximity to definable geomorphologic features such as
terraces, knolls, or the confluences of creeks, streams, and rivers. In the project
area, the major waterways are the Dudgdemona River and Saline Bayou. Areas
of high probability for historic sites are primarily concentrated along
transportation routes such as roadways and navigable waterways, although
isolated farmsteads may be found near any expanse of arable land. In the
project area, historic sites may occur anywhere in the forest where lumbering
activities took place.
Medium probability areas are defined by Ecology and Environment, Inc.
(1992) and include uplands with well-drained soils, large and small plateaus
located away from water sources, small raised “islands” within low marshes or
swamps, and certain segments of agricultural land that exist near old oxbows.
Areas with a medium probability of containing historic sites include remote
plateaus, hilltops, and pasture lands located away from present farming and
urban centers.
Ecology and Environment, Inc. (1992) states that low probability areas are
“areas in which archaeological sites are unlikely to be found because either the
environmental character of the area was not conducive to use or settlement, or
because the environment has been altered to the extent that any original sites
would have been destroyed or severely disturbed.” Environmental factors typical
of low probability areas are generally similar for prehistoric and historic sites.
These areas are usually wet or swampy or, to a lesser extent, covered by very
poorly drained soils or steep, unstable slopes greater than 10 percent.

METHODS
Background Research
Prior to the survey, previously recorded site information and site location
data were obtained from the Winn District of the Kisatchie National Forest and
the files of the Louisiana Division of Archaeology. This information was used to set
up areas to be avoided by the initial staking of the proposed source point
locations by the seismic project’s surveyors (M & N Surveyors). The boundaries
of each site and isolated find were given a 30-meter buffer within which seismic
activity was prohibited. As stated above, specific information regarding the
methods to be followed by the seismic company is presented in Appendix II.
While the field survey was underway, the Principal Investigator conducted
additional records searches at the office of the Kisatchie National Forest in
Pineville, Louisiana. He discussed the project with Lee Stewart, archaeologist at
the Kisatchie Forest, and copied site forms and other data. Later, Jessica Colvin
returned to Pineville and copied the remainder of the site forms and reports. The
Principal Investigator also discussed the project with Forest Heritage Manager
and Tribal Liaison Velicia Bergstrom at the Kisatchie National Forest and
Regional Archaeologist Jeffrey S. Girard at Northwestern State University in
Natchitoches, Louisiana. The Project Archaeologist visited the Forestry Museum
in Lufkin, Texas and discussed forestry practices in Texas with John E. Ippolito,
Public Services Team Leader for the National Forests & Grasslands in Texas. The
Principal Investigator contacted the History Center in Diboll, Texas and talked by
phone with Jonathan K. Gerland, Director. Online searches were conducted to
gain specific resource data.
Field Survey
The field survey was performed under the supervision of Edward P. Baxter
(Project Archaeologist) who was assisted by Phil Bishop (Assistant Project
Archaeologist), and John C. Hogg (Crew Chief). The field crew consisted at
various times of Ben Apperson, Tom Bearden, Bill Brown, Jessica Colvin, Scott
Davis, Jason Foust, Matt Greby, Emily C. Hilley, David Jackson, Warren Kinney,
Kris Underwood, and Anna Warren. The survey was conducted from November
12, 2007 to April 6, 2008. The field methods were based on a meeting held at the
Kisatchie National Forest offices in Pineville, Louisiana on August 24, 2007. In
attendance were Velicia Bergstrom, staff archeologists for the Kisatchie National
Forest; Eric Schuster of Seismic Exchange; Tanya Matherne, President of
DESCO; and Edward P. Baxter, consulting archaeologist for BVRA and DESCO.
The forest service mandated that each source point placed on the forest property
be investigated with the exception of source points in areas deemed previously
surveyed.

30

A map of previously surveyed areas was provided by the Forest Service
(Appendix III). During the course of the survey this map was reviewed and
changed by the Forest Service; thereby, requiring a larger portion of the survey
area to be investigated. Each source point location was investigated and, where
appropriate, at least one shovel test was performed. In those areas considered
to be a likely setting for a prehistoric site, a second shovel test was excavated.
This decision was made by the archaeologists in the field. In general, floodplains
and the steep slopes of hills were not shovel tested. The archaeologists walked
over these areas and made a determination regarding the need for shovel testing
in the field. All rises, terraces, and pimple mounds observed in floodplains were
shovel tested if source points were located on or near them. All shovel tests were
excavated to 100 centimeters below the existing ground surface unless sterile
soil or water were reached prior to that depth. The fill from all excavated shovel
tests was screened through 1/4th inch hardware cloth. While the crew was in the
field conducting inspections and shovel tests, they also examined disturbed
areas within the vicinity of each source point location for displaced cultural
materials. Only diagnostic artifacts were to be collected from the surface. All
survey shovel tests and visual inspections were documented on a “Log of Areas
Investigated” form printed on acid-free paper. They include the following
information (1) seismic grid coordinates and offsets (if any), (2) depth of each
shovel test, (3) depth of cultural materials, (4) kinds of artifacts recovered, and
(5) type of soil present. This information was later placed on an Excel spread
sheet and put on a compact disc and submitted to the USDA for its files.
When a previously unrecorded site was found, its horizontal extent was
determined through additional shovel tests. This was the delineation phase. A
team of archaeologists excavated shovel tests in four directions from the
discovery test until two consecutive negative shovel tests were excavated in
each direction. In some cases, the landform morphology dictated the exact layout
of the pattern and was sometimes the primary criteria used in determining site
boundaries. Sites found on the edge of a steep landform or next to stream
channels did not receive shovel tests on the slope or in the streams. These
directions were considered to be a site boundary. In many cases, landforms such
as ridges dictated the alignment of the shovel test grid. In cases involving large
or very long sites, additional tests were excavated to better delineate the cultural
resource. During the site delineation phase, shovel tests were excavated at an
interval of 10 meters. A field map depicting the location of each shovel test in
relation to the topography and any distinguishing features was completed on
acid-free cardstock. This map was created using a compass and pacing. A
“Shovel Test Log” form, printed on acid-free paper, was completed for site and
included the following information: (1) shovel test number, (2) depth of each
shovel test, (3) depth of cultural materials, (4) kinds of artifacts recovered, and
(5) type of soil present. The site shovel test logs were put on a compact disc and
submitted to the USDA for its files. Munsell soil color chart readings were taken
where appropriate.

31

All artifacts found in shovel tests were collected for analysis in the
laboratory. They were placed in plastic bags that contained basic information
such as field site number, date of test, location and depth of test, and recorder.
Also, an artifact catalog card printed on acid-free cardstock was filled out with
location data and project information and was placed inside the artifact bag. A
single yellow survey flag indicating the location of Shovel Test 1 was hung from a
tree branch over the location of the shovel test. This was done at the request of
the Winn District archaeologist to aid in later site relocation. The remainder of
the shovel test flagging, indicating negative and positive tests, was buried in the
respective shovel test backfill at the end of the recordation process. Using the
site map, the forest service archaeologist could later determine the locations of
all site shovel tests in the field. A GPS was not used to mark the location of the
shovel tests since each test was excavated at the stakes that the surveyors had
placed with sub meter accuracy.
The locations of the survey shovel tests and shovel tests associated with
site delineation were incorporated in an Arcview drawing and were used to
produce the maps that will appear in the final report. The source points were put
onto a map by the surveyors. This map was given to the Project Archaeologist
who superimposed the shovel tests onto the topographic maps.
Previously recorded and newly recorded sites received a 30-meter
avoidance buffer around their perimeter to protect them from seismic activities.
The buffered areas were depicted on the seismic survey maps. In no case, were
these avoidance areas named as site locations on these maps.
Archaeological Monitoring of the Seismic Drilling
An archaeologist was present during the drilling phase of the seismic project
to insure that all site buffers were avoided by the seismic activities and investigate
any new source point locations resulting from the inability to access previously set
out points. The three Avoidance Area plans listed the distance in meters of the
proposed seismic activity to all the sites and isolated finds. All drilling and vehicle
access activities within 50 meters of any individual site or isolated find buffer areas
were monitored. Other site buffer areas were either monitored during drilling or
inspected at a later date to ensure no impacts were made to the sites. Inspections
of new source point locations and site delineation activities utilized the same
methods as described in the survey above. Monitoring took place from April 6,
2008 to August 12, 2008. The monitors were John C. Hogg, Kris Underwood, and
Phil Bishop.

32

Laboratory Analyses and Database Entries
In all, 6987 negative shovel tests were excavated at source point locations
throughout the project area. This information has been placed on a compact disc
entitled “Log of Source Points Investigated” that has been curated with the
artifacts and the remainder of records generated as a result of this project. This
log contains the following information: (1) source point number, (2) offset
distance and direction, (3) shovel test depth, (4), date of the excavation of each
shovel test, (5) name of the recorder who excavated the shovel test, and (6)
general comments regarding soil type and disturbance. Other information on this
compact disc includes (1) survey source point investigations, (2) the
investigations of new locations of source points that were moved outside of newly
discovered site areas, and (3) the investigations of source points that were
moved by the archaeological monitor during drilling operations.
The artifacts were analyzed by Rita D. Fields (see Prehistoric Artifact
Analysis and Historic Artifact Analysis below) who followed standard procedures
for artifact analysis. Some of the lithics were determined to be non-cultural.
These items include specimens made of chert that were crazed, fractured, and
pot-lidded. She believes these items occurred naturally as pebbles and were
altered due to natural causes such as grass fires and freezing temperatures.
They were separated from the cultural materials and placed in separate bags as
part of the curation package to ensure their availability to future researchers who
may have a different opinion. These bags are labeled, but individual tats are not
inserted in bags containing non-cultural material. Attributes for the three major
classes of prehistoric artifacts (projectile points, flakes, and ceramics) appear in
tabular form as part of the records submitted for curation. Completed forms for
each archeological site were submitted to the Louisiana Division of Archaeology
in Baton Rouge where official state trinomial site numbers were assigned.
Report Preparation and Submission
Following completion of all fieldwork, two copies of the draft report were
submitted to the Kisatchie National Forest, two copies were submitted to the
State Historic Preservation Officer for the State of Louisiana, one copy was
submitted to Jeffery S. Girard, and copies were submitted to the Caddo Tribe of
Oklahoma, Chitimacha Tribe, Choctaw Tribe of Oklahoma, Coushatta Tribe,
Jena Band of Choctaw, and the Tunica Biloxi for review. Following review by
these agencies and individuals, all comments will be addressed in the final
report, and the requisite number of final report copies will be delivered to all
concerned parties.
The Principal Investigator is the first author and is
responsible for preparing a report that will satisfy the United States Department
of Agriculture, Kisatchie National Forest and the Louisiana State Historic
Preservation Officer.

Distances from the nearest major water source were measured based on
the streams depicted on the topographic maps. In some cases, minor streams or
gullys appear on the site map, but these were not considered to be the nearest
major water source.
Curation
Upon completion of all fieldwork, all recovered artifacts were cleaned and
sorted by Rita Fields. At a minimum, all artifacts were analyzed by provenience
and classified by raw material, technological, and functional categories based on
southeastern typologies, and artifact classifications used in the vicinity of the
project area. Cleaned and analyzed artifacts were placed in plastic bags that are
four mm in thickness. Permanent pens were used to write on all plastic bags,
and writing was only on one side of the bag in neat, legible printed writing. The
artifacts were prepared for curation according to the Louisiana Division of
Archaeology curation standards and guidelines. Hand-written information on all
forms was completed in pencil. Staples, metal paper clips, tape, rubber bands, or
any materials were not used as they will deteriorate over time and are not
considered to be archival quality. All collections are accompanied by a catalogue
sheet.
Artifacts have been packed in archival quality storage boxes in such a
manner that they will not be damaged during transportation and storage. All
artifacts found during the survey, records generated by this project, and a copy of
the final report have been submitted to the Supervisor’s Office at the Kisatchie
National Forest in Pineville, Louisiana for permanent curation. All artifacts
recovered from work performed under this ARPA permit were treated in
accordance with 36 CFR 79.

This historic site is in Winn Parish and consists of a dipping vat operation
used by ranchers for the eradication of ticks and control of disease. The features
observed include a subterranean, concrete-lined dipping vat, four concrete slabs at
either end of the vat probably used as entrance and exit platforms for the animals,
two backdirt piles created from the excavation of the pit for the vat, and a circular
depression and associated backdirt pile that probably represents a well. Site
16WN501 is located on the toe slope of an upland ridge at an elevation of 150 to
160 feet above mean sea level overlooking an unnamed tributary of Bates Creek
60 meters to the south. A shovel test was excavated at the source point, but no
additional shovel tests were dug at this site due to the probable toxic nature of the
soil. The Forest Service Archaeologist not shovel these areas as they are toxic due
to the use of arsenic for dipping cattle. At the time of this survey the ground cover
visibility was less than ten percent due to leaves and forest debris. No artifacts were
collected. Vegetation consisted of mixed pines and hardwoods. The soil in the area
has been identified as Sacul fine sandy loam, 5 to 20 percent slopes (SC), and the

16WN510
This historic site is in Winn Parish and consists of features believed to be
associated with the lumber industry. The features include a series of six borrow pits
outlined by berms, a ditch, and backdirt piles. The pits and berms are aligned in a
row downslope where they form a series of terraced ponds. The pit is fed by a
small intermittent stream that feeds the first pit upslope, and then the stream spills
over into the next pit where it eventually fills in the rest of the pits. It is believed that
the function of these pits was for log storage. This site is in the proximity of
16WN511 (285 meters to the south), a large area of berms next to the old
Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad. Site 16WN510 is located on the side slope of an
upland ridge at an elevation of 128 to 136 feet above mean sea level overlooking a
large beaver pond on Spring Branch 200 meters to the east. The stream depicted
on the site map below is an intermittent stream that rarely contains water. One
shovel test was dug at the source point, and no artifacts were collected. At the time
of this survey the ground cover visibility was less than ten percent due to leaves
and forest debris. Vegetation consisted of mixed pines and hardwoods. The soil in
the area has been identified as Smithdale fine sandy loam, 8 to 20 percent slopes
(SM), and the amount of disturbance is estimated at less than 10%.
Representative shovel test profiles were not excavated at historic sites that were
delineated by the presence of surface features. The size of this site is 2,325 square
meters (0.57 acre), and its dimensions are 75 meters north-south x 40 meters eastwest. It is classified as a historic site associated with the lumber industry based on
the feature present. This site probably dates to the 20th century. The eligibility of
this site in terms of listing in the National Register of Historic Places is unknown.

This site is in Winn Parish and consists of a prehistoric and a historic
component. Sixteen tests were excavated at this site, and seven were positive. The
prehistoric component consists of 19 flakes, 6 pieces of shatter, 1 projectile point
medial fragment, 1 hammer stone, 1 Nodena Red-on-White, sherd, 6 Belcher
Ridged sherds, 1 untyped brushed sherd, 1 untyped engraved sherd, 5 plain sandtempered sherds, 2 plain sand and grog-tempered sherds, 13 plain grog-tempered
sherds, 3 shell-tempered sherds, and 1 bone-tempered sherd. Detailed information
regarding these artifacts is found in the Prehistoric Artifact Analysis section below.
The historic component consists of features believed to be associated with lumber
industry. These features include a series of five interconnected areas believed to
have been constructed for log storage. The areas consist of borrow areas outlined
along the sides and downhill slope with large berms. There is evidence that these
areas had water control devices installed in the bases of the downslope berms.
Eroded areas and cuts into the berms, as well as a valve stem and handle, support
this theory. “The LUNKENHEIMER CO CIN O” is embossed on the handle of the
valve. The company that made the valve started as the Cincinnati Brass Works
started by Frederick Lunkenheimer in the middle to late 19th century. It later
became the Lunkenheimer Valve Company, and it s still in operation. This firm
originally manufactured steam whistles, oilers, and valves (Smiddy 2007). Site
16WN511 is located on the top and side slope of an upland ridge at an elevation of
120 to 126 feet above mean sea level overlooking Spring Branch 30 meters to the
northeast. At the time of this survey the ground cover visibility was less than ten
percent due to leaves and forest debris. Vegetation consisted of mixed pines and
hardwoods. The soils in the area have been identified as Guyton silt loam,
frequently flooded (GY) and Shatta very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes
(Sk), and the amount of disturbance is estimated at between 10% and 20%. A
typical shovel test profile revealed loamy sand (10YR 5/2) from0-10 cm, loamy
sand (10YR 6/6) from 10-50 cm, and compact sandy clay (10YR 5/8) from 50-55
cm. The size of this site is 10,760 square meters (2.66 acres), and its dimensions
are 194 meters northwest-southeast x 70 meters northeast-southwest. The
prehistoric component is classified as Baytown based on the grog-tempered and
bone-tempered sherds, Mississippian based on the shell-tempered sherd, and
Caddo based on the Nodena Red-on-White sherd and the Belcher Ridged sherd,
and the historic component is classified as a historic site that probably represents a
major rail hub for the lumber industry where logs were collected at the satellite hubs
before being transported for loading on large railroad cars. The site is adjacent to
the now abandoned track of the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad that was owned
by William Buchanan, the owner of the Bodcaw Lumber Company. The eligibility of
this site in terms of listing in the National Register of Historic Places is unknown.
This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected by the current seismic
project. The temporary number assigned in the field was TB-02, and the number
assigned by the Forest Service is 08060400639. It is depicted on the Coup Point

10YR 5/6) from 44-48 cm. The size of this site is 1,703 square meters (0.42 acre),
and its dimensions are 60 meters north-south x 40 meters east-west. It is classified
as a probable farmstead based on artifacts typically associated with this type of
site. This site dates from the late 19th century through the early 20th century.
Features at this site include a post and lintel structure that may have been a shed in
the past, a hog wire fence, a circular depression that may have functioned as a
well, a square depression that may have been a root cellar. A domestic flowerbed
adds support to the theory that this site was a farmstead. The eligibility of this site
in terms of listing in the National Register of Historic Places is unknown. This site

PREHISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
In all, 1204 prehistoric artifacts were recovered during the course of this
survey. Prehistoric artifacts include 1003 lithic artifacts and 198 ceramic sherds.
Additionally, three faunal specimens were also recovered that were interpreted to
have originated from American Indian occupations. Artifact analysis data were
entered onto a Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet was put on a compact disc
and submitted to the USDA for their files.
Projectile Points
Seven lithic tools are classified as projectile points. The assemblage is
composed exclusively of specimens that probably date to the Archaic period
(Figure 88). Table 1 contains information regarding provenience information for
each point. The identifications are based on local types found within the
immediate area and vicinity as well as general morphological similarities to
previously identified points in Louisiana. Sources used in the identification and
discussion of these points were McGahey (2000), Perino (1985), Schambach
(1998), Turner and Hester (1985), Webb (1981), and a personal communication
with Jeffrey S. Girard.
One projectile point is classified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88a). This
specimen was recorded as an isolated find found at locality 08060400642. It is
made from local gravel chert and is missing its extreme tip. Metric measurements
for the specimen include width (26.2 mm), length (36.9 mm), and thickness (11.5
mm). The specimen weighs 10.18 grams. It is medium in size, side-notched, and
has an expanded stem with a slightly rounded basal edge.
One projectile point is classified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88b). The
specimen was recovered from site 16NA640. It is made from local gravel chert.
Metric measurements for the specimen include width (20.4 mm), length (32.8
mm), and thickness (8.3 mm). The specimen weighs 4.9 grams. It exhibits fine
pressure flaking along the blade edges and has straight blades. The specimen is
side-notched and has squared shoulder tangs with a slightly straight basal edge.

One projectile point was identified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88c). It was
recorded as an isolated find found at locality 08060400647. This specimen is
manufactured from gravel chert. Metric measurements include width (33.7 mm),
length (46.9 mm), thickness (10.3 mm), and it weighs 14.15 grams. The
specimen is missing the extreme tip and has straight blade edges. It has a
slightly expanding stem and a straight basal edge.
One projectile point was identified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88d). It was
recovered from site 16WN513. It is made from local gravel chert. Metric
measurements include width (35.2 mm), length (61.6 mm), thickness (12.3 mm),
and it weighs 24.82 grams. The specimen is a large spear point with straight to
slightly excurvate blade edges. It has an expanded stem with a straight to slightly
excurvate basal edge. It does not appear to be finished, and it is missing one
shoulder that was possibly broken during manufacture.
One projectile point was identified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88e). The
specimen was recovered from site 16WN504. It is made from local gravel chert.
Metric measurements include width (25.2 mm), length (36.6 mm), thickness (9.6
mm), and it weighs 7.44 grams. It is a small to medium sized dart point with
straight-sided blade edges with rounded shoulders, straight stem, and a straight
basal edge.
One projectile point was identified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88f). The
specimen was recovered from site 16NA652. It is made from smoky gray
novaculite. Metric measurements include width (32 mm), length (50.7) thickness
(7.3 mm), and it weighs 12.86 grams. This specimen exhibits fine pressure
flaking with slightly excurvate blade edges. The point was broken across the
blade during shovel testing and was repaired in the laboratory. It has an
expanding stem and is corner-notched.
One projectile point was identified as untyped Archaic (Figure 88g). The
specimen was recovered from site 16WN500. It is made from white novaculite.
Metric measurements include width (21 mm), length (30.9 mm), thickness (8.2
mm), and it weighs 5.21 grams. The specimen has straight blade edges and is
corner-notched with slight shoulder barbs. The specimen has an expanded
excurvate basal edge and is missing the extreme distal tip as a result of an
impact fracture. Similar points are described by Perino (1985) and Turner and
Hester (1985) as belonging to the Motley type. Motley points date to the Middle
and Late Archaic periods (circa 1500 B.C. – 500 B.C) and are also found in
northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas. This type is often made from exotic
chert.

206

Projectile Point Fragments
Twelve projectile point fragments were recovered. They include two tips,
four stems, and six unidentifiable fragments. Table 2 contains information
regarding provenience information for each fragment. Two projectile points or
knife tips were recovered during this survey. Stone tool tips were classified as
projectile point tips based on the presence or absence of edge straightening, fine
pressure flaking, and/or deliberate retouch along one or both marginal edges of
the blade. Broken blade fragments often enter the archaeological record due to
usage, maintenance, or manufacturing activities. During maintenance, the
possibility of breakage occurs during re-sharpening. Manufacturing breaks or
failures occur most often during thinning processes such as early and late stages
of bifacial tool thinning. Because projectile points/knives have multifunctional
uses, tools may be broken during a number of use related activities including
scraping, cutting, perforating, or actual use as a projectile in which case broken
tool fragments may return to a base camp lodged in the carcass of animals. The
tool fragment would then be subsequently discarded during butchering activities.
Breakage patterns were identified for each specimen. Both specimens were
broken as a result of lateral snaps
Four stems or hafting element fragments were recovered. Stems are
likely to enter the archaeological record through re-hafting maintenance activities.
Stem snaps occur most often during tool utilization (Johnson 1981). Specimens
were analyzed and sorted into morphological categories based on hafting area
types presented by Cambron and Hulse (1975). All specimens were identified as
being straight sided. Additionally, basal edge nomenclature was also assigned.
Basal edge types included rounded (n=1), excurvate (n=1), and straight edges
(n=2). Three stems appear to have originated from small to medium sized dart
points while the remaining stem likely originated from a large to medium sized
spear.
Six fragments originating from projectile points were unable to be sorted
into identifiable categories such as stems or tips. These fragments were counted
and raw material recorded.
Non-Hafted Bifaces
Non-hafted bifaces are worked stone tools with clear bifacial flaking on
both faces. These tools show no evidence of hafting and may be recovered in
various states of completion. Eight bifacially worked tools and/or tool fragments
were recovered during this survey. Table 3 contains information regarding
provenience information for each non-hafted biface.

Scrapers
Scrapers were recognized as either end scrapers or thumbnail scrapers.
As the name implies, ends scrapers are generally a unifacial tool manufactured
on the end of a medium to large flake opposite the bulb of percussion, but they
may also be manufactured from a split cobble or core. One end scraper was
recovered during the Bodcaw 3-D Seismic Survey, and it was found at site
16NA652. The specimen was manufactured from an oversized chert gravel flake.
One thumbnail scraper was found at isolated find 08060400670, and it was
manufactured from a piece of chert gravel. Thumbnail scrapers are similar to
end scrapers with the exception that utilization occurs on one or both lateral
edges. Giliberti (1995) suggests thumbnail scrapers were handheld, but they may
have been hafted. Table 4 contains information regarding provenience
information for each scraper.

Ground Stone Tools
Ground stone tools included in this discussion consist of hammer stones
and/or nutting stones. Two hammer stones and one nutting stone were
recovered during the course of the survey.
The hammer stones were
manufactured from chert gravel cobbles. The nutting stone is made of sandstone
and exhibits pitted, well-worn indentions on both faces. Hammer stones and
nutting stones are generally associated with stone tool manufacture and
maintenance, but they may also be considered to be a multi-functional tool.
Other functions include grinding vegetable matter, seeds, or grains, and
utilization during nut mast harvesting. Table 5 contains information regarding
provenience information for each ground stone tool.
Cores
Cores are the parent material from which lithic tools are manufactured.
Percentages of the various raw materials utilized during the manufacture of cores
and core fragments are likely to vary based on the distance from known quarries.
Four cores or core fragments were recovered during the course of this survey.
Three core fragments were made from gravel chert, and the core was made from
agate. Table 6 contains information regarding provenience information for each
core.

Debitage
At most archaeological sites, debitage (artifacts resulting from stone tool
manufacture and maintenance) constitutes the majority of artifacts recovered.
Not surprisingly, lithic debitage made up the majority of artifacts recovered during
this survey. In all, 968 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered. The survey area
included portions of Natchitoches and Winn parishes, with the two parishes
divided by Saline Bayou. Sites recorded in Natchitoches Parish produced the
majority of debitage with a total of 679 pieces. Of the 679 pieces of debitage, 439
were considered actual flakes while 240 were coded as shatter or blocky
fragments. Part of the debitage sample (shatter and blocky fragments) does not
retain primary flake characteristics and mainly consists of angular fragments or
broken indiscernible flake fragments that could not be properly identified into a
flake category. Winn Parish sites produced the remaining 289 pieces, and 44
specimens were identified as shatter or blocky fragments.
A number of different raw materials were identified during the debitage
analysis. These were analyzed by parish. Tables 7 and 8 tabulate flakes by raw
material for the two parishes. Raw material for artifacts found at Natchitoches
Parish sites includes 443 agate specimens, 205 chert gravel specimens, 21
novaculite specimens, 5 quartzite specimens, 4 silicified wood specimens, and 1
quartz specimen. Raw materials for artifacts found at Winn Parish sites include
239 chert gravel specimens, 24 agate specimens, 14 novaculite specimens, 6
quartzite specimens, 3 silicified wood specimens, and 1 quartz specimen.
Noticeable differences were observed for the occurrence of debitage by
raw material between the two parishes. The two primary raw materials identified
at archaeological sites within the project area are agate and chert gravels.
Differences in the percentages suggest distribution and/or raw material access
changes. In Natchitoches Parish, agate composed 65% of the raw material
verses chert gravels with 30%. Sites identified in Winn Parish, on the other
hand, produced mostly chert gravel debitage (82% compared to agate at 10%).
The dramatic difference in raw material for the two areas suggests that agate
was more readily available as a raw material than chert in Natchitoches Parish,
at least within the confines of this project area. Chert overwhelmingly is the raw
material of choice within the project area in Winn Parish.

Sites producing a majority of agate were plotted in order to identify
possible raw material use patterns and sources. In Natchitoches Parish, sites
producing a majority of agate were concentrated in a tight cluster along the
confluence of Choctaw Creek and Saline Bayou to the east. Agate at these
sites, although representing all stages of manufacturing activities, was primarily
coded as shatter or blocky fragments. Two sites (16NA640 and 16NA645),
located 1.25 linear miles from one another on Choctaw Creek, contained the
highest percentages of shatter with 51% and 40%, respectively. The high
percentage of shatter indicates early stages of manufacture and primary
procurement strategies. Site 16NA656, located 2.5 miles north of 16NA640 on
Eightmile Creek, contained 37% of agate shatter. Farther north (3.5 miles) at
the confluence of Brickyard Branch and Saline Bayou, site 16NA642 produced
33% of agate shatter. The general trend observed indicates that as one moves
away from Choctaw Creek agate shatter decreases, suggesting that a quarry or
primary source location for agate is located in the general vicinity of Choctaw
Creek.
Novaculite is the third most plentiful raw material recovered during this
project, although it represents only 5% of the total debitage assemblage.
Although novaculite represents only a small percentage of the total assemblage,
its presence indicates long distant trade and/or procurement strategies.
Natchitoches Parish sites contained slightly more novaculite than Winn Parish
sites, 5% compared to 3%. Looking at the reduction stages for novaculite as a
whole, 67% of the novaculite sample fell within the later stages of biface
manufacture and maintenance. Moreover, only 6% of the sample was identified
as shatter, a percentage well below that which would represent early stages of
manufacture. The higher percentage of later stage debitage suggests that
completed projectile points or bifaces were brought to the project area and resharpened or completed at those locations the novaculite was identified.
The small sample sizes for each of the sites encumbers inferences related
to site function based on inferred reduction stage debitage assignment; however,
it appears that the majority of archaeological sites recorded in the project area
represents small, ephemeral or temporary special purpose camps such as
overnight hunting stands or foraging and procurement camps as well as
residential (long to short term) occupations. Reduction stage assignment for all
debitage categories, for the most part, fall within the early stage reduction
category with very little late or middle stage debitage.

215

Ceramics
In all, 199 ceramic sherds were recovered during the current survey.
Ceramics were found at sixteen sites and six isolated finds. Ten of the sixteen
sites are in Natchitoches Parish, while the remaining six sites are in Winn Parish.
The sample includes 164 body sherds, 21 rim sherds, 2 base sherds, and 12
sherd fragments (also referred to as sherdlets). The 21 rim sherds originated
from simple bowls or jars. Small size precludes inferences related to orifice
diameter. Temper types for recovered ceramics include grog, grog and sand,
grog and shell, sand, bone and sand, and shell (Table 9).
The majority of the ceramic assemblage exhibits no form of visible exterior
decoration. Samples of the decorated ceramics appear in figures 89 and 90. Of
the 145 plain ceramics, 12 were coded as sherd fragments (sherdlets) that are
too small to further define into analysis categories. Plain grog-tempered wares
(n=71) make up the majority of undecorated ceramics. Paste quality varies from
sherd to sherd as well as site-to-site. Paste types range from very contorted,
chunky grog particles to very fine grog with minimal amounts of sand inclusions.
The average thickness for grog tempered plain ware is 6.1 mm.
Both grog-tempered and sand-tempered plain wares were fairly evenly
represented in both Natchitoches and Winn parishes with slightly higher grog
temper representation in Natchitoches Parish. Differences were observed in the
percentages of shell-tempered and bone-tempered plain wares in each parish.
Bone-tempered plain wares represent only 2% of the total plain ceramic
assemblage in Natchitoches Parish. Similarly, shell-tempered plain wares
represent the same percentage. In Winn Parish, however, bone-tempered plain
wares constitute the second highest percentage of the ceramic assemblage with
26%. Although not representing as much, shell-tempered plain wares make up
11% of the total Winn Parish assemblage. The comparison suggests that sites
identified in Winn Parish represent later occupations than those identified in
Natchitoches Parish.
Fifty-five sherds demonstrated some form of visible exterior decoration
such as brushing, ridging, cord marking, stamping, incision, engraving, painted,
and punctuations (Table 10). Late ceramic types that could be confidently
identified as Caddoan and Mississippian include Belcher Ridged (Figure 89a-b),
Plaquemine Brushed (Figure 89c), Pease Brushed (Figure d-e), Cahokia CordMarked (Figure 89f), Nodena Red-on-White (Figure 89g) and Hodges Engraved
(Figure 89h). There are five types with exterior forms of decoration that could not
be assigned to a known type. These specimens are tentatively classified in this
report as untyped brushed, untyped engraved, untyped incised, untyped
punctuated, and untyped stamped.

Ceramics with ridging used as a decorative treatment was the most
common type encountered during this survey. Twenty-five sherds were identified
as Belcher Ridged. Temper for the Belcher Ridged sherds include grog, sand,
bone, and mixed grog and sand. This sample includes 24 body sherds and one
rim sherd that is rounded and turned slightly outward. Vessel wall thickness
ranges from 4.2 mm to 7.1 mm with an average of 5.4 mm. The paste is finely
compact and well fired. Decoration consists of tiny pinched ridges that are
closely spaced and vertically placed on the exterior of the vessel. Two foci are
presented for Belcher Ridged ceramics. The first (Bossier Focus) consists of
grog-tempered, grit-tempered, and bone-tempered wares and dates from A.D.
1100 to A.D. 1300. The second (Belcher Focus) consists of a shell-tempered
specimen and dates from A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1500. Based on temper type, the
Belcher Ridged ceramics recovered during the present study would fall within the
Bossier Focus.

Two sherds exhibit exterior paint as a decorative technique. One sherd,
classified as Nodena Red-on-White (Figure 89g), was identified as a body sherd
with a thickness of 5.5 mm. Nodena Red-on-White ceramics are defined by
alternating bands of red and white paint on a light buff un-slipped surface on
shell-tempered ware (Phillips 1970). Unfortunately, this sherd is not large
enough to confidently identify the decorative pattern, but the different color paint
is faintly visible. Nodena Red-on-White dates to the Late Mississippian or Early to
Middle Caddo periods between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1500. One additional grogtempered sherd that appears to be painted with red pigment was provisionally
identified as Larto Red (Figure 90d). The sherd is a body sherd and has a
thickness of 5.6 mm. Larto Red ceramics generally date to the early Baytown or
Middle Woodland periods in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Woodland ceramics
include Marksville Incised, French Fork Incised, and Larto Red.
Five incised and five engraved sherds were recovered. Two grogtempered sherds were classified as Marksville Incised (Figure 90a-b). The two
sherds were identified as body sherds and were recovered from the same site
(16NA655). Decorations consist of at least one wide line incision on the exterior
surface of the sherd. The average thickness for the sherds was 5.4 mm.
Marksville ceramics generally range in age from between 200 B.C. during the
earlier part of the Woodland period to A.D. 600. One fine line incised sherd was
identified as French Fork Incised (Figure 90c). The sherd has a thickness of 6.1
mm. Identification was based on decorative patterns of the incision. The
decoration consists of curvilinear fine lines that form what appears to be a
keyhole design. Keyhole patterns are most often associated with French Fork
Incised ceramics. French Fork Incised ceramics date to the latter part of the Late
Woodland period during the Coles Creek period circa A.D. 700 to A.D. 1000. The
remaining two incised sherds could not be positively identified to a distinct type.
They consist of single fine line decorations of unknown orientation other than
being located on the exterior surface of the vessel.
The use of brushing as a decorative treatment is the second most
common decorative type present in the assemblage. Twelve body sherds and
one rim sherd that exhibit brushing as a decoration were recovered. Temper for
the brushed sherds included grog, sand, mixed grog and sand, bone, and shell.
Sherds manufactured using grog, sand, mixed grog and sand, and bone were
identified as Pease Brushed (Figure 89d-e). The remaining shell-tempered,
brushed sherd was provisionally identified as Plaquemine Brushed (Figure 89-c).
Vessel wall thickness for the Pease Brushed sherds ranges from 4 mm to 7.1
mm with an average of 6.4 mm. Decoration consists of brushing within panels
over the entire exterior (base excluded) of the vessel. The brushing is applied in
diagonally alternating directions. Pease Brushed ceramics date to the Early
Caddo period, and Belcher Ridged sherds date to the Late Caddo period.

222

The single Plaquemine Brushed body sherd (Figure 89c) has a thickness
of 5.3 mm. Plaquemine Brushed dates to the Late Mississippian or Early to
Middle Caddo, circa A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500. Similar to Belcher Ridged, Pease
Brushed pottery was predominantly recovered from sites along the floodplain of
Saline Bayou. This is not surprising as the two ceramic types are considered
contemporaneous and were found within the same site assemblages.
Engraved sherds included one sherd identified as Hodges Engraved
(Figure 89h) and four that were not identifiable to a distinct type. The Hodges
Engraved sherd was identified as a shell-tempered, out-flaring rim sherd possibly
originating from a carinated bowl. It was not possible to determine the orifice
diameter due to the small size of the specimen. The thickness of the sherd is 4.4
mm. The sherd is very well made and well fired. Hodges Engraved ceramics date
to the Late Caddo period, circa A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1650. The remaining engraved
specimen is tempered with shell, sand, and mixed sand and bone. Decoration is
faint and eroded providing little information that could be used to type the
specimen. Based on temper and the association with the Hodges Engraved
sherd, the specimen may be affiliated with the Late Caddoan period.
Three grog-tempered sherds with faint stamped decorations were
recovered from 16NA655. Two specimens appear to exhibit faint evidence of
dentate stamping. The final specimen has a drag and jab stamped impression.
Site 16NA655 also produced Marksville Incised ceramics, so it is possible that
the grog-tempered specimens discussed here date to the Middle Woodland
period and may represent Marksville type ceramics. No wide line incisions are
present on any of the specimen so this statement is speculation at best.
One shell-tempered sherd exhibits cord mark decorations and was typed
as Cahokia Cord-Marked (Figure 89f). The sherd was identified as a body sherd,
and it has a thickness of 5.5 mm. This type dates to the Middle to Late
Mississippian period. Examples of decorated ceramics found during this survey
appear in figures 89 and 90. According to Girard (personal communication), the
use of cord marking as a decorative technique is very rare in this portion of the
state (project area) even in Late Woodland period sites with good context.
One grog-tempered sherd was identified as containing faint punctate
decoration. This is a body sherd, and it has a thickness of 5.3 mm. Unfortunately,
a positive identification was not possible, and it is simply identified as Untyped
Punctated.
Faunal Assemblage
Two faunal specimens were recovered during this survey. One specimen
was recovered from site 16WN509 and consisted of a burned unidentified
mammal fragment. The other specimen was recovered from site 16WN511 and
consisted of a burned piece of turtle carapace.

223

HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
In all, 433 artifacts collected during this survey date to the historic period
(Table 12). Historic artifacts were collected from nine sites. They include site
16NA653 in Natchitoches Parish and sites 16WN490, 16WN493, 16WN498,
16WN506, 16WN507, 16WN508, 16WN509, and 16WN512 in Winn Parish. A
total of 378 artifacts could be sorted into Orser’s functional typology. The
remaining 55 specimens were listed as unidentifiable or fragmented and
removed from the study.
When the functional categories of artifact types were compared, artifacts
associated with foodways dominate the total assemblage with 313 artifacts
followed by 63 artifacts related to structural or household activities, 1 artifact
described as a weapon, and 1 artifact described as personal. The foodways
category consists of 5 stoneware fragments, 24 earthenware fragments, 3 pieces
of milk glass, 21 pieces of lamp glass, 2 items described as cooking utensils, 22
tin can fragments, 232 broken glass fragments, 2 soda bottle tops, and 2 faunal
specimens.
Structural/household artifacts include 32 specimens identified as nails, 17
pieces of window glass, 13 brick fragments, and 1 metal door hinge. All
household or structural artifacts fall within the subcategory of architecture and
likely represent the remains of household structures or outbuildings. Also, one
spent .22 caliber round and a button were recovered.
Ceramics
One of the best methods employed by archaeologists in determining the
chronological sequence of a site is through the analysis of historic ceramics.
Ceramics resemble other assemblages dating from the late 19th century to the
early 20th century. As part of this analysis, ceramics were sorted into refined
earthenware and stoneware. Twenty-four whiteware sherds were recovered, and
the majority of whiteware sherds (n=21) are undecorated. The remaining three
specimens are decorated with a decal. This artifact type dates to sometime
around 1900.
Stoneware is one of the most common ceramics recovered from historic
archaeological assemblages. Because stoneware was a utilitarian ware, it was
common and, therefore, widely present at historic sites. Utilitarian stoneware
was available in many different shapes, sizes, and glaze types. Five stoneware
vessel fragments were recovered. Four were identified as Bristol Brown and
probably represent a churn. The remaining sherd was identified as alkaline
glazed stoneware. Dates for the stoneware sherds range from 1850 to 1900 and
later.

224

Table 12. Historic Artifacts

225

Glass
The most numerous artifact type recovered during this survey is glass.
Container glass is the most common with 232 specimens. This is followed by
milk glass fragments (n=3), lamp globe glass fragments (n=21), and flat window
glass fragments (n=17). The majority of container glass is clear (n=176), Two
fragments originated from clear canning jars, and three fragments originated from
milk bottles. The remaining glass fragments were unable to be sorted into a
functional category. Three fragments are amber in color and probably represent
snuff bottles. Thirty-nine fragments are aqua in color and have the characteristics
of Mason canning jars. The remaining fragments include 5 amethyst glass
fragments, 3 cobalt glass fragments, 3 milk glass fragments, 1 misty hand blown
fragment, and 1 olive glass fragment. Twenty-one pieces of very thin glass was
identified as glass fragments from an oil or kerosene globe lamp.
Window glass thickness is sometimes used to date archaeological sites. In
general, window glass is thought to have increased in thickness over time.
Thickness was measured on the seventeen fragments recovered during this
survey. Thickness ranged from 1.6 mm to 2.9 mm with a median of 2.15 mm,
providing a date range of 1893 to 1901 with a mean date of 1889 based on Orser
(1987).
Metal
Eighty-three pieces of metal were identified during this survey. Fifty-five
specimens could not be identified because of deterioration. The remaining metal
objects include 22 pieces of a tin can, 2 cooking utensils (spoons), 2 soda bottle
caps, 1 door hinge, and 1 spent .22 caliber round.
Thirty-two nails were recovered during this survey. Nails are very common
at 19th and 20th century sites. They also are the most reliable and accurate tool
for dating the undocumented buildings of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. The presence of nails may be the only clear indicator of the existence
of a structure since many wooden buildings rested on piers that were often
moved when the structure was razed. Nails have been manufactured in three
basic forms over the years: hand wrought (forged), machine cut, and wire
(drawn). The nail assemblage (including both complete and fragments) includes
11 machine cut nails and 21 wire or drawn nails. Machine cut nails were initially
produced in the late 18th century. By 1830, machine cut nails were being made
with machine stamped heads, and other improvements were made so that these
nails were no longer brittle and, therefore, could be clinched without breaking
(Young and Wright 2000). Wire nails began to appear at construction sites circa
1890. Because of the inexpensiveness of wire nails, they quickly replaced cut
nails and by 1913 at least 90% of all nails in use were wire (Young and Wright
2000). All the cut nails recovered were machine headed, indicating a date range
of 1797-1896. The wire nails dates from 1890 to the present.

226

Bricks
As brick-making methods changed through time, so did the quality of the
bricks used. Thirteen brick fragments were recovered during this survey. Twelve
of the 13 were handmade, while the remaining fragment was identified as
machine-made brick. While a precise dating of the bricks recovered is not
possible because the brick is machine made and handmade, it is a high
probability that its date is consistent with those of the other architectural materials
and dates to the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century.
All the brick was recovered from site 16WN490.
Buttons
A single metal button was recovered during this survey. The button is a
snap button and has Kangaroo imprinted on one side. It was recovered from
16WN512.
Faunal Specimens
Two faunal specimens were also recovered from site 16NA653 and are
associated with the historic occupation of the site. The specimens were identified
with the assistance of Dr. Ed Jackson, faunal specialist at the University of
Southern Mississippi. The fragments consist of left tibia medial fragment from a
goat or sheep. The specimen contains carnivore gnaw marks likely from a dog.
The other specimen consists of a left lower maxilla of a goat or sheep. The
specimen was in six pieces and reconstructed in the lab for analysis.
Summary
It is hard to say for sure what the historic sites identified in this survey
represent. It is possible they could represent trash scatters associated with
farms or homesteads. Considering the long history of logging in the region
during the latter part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, the
historic sites may represent the remnants of ephemeral or possibly long term
logging camps.

227

HISTORIC FEATURES
Lumber sites16WN494, 16WN497, and 16WN498 are in similar
topographic settings. Also, there are historic trams on either side of these sites
or oriented so that they head in the direction of these sites. Two sites (16 ) and
16WN498) are situated on the top slope of an upland ridge, while 16WN494 is on
the side slope of an upland ridge. The three sites overlook large, broad valleys.
Features associated with these sites include borrow areas, concrete foundation
slabs with adjacent concrete lined pits, evidence of cut-and-fill activities and large
areas surrounded by berms. These berms enclose containment areas that may
have had two important functions. First, they may have been used as dams for
water containment to store logs, and the top of these berms may have served as
a platform for trams for railroad cars that circled the enclosure while removing the
logs from the ponds and transporting them to the railroad track where they were
taken to the next destination, probably the mill. If the function of these berms
was only as dams for water containment, they would have been placed farther
down slope, and the top elevation of each one would have been the same.
Photographs of these sites appear in Appendix VI.
The berm enclosures at 16WN497 and 16WN498 are large single
containment areas in the form of an oval, while the enclosure at 16WN494 is a
large oval that has been subdivided by berms to produce one large and four
smaller areas enclosed by berms. The three concrete slabs all are roughly the
same size, but they differ in design. No rebar was used in any of the slabs. The
foundation at 16WN497 (Figure 91) was poured around four vertical posts that
were presumably used as tie downs for a large winch. The holes are evident in
the slab. The slab showed signs of a catastrophic failure. It broke into several
scattered pieces, tossing two and flipping them upside down over a portion of the
concrete lined pit. The slabs at the other two sites (16WN494 and 16WN498)
have two large concrete support blocks, one on either side of the slab. These
blocks have tie downs at each end, making a total of four tie downs per slab, one
at each corner. These slabs are thought to represent foundations for heavy
equipment such as steam powered donkey engines. These engines could have
powered cable winches, pumps, or other equipment.
The tie downs at 16WN498 consist of loops of 2-inch braided wire rope
poured into the concrete of one of the blocks and two chain links set into the
concrete in the other block (Figure 92). The tie downs at site 16WN494 have two
large chain links on the ends of each block (Figure 93). The concrete lined pits at
each site are similar with the exception of 16WN498 that has a 4-inch cased well
pipe protruding from the pit with a 1-inch pipe and high pressure Nordstrom
valve. These pits may have acted as cisterns, and they may have had wells in
them. The sites may represent an evolution of the facility design with 16WN497
being the oldest, followed by 16WN498 and 16WN494. Sites 16WN497 and
16WN498 have large deep, straight-sided borrow areas that were probably made
by early steam shovels.

The large earthen mounds in the area may have been borrow piles that
were not needed after berm construction was completed. Site 16WN494 has a
large borrow area cut into the side of a hill slope, and it is lacking the borrow
mounds. The remaining two sites (16WN510 and 16WN511) have large areas
enclosed by berms that were presumably used for log storage while awaiting
transport, and they are near a major railroad. These sites lack the concrete
foundation slabs, concrete lined pits, and large borrow areas away from the
areas enclosed berms. These two sites probably represent a major rail hub for
the lumber industry where the logs collected at the satellite hubs were
transported for loading on large railroad cars. The lack of concrete foundations
suggests that any steam donkey engines used in log loading were mounted on
railroad cars. There is a valve stem and handle at the base of one of the
containment areas at 16WN511. The valve handle is labeled “The
LUNKENHEIMER CO CIN O.” The company started as the Cincinnati Brass
works started by Fredrick Lunkenheimer in the mid to late 19th century. It later
became the Lunkenheimer Valve Company that exists to this day. They
originally manufactured steam whistles, oilers, and valves (Smiddy 2007).
Photographs of these sites appear in Appendix VI.

231

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A check of the site records on file at the Kisatchie National Forest in
Pineville, Louisiana and the Louisiana Division of Archaeology revealed 199
previously recorded archaeological sites and isolated finds have been documented
in the current project area (Appendix IV). Of this number, 81 sites are prehistoric,
38 sites are historic, 2 sites contain both prehistoric and historic components, there
is no information for 9 sites, and 69 areas are classified as isolated finds. The vast
majority of previously known sites in the current project area consist of lithic
scatters with few artifacts, not one of which can be viewed as diagnostic of a
particular archaeological period. Diagnostic artifacts were found in a few cases,
and they suggest occupation of the area during the Archaic, Woodland, and
Caddoan periods of Louisiana prehistory. Prior to the current study, most of the
cultural resource surveys were performed in-house by staff archaeologists working
for the Kisatchie National Forest. When prudent, private contract firms were
brought in for survey, testing, and excavation. These investigations are discussed
in the section entitled Archaeological Background earlier in this report.
Field Survey
The field survey identified forty-two previously unrecorded archaeological
sites. Eighteen sites (16NA639 – 16NA656) are in Natchitoches Parish (Table 13),
and twenty-four (16WN490 - 16WN513) are in Winn Parish (Table 14). Normally,
an isolated find is defined as a single artifact found with no discernable association
with other artifacts or features. The sample of newly recorded sites in the project
area consists of 30 prehistoric sites and 10 historic sites. Two sites are historic,
but single prehistoric artifacts were found on the surface. Therefore, they are
referred to in this report as multi-component sites with the abbreviation “P/H” on
those tables depicting newly recorded sites in the project area. During this
project, however, sites with four artifacts or less received the designation of isolated
find based on criteria established by the Louisiana Division of Archaeology.
Therefore, 42 areas where four artifacts or less were identified are referred to in this
report as isolated finds. Thirteen isolated finds (08060400642 - 08060400654) are
in Natchitoches Parish (Table15), and 29 of the isolated finds (08060400655 –
08060400683) are in Winn Parish (Table 16). Of the forty-two newly found sites, 30
are prehistoric, 10 are historic, and 2 are historic with minor prehistoric components
(surface finds). Five of the historic sites (16WN494, 16WN497, 16WN498,
16WN510, and 16WN511) are believed to date to the lumber industry, and they are
discussed below. The location of each site and isolated find on USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangles is found in Appendix III. The Natchitoches National
Forest is divided into compartments, and Table 17 identifies those newly recorded
sites and isolated finds according to compartment. The following information was
taken, in part, from the artifact analysis (see above) and is summarized below.

No evidence of Paleoindian occupation was found during the current survey.
It should be stated here that one site (found during a previous survey) yielded a
single San Patrice point that dates to the Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic periods.
The earliest known utilization of the project area, based on this survey, dates from
the Early Archaic through the Late Archaic periods and is represented by projectile
points at five sites and two isolated finds. Four of these points were made from
local chert probably obtained from a nearby stream bed or a local quarry, and two
were made from novaculite a non-local material that could have come from other
parts of the Southeast such as Arkansas. According to Lee Stewart, novaculite is a
rare find in the Kisatchie National Forest. The Archaic sites were found in a
floodplain setting and along the slopes and tops of upland ridges.
The Late Prehistoric period in the project area is represented by sites where
ceramics were recovered. This period is also referred to as Woodland, which lasted
from about 500 B.C. to A.D. 900 after which time Caddoan tribes began to occupy
the area. The current survey identified Woodland period sites based on ceramic
types Larto Red (Baytown), French Fork Incised (Coles Creek), and Marksville
Incised (Marksville). Caddo pottery types in the project area include Hodges
Engraved, Belcher Ridged, Pease Brushed, and Belcher Ridged. Nodena Red-onWhite and Plaquemine Brushed types date to the Mississippian period. Plain grogtempered pottery was found at a number of sites, and this type is associated with
sites dating to the Baytown period. Materials used as temper include bone, sand,
grog, and shell and a combination of some of these. Decorative techniques noted
include brushing, incising, stamping, ridges, cord-marks, engraving, punctuations,
and paint. The ceramic producing sites are located in floodplains and along upland
ridges with a concentration along Saline Bayou, the major stream in the project
area.
The historic period in the project area is represented by a variety of sites
that can be categorized as domestic, lumbering, and military. Of the previously
recorded historic sites (n=40) two contain prehistoric components. These sites
are described on the site forms as artifact scatters probably associated with early
house sites or farmsteads, wells, trash dumps dating from the latter part of the
19th century through the early 20th century, a single grave, segments of trams
used by logging companies, and foundations that supported observation towers
that were used to observe bombing operations during World War II. The current
survey located and recorded twelve historic sites, one of which has a prehistoric
component. These sites include farmsteads and features associated with the
lumber industry such as earthen berms and cement foundations. Segments of
trams were observed, but they were not assigned official site numbers.

Outside the project area, but in close proximity, is the Drake’s Salt Works
located on Saline Bayou (Veatch 1902). There were several salt licks in the area,
and they were first used by the local Indians. Veatch does not state how the salt
was obtained by the Indians, but their use of it is documented by early explorers.
One account of a band of Ouachita Indians with several pirogues loaded with salt
were observed in 1700 by Bienville four and a half leagues west of the Tensas
River (Veatch 1902). Bienville also mentions Natchitoches Indians engaged in
the trading and selling of salt. The water in local springs was very salty, and the
salt was deposited on the banks during hot weather. The first use of the salt
deposits by the early settlers is not known (Veatch 1902). Apparently, the salt
was easy to obtain, as there is an account of two crippled men who were able to
supply a district with salt using twelve old pots and kettles (date of this operation
not stated). One of the first accounts of the use of salt by non-Indians was an
1805 account by John Sibley in a letter to General Dearborn discussing a deposit
about twelve miles north of Natchitoches on the northeast side of the river. This
was located on land owned by a Mr. Reuben Drake. The local demand for salt
was such that Drake “attempted to obtain a deeper brine by boring” in the 1840s.
(Veatch 1902:57). Drake’s property was obtained by J. C. Weeks who made salt
until about 1854. In some cases, wells were drilled to obtain the salt. During the
Civil War, the Confederacy negotiated with Weeks to produce salt for the needs
of the army. Today, this property is in private ownership, and salt is no longer
produced at this site. Shell-tempered pottery has been found at this salt lick and
may be an indicator of the importance of the salt lick by Native Americans.
Post Survey Monitoring of Drilling
An archaeologist was present during the drilling phase of the seismic project
to insure that all site buffers were avoided by the seismic activities and investigate
any new source point locations resulting from the inability to access previously set
out points. The monitoring activities resulted in the relocation and investigation of
105 source points and the finding of one isolated find (08060400660). The isolated
find was avoided by the drilling activities. Drilling activities within 50 meters of any
archaeological resource were monitored by the archaeologist to insure avoidance.
At one presumed site location (EH-09) a drill followed old access flagging that had
not been pulled by the surveyors and drilled at the original stake location. This was
reported to the Forest Service archaeologist and it was ascertained that no site
disturbance had occurred. Later, the artifact analysis of this isolated find found that
the collected specimen was not cultural and no isolated find existed at that location.

241

RECOMMENDATIONS
The cultural resources survey identified eighty-four previously unrecorded
sites and isolated finds within the project area. Based on an agreement with Lee
Stewart (staff archaeologist at the Winn Ranger District) prior to this project, it
was decided that the focus of our work would be the identification and
documentation of these resources. It was also decided that this level of work
would not be sufficient to determine the eligibility of these resources for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places. Therefore, all sites and isolated finds are
recommended for protection until they can be evaluated in more detail. The
seismic operatives were informed of the location of each site during the field
survey, and these areas were avoided.
