ABSTRACT
A review of existing literature revealed Somervell County and its immediate
neighbors, Bosque, Erath, Hood, and Johnson, counties, are in a region of Texas
containing significant prehistoric and historic sites. In fact, each of these counties has
sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was determined that
prehistoric and historic sites in the five counties have been recorded primarily by two
means: reservoir surveys conducted by professional archaeologists and the efforts of
individuals, sometimes avocational archaeologists. As of March 2, 1995, the five
counties had the following number of recorded sites at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas: Bosque (252), Erath (33), Hood (70),
Johnson (12), and Somervell (105). Archaeological sites in the five counties date from
Paleoindian times, about 10,000 years ago, through the present.

INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) was retained by the Museum of
Paleontology and Archaeology in Glen Rose, Texas to review previous archaeological
investigations in Somervell and adjacent counties (Figure 1). The counties immediately
adjacent to Somervell County are Bosque, Erath, Hood, and Johnson. BVRA is familiar
with previous work in Somervell County, having conducted two cultural resource studies
in the county prior to this effort. William E. Moore compiled this overview. It is the
purpose of this project to identify as many archaeological investigations in the five
counties mentioned above as possible. All archaeological investigations, professional
and avocational, are presented.
The investigations reported below were identified by checking as many sources
as possible. First, the published Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series was
checked for all references to the five counties. The abstracts series contains all state
and federal reports from 1987 to 1992 (Moore 1990, 1991a, 1992a, 1992b, 1993, 1994).
There are no published bibliographies for this area; therefore, earlier documentation
was obtained by checking the files at the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas
Historical Commission, in Austin, Texas. This is the official repository for all state and
federal reviewed projects in Texas. There have been several indexes that contain
relevant information such as the index to the first 50 years of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society by Helen Simons (1981). This source was examined for this
project. In addition, the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas was checked in order to identify the original recorders of each
site. Sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places were identified by checking
a list maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. Finally, five volumes of the
Texas Family Land Heritage Registry (Texas Department of Agriculture 1974, 1975,
1977-1978, 1979, and 1980) were checked for information on early Texas families. In
order to be eligible for the Registry, a family must have maintained their land in
agriculture for 100 years or more.

BOSQUE COUNTY
According to the site records at TARL, as of March 2, 1995, there are 252
recorded archaeological sites in Bosque County. Of this number, 38 sites are listed as
National Register sites; however, only 1 has been determined to be eligible. Two sites
are listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A complete listing of these sites
appears as Appendix I.
Previous Investigations
1945
Carl Chelf published an article on boat-shaped artifacts from Bosque and Val Verde
counties, Texas in Volume 16 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society (Chelf 1945).
1947
The first systematic field investigation in the county was an archaeological survey of the
site of the proposed Lake Whitney Reservoir. The field survey was conducted by
Robert L. Stephenson under the supervision of Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Associate Chief
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution (Stephenson 1947).
Sixty-one archaeological sites were recorded, 23 of which are in Bosque County.
1965
Doris Olds reported on materials from Brawley's Cave (41BQ20), a large limestone
rockshelter, in Volume 36 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. This
prehistoric site was excavated in 1917 and 1918 by relic collectors. Olds' article
attempts to salvage as much data from this very rich site as possible based on the
materials available for study at the time.
1970
Robert L. Stephenson reported on previous work in the Whitney Reservoir area in
Volume 41 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society (Stephenson 1970).
1974
The first edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the Texas
Department of Agriculture (1974). This volume contains eleven references to ranches
and farms in Bosque County (Appendix I).

3

1975
The second edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1975). This volume contains four references to
ranches and farms in Bosque County (Appendix I).
1978
Frank H. Watt published a chronology of sites in the central Brazos Valley based on
radiocarbon dates (Watt 1978). This article appeared in Volume 49 of the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society. Two sites in Bosque County are discussed. These are
the Horn Rock Shelter Number 1 (41BQ47) and the Horn Rock Shelter Number 2
(41BQ46).
1986-1987
The Bosque Reservoir was surveyed.
1988
Daniel E. Fox (1988b) of the Texas Water Development Board conducted an
archaeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater treatment facility. The size
of the area examined is not stated in the report. One historic site (41BQ241), a stone
dam, was recorded.
1989
An archaeological reconnaissance of the site of the Walnut Springs Wastewater Plant
was conducted by W. Hayden Whitsett (1989) of the Texas Water Development Board.
The size of the area examined is not stated in the report. One historic site house site
(41BQ243) was recorded and a railroad grade, circa 1880, was observed.
1990
An archaeological survey of three proposed powerline construction projects in Bosque
and Erath counties was performed by Brown and Brown Consulting Archeologists
(Brown 1990). The size of the areas examined were 20 x 49,000, 20 x 3500, and 20 x
7000 feet rights-of-way. No sites were recorded in either county.

4

ERATH COUNTY
According to the site records at TARL, as of March 2, 1995, there are 33
recorded archaeological in Erath County. Of this number, 5 sites are listed as National
Register sites; however, not one has been determined to be eligible. Three sites are
listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A complete listing of these sites
appears as Appendix II.
Previous Investigations
1974
The first edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the Texas
Department of Agriculture (1974). This volume contains only one reference to a farm in
Erath County (Appendix II).
An archaeological survey of the Kickapoo Creek Watershed in the northeast corner of
Erath County was conducted by SMU in 1973. Two sites (X41ER1 and X41ER2) were
recorded.
1975
The second edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1975). This volume contains two references to farms
in Erath County (Appendix II).
1977-1978
The fourth edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1977-1978). This volume contains references to one
farm and one ranch in Erath County (Appendix II).
1985-1986
Archaeological excavations at a 20th century cellar (41ER26) were conducted by
volunteers of the Western Cross Timbers Archeological Society in 1985 with follow-up
work in 1986 (Patrick 1987). The focus of the investigations was the construction
methods and use of a 3x4 meter cellar.
1990
An archaeological survey of three proposed powerline construction projects in Bosque
and Erath counties was performed by Brown and Brown Consulting Archeologists
(Brown 1990). The size of the areas examined were 20 x 49,000, 20 x 3500, and 20 x
7000 feet rights-of-way. No sites were recorded in either county.

5

1991
An archaeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater treatment project in the
City of Stephenville was conducted by the Texas Water Development Board (Jurgens
1991). The size of the area examined was 8900 feet of wastewater pipeline and limited
work on an existing plant site. No sites were recorded.
1992
An archaeological reconnaissance of revisions to a proposed wastewater project in the
City of Stephenville was conducted by the Texas Water Development Board (Jurgens
1992b). The two areas examined consisted of 5470 and 9000 feet rights-of-way. No
sites were recorded. One prehistoric site (41ER4) is discussed in the report.
A cultural resources survey of two distribution line conversion projects and a short tie
line in the service area of the Erath County Electric Cooperative Association was
conducted by AR Consultants (Skinner 1992). The area examined consisted of 18
acres. No sites were recorded. Archaeological site 41ER15 is noted as being close to
the project area on private land.

6

HOOD COUNTY
According to the site records at TARL, as of March 2, 1995, there are 70
recorded archaeological sites in Hood County. Of this number, 2 sites are listed as
National Register sites; however, not one has been determined to be eligible. Two sites
are listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A complete listing of these sites
appears as Appendix III.
Previous Investigations
1953
The proposed DeCordova Bend Reservoir was surveyed and 51 prehistoric sites were
located and recorded (Jelks 1954).
1955
Adolph H. Witte (1955) presents a very general overview of the prehistory and history of
a portion of the area he refers to as the upper western Cross Timbers of Texas. Hood
County is located in this area.
1966
Southern Methodist University returned to DeCordova Bend Reservoir (Lorrain 1967,
Skinner 1968).
1968
Jay C. Blaine et al. (1968) published the results of their work at the Acton Site in eastcentral Hood County, Texas in Volume 39 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society. The authors began work at this site in 1961 and continued through 1967.
Their work consisted mainly of surface collecting. Artifacts from the site date from
Paleoindian times through the Late Prehistoric period.
1969
S. Alan Skinner and Randle Rash (1969) describe a Clovis fluted point found on a
gravel bar in the Brazos River in an article in Volume 40 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society.

7

1971
S. Alan Skinner (1971) published an article in Volume 42 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society in which he discusses prehistoric settlement of the De Cordova
Bend Reservoir in Hood County. His discussion is based on excavation of five
prehistoric sites in the reservoir area in 1968 by Southern Methodist University. It was
determined that the area had been occupied from Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric
times.
1972
The first professional work in the county consisted of an intensive survey and
preliminary testing program within the proposed Squaw Creek Reservoir by the
Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University in 1972 (Skinner and
Humphreys 1973). This project examined an area of approximately 3200 acres in Hood
and Somervell counties along a six mile segment of the Squaw Creek Valley. In Hood
County, 2 prehistoric sites (41HD55 and 41HD57) and 1 historic site (41HD56) were
recorded within the reservoir boundaries.
1974
Joseph G. Gallagher (1974b) conducted an archaeological survey of the proposed
Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station transmission line and intake and return pipeline
right-of-way in Hood and Somervell counties for Southern Methodist University. The
size of the area surveyed is not mentioned in the report. In Hood County 2 prehistoric
sites (41HD58 and 41HD59) and 1 historic site (41HD60) were recorded.
An archaeological survey of the Kickapoo Creek Watershed in the northwest corner of
Hood County was conducted by SMU in 1973. Two sites (X41HD55 and X41HD56)
were recorded.
The first edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the Texas
Department of Agriculture (1974). This volume contains one reference to a home site in
Hood County (Appendix III).
1975
Joel L. Shiner (1975) discusses Clear Fork Gouges in Volume 46 of the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society. One of the samples is a collection of gouges from the
Acton site in east-central Hood County (see Blaine et al. 1968).
The second edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1975). This volume contains two references to a farm
and ranch in Hood County (Appendix III).

8

1988

in the city limits of Tolar, Texas for the Texas Water Development Board. No sites were
recorded.
1989
David Collin Crass (1989) conducted an archaeological survey of the proposed
Granbury Airport site. The size of the project area is not stated in the report. No sites
were recorded.

9

JOHNSON COUNTY
According to the site records at TARL as of March 2, 1995, there are 12 recorded
archaeological sites in Johnson County. Of this number, 5 sites are listed as National
Register sites; however, only 1 has been determined to be eligible. Two sites are listed
as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A complete listing of these sites appears as
Appendix IV.
Previous Investigations
1974
The first edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the Texas
Department of Agriculture (1974). This volume contains only one reference to a ranch
in Johnson County (Appendix IV).
1975
The second edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1975). This volume contains only one reference to a
ranch in Johnson County (Appendix IV).
1977-1978
The fourth edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the
Texas Department of Agriculture (1977-1978). This volume contains only one reference
to a farm in Johnson County (Appendix IV).
1990
A cultural resources survey of the Concord-Keene portion of the proposed ConcordKeene-Grandview Electric transmission line was conducted by Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc. (1990). The area surveyed was 17.1 kilometers with a 30 meter rightof-way. No sites were recorded.
A reconnaissance of approximately 12 miles of proposed pipeline easement and a
wastewater treatment plan (approximately 10 acres) were examined by the Texas
Water Development Board (Whitsett 1990b). One prehistoric site and one historic site
were recorded.

10

1992
An archaeological reconnaissance of a wastewater project in the City of Alvarado was
conducted by the Texas Water Development Board (Jurgens 1992a). The area
examined was 80 acres and a 59,000 foot right-of-way. No sites were recorded.
The Texas Highway Department examined 13.5 acres at a construction site (Texas
Department of Transportation 1992). No sites were recorded.

11

SOMERVELL COUNTY
According to the site records at TARL, as of March 2, 1995, there are 105
recorded archaeological sites in Somervell County. Of this number, 2 sites are listed as
National Register sites; however, not one has been determined to be eligible. Four
sites are listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). A complete listing of these
sites appears as Appendix V.
Somervell County
1955
Adolph H. Witte (1955) presents a very general overview of the prehistory and history of
a portion of the area he refers to as the upper western Cross Timbers of Texas.
Somervell County is located in this area.
1972
The first professional work in the county consisted of an intensive survey and
preliminary testing program within the proposed Squaw Creek Reservoir by the
Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University in 1972 (Skinner and
Humphreys 1973). This project examined an area of approximately 3200 acres in Hood
and Somervell counties along a six mile segment of the Squaw Creek Valley. In
Somervell County, 16 prehistoric sites (41SV28, 41SV31-41SV34, 41SV36-41SV41,
41SV44-41SV45, 41SV48, 41SV52, and 41SV54) and 6 historic sites (41SV29,
41SV35, 41SV42-41SV43, 41SV46, and 41SV53) were recorded within the reservoir
boundaries.
1974
A reconnaissance survey of Dinosaur Valley State Park was performed by Southern
Methodist University in September of 1974 (Gallagher 1974a). This study was initiated
partly to add to the growing body of data for the region and partly out of concern for the
archaeological resources of the park that are potentially threatened by an increase in
tourism. The survey was intended primarily to examine portions of the park thought
most likely to contain archaeological materials and no attempt was made to conduct a
systematic investigation of the entire park. As a result of this reconnaissance, four
archaeological sites were located (41SV56 - 41SV59). No artifacts were collected and
no shovel tests were dug. Joseph G. Gallagher (1974b) conducted an archaeological
survey of the proposed Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station transmission line and
intake and return pipeline right-of-way in Hood and Somervell counties for Southern
Methodist University. The size of the area surveyed is not mentioned in the report. In
Somervell County 1 prehistoric site (41SV55) was recorded.

12

1974 (continued)
Excavation at the Hopewell School site (41SV30) was undertaken by Southern
Methodist University in the summer of 1974 following a pedestrian survey of the Squaw
Creek Reservoir conducted earlier which resulted in the recording of this site (Gallagher
and Bearden 1976). Over 300 square meters were excavated to bedrock in large block
areas. The site was found to contain a temporally mixed occupation, although the Late
Archaic period was best represented.
The first edition of the Texas Family Land Heritage Registry was published by the Texas
Department of Agriculture (1974). This volume contains two references to a homestead
and ranch in Somervell County (Appendix V).
1975
Two small area surveys were conducted by the Texas State Department of Highways
and Public Transportation in 1975. On June 18, 1975 an investigation was made of F.M.
201 from U.S. 67 to the Somvervell County line (Letter report on file at the Texas
Historical Commission, Somvervell County files). No sites were found.
On June 19, 1975, an investigation was made of F.M. 205 from F.M. 204 to Glen Rose
(Letter report on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Somvervell County files). No
sites were found.
1982
Two sites were recorded in 1982 by Laurie Moseley, III of Springtown, Texas. Mr.
Moseley is an amateur archaeologist who participated in the 1974 reconnaissance of
Dinosaur Valley State Park (Gallagher 1974a). The two sites, recorded as a private
project, consist of a prehistoric campsite (41SV1) described to be very prolific in terms
of artifacts and a historic pioneer cemetery (41SV2) that contains graves from the 1820s
and 1830s.
1989
On January 30, 1989, the Texas Water Development Board conducted an archeological
reconnaissance of proposed wastewater system improvements (Whitsett 1990a). The
pedestrian survey was largely confined to the line route leading from the existing
wastewater treatment plant to near the corner of F.M. 144 at the Glen Lake Camp.
"Spot checks" were conducted along F.M. 205 where a few visible surfaces were
present and along Paluxy Street on the south bank of the river between F.M. 144 and
Montgomery Branch. No sites were observed.

13

1990
Jimmy Smith, a member of the Texas Archeological Society and Steward for the Office
of the State Archeologist, recorded a prehistoric rockshelter site (41SV60) in 1990 after
he visited it with Don Lemens, local artifact collector (TARL site files). This is an
important site containing at least one burial, Perdiz, Washita, Bonham, and Scallorn
arrow points, deer and fish bone, burned rock, deer antler flaking tool, and possible
shell scoop. The site has been vandalized by Mr. Lemens who plans to destroy it
completely.
1991
S. Alan Skinner (1991) of AR Consultants conducted a pedestrian survey of 10 acres
near Chalk Mountain for the Erath County Electric Cooperative. One historic house site,
consisting of a standing chimney was recorded as 41SV66. Based on bottle glass
found near the house it is believed this house dates to after the turn of the century.
Daniel J. Crouch of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department visited Dinosaur Valley
State Park in 1991 and recorded two prehistoric sites (41SV61 - 41SV62) and three
historic sites (41SV63 - 41SV65). Site 41SV64 is a possible grave associated with a
rock cairn. The addition of these sites increased the total number of known sites in the
park to nine.
In cooperation with local collector Don Lemens, forms for fourteen prehistoric sites
(41SV102 - 41SV115) were submitted to TARL in October of 1991 by Jimmy Smith.
A survey of the Glen Rose Golf Club was conducted by Brazos Valley Research
Associates in April of 1991 (Moore 1991b). Two hundred acres adjacent to Squaw
Creek were examined. One previously recorded site (41SV51) was visited and
evaluated. Four new prehistoric sites (41SV3 - 41SV5, 41SV47) were recorded. The
rock art at 41SV51 is unique to the area. Therefore, it was suggested that it be
protected and considered a candidate for the National Register of Historic Places.
1992
As part of a Soil Conservation Service Training Program, Jimmy Smith submitted forms
for five prehistoric sites (41SV69 - 41SV73) and two historic sites (41SV68 and
41SV74) to TARL in March of 1992.

14

1992 (continued)
Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1992c, 1995) conducted an archaeological
assessment of the 3000 acre Fossil Rim Wildlife Center. This was not a 100% survey
as emphasis was placed on visiting known sites and certain high probability localities.
Eleven prehistoric sites (41SV67, 41SV75 - 41SV77, 41SV79 - 41SV81, 41SV83,
41SV85, 41SV88 - 41SV89) 3 historic sites (41SV78, 41SV84, 41SV90), and 5 isolated
finds were recorded on Fossil Rim property. In addition, 2 prehistoric sites (41SV82,
41SV87) and 1 historic site (41SV86) were recorded on private land.
1993
In 1994, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin, conducted limited testing of two prehistoric sites (41SV56 - 41SV57) at Dinosaur
Valley State Park (Turpin 1994). In addition, an historic site (41SV63) was assessed for
impact from pending construction and one additional historic site (41SV117) and three
additional prehistoric sites (41SV118 - 41SV120) were recorded.
1997
In 1997, Brazos Valley Research Associates conducted a Phase I archaeological
survey of an additional 260 acre tract, an expansion of the Squaw Valley Golf Course in
Somervell County, Texas (Moore and Bradle 1997). Much of the project area was in the
floodplain of Squaw Creek. One prehistoric site (41SV151), a buried hearth, was found
on an ancient terrace of the creek. Burned rock was found in a backhoe trench at a
depth of 45 cm, and fragments of burned rock, bone, and charcoal were found between
95 and 110 cm in an adjacent trench.
