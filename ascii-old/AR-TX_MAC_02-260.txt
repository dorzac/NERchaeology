ABSTRACT
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Archeological excavations conducted between August 1997 and March 1998 in the heart of Houston,
Texas, uncovered remnants of one of Houston’s earliest residential neighborhoods dating from the middle
of the nineteenth century. Though covered by asphalt parking lots and, in some cases, other buildings,
more than 200 features were exposed during selected blading of the 17-block Project Area. Of those
features, 103 were excavated; 80 of these dating from the period 1830-1870 were analyzed and are
included in this report. Nearly 30,000 artifacts that reflect the middle-class status of the residents were
recovered in the investigation. Over 29,000 of these will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin.
Brick cisterns, wells, and house foundations were typical finds, as were wood-lined privies and scattered
refuse deposits. Imported ceramics and elegant glassware were a cut above what the typical Texas
frontiersman could afford. Floral and faunal analyses confirm that beef was a regular staple
supplemented by garden fruits and vegetables and, in some cases, imported spices. The interface of this
archeological data with historical documentation was critical in determining the significance of the
various household assemblages that were examined.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
_____________________________________________________________________________________
The Ball Park at Union Station investigation was supported by a number of individuals and organizations.
Harris County-Houston Sports Authority (HCHSA) provided funding for the project, and we would
especially like to thank Board Member Mr. Wayne Smith. The project was also facilitated by Ms. Leah
Flanagan, City of Houston, and Mr. Robert Eury, Central Houston, Inc., who devoted innumerable hours
to project coordination and on-site visits. HCHSA legal representatives Mr. Franklin Jones and Mr.
James Lemond of Lemond & Associates assisted throughout the project. Mr. Mark Denton, Archeology
Division, Texas Historical Commission, visited the site periodically and provided insightful comments.
Without the help of experienced backhoe and trackhoe operators, our jobs would have been much more
difficult and the integrity of the data lost. For their expertise, we are grateful to City of Houston
personnel Mr. Juan Reyna, Mr. Otis Kelley, and Mr. Gustavo Rodriguez, who were supervised by Mr.
Charles Harvey. Private heavy equipment services were provided by Gulf Coast Remediation, LLC, with
operators Mr. Chester Langford, Mr. Daniel Brady, Mr. Jefferey Beachy, Mr. Joe Ramirez, and Mr. Fidel
Zuniga functioning under the direction of Mr. Russell Herrscher. Additional mechanical assistance was
provided at the courtesy of Mr. John F. Angelina and Mr. Malex Wilson, III, of D. H. Griffith of Texas,
Inc. Valuable environmental coordination and coring log data was provided by Mr. Donald Ripley and
Ms. Karen A. Dorsey of Roy F. Weston, Inc.
Dr. Roger G. Moore, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., served as Project Manager, overseeing the
day-to-day administration of the project. The field excavations were directed by Mr. Joseph M. Sanchez,
whose diligence, dedication, and astute observations did not go unnoticed. Miguel Espinoza, Richard
Mahoney, Allan Meyers, and Kenny Wright served as crew chiefs, accepting the tedious task of recording
hundreds of pages of notes and forms. Crew members were many and varied, and included Barbara J.
Bartholomew, Abigail P. Beck, G. Brent Brock, Eleanor S. Dahlin, Cliff Ewing, Robert N. Harris, April
A. Hayes, Chad Hendrickson, James Hughey, Constance K. Judkins, Christina Leshley, Sharon A. King,
Craig Kline, Clinton F. Ladd, Mary Ann Paul, B. Thomas McWhorter, Terri D. Perez, Jeff Roberson, Lisa
A. Rodriguez, Darren K. Schubert, Ibrahima Thiaw, John B. Vivona, and Ben V. Woltz. Laboratory
processing of artifacts was initially directed by Carrie Jackson and later by Constance K. Judkins, with the
assistance of Barbara Bartholomew, Abigail P. Beck, Eleanor S. Dahlin, Sharon King, Terri Perez, Lisa
A. Rodriguez, and Kelly Schexnayder. Ann Mesrobain floated all soil samples. Computer-generated
field maps were designed by Michael Jackson and maintained by Miguel Espinoza and Richard Mahoney,
who also produced individual feature maps. Michelle Huebner, Melba F. Gollott, and Eleanor S. Dahlin
each inherited the task of bookkeeping. Eleanor was also responsible for the photographs of features and
fieldwork that appear herein. Kelly Houk photographed all of the artifacts. Madeleine J. Donachie and
Robyn P. Lyle edited the draft report. Madeleine completed the editing and formatted the final report.
We are especially grateful to the specialists called upon to conduct various analyses. Frederick Pearl,
Texas A&M University, analyzed the geological cores and placed them in an historical perspective. Janet
K. Wagner and Margaret S. Henderson of J. K. Wagner & Company, Inc., Houston, oversaw the
historical studies. Randall Moir, Historic Preservation Consultants, Dallas, carried out an in-depth
analysis of all recovered ceramics. Allan Meyers, University of Wisconsin-Rock County, analyzed all
metal artifacts and miscellaneous artifacts, such as bricks, buttons, personal items, etc. Brian Shaffer,
Dallas, graciously analyzed the faunal remains on short notice. J. Philip Dering, Texas A&M University,
performed botanical analyses, and Dawn Marshall, also of Texas A&M University, analyzed recovered
pollen grains. David Jurney, U.S. Forest Service, Lufkin, conducted tree -ring analyses of wood
fragments. Mr. Jim Jobling, Conservation Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University, directed the
conservation of metal and wood artifacts.

Because of the magnitude of this project and the many people involved, we apologize for any names that
were inadvertently left out. This was truly a team effort and everyone’s contribution, no matter how big
or how small, was important in bringing to completion the final study.

PART I
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION

1
THE BALL PARK AT UNION STATION ARCHEOLOGICAL
PROJECT
Shawn Bonath Carlson

This report presents results of an archeological investigation conducted between 1997 and 1998 in a
section of downtown Houston, Texas, which was once a residential area known as Quality Hill (Figure
1.1). Houston was platted in 1838, and the sale of lots and blocks in this up-and-coming port city rapidly
followed. Urban ‘farms’ sprang up overnight; within a few years, log cabins were replaced by more
stylish Greek Revival frame houses. Increased population demanded that blocks be subdivided, and it
was not long before the city began to take on a more cosmopolitan appearance. Until the turn of the
century, Quality Hill thrived as a well-to-do neighborhood inhabited by some of Texas’ most enterprising
young families. But this changed with the appearance of the Houston, Belt and Terminal Railway, which
took over city blocks to make room for rail lines and loading platforms. Now, nearly 100 years later,
Quality Hill has once again been transformed, this time into a ballpark and stadium complex that is home
to the Houston Astros. Despite significant disturbances introduced by railroad construction, wellpreserved archeological features representing the early settlement of Houston were uncovered. House
foundations, wells, cisterns, and privies have provided stunningly intimate details about life in the city
150 years ago.
SCOPE OF WORK
Archeological and historical studies were performed by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC),
Houston, Texas, funded by the Houston Sports Authority. Survey and testing were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1864; data recovery was accomplished under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
1885. The large size of the Project Area (17 city blocks) required that a sampling strategy be in place
when fieldwork commenced. In conjunction with preliminary historical investigations conducted by J. K.
Wagner & Company, Inc., Dr. Roger G. Moore of MAC thus developed a significance ranking system for
the Project Area. By ranking various criteria (for example, date of occupation, significance of former
occupants, presence of structures, presence of hazardous waste, known disturbances), Moore was able to
reduce the number of potential research parcels from 72 to 34. At the same time, this strategy reduced the
number of city blocks under study from 17 to 11.
The subsurface survey that followed was designed to confirm or deny the presence of archeological
deposits. Each of the 34 parcels was mechanically bladed to remove asphalt parking lots and twentiethcentury sheet middens. Nineteenth-century features were then exposed via shovel testing. Once mapped,
these features were available for testing, which was directed at verifying the chronological position of the
deposits. Because of the unwieldy collections recovered from other urban projects in Texas and the high
cost of curation, this project was restricted by the Texas Historical Commission to the period prior to
1870. Features predating 1870 were thus fully excavated, those postdating 1870 were discontinued.
The objective of the data recovery phase was to examine pre-1870 archeological deposits or features that
had been confirmed within the land parcels already surveyed and tested as having verifiable potential
significance. Of the 215 features that were initially exposed, 103 fell within the 1830-1870 time frame;

80 of these were fully excavated (mitigated). The investigation yielded a total of 29,140 artifacts, with
27,685 of these retrieved from said 80 features.
Simultaneous subsurface survey, testing, and data recovery were undertaken between July 1997 and
March 1998. Shawn B. Carlson, Principal Investigator, and Roger G. Moore, Project Manager, were in
the field one-quarter time. Field Director Joe Sanchez was on hand throughout the project. He was
assisted by Crew Chiefs Miguel Espinoza, Richard Mahoney, and G. Kenny Wright. Crew sizes varied
from about two to four people each. MAC archeologists spent a total of approximately 1,065 person-days
in the field. Laboratory Director Connie Judkins supervised artifact washing and cataloging through
August 1998, totaling another 293 person-days. Analysis and writing continued through August 2000.
Report preparation was completed in 2003.
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS
Archeological and documentary research has characterized the Ball Park at Union Station Project Area as
a residential neighborhood of relatively well-to-do families. Early inhabitants probably resided in widely
spaced log homes. As manufacturing became established in the 1840s, many of the homes were replaced
with (probably locally made) brick. An abundance of brick structures, ranging from a house foundation
and piers to cisterns and wells (some with gutters and filters), was found throughout the area.
Ceramic studies reveal that decorated whitewares were numerous, but the presence of large serving
platters, matching dish sets, or unusual items, such as a colander, tip the economic interpretation in favor
of a middle-class neighborhood. Glass artifacts are similarly of a higher caliber than would be expected
in a rural farmstead. Pressed-glass stemware supplements undecorated tumblers, and proprietary
medicines and toiletries such as hair dye point to discretionary spending. Personal goods recovered
include grooming items, such as combs, razors, toothbrushes, and a perfume bottle or two, indicative of a
comfortable lifestyle. Brooches, marbles, and pocketknives, all lost down a privy and never retrieved,
apparently were replaceable.
The early residents of Quality Hill did not go hungry. A steady diet of beef was supplemented with
imported rice and garden vegetables, such as corn, beans, or squash. Dessert may have been peaches and
strawberries followed by a good cup of coffee.
Although the upper 16 in (40 cm) of the Project Area had been bladed at the turn of the nineteenth
century, and twentieth-century construction obliterated other features entirely, the undisturbed remnants
of some 80 deep shaft features still have a story to tell.
REPORT ORGANIZATION
This chapter provides an overview of the project objectives and the scope of work. It serves as the first in
a series of chapters that furnish both background and preliminary information about the Project Area. In
Chapter 2, Dr. Roger G. Moore details the significance ranking method and applies it to the project data.
Chapter 3, by Dr. Shawn B. Carlson, addresses research strategies, including the recognition of wealth of
these early Houston residents. Field methods, laboratory analysis methods, and documentary research
methods are described by Miguel Espinoza, Connie Judkins, and Janet K. Wagner in Chapter 4. In
Chapter 5, Carlson and Richard Mahoney discuss the distribution of features and artifacts across the site.
The second section of the report addresses the natural and cultural setting of the Project Area. In Chapter
6, Dr. Frederick Pearl draws upon historical descriptions of the Project Area and combines it with
geological data to understand the attraction of the site to early settlers. Dr. Margaret S. Henson provides
an historical overview of Houston during the nineteenth century in Chapter 7, emphasizing the economic
incentives that drew settlers to Houston. In Chapter 8, Janet K. Wagner provides details about those early
settlers through a variety of documentary records.

The third section of the report focuses upon artifacts recovered during the investigation. In Chapter 9, Dr.
Randall Moir discusses ceramics from the perspective of feature context. In Chapter 10, Carlson uses the
same approach with glassware. Dr. Allan Meyers uses an historical context to discuss metal artifacts and
other materials in Chapters 11 and 12.
The fourth section of the report concerns the ecological artifacts. In Chapter 13, Dr. Brian Shaffer
analyzes the faunal remains and explores the variety of meats that early Houston residents included in
their diets. Dr. Philip Dering, in Chapter 14, further pursues the dietary question through examination of
floral remains. Dawn Marshall’s study of pollen remains rounds out this discussion in Chapter 15. David
Jurney concludes this section in Chapter 16, with a tree-ring analysis of recovered wood specimens.
The fifth section of the report provides a detailed look at the physical structure of features investigated
during the project. Richard Mahoney introduces the subject in Chapter 17, with technical descriptions of
representative features identified during excavations. In Chapters 18 and 19, Carlson draws upon
historical data to place the architectural features and water storage features in context.
The final section of the report, incorporating Chapters 20 and 21, pulls together the preceding data to
demonstrate the relevance to current archeological studies and provide a clear picture of what it all means.
Nine appendices are attached to this report. Appendix A includes landowner summary data. Appendix B
associates features with lot owners. Feature summaries are presented in Appendix C, with basic artifact
data listed in Appendix D. Appendix E provides detailed descriptions of all recovered glass. Appendix F
includes illustrations of intact glass vessels. All recovered ceramics are detailed in Appendix G. Pollen
results by feature are presented in Appendix H, and geoarcheological core data are presented in Appendix
I.

SIGNIFICANCE RANKING
Roger G. Moore

This chapter addresses the initial assessment of the archeological potential of individual land tracts within the
Ball Park at Union Station Archeological Project. The purpose of the investigation was to provide the data
necessary to begin compliance of the project with the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. As noted
in Chapter 1, the Project Area consists of 17 city blocks on the eastern side of the Central Business District of
the City of Houston (Figure 2.1). While standing structures remained on all or part of a few of these blocks,
most of the Project Area was vacant land at the time of the investigation.
For a project of this scale, it was necessary to devise a means of differentiating in advance of the field
investigation those portions of the Project Area with significant archeological potential from those of lesser or
negligible potential. Application of such a classification system would permit the restriction of archeological
field efforts to only those parcels of verifiable potential significance, and as such, result in significant cost and
time savings. For the current project, potentially significant remains consist of historical archeological
deposits relating to the settlement and development of the City of Houston. ‘Significant archeological
potential’ is, in this case, additionally defined upon the basis of demonstrated occupation during the 1860s or
earlier, a time horizon stipulated by the Texas Historical Commission.
Initial project objectives included:
1. Identification of the initial period of settlement, associated significant personages and institutions, and
historic land use of individual tracts within the Project Area by reference to data provided by J. K.
Wagner & Company, Inc. (JKW) and Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc (MAC) (JKW & MAC 1997).
2. Compilation and analysis of post-1870 ground-surface disturbances to the tract. Analysis of basement,
utility, and geotechnical data for the Project Area assisted in an evaluation of the potential for the
preservation of significant archeological deposits within it.
3. Preparation of a tract-by-tract overlay presenting assessment of the archeological potential of each tract
within the Project Area. This assessment classified each tract as exhibiting low, medium, or high
archeological potential, based upon:
a. the presence/absence and character of pre-1870 occupation of the tract; and
b. an evaluation of post-1870 disturbances to the tract. These disturbances could include basements,
utilities, and other construction as discussed above. Those areas for which extensive prior disturbance
could be demonstrated could be excluded from further investigation regardless of the significance of their
pre-1870 occupation.
The following data were requested to be provided by the City of Houston in order to assist in the analysis:
1. A geotechnical report and/or boring logs.
2. An aerial photograph of the Project Area.
3. City monumentation maps of the Project Area.
4. Results of utility and basement surveys.

PROJECT METHODS
JKW & MAC (1997) subdivided the Project Area into approximately 70 land tracts, based upon land-

6

ownership history (Figure 2.2). The size of these tracts varied from a few lots to an entire block, depending
upon the depth and complexity of the title chain. The documentary-based archeological assessment evaluated
and ranked the archeological potential of each tract. A point-scoring system and an archeological tract
assessment form were devised in order to make this evaluation and ranking process efficient, standardized,
and replicable. The scoring system was derived from a model initially developed for the City of Halifax,
Nova Scotia, by a member of the current archeological team (see Hubbard 1990). The general selection
process was modeled upon a system of Level 1 evaluations developed by Moore and Hubbard to effectively
deal with the numerous sewer projects generated by the City of Houston’s multiyear Greater Houston
Wastewater Program.
The point-scoring system used information from the historical land-use study, ground disturbance subsequent
to the 1860s, and the projected degree of ground disturbance from the proposed project. This point-scoring
system is presented here as Figure 2.3; the criteria used for the assignment of point values are shown in Figure
2.4. A copy of the archeological tract assessment form appears as Figure 2.5.
Six variables were selected as elements of the point-scoring system:
1. Initial Settlement Date. This date is that of the earliest documented occupation within a particular tract.
It is the variable given the greatest weight in the scoring scheme, using the Texas Historical Commission
horizon of 1870 or earlier to broadly define potentially significant urban remains.
2. Significant Personages or Institutions. This entry provides recognition for potential archeological
remains associated with persons, businesses, industries, and cultural or religious institutions that were
significant in the development of Houston.
3. Underdocumented Groups or Institutions. This entry provides recognition for potential archeological
remains derived from persons and cultural or religious institutions associated with ethnic groups that
traditionally are poorly documented in the historical record of Texas and the City of Houston. These
groups might include African Americans, Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, or other ethnic or
national minorities.
4. Information Quality. This entry recognizes that the research potential of any particular tract is greatly
enhanced if there is an abundant, high-quality documentary record attached to the inhabitants and
institutions that occupied that tract.
5. Intervening Disturbances within Tract. This entry attempts to quantify the degree of subsurface
disturbance that has occurred within each tract since the horizon year of 1870. This assessment was
based upon both documentary resources and a brief drive-by examination of each tract.
6. Proposed Project Impact. This entry approximates the ground-disturbance impact of the proposed project
upon each of the tracts. These impacts were expected to range from ‘severe’ within the footprint of the
stadium to ‘moderate’ within the parking areas.
Differing states for each variable were assigned integer values. For example, a tract settled by 1850 was
given an initial settlement value of +4; a tract settled by 1870 received +3; and all tracts settled after 1870
were scored at 0. The scores for the six variables were summed to yield an archeological score. The
cumulative archeological score of a particular tract formed the basis for the decision as to whether the tract
merited subsurface investigation. Field investigations were recommended for an individual parcel only if its
score exceeded a certain threshold. For example, a site with an initial occupation of 1845, little subsequent
ground disturbance, and severe projected ground disturbance from the proposed project would certainly yield
a score requiring further archeological field investigation.
An early initial settlement date did not, in itself, guarantee a high archeological score. If it could be
demonstrated that an early tract had been extensively disturbed subsequent to the 1860s, the potential for
preserved archeological deposits was deemed to be low. As such, no further investigations would be
recommended. Even the probable presence of preserved early remains within a tract did not ensure that
excavations would take place. For example, if the tract was to remain undisturbed by the proposed project,
then there would be no impact upon the archeological remains and thus no justification for further

7

archeological investigation. The end result of the scoring process was a culling of the 70+ tracts, with
additional archeological investigation recommended for only a small, but highly justifiable, percentage of the
total Project Area.

While the archeological scoring system was very helpful in the assessment of the project tracts, it was not
applied inflexibly and mechanically. The selection and rejection process was tempered with a liberal
application of professional judgment. Even the 1870 time horizon was not regarded as inviolable in the event
that it would require rejection of a tract of special socioeconomic or historical significance.
A seventh variable, tract accessibility, was also quantified but not included in the archeological score
calculation. Tract accessibility refers to current/modern obstacles to subsurface archeological investigations.
For example, a tract with asphalt paving received a higher accessibility ranking than did a tract covered by a
concrete slab. Inclusion of this information would be of considerable practical utility in designing any
subsurface testing program. However, ease of accessibility for archeological testing within a specific tract is
an issue separate and apart from that tract’s potential archeological significance.
A checklist of sources used is appended to the archeological tract assessment form, as shown in Figure 2.5.
This list served as a control both for the preparer and any reviewer of the form.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Shawn Bonath Carlson

PURPOSE OF RESEARCH
Preparing a successful research design involves both the identification of meaningful research questions and
the development of field and analytical strategies to adequately address those questions. Identification of the
research questions and their archeological correlates was particularly critical in the investigations for the Ball
Park at Union Station Archeological Project, since these questions formed the basis for important decisions.
Given the scope of the project, it was entirely likely that an overwhelming amount of pre-1870 deposits would
be identified during the subsurface investigation. It was likewise probable that these deposits would, in
typical historic-site fashion, yield an overwhelming number of artifacts. Excavating all of these deposits or
analyzing all of these artifacts was neither economically feasible nor scientifically justified. The objective of
project research was thus to select adequate samples to produce meaningful archeological results.
RESEARCH GOALS
The archeological investigation for this project focused upon the early settlement period of the City of
Houston. The city is a major metropolis, so any historical or archeological research undertaken within it must
first recognize its function and development as a central place. That role must be then incorporated in an
archeological/historical research design.
By definition, a ‘central place’ has links to the broader world system, as well as to other settlements within the
region (Barber 1994:55-63). These links are created through movements of people and goods, and are
systematic links that help define a central place’s function. Systems such as economy, social stratification,
transportation networks, and ideology provide a dynamic sense of the past and can be identified in various
ways in the archeological record. For example, the presence or absence of portable artifacts, and their value,
quantity, and variety, can reveal much about the groups of peoples who lived in the area in the past.
Subsurface disturbances, such as the presence of trash pits, wells, privies, and the various artifacts associated
with them, can reflect past activities. Similarly, remains of domestic dwellings, outbuildings, or roads can
reveal stages of development of the built environment. The recovery and documentation of such evidence as
outlined above can allow for intersite and intrasite comparisons of urban areas.
Certainly, there exists a wealth of data that can allow comparisons of the development of Houston with other
excavated urban areas in North America. In May 1997, for example, a total of 45 major urban archeological
projects was identified in a handout distributed at an urban archeology workshop in Selma, Alabama (Terry
Klein, personal communication 1997). At least four in-house collections are available at Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. in Houston. Investigations in other cities with pre-1870 contexts (especially
privies) include the archeological report on excavations conducted at the Alamodome site, San Antonio (Fox
et al. 1997). The riverfront Augusta site in Georgia (Joseph 1993) and the Five Points site in New York
(Yamin 1997) also provide similar contexts to that of the present study.
As Jordan (1984:209) points out, “Texas cities are not identical.” This statement can be extended to cities
across the nation. North American cities greatly differ from each other in terms of location, size, form,
function, and population. Such differences evident today were just as true in the past and are based upon
many factors of which geographic locale, population size, ethnic/cultural makeup, and economic function are

13

but a few. As a busy port, Houston in the nineteenth century likely had more in common with New Orleans,
Boston, or New York than it did with interior Texas cities such as Austin, Dallas, or San Antonio. Moreover,
while fewer people lived in Houston (a mere 2,400 in 1850) than in other cities in the state (Galveston and
San Antonio), its population was more culturally diverse. A mixture of Anglos, Germans, and African
Americans walked the streets of Houston and Galveston, while the more densely populated San Antonio
largely consisted of Hispanics. Economically, too, Houston has steered its own path. From an agriculturally
oriented town in its early days, it is now known as a world leader in petroleum refining.
Such variability between cities and their individual developments can be also mirrored within a city itself and
can provide an interesting avenue of inquiry for archeological data. The extent of this variability can be
measured in a number of ways. For the present project, indicators of wealth, ethnicity, and economic function
were examined in an attempt to understand the nineteenth-century dynamics of Houston’s settlement.
Wealth
Recent historical research has shown that wealth was an important variable in the Project Area in the
nineteenth century (J. K. Wagner & Company, Inc. and Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. [JKW & MAC]
1997:1-99). Known as Quality Hill, the area was home to important residents, such as the land baron Jacob
de Cordova, and the relatives of Colonel William Fairfax Gray, an observer at the signing of the Texas
Declaration of Independence. Historical documents reflect this wealth, as well as the lack thereof, through
listings of real estate ownership, slaveholdings, and personal property deeds. Moreover, these documents
reveal that wealthier residents tended to favor the western half of the Project Area. Unfortunately, little is
known of how this wealth was exhibited on a daily basis.
As detailed in the following chapters, the numerous discarded and broken material objects recovered during
this project reveal much about the lives of those who resided in this area in the past. Structural remains give
clues to the size and grandeur of their homes. Samples of bones and seeds provide a glimpse into diet.
The archeological investigation at the Ball Park at Union Station allowed the opportunity to ask and
subsequently answer many important questions about the history and development of the City of the Houston:
1. How do archeological remains reflect the documented wealth of the residents of the Project Area?
2. Do the proportions of costly items vs. inexpensive items reflect wealth?
3. How much of a role do luxury items play in the assemblages of wealthy residents?
4. Is wealth reflected in the size of homes during this early period of Houston’s history?
5. How do construction materials or styles of homes reflect wealth?
6. Is wealth reflected in the cuts of meat or diversity of foods eaten?
Ethnicity
In the 1840s, a wave of European immigrants arrived in the City of Houston. Germans, French, English,
Irish, Scots, Italians, African Americans, and Canadians have all been documented as present in the city
during this time (JKW & MAC 1997:17). The archeological record both corroborates and adds to the
documentary evidence by revealing patterns of cultural preferences in material objects, dietary habits, and use
of space, as well as other things that cannot be verified by documents alone (see Farnsworth 1993). Similarly,
comparisons to other urban assemblages can aid in understanding similarities and/or differences between
ethnic groups.
Again, analyses of data retrieved from excavations have allowed an opportunity to ask and subsequently
answer many important questions about the history and development of the city:
1. Can specific artifacts be identified as clear markers of particular ethnic groups, e.g., trademarks
representing country of origin, excessive quantities of certain artifact types, or other distinguishing
characteristics?
2. Do dietary remains differ from those of Anglo assemblages? If so, in what respects?

14

3. Within the individual parcels of land, how is space used? For example, are there notable differences in
the location of structures such as houses, outbuildings, cisterns, or privies, in areas known to have been
occupied by Anglos vs. areas known to have been occupied by Germans or Italians?
Function
Function is considered to be an important third variable in attempting to understand a city’s past and its
development. In the current investigation, with the exception of one block, the Project Area was entirely
residential. The exception, Block 104, was the site of a rope factory in the early 1850s (JKW & MAC
1997:10-12). Investigations of numerous domestic dwellings within the Project Area have provided baseline
data for early Houston homes. Comparison of these data with other urban assemblages can establish a pattern
of Houston’s similarities or differences on a national scale.
Questions asked of the data include:
1. What are the distinguishing characteristics in the archeological record of a domestic occupation? In other
words, what criteria can be used to identify a domestic occupation, and how many of these criteria must
be present to, for example, distinguish a home-operated business from a strictly commercial business?
2. What are the characteristics (artifacts, structures, etc.) that will reflect, for example, the operation of a
rope factory vs. a garment factory?
RESEARCH STRATEGY
To address the ideas presented above with the archeological data, a careful strategy for sampling was initiated
from the start of the investigation to avoid the collection of large quantities of artifacts that might not provide
relevant information. From the pre-fieldwork phase to the analysis of the excavated artifacts, a step-by-step
procedure was developed to guide the collection of materials to best answer the research questions.
Fieldwork
Deposits to be excavated were determined from examination of stratigraphic superposition and diagnostic
artifacts during subsurface survey and testing. Every effort was made to sample pre-1870 discrete contexts
from (1) all of the blocks in the Project Area, (2) different chronological periods within the target period, and
(3) the full range of structures, features, and fills. Approximately 15 chronologically sensitive artifacts were
examined from each provenience to isolate chronological deposits. Diagnostic ceramic artifacts that were
expected to represent the pre-1870 deposits include Chinese porcelain, some hand-painted pearlwares, and
decorated whitewares (particularly shell-edged). Folded or flanged glass bottles with fire-polished finishes
and applied strings were also expected. In addition, bottle bases or free-blown bodies with marks from dip
molds or two-piece molds, as well as blowpipe pontils, were anticipated. Metal artifacts were expected to be
mostly hand forged, although it was assumed any nails would be machine cut. Cut nails with hand-applied
irregular heads were also considered to be possible finds. Tin cans would have hole-in-cap ends or flanged
ends. Noticeably lacking would be the double-sided seams that were introduced in the late 1880s.
Undisturbed structural remains, features, and fills exposed during subsurface survey and testing were
numbered and mapped prior to data recovery. Features that were tested and that satisfied the sampling
strategy were selected; prior to excavation, notification of this selection was given to personnel at the Texas
Historical Commission. During data recovery, any post-1870 deposits were discarded so that the excavation
of targeted deposits could be expedited. These deposits were photographed and drawn in plan view, and
surface elevations were taken prior to excavation. Features were sectioned and excavated by troweling in
natural levels. All matrix was screened through 0.25-in (6 mm) mesh hardware cloth. The profile of each
feature was drawn and photographed prior to its removal. Furthermore, a flotation sample was taken from
each feature for floral and faunal analyses. The final depth of each excavated feature was also noted.

15

All backhoe trenches were dug under Occupational Safety and Health Administration specifications and met
current state regulations (29 CFR Part 1926 and HB 1569). Culture-bearing strata below approximately 5 ft
(1.5 m) were shored or stepped to permit in situ inspections, and personnel were required to wear construction
hard hats. Only selected trenches were profiled for mapping. Those that showed extensive disturbance or no
natural soil profile were drawn in plan only and photographed and described. Trenches that successfully
crosscut building trenches or foundations were recorded both in plan view and profile.
Analyses
Laboratory analyses were ongoing as fieldwork was conducted. At the same time as the cataloging of all
artifacts was conducted, all remains were roughly identified and tabulated as they were recovered. This
methodology was useful for preliminary reports and planning purposes.
The first step in more detailed analyses was to explore sample size requirements (Jones et al. 1983; Rhode
1988). For example, how many ceramic sherds are necessary to characterize ceramic diversity and
chronology? Or, as the sample size increases, at what point does the diversity of the assemblage stabilize?
Similarly, how many glass fragments are necessary to characterize glass diversity and chronology? In order
to answer these questions, it was necessary to analyze all artifacts recovered from the first several
proveniences. Once sample size was established, the remainder of the collection was sampled.
Subsequent artifact analyses involved examination of specific attributes standard for all material types. For
example, vessel form and (possible) function, as well as paste type, glaze, and decoration, were noted. Vessel
form and function, as well as diagnostic mold marks and trademarks, were noted for all glass fragments.
Recovered metal objects were also examined for specific attributes, as were floral and faunal remains.
Upon completion of all analyses, each sampled provenience (structure, feature, fill) was characterized by (1)
its diversity, e.g., the percentages, types, and forms of ceramics, glass, metal, etc.; and (2) its function, e.g.,
architectural items, culinary, items, etc. Proveniences were then compared according to type, function, time,
and location. For example, all privies dating from the Republic period were compared. Also, all building
foundations, cisterns, or pit features were compared. It was hoped that such comparisons would allow
patterns to be distinguished across the site and aid in discerning differences between ethnic or status groups.
As a final step, functional differences (household remains vs. industrial remains), ethnic differences (African
American vs. German vs. Jewish), and status differences (wealthy vs. poor) were identified and explored.
Site Significance Assessments
The legally mandated inventory, assessment, and protection of potentially significant cultural resources
impacted by the proposed project were accomplished within a framework of established historic contexts.
Individual features were assessed in the field in regard to National Register eligibility by the criteria
previously stated. Given the time constraints imposed by the construction schedule, features considered
potentially eligible were immediately subjected to data recovery excavation. Documentary and subsurface
investigations provided the information necessary to assess various adverse impacts expected from the
planned development. Since not all buried remains were likely to be significant due to integrity or age, these
considerations were made on a site-by-site case; each assessment presented herein considers that resource’s
potential to contribute information useful in the elucidation of specific research topics or data gaps.
Report Preparation and Writing
Pursuant to stipulations by the Archeology Division at the Texas Historical Commission, all interim and
formal reports on the results of the investigation conform to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines of 1990, and were produced for review both by the Client and the Texas Historical Commission.
Various individuals contributed chapters to this report, including the Principal Investigator, staff
archeologists, and various specialists.

Artifact and Documents Curation
Until the writing of this report was complete, all artifacts and documents were temporarily housed at Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc. Thereafter, they will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin for permanent curation.

ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
Field investigations for the Ball Park at Union Station Archeological Project centered around the discovery
and excavation of discrete archeological features that may have been preserved within the Project Area. An
archeological feature is, in essence, a nonportable artifact, such as a privy, a cistern, a house foundation, a
posthole, or a trash disposal pit. Discovery of features is an effective way to deal with urban deposits, since
they are usually found deeply mantled or are protected by overburden consisting of fill, demolition debris,
paved slabs, or extant buildings. Generally, urban sites have low to moderate superficial surface disturbance;
features found in such areas are thus usually only moderately distorted.
Features encountered during this project were characteristic of those from heavily urbanized areas. The top of
the undisturbed natural soil was only about a foot below the current surface, and even if demolition debris was
stripped away, the disturbances did not extend very deep. Three phases of investigation were used to
accomplish project objectives. These included survey, testing, and mitigation, and are described below.
Survey
Surveying did not begin until a series of logistical problems had been addressed. One problem concerned the
orientation of the excavation grid. It was eventually decided to use the street grid as the base; this grid was
oriented 35° east of true north. All test units and excavation units were thus oriented grid north unless the
orientation of features dictated otherwise.
Another problem concerned the order in which the blocks were to be surveyed, but this was resolved by
separating the survey process into two different phases. Phase A consisted of the survey of Blocks 102, 103,
118, 162, 163 (southern half), and 173. Phase B consisted of the survey of Blocks 117, 163 (northern half),
164, 194, 195, and 206 (Figure 4.1). The decision to separate the survey into two phases was primarily based
upon the presence or absence of an excavation permit. Another factor affecting this decision was the presence
of major structures in those blocks that were scheduled for demolition. For example, Block 117 could not be
surveyed because it was a parking lot owned by Stewart and Stevenson Company. Block 163 (northern half)
was occupied by train-storage hangars.
The numeration system to be used during the excavation of each block was also a concern. As noted in
Chapter 2, the initial Project Area covered 17 city blocks (see Figure 2.1), so it was necessary to devise a
system that would eliminate simple, but annoying, problems, such as the duplication of numbers or lots across
multiple blocks. The issue was partially resolved by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL)
policy to assign separate site numbers to individual blocks. Each city block would thus have its own
numbering system. Since work would be proceeding simultaneously on various blocks, there was still the
potential confusion of having features recorded with the same number (multiple Feature 1s, for example).
Blocks of numbers were thus assigned to each city block. The first block investigated used only numbers
between 1,000 and 1,999, the second block used numbers between 2,000 and 2,999, and so on. This system
was used to number features, areas scraped, backhoe trenches, and excavation units. A list of blocks and the
assigned numbers is shown in Table 4.1.

A block numbering system was used in conjunction with the archeological numbering system. This second
system identified cultural geographical living units that reflected the block and lot numbers established on the
ground in 1839 by the surveyor, August Girard, for the City of Houston. Since property boundaries changed
over time, either through the sale of lots or the acquisition of additional lots, the project’s historian modified
the block/lot numbering system. The hyphenated number, referred to as a ‘Parcel,’ includes the block number
and a single number that was not a lot number but rather a number reflecting the combined lots of a
landowner. Furthermore, landowner information was identified for each parcel by examining deeds, probate
inventories, and tax and census records. All of this information, including the location of buildings, was
combined on a base map showing the parcel boundaries (see Figure 2.2.).
Since the blocks were larger than the historic blocks (277 ft [83 m] on each side vs. 250 ft [75 m] on each
side), some adjustments were required. On the 1869 Wood survey map, Preston Avenue measures 79 ft (24
m) wide within the Project Area. Today, Preston Avenue is only 52 ft (16 m) wide. According to the same
survey, Prairie Avenue is 73 ft (22 m) wide compared to today’s width of 54 ft (16 m). The difference in size
between the historic maps and the present blocks can be attributed to an extra 13.5 ft (4 m) allotted to a
modern sidewalk that encompasses each block’s perimeter. Once the team had its bearings, the base map was
used to mark, with spray paint, the locations of parcels and structures on the ground.
Mapping
Mapping was conducted using a Total Station Sokkia (Set 6F) with an attached External Data Collector
Sokkia SDR31. The first step in the mapping process was to establish the site grid based upon two permanent
datum points from which all subsequent datum points would be linked. The first two permanent datum points
were designated STA-100 and STA-101. Each of these and subsequent points consisted of three
measurements: a northing, an easting, and an elevation.

20

Value measurements for the main point of reference (STA-100) were arbitrarily established as east (1000.000
m), north (1000.000 m), and elevation (100.000 m). The measurements for the second reference point (STA101) were east (1037.010 m), north (1000.000 m), and elevation (99.976 m). The elevation values were
corrected to reflect real elevation on October 22, 1997.
Once the two arbitrary points were established, any other points created were automatically linked to these
two points of origin. The linking process entailed setting up the Total Station Sokkia instrument on one of the
known points and then back-siting this point to another already known point. The instrument automatically
computed its location within the Project Area, based upon the two points loaded into its memory.
A series of additional points (stations) was established in order to move the instrument into those locations
where it would be needed. Each station was defined by driving into the soil a steel reinforcing bar, or rebar,
that measured 3 ft (1 m) long, and marking the position by applying bright paint. Occasionally, a station was
marked further by setting wooden stakes along its perimeter. This additional marking depended upon the
importance of the location.
Once the Total Station Sokkia instrument was set up, the information loaded, and the instrument back-sited, it
provided a margin of error for all three measurements (easting, northing, and elevation). A margin of error
higher than 0.005 m in any of these measurements signified that the instrument was not properly set, or that
one or both of the stations had been moved or altered. Under such circumstances, the instrument was again
set up using the same two stations. If the problem persisted, the instrument was established in a different
location using two other stations. On some occasions, the two stations originally used to set up the instrument
were eliminated; at other times, these stations were remeasured, depending upon the need for them.
In all, 43 stations were established during the field investigation. Such a high number was necessary because
the Project Area was constantly altered by ongoing demolition. Stations were often removed or altered by the
constant movement of heavy machinery. In addition to setting up station points, several datum points were
established close to the excavation units in order to provide an elevation value for the unit being excavated.
The elevation value was established at the top of the rebar, and from this point, all elevation measurements
were taken. Benchmarks observed within the Project Area were also mapped. Those located within the
Project Area were assigned the numbers CPT-156 and CPT-177.
Mapping activities in the field were almost constant; the mapping crew was required in the field on an almost
daily basis. New excavation units needed to be shot and their complementary datum points set; expansions of
excavation units required remeasuring; new features needed to be located; etc.
Maps were created using Surfer®, a computerized mapping program from Golden Software, Inc. Each map
was created by transforming the three measurements recorded for each point into a spatial point within the
Project Area. Each of these points was then either grouped together into polygons or left as an isolated point,
depending upon its representative role within the Project Area. For example, four points were linked in order
to represent an excavation unit, or an isolated point was used for a wooden post, and so forth.
Scraping
This activity was carried out by a crew chief, one or two crew members, and a trackhoe operator. On some
occasions, the work force consisted only of the crew chief and the machine operator, depending upon the area
scraped and the work load in other areas of the project. During the scraping process, as well as the excavation
of trenches and other excavation units, all personnel followed safety protocol (i.e., all excavation activities
were conducted under OSHA specifications and met current state regulations [29 CFR Part 1926 and H. B.
1569]). Personnel working in close proximity to the trackhoe were required to wear a hard hat, a brightly
colored vest, safety goggles, and steel-toe boots in order to minimize the possibility of injuries. Furthermore,
no personnel were permitted to enter any area excavated deeper than 5 ft (1.5 m).

21

Scraping did not begin until parcel boundaries and historic building sites were located and spray-painted. The
first step in the process entailed removal of the paved surfaces and any other obstructions. The operator then
proceeded to remove the overburden and fill that covered the possible features (Figure 4.2). During this
work, a hand-signal system was developed between the crew chief and the operator to relay instructions and
safeguard any features that might be exposed. Instructions were given to the operators to remove only about 1
in (2-3 cm) of soil at a time while searching for features. In addition, they were instructed to remove and
place the scraped material to the side of the excavation for later removal, being careful to place backpiles in
an area that was not scheduled for later scraping. During the scraping process, backpiles were frequently a
problem; they took up space, contaminated open excavations, and sometimes caused walls to cave in.

Figure 4.2. Resulting backdirt piles from mechanically scraping the Project Area.

The scraping process was halted as soon as a new feature or soil anomaly was observed. A pin flag was
immediately set on the location, and the operator was instructed to not excavate any further in that location.
A crew member then hand-scraped the surface of the possible feature in order to confirm its legitimacy and
define its limits. When confirmed as a feature, a temporary feature number was assigned, and a feature
excavation form was completed. This form includes information such as site number, block number,
temporary feature number, feature type, artifacts observed at the time of discovery, and soil characteristics. A
sketch was drawn of the feature and a photograph was taken. A temporary map was drawn, including all of
the newly discovered features. The same process and recording procedures were followed for features
discovered during trenching.
In all, 10 trenches were excavated during the course of this project. These trenches were excavated not only
to locate features but also to observe the stratigraphy of areas that were being horizontally scraped. Each
trench was recorded by completing a backhoe trench excavation form (includes information such as site
number, block number, dimensions, and features observed on the trench), drawing a profile to show trench
stratigraphy, and taking a photograph of the trench from the same position that the profile was drawn. A
minimum field sample of temporally diagnostic artifacts was also obtained for review by the Principal
Investigator. Some of the trenches, especially those excavated in Blocks 194 and 195, were sloped to

22

facilitate the flow of water and its easy removal by water pumps. Both of these blocks were saturated with
water, and the trenches remained filled despite a lack of rainfall.
Newly discovered features were reevaluated upon completion of trenching or scraping. The Principal
Investigator verified the integrity and age of each feature and then prioritized features before authorizing their
excavation. Features were then given a final number and mapped with the Total Station (see Appendix C).
During the survey phase, the trackhoe proved to be the most efficient machine, primarily because its weight
was evenly distributed along its tracks (Figure 4.3). The backhoe was more cumbersome to maneuver,
probably because its weight was distributed across its four tires, which left deep marks in the soil, especially
when the soil was wet. These difficulties increased the possibility of destroying undiscovered features. In
general, the surveying phase was successful, and it is believed that no important features in the Project Area
were missed or undetected.

Figure 4.3. Trackhoes were indispensable during the survey phase of the investigation.

Testing
A separate testing crew was responsible for excavation of the selected features. The first step was to remove
any fill material so that the limits of each feature could be more easily defined. The feature was then
photographed and drawn in plan view. Feature forms completed by the survey crew were also checked in
order to confirm the identity and location of each feature being tested. An excavation unit was then staked
around the feature. All excavation units were aligned with grid north or the orientation of the feature axis.
The size of units was determined by the size of the feature to be excavated. Most of the features were each
tested by excavating half of it; in some instances, however, this procedure was altered to account for the
different characteristics presented by each feature. Only one-fourth of very large features was excavated.
Excavation did not begin until the excavation unit was established, photographs taken of the feature, and a
plan view drawn and recorded on a feature excavation form. During excavation of each level, a feature
excavation form was required. The features were excavated in arbitrary levels of 10 cm due to soil

23

homogeneity observed over the entire Project Area. Most of the features were excavated within
homogeneous, dark gray silty clay, although the color varied slightly from very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to dark
gray (10YR 4/1). Soil anomalies were excavated separately when and where they were observed in an
attempt to excavate in natural levels as much as possible. Furthermore, dim natural soils observed in any
excavation unit were noted on the level excavation form; a plan view of the bottom of the level was also
drawn. Soil excavated from each level was screened through a 0.25-in (6 mm) mesh hardware cloth when
possible. Some large features, such as wells and cisterns, were not screened because they were mechanically
tested with the trackhoe due to the enormous amount of material to be removed as well as safety
considerations.
Artifacts retrieved from each level were bagged, and a lot number was assigned for each bag(s) collected from
the level excavated. A separate lot number was assigned to diagnostic artifacts that were piece-plotted.
Soil samples were collected from locations previously designated by the Principal Investigator. On some
occasions, the samples were collected based upon soil characteristics encountered during the course of an
excavation.
The excavation of features was halted when no cultural deposits were observed. A profile of the feature was
drawn and photographed. This concluded the field recording for each feature.
Mitigation
Throughout the mitigation phase, the same archeological techniques and excavation procedures were applied
as during the previous phases. Excavations conducted during this phase were intended to retrieve as much
information as possible, since the selected features would be destroyed prior to construction. Features to be
mitigated were selected based upon their uniqueness and the amount of information they could provide. For
example, all privies were completely excavated, and in two cases, the actual privy box/barrel was recovered
and conserved (Features 1048B and 7009). Additionally, sections of Feature 7005, a house foundation
encountered in Block 117, were also retrieved and conserved (Figure 4.4). These included numerous wooden
planks used for leveling the foundation, as well as a 3-ft-long (1 m) cross section of the foundation.
Guidelines and goals proposed for the fieldwork were successfully met. In all, 215 features were identified.
Some 103 (47.9 percent) of these were tested, with 80 of them fully excavated during the mitigation phase.
Numerous artifacts and soil samples were collected and were temporarily curated at Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. (MAC) in Houston. All artifacts will be permanently curated at TARL in Austin.
LABORATORY PROCEDURES
While it would be possible to describe the MAC laboratory system in a few words – wash, sort, and catalog –
the magnitude of this project calls for a more complete description of the subject. It is hoped that the
procedures described not only contribute to this report’s findings but also provide information that may be
useful to others involved in large-scale urban archeological projects.
Overview of Laboratory System
With the exception of a large wooden privy box and a number of wooden planks that were taken directly from
the Project Area and treated at the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University in College
Station, all materials collected during the 1997-1998 field season were processed through the MAC
laboratory. Procedures at MAC were designed to facilitate analysis and curation of the project collection.
Procedures and materials used comply with guidelines established by TARL and the Council of Texas
Archeologists.

Routine Activities
The project included nine sites and one block with no site number assigned. Within each site/block, artifact
provenience information was designated by lot number (a sequential numbering system beginning with ‘1’).
During excavations, all recovered materials for a particular horizontal/vertical provenience were placed in a
paper bag, assigned a lot number, and brought to the laboratory at the end of each day.
At the MAC laboratory, provenience data recorded on each bag were cross-checked for consistency with the
lot number index and other associated field forms. Any discrepancies were reported to the field director for
immediate resolution. This was the first of many cross checks employed by the laboratory. Simple clerical
errors on a project of this size would only compound and eventually become impossible to resolve. Copies
were made of all completed field forms and the lot number index, both as a precaution against loss and so that
they would be available to the laboratory for reference.
Following check-in, all artifacts were cleaned. With the exception of metal and some organic materials, most
artifacts were washed with tap water and air dried. Metal preservation varied considerably, and most metal
items were dry brushed. Fragile materials and organics were handled on a case-by-case basis. Soil sample
bags, which were often very moist, were placed on open shelves in an attempt to prevent mold growth and to
encourage drying.
After cleaning, artifacts were sorted into basic artifact classes (see Appendix D). Whole nails and flat glass
were measured, shell and bone artifacts were weighed. The lot number, artifact code, artifact class,
weight/measurement, and count were recorded on a basic artifact sort form. These data, along with additional
provenience information, were written on an artifact tag and placed in the appropriate artifact bag. All artifact
bags were then placed in the original field sack and set aside with the basic artifact sort form to be doublechecked by the laboratory director.

25

Double checking the sorted artifacts served two purposes. First, it helped reduce the number of clerical
errors. Data on the artifact tag and basic artifact sort form were cross-checked with the data on the field bag
and with the material itself. Second, double checking helped maintain consistency in the sort categories.
After the double check, the face of the original field bag was cut out and filed by site number/lot number for
future reference. Invariably, a discrepancy would arise and this original data would be needed.
Following the sort, all artifacts were cataloged. Catalog numbers were unique and consisted of the lot number
followed by a specimen number. With the exception of very small, fragile, or friable artifacts, the catalog
number was written on each element. Catalog numbers were added to the artifact tag, and if necessary,
information regarding the labeling of individual artifacts. All data were recorded on a catalog number form.
Double check procedures were similar to those for sorted artifacts.
In addition to processing artifacts, the MAC laboratory was also responsible for handling the
photographs/slides taken during the course of the project. As rolls were finished, they were given to the
laboratory along with the photographic log. The rolls were sent out for developing, and when returned, were
checked against the photographic log for accuracy. All photographs/slides were temporarily labeled with the
site number, roll number, and frame number, and placed in archive-quality sleeves in binders.
Data-processing activities were interspersed throughout the above process. Data from the lot number index,
basic artifact sort, and catalog number forms were entered into the computer database program, Access®.
This enabled relatively easy manipulation of data for reports; it also provided documentation for curation.
Similarly, all photographic logs were entered into a computer in a format suitable for curation.
Additional Activities
In addition to the above tasks, the MAC laboratory was involved in the temporary storage of one-half of a
waterlogged barrel. The barrel was removed in the field and transported intact to MAC, where it was placed
in a large water-filled container. Advice on the type of storage water (distilled vs. tap) and the pros and cons
of the use of fungicides was solicited from a variety of sources. Ultimately, since MAC laboratory personnel
did not know what conservation materials would be used, tap water was chosen as the storage medium.
Unfortunately, the waterlogged barrel did not retain its structural integrity during storage. Before transport to
the conservation facility at Texas A&M University, it was drained, photographed, and then each slat was
drawn in its relative position, measured, and photographed. Each piece was then individually tagged and
wrapped for transport. Laboratory personnel were also involved in preparing artifacts for transfer to the
various analysts. After cataloging was completed, all artifacts were sorted by artifact type and grouped by
feature number to facilitate analysis. Box inventories were generated for general record-keeping purposes and
to serve as a cross check as materials were returned to the laboratory after analysis.
Laboratory Tracking System
Ideally, artifacts arriving at the laboratory would be washed, sorted, and cataloged in lot number order so that
finding any artifact from a particular lot number for preliminary analysis or display purposes would be an
easy task. However, reality is often far from ideal, and after the project was well underway, it became clear
that a laboratory tracking system was needed.
In most cases, artifacts were washed as they arrived at MAC. As excavations progressed and the volume of
artifacts increased, it was not possible to keep abreast of the incoming artifacts. In addition, bags were not
always turned in to the laboratory in lot number order, since different units/levels would finish on different
days, or priorities would shift. Furthermore, washing, sorting, and cataloging took varying amounts of time,
depending upon the size and composition of the collection. As a result, backlogs occurred at the various
processing stages, and it became time consuming to locate artifacts from a particular lot number. Therefore,
about midway through the project, a tracking form was developed. Each lot number was logged in as it came
in from the field and checked off as the artifacts went through the various processing stages. Double checks

26

were denoted with an ‘X’. It thus became possible to see, at a glance, where a particular lot was in the process
and quickly find the associated artifacts.
Artifact Displays
Interest in the project was high both among living relatives of the early occupants of the Project Area and the
local press. As a result, the MAC laboratory was occasionally called upon to set up displays of artifacts. Due
to the scope of the project and large quantity of artifacts generated by the excavations, it was not reasonable to
rely on memory to locate suitable items. A file was thus created of particularly diagnostic, photogenic, or
otherwise interesting artifacts. This file contained the site, lot, specimen, and feature numbers, as well as
descriptions of the artifacts. This file, used in conjunction with the tracking system, enabled the laboratory to
efficiently organize public displays.
DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH METHODS
The documentary research phase of the investigation supported the work of the archeological team by
providing names and histories of individuals and families associated with dated ceramic, glass, metal, and
other in-the-ground features recovered during the testing and mitigation phases. A literature search was
previously undertaken in 1997 (JKW & MAC 1997), and this document became the basis for the general lotownership data used in research for the mitigation phase of the investigation. This documentary search
focused upon the pre-1870 potential site occupations across the Project Area. Data results were then used by
MAC to determine locations that had the greatest potential for artifact recovery and cultural interest. These
identified sites were scheduled for field reconnaissance and testing by MAC prior to project construction.
Artifacts and cultural features found during the testing phase of the investigation formed the basis for the time
periods that were then researched.
The following methods and data documentation sections describe the approach to information gathering and
analyses conducted in response to date ranges supplied by archeological team members for recovered
artifacts. The preliminary study involved over 70 parcels and well over five times that number of family
occupants. During the archeological testing and mitigation phases, 15 of the original parcels produced
artifacts or features predating 1870. These parcels and/or features concern 22 family groups.
Methods
Multiple data sources were used to build a composite profile of the persons or entities that possibly had
possession of the recovered and dated artifacts, or built and/or used the features found during the excavation
process by the archeological team. Photographs, informants, descendants of the original occupants, original
field surveys, old land maps, and primary source data were used in the comparative analysis process. This
comparative process depended entirely upon the date ranges produced by the archeological analysis of the
recovered material and in situ features.
Two types of search formats were instituted: a genealogical search and a civil search. The genealogical
search focused on identifying each of the family groups from the glass/ceramic/feature date ranges and the
group’s ancestry. The civil search format involved examining extant land, census, tax, and various court
records, as well as published directories of the identified individuals within family groups. This analysis
provided support data for a biographical history of selected individuals within family groups and for the
general historic overview of neighborhood activities with regard to the contemporary economic and political
tone. The data also provided a basis for interviewing located descendants of these previous occupants.
Information sources used in search formats included primary and secondary source materials.
Date ranges for glass and ceramics supplied by the archeological analysis within each feature number were
compared with known occupants within the specified time period for the particular parcel of land. Each
individual’s age at property purchase and age at property sale, as well as his/her ethnicity, nativity,
occupation(s) (where appropriate), religious affiliation, family boarders, and possible slaveholdings, are

27

attached in tabular format in Appendix B. Family ancestry gathered from census and civil records added vital
information to the family profile in terms of immigrant vs. migratory eastern or midwestern groups.
Literature Search and Documentation
Public and private documents provided the basis for the literature search. Public records examined consisted
of federal, state, and local records. Private records from family collections augmented the ownership and
occupation data of parcels under study. Harris County records included those from the offices of the County
Clerk, the District Clerk, the Clerk of Commissioner’s Court, the Tax Assessor-Collector, the Right-of-Way
Division, and the Engineering Division. Records in the Texas Room at the Houston Public Library, the
Houston Metropolitan Research Center, and the Clayton Branch were also consulted. These included
Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, the Texas Room map collection, Houston City directories, scrapbooks,
newspaper files, Texas almanacs, family histories, census records from 1807 through 1880, and various
secondary sources held in the rare book collection. Houston City Council Minutes and Ordinances were also
reviewed for information regarding water, sewage, and streets.
Private collections and archives of J. K. Wagner & Company, Inc., Ms. Ann Quin Wilson, and Dr. Margaret
Swett Henson assisted in data recovery regarding John Austin, Isaac Batterson, Jacob de Cordova, John S.
Moore, Ben Fort Smith, and various genealogical data regarding the Dumble, Gray, Smith, and related
families. Descendants of families related to productive sites were contacted but found not to have extensive
knowledge of their family history. The exception was the Dumble-Gray family, whose descendants were
interested in the project. Documents held by the General Land Office, the Texas Railroad Commission, the
Texas State Library, the Genealogical Branch of the Texas State Library, the Austin Public Library, the
Center for American Research, and the Catholic Archives of Texas were examined for real property
information, as well as for the activities of the former occupants.
Records held by the Sophienburg Archives, the County Clerk records for Austin, Bexar, Brazoria, Comal,
Fort Bend, Guadalupe, Hayes, Kimball, McLennan, Montgomery, Nacogdoches, Travis, and Waller counties,
were examined for tracing of the Batterson, de Cordova, Gray, Moore, Smith, and Wells activities. The St.
Louis County Clerk records were consulted for background data about the Wells family in Missouri. Census,
marriage, city directory, and death records for Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Texas, and
Virginia from about 1800 through 1880 were searched, via the Clayton Branch of the Houston Public Library,
for profiles and background regarding the specific families under study.

DISTRIBUTION OF FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS
Shawn Bonath Carlson and Richard Mahoney

This chapter discusses the distribution of features and artifacts uncovered during the Ball Park investigation.
As noted earlier, the archival investigation of the 17-block Project Area was first conducted by J. K. Wagner
& Company, Inc. during the spring of 1997 (see Figures 2.1 and 2.2). These studies were immediately
followed by archeological survey, testing, and data recovery conducted simultaneously over an 11-block area
from August 1997 to March 1998 (see Figure 4.1). Twenty-one mechanically stripped areas, 10 backhoe
trenches, and 90 excavation units were used to expose 215 features. Of these, 103 fell within the 1830-1870
time frame; 80 of these were fully excavated (mitigated). The investigation yielded a total of 29,140 artifacts,
with 27,685 of these retrieved from said 80 features.
Mechanical excavations totaled 2,854 m3, with another 35 m3 excavated by hand, resulting in an average
artifact density of 728 artifacts per cubic meter. Some 1,065 person-days were employed during the
excavation, representing an excavation rate of approximately 0.03 m3 per person-day. Washing, cataloging,
and labeling of artifacts consumed another 293 person-days.
STRATIFICATION AND STRATIGRAPHY
As noted in Chapter 4, existing stratification by city block within the Project Area served as a starting point
for site stratification. Parcel boundaries were identified on the ground with spray paint. Pre-1870 house
locations recorded on historic maps were also spray painted. Excavations were subsequently conducted by
parcel within each block, and included areal stripping, backhoe trenches, and hand-excavated units. In an
effort to be efficient in recovering data, one of the first lessons learned was that mechanical blading exposed
features much more quickly and effectively than trenching. However, when deciding to blade rather than
trench, the decision also had to be made whether to give up sheet refuse data. This was not a difficult task,
since documents revealed that parts of the Project Area had been bladed at the turn of the nineteenth century.
Further, it was clear from the exposure of numerous cisterns and their obvious lack of shoulders and necks
that approximately 16 in (40 cm) of dirt had been removed long ago. An effort was made to examine sheet
refuse around the single cistern that retained its neck, but it became clear fairly quickly that the refuse had not
only been mixed with later deposits but redeposited from adjoining lots.
Once confident that blading was the way to proceed, the next decision was where to blade. Thanks to the
advice and expertise of other urban researchers, blading operations were focused on the interior of blocks to
expose backyard features. The assumption was that residential front yards are ornamental and thus lacking in
features, while the structures themselves offer little information about the occupants. It would be accurate to
say that the data are biased in favor of backyard information (cisterns and wells, privies, postholes, and refuse
deposits/pits). Furthermore, because, as noted above, about 40 cm of dirt was removed around 1908, when
most of the Project Area was modified for construction of the rail yard associated with the Houston, Belt and
Terminal Railway, features exposed during excavations represent only those greater than 40 cm in depth.
These had been protected by a layer of sand and crushed shell laid down in the early 1900s. Beaumont clay,
or ‘black gumbo,’ lay beneath this bed. Deeper excavations conducted by the construction company revealed
a continuation of this clay (see Chapter 6). Many shallow features were probably lost when the rail yard was
built. Data presented in this report, then, are skewed in favor of deeper features. Nonetheless, the features are
definable and the artifacts quantifiable, as is shown in succeeding chapters.

TESTING PROCEDURES
According to guidelines set by the Council of Texas Archeologists and the Texas Historical Commission, a
city block was designated a ‘site’ and assigned a trinomial as soon as archeological remains were exposed.
Those assigned within the Project Area included 41HR822 (Block 102), 41HR812 (Block 103), 41HR820
(Block 117), 41HR815 (Block 118), 41HR816 (Block 162), 41HR819 (Block 163), 41HR821 (Block 164),
41HR818 (Block 173), and 41HR823 (Block 206) (Figures 5.1-5.9). Block 194 yielded no artifacts, so no site
number was assigned. No trinomial was assigned to Block 195, since it yielded deposits postdating 1870
(Figures 5.10-5.11).
As work progressed, five of the initial 11 blocks were eliminated from further analysis. These included
Blocks 194 and 195 for the reasons noted above. Blocks 164 and 206, although given site numbers, were later
determined to also contain deposits postdating 1870. (Several artifacts were collected from Block 206 but
were not analyzed once it was determined that existing sheet refuse had been redistributed and thus these
artifacts had no context. Although 44 features were exposed on this block, all were filled with post-1870
material.) Block 102 was eliminated due to a paucity of artifacts (n=2) from one feature (cistern) identified.
The remaining six blocks – 103, 117, 118, 162, 163, and 173 – included the 80 features that were fully
excavated and used for the analyses presented in this report.
FEATURE DISTRIBUTION
Table 5.1 shows how these 80 features, as well as the artifact yield, were distributed across the Project Area.
Table 5.2 shows the distribution and artifact densities of said features. As shown in Table 5.1, Block 117,
with the highest number of excavated features and recovered artifacts, was one of two blocks whose interior
was completely bladed; the other was Block 103. These two blocks were the only ones with clusters of
features that were temporally related and affiliated with the same landowner (see Chapters 9-15). Each
provided a context that isolated features could not. Other blocks had fewer significant blocks (see Chapter 2),
so fewer features and artifacts were found.
The features fall into six general categories: (1) brick structures, (2) cisterns and wells, (3) postholes, (4)
privies, (5) refuse deposits or pits, and (6) a miscellaneous ‘other.’ The brick category includes in situ
structural features, such as brick piers, foundations, wall roots, and alignments, as well as scatters and
concentrations of brick. As shown in Table 5.1, brick piers occurred on Block 117 (n=5), Block 118 (n=2),
and Block 162 (n=7). A single brick spreader foundation was found on Block 117, along with a brick
alignment, a circular arrangement (a possible cooler), and a scatter. A brick wall root was uncovered on
Block 118. Two brick concentrations were exposed on Block 162. More details on the configuration of these
features can be found in Chapter 17 and in the descriptions of brick in Chapter 12.
The cistern and well category includes associated features such as gutters and filter boxes. Excavated cisterns
and their components were found on Blocks 103 (n=1), 117 (n=4), and 163 (n=1). Each was constructed of
brick with a clay-packed exterior and a plaster-lined interior (see Chapter 17). Brick gutters used to drain
overflowing cisterns to adjacent streets were associated with two of the cisterns on Block 117; one cistern had
a filter box. The two wells were uncovered on Blocks 117 and 118; the well on Block 118 had a gutter
attached.
Three types of postholes were excavated: brick filled, clay filled, and sand filled. These were found on
Blocks 103 (n=1), 117 (n=15), 118 (n=1), and 163 (n=1). Although the postholes were shallow due to
previous site blading, their locations and contents helped establish a chronology of when the posts were set
(see Chapter 17).

Eight privies representing a variety of construction techniques were also identified. Four privies were
excavated on Block 103. Two of these were unlined, one was lined with a wooden barrel, and one was lined
with vertical planks. The privy on Block 162 was lined with horizontal planks nailed into the clay subsoil,
with vertical posts supporting its corners. Block 117 also had a barrel-lined privy, a wooden plank-lined
privy, and one that was lined with an old shipping crate. Undoubtedly there were many more privies in the
Project Area that rested on the ground surface and had removable pans that were cleaned at night by city
workers.
Refuse deposits were well represented in the Project Area, although pit features were not. The shallowness of
refuse deposits and their irregular edges distinguish them from refuse pits, which were deeper, intentionally
dug holes with more regular edges. Only one pit feature, on Block 173, was found. Twenty-one refuse
deposits were scattered across Blocks 103 (n=3), 117 (n=13), 118 (n=3), and 173 (n=1). Some may represent
naturally shallow areas that were conveniently used for dumping trash, while others may be small,
intentionally dug, holes.
The last category is a catch-all for any other types of features that did not conform to the above categories.
These include a ceramic bottle alignment and three glass bottle alignments found on Block 117. They appear
to have been used as landscaping borders.
ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTION
In all, 29,140 artifacts were recovered from the 11-block Project Area (Table 5.3, see also Appendix D). Five
of the 11 blocks were eliminated from further analysis for reasons noted above. As a result, only those
artifacts from six blocks were considered for detailed analysis (see Chapters 9-15). The distribution of these
artifacts across the various blocks was unequal due to the number of targeted parcels (i.e., some blocks had
only one targeted parcel while others had multiple parcels). Thus distribution of artifacts by feature type
seemed the only viable way to examine them across the Project Area.
The practice of waste disposal in shaft-type features on residential lots was probably discontinued by most
American cities during the 1860s. It was during this period that city ordinances began addressing health
issues related to the disposal of trash, specifically organic remains (see Bay City, Michigan, Charter and
Ordinances [Bay City] 1869; Catholic World 1868; DeBow 1851; Kenosha, Wisconsin, Charter and
Ordinances [Kenosha] 1866). Streets and public alleys had apparently become preferred sites for disposing of
waste; various cities, particularly New York City, cleaned their streets daily, even using carbolic acid as a
disinfectant. In New Orleans, the Board of Health was so concerned by mortality rates that they issued a
series of edicts in 1849 to “remove filth of all kinds as soon as possible, before it contaminates the air we
breathe and the water we drink and cook with, and use for all domestic purposes” (DeBow 1851:479). All
slaughterhouses, factories, and large stables were to be moved to the outskirts of the city, along with night
soil, urine, kitchen, and street filth. Privies were to be emptied, filled, and replaced with impermeable liners.
Canals were covered and low-lying areas filled in to prevent stagnation of water. Health wardens were
appointed to inspect “every street and yard . . . every day” (DeBow 1851:480). Daily inspections were also
warranted in Kenosha, Wisconsin (Kenosha 1866). In Bay City, Michigan, residents were not allowed to
have rotting carcasses or garbage that caused “noisome or offensive smell(s)” (Bay City 1869). New York
City’s Board of Health, established in 1866 to remedy tenant-housing sanitation, claimed to have better health
laws than any other city in the country (Catholic World 1868:558).
Artifacts recovered from features excavated during this project represent trash that was disposed on private
property prior to the availability of city services. It is assumed that small numbers of artifacts were deposited
on a regular basis on the ground surface, while larger deposits were made less frequently in shaft-type
features. It is the latter deposits that are the concern here. Artifact categories used for the interfeature
comparative analyses include ceramic tableware, glass tableware, glass bottles, flat glass, cut nail, wire nail,
and brick. These were selected because they typify the majority of diagnostic artifacts recovered from

43

historic sites, and they allow for future intersite distributional analyses. Overall, these categories represent
about 20 percent of the total artifact assemblage.

Table 5.4 shows the distribution of these selected artifact categories by feature type. Using proportions rather
than densities, it is easy to see that privies produced the highest number of artifacts in this project, whereas
postholes produced the least. Refuse deposits and pits had far fewer artifacts than privies but were similar in
number to the built remains, such as brick foundations, piers, etc.
Examining the various artifact categories, it became clear that glass accounts for the higher number of
artifacts found within privies. Sixty percent of glass tableware, 34.1 percent of bottle glass, and 51.2 percent
of flat glass ended up in privy vaults. Discarding glass into privies, especially bottle glass, is usually
associated with hiding liquor bottles, but safety might also have been a consideration.

Ceramics, on the other hand, occurred most frequently around built structures (36 percent) and in somewhat
lesser quantities in privies (30.7 percent) and refuse deposits/pits (24.1 percent). Ceramic tableware is
generally broken most frequently in areas where food is either being prepared or eaten. It would be
reasonable to assume, then, given the higher number of ceramics found around structures, that broken
ceramics left on the ground around a kitchen structure or outside a dining area might have been considered
less of a threat than broken glass. If this were true, it would be less urgent to move the broken pottery to a
privy or refuse pit.
Wire nails occur in such small quantities that they are considered negligible. Cut nails, however, occurred
most frequently in privies (45.4 percent). Smaller quantities were found in refuse deposits/pits,
cisterns/wells/gutters, and around built structures. Safety may again be a factor. The low number of nails
found around structures in combination with the high number found in privies may be an indication of
deliberate attempts to clear the ground surface of extraneous nails.
Large quantities of brick fragments were recovered from features and are enumerated in Table 5.4. There
were, of course, multiple features, such as cisterns, wells, and foundations, with intact bricks. Samples of
these whole bricks were collected from each built feature for the purpose of determining size and construction
techniques, but these were not included in the brick count. Not surprisingly, brick fragments were found most
frequently around built structures. They were found in almost similar quantities in privies and refuse
deposits/pits. This seeming lack of preference for brick disposal could be attributed to the soft, friable nature
of nineteenth-century bricks and their tendency to ‘melt.’ Soft brick would certainly be a lesser danger to
bare feet than glass or nails.
SUMMARY
The Ball Park at Union Station Archeological Project initially encompassed an area of 17 city blocks. Data
recovered from this large area were managed through a significance-ranking system and state-imposed
guidelines. In the final analysis, 27,685 artifacts retrieved from 80 features on six blocks were used to
provide a glimpse into Houston’s past. The period from 1830 to 1870 was characterized in the Project Area
by fairly well-to-do families, hence the name, Quality Hill. Evidence of building remains associated with
cisterns, wells, and privies was not uncommon. Artifacts recovered from these deep shaft features include
items that were probably considered luxuries during the nineteenth century, such as jewelry, silverplate,
patterned glassware, and ceramic platters, pitchers, and bowls. Their distribution across the Project Area was
partly related to the excavation of significant lots, but it is also true that most artifacts were recovered from
privies, and the most common type of artifact is glass. In the following chapters, detailed analyses of both
artifacts and features will elucidate the significance of these findings.

PART II
THE NATURAL AND CULTURAL SETTING OF THE
PROJECT AREA

6
CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY AND GEOARCHEOLOGY
Frederick Pearl

Houston, seat of Harris County, Texas, is located on the Upper Gulf Coast 50 miles inland from the Gulf of
Mexico. Houston did not exist when Texas gained statehood in 1836, although the small town of Harrisburg
was nearby. Today, just over 150 years later, Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States, covers
596 square miles, and has a population of more than 1.7 million. Houston has the ninth largest airport system
in the United States, and every year, more than 5,500 ships pass through its port, making it North America’s
number two port in foreign tonnage.
To some, the causes of Houston’s importance are self-evident: its prime location along Galveston Bay and
near the convergence of several major waterways. Yet Houston’s rise to prominence was anything but
destined. With the clayey soils that have proven a detriment to architects and engineers for over 150 years,
and with intermittent and destructive flooding, one might wonder why the lowlands along Buffalo Bayou
were initially settled at all. In 1836, there were many other towns already well on their way to success. Why,
then, did Houston arise?
Mary Austin Holley’s (1985[1836]) book, Texas, gives an idea of conditions at the time the Allen brothers
were promoting the new town of Houston. Holley (1985:3-37[1836]) notes that the coastal bays and harbors
of Texas, combined with its interior streams, would provide for extensive commerce. She cites Galveston,
Matagorda, Aransas, and Nueces as the principal bays, with the Sabine, Nueces, Colorado, Navasota, Brazos,
Trinity, and Neches as the principal rivers (Holley 1985:26-35[1836]). Regarding Buffalo Bayou, Holley
(1985:35[1836]) states, “The Buffalo Bayou is also navigable to its forks above Harrisburg, within forty miles
of San Felipe de Austin, which interval is a level prairie. It resembles a wide canal, with high and heavily
timbered banks. The tide flows up as far as the forks above mentioned.”
The most important navigable waterway in the region was clearly the Brazos River. “Though there are many
rivers navigable for steamboats, the Brazos alone is visited by them; several steam vessels regularly navigate
its waters for the purposes of commerce” (Holley 1985:193[1836]). It is along this river that the major towns
flourished. Among them were Brazoria, Bolivar, San Felipe, Washington, and Velasco, as well as other
smaller settlements. Houston, which was laid out on the east side of the Trinity River, is described as
“handsome, salubrious, and well watered; surrounded by fertile, well timbered land, and is about six miles
distant from a good steam boat landing on the Trinity” (Holley 1985:124[1836]).
Edward (1990:53[1836]), a contemporary of Holley, suggests that small vessels would be able to navigate the
inlets and streams of Texas. However, he predicts that “when the commerce of the country shall require the
merchant ships, Galveston Bay will be the focus of trade, by having such a large scope of country, whose
rivers can be made tributary to it; which, together with rail-roads, will insure to this point two-thirds of the
imports and exports of Texas.” Interestingly, Edward suggests that a major commercial center rivaling those
along the East Coast would soon arise either on Galveston Island or perhaps on the mainland. In his opinion,
the ideal spot was Bolivar Point (the west end of Bolivar Peninsula, which is east of Galveston Island and
connected to the mainland).

47

BEFORE THE TOWN
The earliest European settlers in the vicinity of Buffalo Bayou lived in close association with nature. Many of
these settlers kept journals that have subsequently been published, so there is quite a bit known about their
early lifestyle. In general, wild animals, especially deer, provided food and raw materials for clothing and
furnishings. Along Buffalo Bayou, store-bought products were expensive and hard to come by, yet wild deer
and horse were said to be plentiful (Doughty 1983:24). Some diaries note that the woods were infested with
panthers, bears, buffalo, wild cats, and wild pigs (Doughty 1983:28-29).
Today, the Houston area is mostly a single paved mass, but along Buffalo Bayou and other area waterways
that have not been developed, remnant populations of mixed pine and hardwood forest (loblolly pine, longleaf
pine, shortleaf pine, gum, cypress, oak, and hickory) are evident. There is reason to believe that much of the
area was deforested by early settlers, who needed raw materials for construction, and who cleared the land for
agro-pastoral production. The fledgling town of Harrisburg was chiefly supported by the pine-lumber trade,
although the lands would also have been suited for grazing (Holley 1985:15, 120 [1836]). Other economic
pursuits included trapping and trading of furs. In addition to the wild animals noted above, otter and beaver
pelts could be obtained along the Brazos and Trinity river basins (Doughty 1983:34). This type of trade was
probably dominated by Texas Indians, however, with European and Mexican traders providing its merchant
and market aspects. One Harrisburg resident wrote that the “Indians were constantly wishing to exchange
skins for pots and other utensils” (Kleberg 1898:298, cited in Doughty 1983:40). In later years, trade with
Indians increased in frequency and importance, as noted by a gathering of over 2,000 Indians at the Torrey
Trading House in Houston in 1847 (Democratic Telegraph and Texas Register [DTTR], 11 January 1847).
Today, Houston is largely surrounded by prairie grasslands (when undeveloped) that support a biosystem of
bluestem, indiangrass, sparse mesquite, hackberry, huisache, chapparal, and some cactus. The total area
occupied by this prairie has increased as a result of deforestation and as a result of the dramatic increase in
agro-pastoral activity, primarily in the form of cattle ranching and large-scale crop production. Nonetheless,
the historic combination of mixed woodlands and grasslands was an optimal environment for medium-sized
arboreal adapted game, such as wild cats, bear, deer, and bison.
Almost every history of Houston contains the same reference to the now infamous advertisement for the
newly established “town of Houston” (DTTR, 30 August 1836). In this advertisement, the virtues of the site
are extolled for economic and logistical purposes. The primary virtues of the site are its relationship to the
major regional streams, including the Brazos River, San Jacinto River, Spring Creek, and New Kentucky
Creek.1 At the time of the advertisement, the Battle of San Jacinto and the events surrounding it were fresh in
the minds of Texans. It is interesting that the Allens chose to list Spring Creek among the other waterways
noted, given that it is only a minor tributary. It might have been more realistic to suggest that the Trinity
River would enhance port traffic through Houston. Spring Creek, however, had the distinction of being the
campsite of Sam Houston’s army prior to the battle of San Jacinto. This honor was not lost on the Allens,
who could see its potential impact on marketing the new town of Houston.
To ensure that their land investment would be a success, the Allens launched a campaign to have the capital
situated in the new town. The name itself was derived, of course, from the biggest war hero of the day, Sam
Houston (McComb 1981:12). One of the Allen brothers, John, was a member of the Texas legislature, and
argued vehemently that the site of Houston was healthy, beautiful, and plentiful in food and natural resources
(McComb 1981:14). By 1837, the legislature had made its decision, and the Allens could now advertise that
the ‘City’ of Houston, the seat of the government of Texas, was available for settlement. It is perhaps for
these reasons more than any other that Houston was established in its current locale rather than some other.
1

The exact location of New Kentucky Creek is all but lost in modern maps. It appears on the inset of one of the earliest
maps of Houston as a tributary of the San Jacinto River, a few miles above Spring Creek. (This early map was drawn by
the Borden brothers and can be found in the Texas Room [Map H-1837] in the city’s public library.)

48

While its location was not optimal, with little effort, it could be made to be optimal. Since the Allens were
prepared to invest heavily in land improvements and loans to the fledgling government, there is little reason to
wonder why the site was initially chosen (McComb 1981:14).
In 1836, the bulk of traffic through Texas was centered on the navigable waterways, and early maps show
several routes converging on Houston. In fact, crossing Buffalo Bayou may have proven to be a laborious
task for early road traffic. The Stockbridge Ford, located in the City of Houston, was one of the few spots
where crossing prior to bridge construction was reasonably assured (Wagner 1986:1). Both upstream and
down, crossing was much more difficult. So, traffic was funneled through Houston en route to ports on the
Trinity River/Galveston Bay shores. The Stockbridge Ford conjoined traffic headed for San Felipe–San
Antonio, as well as the Montgomery–Nacogdoches–Red River–St. Louis route to North America.
Additionally, the Stockbridge route provided access to the Rock Island crossing on the Brazos River, which,
in turn, led to Washington-on-the-Brazos through Independence (Wagner 1986). This crossing was used even
prior to the establishment of Houston, and although not mentioned by the Allens, no doubt provided their own
egress to their new properties. The Stockbridge Ford served as Houston’s first traffic ‘bottleneck,’ a point
that perhaps the Allens knew would bode well for the establishment of a major trade and commerce center.
Trade would soon funnel through Houston along some of these roads. Newspapers routinely reported the
opening of new trade routes and entrepreneurial opportunities. For example, several notices appeared in 1841
announcing the opening of a route to Austin by the City of Brazos on the Brazos River (see Morning Star
[MS], 9 January 1841b).2 Another announcement published in the summer of 1841 reported that trade to the
“Red Lands” (Nacogdoches) was now open to the citizens of Houston. The editor notes that only once this
vast array of “large, cheap, and well-assorted stocks of goods” are added to those already coming from trade
along the Trinity, Brazos, and Colorado countries, “will the destiny of Houston declare itself” (MS, 22 June
1841e).
HOUSTON GEOGRAPHY
Although Texian commerce was still largely relegated to navigable streams, these waterways would also
prove to be perhaps the single largest detriment to settlement. While official flood records for the City of
Houston begin in May 1937, numerous personal accounts exist of intense flooding prior to this time.
The largest known flood in Houston occurred on December 9, 1935 (Gandara et al. 1995:82), almost 100
years after the city was established. This event, along with the many other flood events recorded during this
century, is indicative of natural floods that are endemic along the Houston stretch of Buffalo Bayou. For
example, bridges erected at the Stockbridge Ford and elsewhere on Buffalo Bayou were washed out in a flood
in 1839 (Wagner 1986:2). A dramatic account of flooding is reported in the Morning Star in January 1841:
Another flood—A rain set in before light on Saturday morning which continued almost without
intermission for 18 hours; the prairies were covered with water, and the Bayou has been rising from

The ‘City of Brazos’ was another of the Allen brothers’ attempts to create a commercial center, this time along the road
to Austin. This announcement, appearing in the Morning Star (MS) on January 1, 1841, but dated July 20, 1840, was
modeled after the famous advertisement that announced the town of Houston (MS, 1841a). It emphasized the economic
advantages of the location and of the variety of natural resources. The announcement promised that the “Houston and
Brazos Rail Road” would soon reach the location, and that all efforts would be made to finish that line. Use of the term
‘City’ was, perhaps, premature, but it clearly intended to make the new endeavor seem promising to settlers. The Brazos
venture was not nearly as successful as that of Houston, having none of the logistic advantages of Houston or the
political and social associations that allowed the Allens to successfully promote Houston. The ‘City of Brazos’ may
have been a failure, but when the railway was completed in 1859 (Texas Pacific Railway), another venture for the City of
Hempstead was quite successful.

that time to the present. It has nearly reached the second floor of Mr. Stanley’s warehouse and of one
belonging to Mr. Carraher. Two bridges near town have gone, and some apprehensions are
entertained for the safety of several warehouses near the shore.
The water is still rising and must soon reach the height it obtained in February 1839. A gentleman
who came in on Sunday from Brays Bayou reported that several families there were in great distress
being driven from their houses by the water. Compelled to seek the highest knoll for security and
unable to get away. Some citizens have gone to their relief with wagons, carrying boats along. From
the unusual severity of the weather, we are apprehensive of fatal consequences. The gentleman who
brought the intelligence was almost paralyzed with cold . . . . [MS, 19 January 1841c].

It was not until 1939 that the citizens of Houston voted to undertake major water-control measures along
Buffalo Bayou and other local watercourses. This was largely in response to the great flood of 1935 that
flooded 93,440 acres, 8 percent of the total county, with almost 3 million dollars in damage (unadjusted for
inflation) (Houston Post, 12 February 1939a).
Previous geological studies have indicated that the primary constituent of the substrate beneath Houston is
interdistributary mud (silts and clays), including flood basin and bay facies that are Pleistocene in age (Fisher
et al. 1972:33). Along modern fluvial systems, such as Buffalo Bayou, a small contribution of modern
overbank muds exists. In short, soils beneath early Houston were a product of a long history of flooding.
Historically documented floods have continued to contribute significant amounts of mud to the modern
surface. Bertha Schmidt, in a letter to Kathleen Schmidt, recalls flooding in Houston, ca. 1915-1935:
He [her father] had to go to Houston on business at times from Yoakum. I heard him tell about seeing
horses in mud up to their knees, and men walking alongside of them. He always said Houston had to
be the place to catch malaria because the mosquitos were so bad, and there was so much stagnant
water. . . . I remember walking in dirty, muddy water for blocks. You couldn’t see where you were
going because of the muddy water. . . . Millie and I had taken my brother to Bay City and on the way
home we saw them coming out of the houses in the Brazos River bottoms with wheel barrows filled
with mud. After the flooding was over, people’s houses were full of snakes, frogs, worms and insects
of all kinds. Wallpaper, rugs and windows had to be replaced. A lot of the mud was hauled to
Galveston because the shoreline really took a beating [B. Schmidt to K. Schmidt, letter, 3 April 1998,
in possession of the author].

CHARACTER OF HOUSTON SOILS
Soils upon which the settlers of 1836 built were not only flood prone but flood produced. Clays and silts
settling out of suspension during post-flood events result in a thick clayey mass. These clays have a high
capacity to retain water and expand dramatically when saturated. Conversely, when dry, they shrink to a
much smaller size, leaving large, and sometimes deep, cracks in the soil. Soil scientists call these soils
‘vertisols,’ and engineers have likely struggled to overcome the adverse affects of building on them since the
earliest days of settlement.
Unfortunately for the archeologist, these ‘shrink-swell’ soils also contribute to poor preservation conditions.
Seasonal wetting and drying results in rapid deterioration of organic materials, while expansion and
contraction of the clays physically breaks down the more resistant artifacts. Seasonal shrinking and swelling
over long periods of time also tends to mix together the top few meters of the soil. Archeologists call this
‘argilliturbation’ (literally, clay mixing), and it can result in artifacts of different ages being found mixed
together in the top few meters (Schiffer 1987:216-217).

50

Within the current Project Area, sedimentary cores were analyzed to determine to what extent the soils were
uniform (Appendix I). These cores indicate that the soils are homogenous, characterized as very high in clay
content (over 50 percent), and show strong evidence for shrink-swell capacity (vertic properties). Further, the
loosely packed muds that extend very deeply are subsiding due to the modern extraction of groundwater.
These findings indicate that while this area on Buffalo Bayou might have been a bountiful biotic area,
providing all of the community’s basic needs locally, it was far from an ideal site for a cosmopolitan center.
The high incidence of flooding, as well as poor soils, ensured future hardships for the residents (and
ultimately billions of dollars in improvements made by the City of Houston and Harris County). There is
much higher land west of Houston, closer to the Brazos River, which is less flood prone. However, this land
does not have direct access to a navigable river connected to Galveston Bay. The Allens foresaw that the
future of trade in Texas lay in the safe shipping harbor of Galveston rather than in the narrow, although very
productive and fertile, valley of the Brazos.
SUMMARY
The historical environment of the Houston area was bountiful in basic natural resources required for human
populations. For early prehistoric occupants, this meant ample supplies of vegetable products for food, plenty
of fresh water, and abundant game for food and raw materials. European settlers also took advantage of these
resources, but they needed building materials for permanent shelters and economic opportunities so that they
could purchase desired goods from the East. Close proximity to navigable waterways was desirable since
these were the primary modes of long-distance transportation used by the Europeans in the early nineteenth
century. To this end, the southeast coastal region was seen as a land of great opportunity.
The most successful settlements were located along the region’s largest navigable river, the Brazos. In 1836,
no one but the Allens figured that the sleepy, flood-prone area north of Harrisburg would someday become a
teeming metropolis. It was, perhaps, inevitable that, along with the rise of large merchant-class shipping,
some place in the vicinity of the Galveston Bay complex would arise as the region’s most important trade
center; the earliest predictions for such a port city were on or adjacent to Galveston Island.
The Allens cleverly marketed their land holdings on the bank of Buffalo Bayou, taking advantage not only of
the excellent natural resources and logistical advantages of the navigable connection to Galveston Bay but
also of the national attention and fame brought to the area by the Texas independence movement and the now
legendary war hero, Sam Houston. If not for the successful marketing of the new ‘City of Houston,’ along
with successful lobbying to locate the capital there, any other burg along the Galveston Bay complex might
have risen to prominence. Yet, come hurricane or high water (and both have come), by 1876, Houston was
well on its way to becoming one of the most important trading centers in the United States.

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT AREA
Margaret Swett Henson

A small portion of Houston’s early history surfaced in 1997-1998 when the Houston Sports Authority began
clearing 13 tracks leading into the 1910-1911 Union Station complex (Figure 7.1). Retaining the five-story
brick passenger station as a ticket office, but excavating a large number of blocks for the downtown baseball
park, the state-required archeological survey discovered a rich deposit of early nineteenth-century building
material and artifacts. Only minimal excavation had taken place in 1910 when the tracks were laid east of
Crawford Street. Foundations, wells, privy and trash pits remained intact, providing archeologists and
historians access to sites dating from about 1830 to 1910.

(Courtesy, Houston

These blocks marked the southeastern edge of an area known as Quality Hill in the last half of the nineteenth
century. Newspaperman Jesse A. Ziegler visited Houston in the 1870s and later recalled that the area of
upper-class homes began at Franklin, went south on Crawford to Congress, then east to Austin Street. His
memory was slightly flawed because at mid century, the courthouse, three blocks west of Austin Street, was
ringed by substantial homes. In 1867, the Annunciation Roman Catholic Church was started at the corner of
Texas and Crawford (across Texas Avenue from the station) (Figure 7.2). The crosses on its two towers
reached 97 ft (30 m), making the church a landmark for years.

52

Figure 7.2. Houston and the Project Area, as shown in the 1873 Bird’s Eye map. Note
the Annunciation Roman Catholic Church spire at center right.

The blocks eastward from Crawford, however, were a mix of a few substantial homes, such as that of A. C.
Gray, owner of the leading newspaper, and those of the working classes. A number of upwardly mobile
German immigrants settled in the area, along with other Europeans. In some cases, the standard 12-lot blocks
were subdivided into smaller lots; this contrasted with the blocks lining Crawford, where a single house was
located in each quadrant, or one or two dwellings dominated the center of a block. When the railroad began
buying out the owners, the wealthy families moved south along Main Street into new subdivisions. It is
unknown where the lesser folk resettled.
One of the sites found beneath the railroad tracks on Block 117 had a brick foundation, two wells, and a
storage pit that may date from 1837-1838, or earlier. The chain of title is confusing due in part to poor
surveying and platting of the area, and the fact that deeds were casually exchanged to pay debts in lieu of
insufficient circulating gold and silver coins.
PLAT OF HOUSTON IN 1836
Houston was platted and lots advertised for sale in August 1836, only four months after the Texas volunteer
army defeated President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto. Two brothers from
upstate New York, Augustus C. and John K. Allen, purchased the land from the widow of John Austin, who
had laid off part of his headright on Buffalo Bayou at the mouth of White Oak Bayou but had never lived
there. The Allen brothers’ surveyors, Gale and Thomas H. Borden, also natives of New York, platted their
townsite with north-south streets perpendicular to the bayou, not true north-south. This alignment with a
moving steam was traditional in the United States and allowed businesses to occupy the streets parallel to the
water course. The first Houston plat did not include the blocks in this study.
In this sense, Houston was a typical ‘American’ town with a river frontage. Moreover, the surrounding
prairie was almost flat, and the absence of rock outcrops or dense forests permitted an unhampered, traditional
grid pattern for streets and blocks. The Allens had become land speculators in the Nacogdoches area in 1832,

53

and after the Texas Revolution, brought their parents and siblings to Houston. The Allen venture depended in
part upon the inherited wealth of A. C. Allen’s wife, Charlotte Baldwin, whose kinsmen also settled in
Houston. Her family had founded Baldwinsville, on the Seneca Canal near Syracuse, and there is some
evidence that she took an active roll in the Allen partnership. The New York background of the founders and
surveyors seems moderately significant in the laying off of the new town. All were from upstate New York
and were well acquainted with the importance of water traffic for a commercial center, by river, lake, and the
New York canal system.
Speculation in town sites was popular in the Republic of Texas and the United States in the 1830s. The
Allens, for example, wanted to buy Harrisburg, a few miles down Buffalo Bayou. It had been laid off in 1826
at the head of the tidewater by another New York native, John R. Harris. Santa Anna burned most of
Harrisburg on April 15, but the site was prime. Harris died in 1829, and his brothers and widow were unable
to settle his estate, forcing the Allens to look elsewhere.
Besides the already established village of Harrisburg, there was another town plan in the vicinity at Morgan’s
Point, the high bluff peninsula on the west side of the San Jacinto estuary. Since 1834, James Morgan had
been developing a town site as agent for a group of prominent New York investors that included Samuel
Swartwout, President Andrew Jackson’s appointee as customs collector at the Port of New York. Morgan had
just completed a house to serve as a hotel and warehouses in early 1836, most of which was destroyed by
Santa Anna’s cavalry on April 19, 1836, just two days before the Texas victory at San Jacinto. Morgan, like
the Allens, wanted his town to become the capital of the new Republic of Texas, but the Allens won out,
promising to build a suitable building for the next session of Congress.
The Allen venture also had the potential of becoming a shipping point to serve farmers and planters on the
Brazos River in what would become Fort Bend County. The Brazos River was not navigable year round; it
also had two shallow sandbars at its mouth that made incoming and exiting vessels wait for high tide and
favorable wind. Houston offered an easier water route for shallow-draft steamboats to connect with Gulf
vessels at the deepwater harbor at Galveston Island once the snags, sawyers, and overhanging trees were
removed.
Houston’s rival would be the new City of Galveston being planned for the eastern tip of the island. Neither
Spain nor Mexico had allowed development on this strategic island with the most accessible deepwater harbor
on the Texas coast. An enterprising group had managed to secure a questionable Mexican title in 1834 and
planned to petition the Congress of the Republic of Texas to plat the city. The Allen brothers had also joined
this consortium.
ECONOMIC FACTORS IN 1836
All of these land-development schemes were financed on credit. President Jackson’s personal suspicions
about banking led to a disastrous attack against the Bank of the United States before he left office at the end
of 1836. The banking panic of 1837 followed, and bank after bank went bankrupt. The United States did not
print its own paper money at this time, and businesses relied on gold and silver coins. Specie (coins)
disappeared eastward to banking centers in the United States, and in turn, went abroad to settle merchants’
debts. Thus business in the United States (and the Republic of Texas) relied upon paper money issued by
merchants, unregulated state banks, and personal IOUs. All paper money was suspect and, therefore, heavily
discounted. Republic of Texas paper money was exchanged in New Orleans 10-1. Therefore, in Houston,
most business was conducted using IOUs or deeds, and bartering. The banking crisis continued well into the
1840s and ended with the outbreak of the war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas to the United States
in 1846. Historians note that most periods of economic distress are solved by the wartime spending of
governments.

54

Economic hard times helped develop Houston when debtors in the United States moved to the frontier
seeking a fresh start. Those with a little specie could make it go far, while those without means could work or
gamble, hoping to earn a stake. Carpenters and brick masons, the last who could burn brick, were in demand.
As population increased after annexation to the United States, Houston residences were built east of Crawford
and south of Preston. Greater development occurred after the Civil War and outside of the 1870 parameter for
this study.
The blocks comprising the Union Station property were part of a land grant (one-third of a league, or 1,476
acres) made to James Wells by the Harrisburg District Board of Land Commissioners at its first hearing in
January 1838. Mandated by the Congress of the Republic, these boards met to establish the legitimacy of
claims for first-class headrights of those who arrived prior to March 2, 1836, but who had not previously
received a headright from the Mexican government through an impresario or a state land commissioner.
Single men were entitled to one-third of a league, while heads of a family might claim a league and labor
(approximately 4,428 acres of pasture land and 177 acres of irrigable farm land).
Wells received his grant in the eastern third of a league of land that had been previously claimed by two
successive New York merchants seeking Texas land, first in 1831 by John S. Moore, and second in 1834 by
Isaac Batterson. Neither being able to perfect his title, Moore forfeited his claim early in 1834, while
Batterson was unable to secure a title in the February 1838 land-office rush. Moore was dead by 1836, and
his widow returned to New York with the children. Batterson died in early 1838, leaving his widow to fight
the courts for his league, losing the prime location adjacent to the growing City of Houston to James Wells,
James S. Holman, and widow Obedience Smith, mother of Ben Fort Smith. Both Smith and Holman made up
two-thirds of the 1838 Board of Land Commissions for Harrisburg County.
In 1831, it was possible to apply for a headright from Stephen F. Austin, but it was somewhat awkward. One
year earlier on April 6, 1830, the Mexican government had, for political reasons, closed immigration into
Texas to residents of the United States. Leaders in Mexico City worried that Texas had too many AngloAmerican residents who were not assimilating Mexican language or culture, and who might have intentions of
aiding the United States and President Andrew Jackson in acquiring eastern Texas by force. Stephen F.
Austin immediately secured an exemption for those immigrants intending to settle in his colony, and who had
a passport and character references from one of his agents. To enforce the April 6, 1830, law, and to aid
customs officers newly assigned to collect national tariffs on imports, Mexican authorities sent troops to
various Texas ports of entry, such as Anahuac, Nacogdoches, the mouth of the Brazos, and so forth. A
political coup and a civil war from 1830-1832 south of the Rio Grande resulted in the capturing by Anglo
Texans of the fort at Anahuac and Velasco in June 1832 in the name of the reformer-victor, General Antonio
Lopez de Santa Anna. Troops withdrew to San Antonio and pronounced in favor of Santa Anna.
Moore, Batterson, and Wells arrived in Texas seeking their fortunes during this tumultuous time. John S.
Moore, a New York merchant, along with neighbor Isaac Batterson, apparently heard the ‘Texas talk’ offers
of free land and passage by stock companies such as the Galveston Bay & Texas Land Company and other
small promoters. Moore may have departed New York in late 1830, in time to arrive at the S. F. Austin
Colonial Office in February 1831, applying for one league and one labor of land to settle his family in Texas.
Moore testified he was a trader from New York in company with wife, Catherine, one child and one
dependent. Moore promised to settle his family on the acreage situated on the south line of the John Austin
Town Tract by January 8, 1832 (Austin’s Register of Families 1825-1835:I-91). The grant of land was
located on Brays Bayou, above Luke Moore’s grant and the Tierwester grant.
Moore, born in New York City in 1802, had become a partner in the New York dry-goods firm of Moore &
Pattison, 200 Chatham Street, by 1825. Four years later, he was the sole proprietor of the John S. Moore Dry
Goods Company, moving to 54 Maiden Lane in 1829. Settling on the Texas frontier on over 4,428 acres of

55

free land represented a drastic lifestyle change for the Moore family. While working his farm on Buffalo
Bayou, John Moore heeded the call to John Austin’s militia in Brazoria on June 20, 1832, being established
on his land for about 15 months with family, a water well, shelter, and the beginning of field crops. Two
crops later, in February 1834, Moore left the Buffalo Bayou league, discovering early what many other
settlers along the waterway learned late–that land along the bayou was not suitable for extensive farming,
only for range cattle, trapping, and harvesting pine timber. Trappers carried otter, deer, bear, panther, wild
cat, wolf, and coon pelts to river ports, trading for medicine and lead (Harris 1900-1901).
The Moore league was predominantly located in the saltgrass prairie with scattered post oaks. The eastern
edge along Brays Bayou had a stand of pin oak, red oak, white oak, and post oak. The old San Felipe-toHarrisburg trail that hugged riparian timber on the south side of Buffalo Bayou divided the John Austin Two
League Town Tract from the north line of the Moore league. Moore, as did most settlers, established his
residence and water well a few hundred feet off the road.
Early in 1825, Austin Colony Surveyor John Cook teamed with an associate to file for a league of land on
Galveston Bay, which both forfeited when visiting the lush Colorado River valley near Bastrop. Virginian
farmer and mill builder A. C. Reynolds, after settling on the west line of John Moore’s league for three years,
quickly exchanged his Buffalo Bayou plantation by 1834 for greener pastures in Washington County.
Moore’s wife, Catherine, and her children and mother were back in New York in 1836, with Catherine listed
as a widow. By 1850, Catherine and son John Moore were busy in the advertising business in New York’s
Central Market (New York City Directory 1836-1855; New York Federal Census 1850).
Isaac Batterson applied at San Felipe de Austin for the forfeited Moore league in April 1834, just two months
after John Merry requested the same league (Austin’s Register 1825-1835:I-42). Merry, age 48, and his wife
Marrill, age 47, along with three male children and one female, arrived from Tennessee in the fall of 1833.
On February 6, 1834, Merry was in San Felipe requesting the league surveyed by Hirams for John Moore. On
April 15 of the same year, Isaac Batterson asked for the same land, stating he was from New York State,
where his family, a wife Amelia and four female children, resided (Austin’s Register 1825-1835:I-42).
Batterson and Moore had been neighbors in New York. Land office records indicate that Batterson had the
land surveyed and applied for a title before the 1835-1836 Revolution. As no titles were being issued,
Batterson could only wait for the land office to open, along with hundreds of other settlers. While waiting,
Batterson settled his family across the bayou from Harrisburg, four miles downstream from the abandoned
Moore league. Batterson’s hardwood house floor was requisitioned by General Sam Houston’s army for a
raft to cross the bayou on their route to meet Santa Anna at San Jacinto.
Land talk and stock options also circulated along all Mississippi River ports, pressed by a Texian group
quartered in New Orleans. James Wells, a bachelor, had arrived at Harrisburg from St. Louis, Missouri, via
New Orleans on April 28, 1833, in company with his brother-in-law, Dr. Pleasant W. Rose and his family
consisting of Rose’s wife (formerly Wells) and their two children. Thus the Rose party arrived at a time of
optimism when reforms favorable to Anglo Texans were possible but also when Austin’s colonization
contracts were beginning to expire. The impresario was starting for Mexico City with petitions for reforms
desired by Anglo Texans, but within the year, Austin became a political prisoner, leaving his agent at San
Felipe to take care of land matters. The Roses and Wells could have applied for the standard land grant in
1833-1834, but did not; instead, Rose rented farm property.
Wells helped his sister’s family move from Harrisburg to the Jesse Cartwright farm near present-day
Richmond in Fort Bend County. Wells was with them in March 1836 when William B. Travis called for
volunteers to join him at the Alamo. He enrolled in the volunteer army on March 13, a week after the Alamo
had fallen, and continued to serve until October 1836, thereby earning the standard 640 acres in bounty land
for his military service. Wells was with a spy company in April when the Mexican army crossed the Brazos
River. He was almost captured in Fort Bend and injured his shoulder during his escape; he thus missed the

56

Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. Wells was reunited with his sister’s family on April 30, when the
Roses returned from their flight across the Trinity River in what was known as the Runaway Scrape (Harris
1900-1901:85-87, 90-91, 160, 173-77).
Two weeks after James Wells received approval for this one-third league from the Board of Land
Commissioners, he married Jane Earle on January 13, 1838. Then, as a married man, Wells applied for and
received his increased allotment, minus the previous one-third league, on February 15. It was a portion of this
4,605-acre claim that he used to secure a vacant strip of land that bordered the southern boundary of the Allen
brothers’ City of Houston. Jane was a daughter of Thomas Earle, a native of Ireland, who received his
headright land on Buffalo Bayou in 1824 from Austin. Jane, named for her mother, had been born in Ohio in
1820. Three children were born to the Wells: Joseph in 1845, Cornelius in 1847, and Anne in 1848 (United
States Bureau of the Census-Harris County 1850:562).
The Harris County 1840 tax roll says James Wells owned 166 surveyed acres and had cattle but mentions no
town lots. The tax collector during the Republic years struggled to identify property and its owners amid the
ever-changing land swapping and bartering carried on by Harris County residents. However, real property
deeds reveal that on October 3, 1838, soon after receiving his headright, he contracted with mapmaker A.
Girard and several land speculators to plat the northern part of the 400- to-500-acre tract (a small portion of
his allotment) as part of Houston. A. Girard platted the blocks in the Wells survey, not always accurately,
which caused confusion, dissatisfaction, and even law suits. Girard had, unfortunately, also instituted a new
numbering system for the Wells blocks, beginning with Block 1, thus duplicating the City of Houston’s
numbering system and creating much confusion at the courthouse. The Girard numbering system was soon
thrown out and replaced by George H. Bringhurst’s survey, which was based upon a continuum of the highest
city block number on the east side of Houston. Bringhurst also had difficulty in realigning survey blocks with
the existing city blocks, finding several discrepancies with the original Girard survey. These inaccuracies in
surveying, found in matching other additions to the city, were not to be resolved until a massive city-wide
survey map was executed in 1869 by W. E. Wood, and signed by the other Harris County surveyors.
Although the Wood map was never placed on record in the Harris County Courthouse, it remains a valuable
resource for early surveys. The original Girard plat that had been placed in the Harris County Deed books has
been missing from the records for over a century.
This was a period of hard economic times in Texas and the United States, stemming from the banking panic
of 1837. The depressed economy did not recover until the annexation of Texas in 1846 and the subsequent
Mexican War of 1846-1848. There was a worldwide shortage of specie; gold coins flowed through East
Coast bankers to Europe, causing private merchants and some states (including the Republic of Texas) to print
virtually worthless money. The United States did not print paper money as legal tender until 1866. Thus
bartering of agricultural produce, slaves, and land for services and necessities was common in Texas; Texas
paper money, which nobody wanted, was discounted as much as 10 cents on the dollar.
These hard times help explain the confusion of some early deed records, in addition to a poor survey made by
army officer Girard, which affected the current Project Area. It appears that between 1838 and 1848, the
Wells family lived on what was to become the eastern expansion of the City of Houston, i.e., Block 117. The
Wells’ city residence remained briefly on the edge of town, almost like a small farm. Still needing money,
James Wells began to sell portions of his homestead block, a practice continued by his widow after his death,
perhaps to settle old debts.
James Wells died at his house in Houston in August 1848, and was carried many miles to their Clear Creek
farm for burial. The Wells had acquired 200 acres with improvements on Clear Creek, a site known in 1849
as ‘the Wells place’ on the headright of James Earle, a brother of Jane.

Houston summers were hot, humid, and deadly with yellow fever, dengue fever, and malaria outbreaks
continuing from July through the first frost. Those who could afford it left the city for the country, some even
traveling to upper New York State during August. The lesser folk took lots in Beauchamp Springs, northwest
of Houston, or in Piedmont Springs in Grimes County to escape the heat and deadly vapors. The Wells
family emulated moderate- to upper-income Houstonians by spending time on the farm at Horse Pen Bayou,
some 15 miles from Houston, where Jane, the three children, and her orphaned niece, 18-year-old Elizabeth
Moore (daughter of Luke Moore and Jane’s sister), lived in the spring of 1850, the time of the census. Jane
purchased a new house in town after her husband’s death but appears to have occupied the house only during
the winter months, following the habit of some of her town neighbors and affluent Houstonians of the day.
Jane, a country woman like her mother, and marginally educated, likely preferred rural living and probably
died at her country place in November 1852. Her niece, Elizabeth Moore, married Edward Gahan on October
17, 1852, and after his death, William R. Anderson on December 6, 1855. The Andersons took care of the
Wells children until they were grown.
SUMMARY
From raw land in 1830 to a lot-and-block subdivision in 1839, the eastern portion of the old Moore league
began to take on the character of the spreading city established only two years previously. However
haphazard a beginning, the surveyed Wells’ lots began to sell after Texas became a State, with money, people,
and merchandise flowing through the new port at Houston. James Wells saw his gamble materialize just
before his death in 1848, with large blocks nearest to the city selling to families who desired stately dwellings
set in the center of their property, emulating the feeling of a country place in the city. The blocks east of the
Wells’ house on Block 117 developed as small lots, crowding 10 to 12 houses to the block, built by moderateincome working immigrant families of mixed ethnicity. The fortunes of the Wells’ subdivision reflected the
growth spurts and fortunes of Houston, depending upon barter during the lean times of the Republic and
expanding with the monied times of statehood, subsequently to flourish and blossom in the high-cotton days
preceding the Civil War. The major turning points of the neighborhood indelibly coincided with the time of
James Wells’ death in 1848 and Jane Wells’ demise in 1852.

DOCUMENTARY RESULTS
Janet K. Wagner

This chapter presents summaries of land ownership for the following blocks located within Project Area:
Blocks 103, 117, 118, 162, and 173. Some of the primary sources consulted include the Harris County
Courthouse Deed Records, Marriage Records, and Tax Records. Files at the United States Bureau of the
Census for Harris County were also consulted, including the Slave Schedule and Products of Industry
Schedule for various years. Some of these records are over 150 years old, so citations will not always be
consistent, especially with regard to volume and page number references. Other referenced sources include
city directories, specifically W. A. Leonard’s Houston Directory for 1866, William Murray’s Murray’s City
Directory for 1870-1871, and Morrison & Fourmy Directory Company’s Houston (Texas) City Directory.
Journal articles, privately published manuscripts, maps, and other documentation located in the archives at J.
K. Wagner & Company, Inc., Houston, Texas, were also consulted.
FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK 103
James F. Dumble Family
James F. Dumble and other Dumble family members were associated with Block 103, Parcel 103-3, Lots 3, 4,
6, 7, 8, 11, and 12 from 1853 until the 1890s. Dumble’s father and mother were both natives of England, as
was James F., born in 1829. James’ older siblings, John (in 1820) and Mary (between 1820 and 1829), were
also born in England. The Dumble family left England following the birth of James and went to Toronto,
Canada, where James’ younger siblings, George and Mary, were born in 1833 and 1837, respectively.
By 1850, brothers and sister, James, John, and Eliza Dumble, were together in Madison, Jefferson County,
Indiana, on the Ohio River. There, on September 2, 1850, James F. Dumble married Mary F. Whery. At the
time, the couple was living with James’ brother, John, a carpenter, and 13-year-old sister, Eliza Dumble.
James F. Dumble and his wife, Mary, had a son, Edwin Theodore Dumble, on March 28, 1852, in Madison,
Indiana. The couple and their new son left Indiana and arrived in Galveston, Texas, in June 1852, becoming
the first generation of Dumbles in Texas. James made his first purchase in Harris County on August 21,
1853, when he bought Block 103 from Robert Brewster, paying in two notes of $250 each (Harris County
Courthouse-Deed Records [HCC-DR] 1853:P:359).
In the same year that James F. Dumble bought Block 103, he was elected superintendent of Sunday School in
the Methodist Church of Houston (Blandin 1908:200). Once they made their home in Houston, James F. and
Mary Dumble had four more children between 1855 and 1863. In September 1855, a daughter, Alice, was
born. Eva C. was born in 1858, and Minerva (also known as Mittie or Minnie) was born in April 1860. In
1863, another son, Frederick, was born into the James Dumble household.
During 1856, James F. Dumble began selling off lots in the east side of Block 103 (retaining Lots 3 and 4).
Later, in 1862, he sold to his brother, George Dumble, and wife, Mary E. (née King), Lots 9 and 10 and part
of Lots 8 and 11, which were abutting his homestead to the north.
On September 20, 1860, James F. Dumble reported owning three slaves: an 18-year-old Black female, a 26year-old Mulatto male, and a 26-year-old Black male (United States Bureau of the Census-Harris CountySlave Schedule [USBC-HC-SS] 1860). The Dumble family was enumerated as living in the Third Ward of

59

Houston on October 11, 1860: James F. Dumble, 30, M (male), Merchant, $2,000 in real estate and $500 in
personal estate, and Mary A., 31, F (female), $1,500 in real estate, are listed as born in England. Edwin T., 9,
M, was born in Indiana, while Alice, 5, F; Eva E., 3, F; and Minerva M., 6 months, F, were born in Texas
(USBC-HC 1860:939).
According to the 1866 Houston City Directory, James F. Dumble was with the firm Peel and Dumble,
General Commission and Forwarding Merchants, Cotton and Wool Factors, located on Commerce Street,
between Main and Travis streets (Leonard 1866). Dumble’s residence at the time was on the corner of Prairie
and Crawford streets. Then, in the 1870 Houston City Directory, James F. Dumble was an agent for the
Houston City Mills Manufacturing Company and an officer of the Agricultural, Mechanical and Blood Stock
Association of Texas (Murray 1871). His residence remained listed at the corner of Prairie and Crawford
streets. By 1870, the James F. Dumble family was living next to the George Dumble family. In addition to
James F and his wife, Mary, the 1870 census includes their five children and one servant, Lucy, a 22-year-old
Black female who was born in Canada (USBC-HC 1870:82-92).
On June 15, 1876, James’ son, Edwin T. Dumble, married 20-year-old Fannie Gray, the daughter of A. C.
Gray, in Harris County (HCC-Marriage Records [HCC-MR] 1876:412:5919). They had a daughter, Millie,
the following year. The 1877 Houston City Directory lists Edwin T. Dumble at his father’s residence on the
southeast corner of Prairie and Crawford streets. Edwin was working as a clerk at the general office of the
Houston and Texas Central Railroad Company (H&TC).
James Dumble’s daughter, Eva C., married Morgan H. Armistead in Harris County on November 20, 1877
(HCC-MR 1877:44:9245). Armistead became a partner in George Dumble’s hardware business in Houston in
1893. According to the Houston City Directory in 1880, James F. Dumble sold china, glass, and Queensware
at 76 Main Street, the west side, between Congress and Preston streets. His residence at the time was still at
Prairie and Crawford streets. Edwin T. Dumble continued clerking for the H&TC offices and living at his
parents’ home. James’ youngest son, Frederick W. Dumble, lived at home and clerked at his father’s business.
On June 23, 1880, the Dumble family was enumerated living on Prairie Street: J. F. Dumble, 51, M, W,
Queensware Dealer; Mary A., 52, F, W, Housekeeping; Alice, 23, F, W, Housekeeping; Millie, 19, F, W,
Housekeeping; and Fred, 17, M, W, Clerk in Store. Also enumerated with the Dumble family on Prairie
Street were M. Armistead, 23, M, W, son-in-law, Clerk in Store, born in Louisiana; Eva (née Dumble)
Armistead, 21, born in Texas; Nelson Munger, 24, M, W, boarder, Clerk at H&TC, born in Texas; James
Kelly, 27, M, B, Servant/Laborer, born in Texas; and Lucy Kelly, 28, F, B, Servant/Cook, born in Texas
(USBC-HC 1880:617). James and Mary Dumble’s son, Edwin T., was enumerated as living with his fatherin-law, A. C. Gray’s family, at 242 Prairie Street.
In 1882, the Houston City Directory listed James F. Dumble, China, Glass, Queensware, Crockery and House
Furnishing Goods, at 48 Main Street. His residence was 225 Prairie Street, on the corner of Crawford Street.
Sons Frederick and Edwin T. worked for James Dumble at the hardware store, with Frederick still residing at
his parents’ home.
James’ son, Edwin, was included in a list printed in 1913 by the Houston Press Club, entitled Men of Affairs
of Houston and Environs. Edwin, educated at Washington and Lee universities, was the State Geologist of
Texas between 1887 and 1897 and thereafter became a consulting geologist to the Southern Pacific Railway
Company. Edwin actively involved himself in geological affairs: vice president of both Rio Bravo and East
Coast Oil companies, and a fellow in the Geological Society of America, American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and Texas Academy of Science. Not only was he a member of the Texas Historical
Society, but Edwin was also a member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, Mining and
Metallurgical Society of America, California Academy of Science, Houston Country Club, and the ZZ Club
(Houston Press Club 1913:171).

George Dumble Family
George Dumble and his family were associated with Block 103, Lots 9 and 10 and part of Lots 8 and 11, from
1862 to the late 1890s. George was born in Toronto, Canada, in 1833, and was in Harris County by 1859.
After making his way to Texas from Canada, George Dumble established a hardware business in Houston.
George Dumble, brother of James F. Dumble, was enumerated in the census as living as a single man in
Houston’s Third Ward on October 23, 1860: George Dumble, 27, M, Clerk, $3,500 in real estate and $1,500
in personal estate, born in Canada (USBC-HC 1860:1063).
George Dumble was married in Harris County to Mary E. King on June 5, 1861 (HCC-MR 1861:C:470). By
October, they had a baby daughter, Mary Georgia Dumble. It was on May 15, 1862, that George Dumble
bought Lots 9 and 10 and part of Lots 8 and 11, adjacent on the north to the homestead of his brother, James.
George and Mary Dumble went on to raise a large family, having a total of eight children (see below) and one
set of twins between 1861 and 1883. The twins died at two weeks of age in 1883.
In 1864, William King Dumble, was born in Harris County. Two more sons, Henry Harry and Rufus, were
born in 1867 and 1869, respectively. Another daughter, Sarah F., was born in 1872, and a son, D. Harvey
Dumble, was born in 1874. Two more sons, Harrison and Herman, arrived in the George Dumble household
in 1877 and 1878, respectively.
The 1866 Houston City Directory lists George Dumble as a clerk with J. R. Morris (Merchant, Main Street,
between Congress and Preston streets), with his residence located on the corner of Preston and Crawford
streets. By 1870, George Dumble was a merchant, and he still resided on the corner of Preston and Crawford
streets (Houston City Directory 1870). According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census for Harris County, on
July 2, 1870, George Dumble and his family lived next to his brother James’ family: George Dumble, 37, M,
W, Ret. Hardware Merchant, born in Canada; Mary E. Dumble, 30, F, W, Housekeeping, born in Texas; and
Mary G., 8, F, W; William, 6, M, W; Henry, 3, M, W; and Rufus, (named on the census as Ruth), 10 months,
F (M), W, all born in Texas. Sallie Dumble, 20, F, B, born in Texas, is also listed (USBC-HC-SS 1870:8393).
In 1871, George Dumble founded a hardware business in Houston, “a pioneer in the hardware business here
and one of the oldest established enterprises of Houston,” according to an 1894 publication detailing
businesses in Houston (Akehurst Publishing 1894). The firm of Dumble, Armistead and Cronan, Hardware
Dealers, at 217 Main Street, was organized in 1893. It consisted of George Dumble, M. H. Armistead, and T.
W. Cronan. It was noted that the hardware business was situated in a “three-story brick building 30 x 100 feet
in area, also two large warehouses, each forty by one hundred feet on Jackson St.” (Akehurst Publishing
1894).
The Dumble firm’s items were “procured direct from first hands,” including iron and galvanized pipe, steam
fittings, stoves, tinware, house furnishing goods, steel cut and wire nails, belting, packing, and
manufacturers’supplies. The firm also acted as “exclusive agents for Giant stitched rubber belting, Munson’s
celebrated Eagle and Dynamo leather belting, Fairbanks’ standard scales, Knowles’ steam pumps, [and]
Excelsior steam injectors” (Akehurst Publishing 1894).
The 1877 and 1880 Houston City Directories list George Dumble’s business of hardware, stoves, and tinware
on 55 east side of Main Street, between Congress and Franklin streets. His residence was located on the
southeast corner of Crawford and Preston streets.
George Dumble and his family were enumerated in the USBC-HC as living on Crawford Street on June 24,
1880: George Dumble, 47, M, W, Hardware Merchant, born in Canada; Mary E., 48, F, W, Housekeeping,
born in Texas. (Mary) Georgia, 18, F, W; William King, 15, M, W; Harry, 13, M, W; Rufus, 11, M, W; Sarah
F., 8, F, W; Harvey, 5, M, W; and Herman, 3, M, W, are each listed as being born in Texas. Two servants, a

61

Black male named Pleasant, who worked at the Porter House and was born in Texas, and a Black female, who
worked as a cook and was also born in Texas, are also included in the household (USBC-HC-SS 1880:123).
George’s daughter, Sarah F., died after June 1880, at about age eight.
According to the Houston City Directory in 1882, George Dumble’s hardware business was listed at 37 Main
Street, while his residence was at 63 Crawford Street, on the corner of Preston Street. His son, William K.,
was living at home and bookkeeping for his father. On June 30, 1883, George and Mary Dumble had twins,
but the two babies died a few weeks later, on July 11. George and Mary’s daughter, Mary Georgia Dumble,
married Horace Baldwin Rice, the son of F. A. Rice and Charlotte Baldwin, in Harris County on October 22,
1883. Mrs. George Dumble died in Houston on December 15, 1894.
Dumble Families in the Methodist Church
Both the James Dumble and George Dumble families became actively involved in the Methodist church in
Houston for a number of years. Mr. J. F. Dumble was the elected Sunday School superintendent of Shearn
Church from 1853 until 1868 (Blandin 1908:200). According to the 1866 Houston City Directory, James F.
Dumble was an appointed member of the building committee for the Methodist Congregation of Houston
(later known as Shearn Church), following the collapse of the church’s brick edifice in about 1860. The
congregation was forced to meet elsewhere for services until the church could fund construction of a new
building.
The first Methodist church in Houston was the Methodist Episcopal Church, known in the conference records
as “Houston Station,” and the second church was also known by the same name (Blandin 1908:213). James
F. Dumble was secretary of the building committee for construction of the third church. He introduced a
resolution to name it Charles Shearn Memorial, since Charles Shearn was the oldest member at the time.
Although the resolution was adopted, the church did not recognize the name until 1890. The 1880 Houston
City Directory lists the Shearn Methodist Church on the north side of Texas Avenue, between Travis and
Milam streets. The pastor was Reverend Robert T. Nabors.
The Dumble wives were also noted in many of the church’s activities. Mrs. James Dumble and Mrs. George
Dumble were charter members of Shearn Church’s Ladies Aid, a fund-raising group that helped locate money
to build a new parsonage at the corner of Milam and Texas streets in 1881. Mrs. George Dumble was also a
charter member of Shearn Auxiliary of Woman’s Foreign Missionary Society in 1881 (Blandin 1908:187,
193).
Robert Brewster Family
Robert Brewster and his family were associated with Block 103, Parcel 103-1, Lots 1 and 2, and Parcel 103-3,
Lots 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. Brewster, a native of Ireland, owned all of Block 103 between 1847 and 1853. It is
likely that Brewster arrived in Harris County in 1842 when he first purchased land in the county.
Block 275 was Brewster’s initial purchase in Harris County, in July 1842. He sold the block three years later
(HCC-DR 1845:H:366, J:416). In November 1846, Brewster formed a co-partnership with Henry H. Milby to
operate a coffee house in downtown Houston (HCC-DR 1846:L:175).1 Robert Brewster married Mary C.
Andross (Andrews), a native of New York, in Harris County on July 8, 1846 (HCC-MR 1846:A:403).
Robert and Mary Brewster had a daughter, Mary A., in 1847. On April 27 of the same year, Brewster
1

H. H. Milby is listed on the 1850 census (USBC-HC 1850:194) as a 33-year-old male from Delaware. He and his wife,
Anne S., from Maryland, and three children, Rhoda, Henry, and Allen 6, 4, and 2 years old, respectively) were living
with A.D. Kellum, a 39-year-old male who worked as a hotelkeeper and was born in Virginia. Also living with Kellum
were A. C. Allen, 45, M, $12,000, born in New York; C. M. Allen, 35, F, born in New York; and Eliza Allen, 12, F, born
in Texas. L. J. Latham, M, Merchant, $8,000, New York, also lived in the same household (USBC-HC 1850:194).

62

purchased Blocks 103, 105, and 118 (HCC-DR 1847:M:198). Robert Brewster made an improvement on Lot
8 in 1847; in 1848, he moved his family into the Fourth Ward, where he served as alderman from 1848
through 1849 and again in 1853. In 1848, Brewster reported 27 lots of land in Houston having a total value of
$3,000, a clock and watch worth $170, and $1,000 of money at interest (HCC-Tax Records [TR] 1848).
A son, Robert W., was born into the Robert Brewster family in 1849, and on September 7, 1850, the Brewster
family were reported in the census: Robert Brewster, 32, M, Merchant, $3,000, born in Ireland; Mary C., 22,
F, born in New York; Mary A., 3, F, born in Texas; and Robert W., 1, M, born in Texas (USBC-HC
1850:204).
On May 31, 1851, Robert Brewster and others signed an agreement forming a company to navigate steam
boats on Buffalo Bayou (HCC-DR 1851:O:518). Robert Brewster sold Block 103 to James F. Dumble on
August 31, 1853 (HCC-DR 1853:P:359). Brewster went on to become Houston’s secretary and treasurer in
1856, and tax assessor and collector in 1861 and 1863-1867. During Brewster’s ownership of Block 103
between 1847 and 1853, he actively bought and sold several lots and blocks in Houston, as well as various
tracts of acreage in Harris County.
John W. Stansfield Family
John W. Stansfield and his family were associated with Block 103, Parcel 103-1, Lots 1 and 2, where he and
his wife had two small children between 1856 and 1865. John W. Stansfield, a native of Leeds, England, left
Hamburg on October 3, 1849, on the ship Hamburg, arriving in Galveston on December 15, 1849.
John Stansfield’s first land purchase in Harris County occurred in July 1855, when he bought a lot in Block
53 (HCC-DR 1855:S:68). On March 5, 1856, Stansfield’s next land purchase in the county was Lots 1 and 2,
Block 103 (HCC-DR 1856:P:618). Nine months later, on December 27, 1856, John Stansfield married Emma
Trautvetter, a native of Saxony (HCC-MR 1856:331). The Stansfield couple built a home on the lots and
mortgaged the improvements on January 1, 1857 (HCC-DR 1857:S:664). In the same year, a daughter,
Antoinette F. Stansfield, was born.
By March 1860, another daughter, Georgianna E., was born into the Stansfield household. On October 19,
1860, the Stansfield family and Emma’s sister were enumerated in the census as living in Houston’s Third
Ward: J.W. Stansfield, 35, M, Clerk, $2,000 in real estate and $250 in personal estate, born in England;
Emma, 23, F, born in Saxony; Antoinette F., 3, F, born in Texas; Georgianna E., 7 months, born in Texas; and
Anna Trautvetter, 21, F, $600 in personal estate, born in Saxony (USBC-HC 1860:975). Five years later, on
May 31, 1865, the Stansfields sold their homestead for $1,200 (HCC-DR 1865:2:23).
During the Stansfield’s ownership of Lots 1 and 2 between 1856 and 1865, John Stansfield did not appear to
routinely buy or sell property in Harris County. His next land purchase in the county did not occur until five
years later, when he secured 274 acres in the J. D. Taylor Survey (HCC-DR 1870:Y:499). According to the
deed records, John W. Stansfield sold property in other counties in 1858, although he did not file the
acquisitions of such property.
William Dissen Family
William Dissen and his family were associated with Block 103, Parcel 103-1, Lots 1 and 2, for a 16-month
period between May 1865 and November 1866. Dissen, a native of Hanover, Germany, initially worked as a
merchant tailor in Houston and later became a hotel keeper, establishing by 1870 the Dissen House on Preston
Street, between Main and Fannin streets.
Dissen’s first purchases in Harris County were Lots 1 and 2 in Block 103, which he bought for $1,200 on
May 31, 1865 (HCC-DR 1865:2:23). A year later, on June 9, 1866, he married 17-year-old Anna Feitler, a
native of Saxony (HCC-MR 1866:152:301).

63

The 1866 Houston City Directory lists William Dissen, Merchant Tailor, on Main Street, between Preston and
Texas streets, with his residence on Commerce Street, between San Jacinto and Caroline streets. The Dissens
sold Lots 1 and 2 with improvements on November 26, 1866 (HCC-DR 1866:3:652). Dissen’s next land
purchase took place in April 1873, when he secured two lots in Block 13 (HCC-DR 1873:11:867-877). By
July 1873, William Dissen and Company recorded a Bond for Sale of the Lone Star Saloon on Preston,
between Main and Fannin streets, later known as the Dissen House (HCC-DR 1873:12:131).
Frederick Schweikart Family
Frederick Schweikart and his family were associated with Block 103, Parcel 103-1, Lots 1 and 2, between
1866 and 1872. Soon after his birth in New York in 1839, Frederick Schweikart came to Texas with his
parents, John (Johan) and Elizabeth Schweikart, who were immigrants from Germany.2
Frederick Schweikart established a career in Houston as a retail grocer. Schweikart’s first land purchase in
Harris County occurred in approximately 1859-1860. On March 24, 1866, Frederick Schweikart, then in his
mid 20s, married Mrs. Antoinette Kuhule, a native Texan, in Harris County (HCC-MR 1866:126:248). Eight
months later, on November 26, 1866, Antoinette Schweikart secured from William and Ann Dissen Lots 1
and 2, with improvements, for $3,000 in gold (HCC-DR 1866:3:652).
In the same year that the Schweikarts purchased these corner lots (on Prairie and Jackson streets), Frederick
clerked with G.H. Danielson and Company, Grocers, located on Congress Street, between Main and Travis
streets (Houston City Directory 1866). According to the 1870 Houston City Directory, Frederick Schweikart
was working as a grocer at 25 Travis Street.
On July 2, 1870, the Schweikart family was listed in the Third Ward: Frederick Schweikart, 31, M, W,
Wholesale/Retail Grocer, born in New York; Antoinette, 35, F, W, Keeping House, born in Texas; Nettie, 3,
F, W, born in Texas; and Louis, 1, M, W, born in Texas (USBC-HC 1870:81-91). Two years later, on August
19, 1872, the Schweikarts sold their home on Lots 1 and 2 (HCC-DR 1872:10:567).
During the Schweikarts’ ownership of Lots 1 and 2, they purchased 3.5 lots in Block 163 in 1871-1872, just
prior to the couple’s sale of Lots 1 and 2 (HCC-DR 1871:10:130, 1872:11:261). The Schweikart couple did
not buy or sell any other property in Harris County until November 1877, when Frederick Schweikart bought
a block in the Hailey Addition and a block in the Sydnor Addition; the same was sold in 1878 (HCC-DR
1878:17:675).
FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK 117
Martin Floeck Family
Martin Floeck and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-6, Lot 8, between 1855 and 1856,
and Parcel 117-7, Lots 9 and 10, between 1852 and 1863. At about age 17, Martin Floeck, his parents
Michael and Katrine (Catherine), and siblings Elizabeth, Peter, Carl, Michael, and Nicholas, immigrated from
Muhlheim, by Coblenz, to Texas, becoming first-generation Texans. It would seem that the Floeck family
were in Harris County by at least 1847, since Martin’s father, Michael Floeck, a lumberman according to the
1850 census, made his first purchase in the county in August of that year (HCC-DR 1847). Martin Floeck
eventually established a career in the brewing business.
The Floecks, natives of Prussia, were a Catholic family with a number of the children and grandchildren that
were baptized in St. Vincent de Paul Church. Martin Floeck was married to Anna Maria Frances Schermoni
in Harris County on June 27, 1851 (HCC-MR 1851:298). He purchased Lots 9 and 10 in Block 117 in June
1852 (HCC-DR 1852:P:204).

Frederick’s father was a member of the first German Society in Texas, known as Deutcher Verein für Texas, organized
in November 1840 (Tiling 1913).

Between 1852 and 1865, Martin and Anna Floeck raised six children. The first daughter, Katy, was born in
1852. A son, William, was born in 1854, while another, Charlie (or Charly), was born in 1856. Robert was
born into the Floeck family in 1859. Amelia Floeck was born in 1863. Two years later, in 1865, another son,
Adolph, was born.
In 1855, Martin Floeck’s Lots 9 and 10 were valued at $500, or $250 each (HCC-Tax Records [TR] 1855).
On December 7, 1855, in a deed from Jane Wells, he acquired Lot 8 in the same block. Martin Floeck
conveyed the lot back to Mrs. Wells one year later, on December 11, 1856 (HCC-DR 1855:P:595,
1856:S:654). However, Floeck continued to pay taxes on all three lots; in 1856, Lots 8, 9, and 10 were valued
at $300 each (HCC-TR 1856). Floeck also reported Lot 5, Block 103, west of Jackson Street, valued at $100,
and $400 at interest in 1856.
The Harris County Tax Records for 1857 list Martin Floeck with Lots 8, 9, and 10 holding their value at $300
per lot. Lot 5 in Block 103 was worth $400; Martin Floeck was also acting as agent for his brother, Peter
Floeck, for part of Lot 9 and all of Lot 10 in Block 113, which was estimated at $100. Lots 8, 9, and 10
remained valued at $300 each in 1858. Lot 5 in Block 103 increased to $500, and Half-Lot 9 and Lot 10 in
Block 113 increased to $300. By 1859, Lots 8, 9, and 10 had increased in value to $333 per lot. Lot 5 in
Block 103 remained at $500, while Half-Lot 9 and Lot 10 in Block 113 remained at $300. Martin Floeck had
also newly listed six lots in Frosttown, valued at $1,000 ($166 per lot).
On July 20, 1859, the Tri-Weekly Telegraph in Houston included a notice of Floeck and Brothers’ Brewery:
“The undersigned would respectfully inform the public generally that they have opened a Brewery and beer
saloon in the old Arsenal Building where thay [sic] will be happy to meet all whom may favor them with their
patronage. Ale and beer kept constantly on hand wholesale and retail. All orders from the country promptly
dispatched.” Martin Floeck was said to have served free beer to patrons on the opening night of his brewery,
and later that evening one of the guests accidentally turned over a lantern, causing the brewery to burn to the
ground (McAshan 1985).
On October 15, 1860, the Floeck family and brewery helpers were enumerated in the census as living in the
Second Ward: Martin Floeck, 32, M, Brewer, $10,000 in real estate, $5,000 in personal estate, Prussia; Anna
F. M., 27, Prussia; Katy, 8, F, Texas; William, 6, Texas; Charly (Charlie), 4, M, Texas; Robert, 1, M, Texas;
boarders: Francisco Rhode, 13, F, Prussia; Max Cunder, 31, M, Brewer, Prussia; Wenzel Chalupka, 19, M,
Brewer, Austria; Fred Koch, 30, M, Brewer, Prussia; and C. Long, 27, M, Brewer, Prussia (USBC-HC
1860:788-791).
The Harris County Products of Industry census (USBC-HC-PIS) for the year ending June 1, 1860, lists M.
Floeck with his brewing business as being operated by “Hand Power.” The census also notes that M. Floeck
had $2,000 invested capital; 1,800 B (barrels?) of malt valued at $2,250; 2,000 pounds of hops valued at
$400; and 150 C (cords?) of wood worth $600. According to the census, Floeck had only three employees at
the time, and the operation had an annual production of 700 B of beer valued at $7,000; 80 B of ale valued at
$1,200; 1,500 B of malt valued at $215; and $130 worth of yeast.
In 1863, Martin Floeck sold Lots 9 and 10 to Lawrence N. Daly for $3,500. In 1865, he sold Lot 8 to Ellen
Dunlop for $400. The Houston City Directory of 1866 lists a Martin Floeck, Brewer, as living on Maple
Street near Buffalo Bayou. Maple Street is at the foot of Jackson Street in the 1870 City Directory.
According to later volumes of the Houston City Directories, Floeck’s son, William, became a fireman, while
Charles became a policeman.
Andrew Dunlop Family
Andrew Dunlop and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-6, Lot 8, from 1865 until 1882.
Andrew Dunlop, a native of Scotland, was born about 1830. His wife, Mary Ellen O’Connor, was born in

65

Ireland. They were first-generation Texans, arriving in Texas between approximately 1857 and 1859.
Andrew and Ellen Dunlop raised a sizeable family, having seven children between 1857 and 1877.3
The Dunlops appeared to have been in Illinois before coming to Texas. Their first child, Elizabeth, was born
in that state in about 1857. The Dunlop’s second child, George, was born in Texas by 1859. Andrew, Jr. was
born about 1864, and another daughter, Nellie, was born in 1866. Jessie was born 1868, and a son,
Morris/Agnes, was born in 1870. The Andrew Dunlop family continued to grow, with a new son, John, born
on September 9, 1877 (USBC-HC 1880).
After settling in Houston, Andrew Dunlop began an extended career in the bakery and confectionery business.
He baked for the Confederate troops during the Civil War (Houston Post, 19 October 1956). Dunlop worked
in town with Bartholomew Tuffly, a confectioner from Switzerland, in October 1860 (USBC-HC 1860:718721).
The Dunlop’s initial purchase in Harris County was the purchase of Lot 8 in 1865 for $400. In the same year,
the Harris County Tax Records indicated that Lot 8 was valued at $1,000. The Houston City Directory of
1866 lists Andrew Dunlop with the firm of W. Guy and A. Dunlop, Bakers and Confectioners, located on
Congress Street, between Main and Travis streets. The 1866 Houston City Directory also includes Dunlop’s
advertisement: “Guy and Dunlop, Wholesale and Retail Dealers in Bakery and Confectionery. We also can
accommodate the public with the best Hot Coffee, Wines, Cigars, &c., &c. Congress street near Wiener’s
Auction Store.” The Harris County Tax Records of 1867 list Andrew Dunlop with Lot 8 retaining its value of
$1,000 and $100 in improvements.
The 1870 Houston City Directory lists Andrew Dunlop, Baker, as residing on Jackson Street, between Preston
and Prairie streets. In 1874, Dunlop was reported with Lot 8 having an increased worth of $1,200 (HCC-TR
1874). The 1877 Houston City Directory lists Andrew Dunlop, Grocer and Baker, on the east side of Jackson
Street, between Preston and Prairie streets, indicating his residence at the same address. The oldest son,
George Dunlop, still lived at his parents’ home at this time, and worked as a printer.
The Dunlops were enumerated in the census as living at 69 Jackson Street, between Preston and Prairie
streets, on June 24, 1880: Andrew Dunlop, 49, M, W, Baker, born in Scotland; Ellen, 43, F, W, House
Keeping, born in Ireland; George, 19, M, W, Printer, born in Texas; and Andrew, Jr., 16, M, W, Apprentice
Printer, born in Texas. Mary E. (Nellie), 14, F, W; Jessie, 12, F, W; Morris (Agnes), 9, M, W; and John, 2, M,
W, all born in Texas, are also listed (USBC-HC 1880:B:120).
Andrew Dunlop continued his career as a baker, and his sons, George and Andrew, Jr., lived with their
parents and worked in the printing business in 1880 and 1882. In 1880, George Dunlop was a printer for
Edward Smallwood, Book and Job Printer, Binder and Blank Book Manufacturer, at the southwest corner of
Congress and Fannin streets (Houston City Directory 1880). In 1882, George was still working as a printer,
and his brother, Andrew M. Dunlop, Jr., was working as a printer for William H. Coyle, Stationer, Printer,
Lithographer and Blank Book Manufacturer, 33 Main Street (Houston City Directory 1882).
The Dunlops sold Lot 8 in 1882, the same year that the Houston City Directory listed Andrew M. Dunlop, Sr.
with a bakery in Huntsville and a residence at 69 Jackson Street, between Preston and Prairie streets. Dunlop
died in Houston five years later, on November 15, 1887, at the age of 57.
One of Andrew M. Dunlop’s sons, John, was born in the Dunlop house on Jackson Street on September 9,
1877, five years before Andrew Dunlop sold the property. John Dunlop, the youngest of apparently 15
children, recounted his childhood days playing marbles in the Jackson Street house. John Dunlop became
3

The Dunlop couple apparently had a total of 15 children, five of whom may have been born and died between census
enumerations. John Dunlop, born in 1877, stated that he was the youngest of 15 children.

Houston’s postmaster on September 1, 1939, after an extended career in Houston’s postal service (Houston
Post, 19 October 1956; Houston Press, 31 July 1939).
Michael Curtin Family
The Michael Curtin family was associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-7, Lots 9, 10, and 11, from 1860 to
approximately 1882. Michael and Catherine Curtin, both natives of Ireland, had a son, Martin, born in
England in 1851. After this time, the Curtins emigrated to the United States, and two more sons were added
to the family: James, born in Louisiana in 1853, and Henry, born in Kentucky in 1854. Sometime between
1854 and 1860, the Curtin family made their way into Texas, and a daughter, Katie (Catherine) was born in
Texas in July 1860. Mary E. Curtin was added to the family in 1871.
The first land purchase in Harris County made by the Curtin family occurred in November 1860, when
Catherine Curtin bought from James W. Beatty, a master carpenter, Lot 11 in Block 117 for $300 (HCC-DR
1860:X:536). The 1860 census lists the Curtin family living in the Third Ward of Houston on October 20,
1860: M. Curtin, 32, M, Laborer, Ireland; Catherine, 32, F, Ireland; Martin, 9, M, Louisiana; James, 7, M,
Louisiana; Henry, 6, M, Louisiana; and Catherine, 3 months, F, Texas (USBC-HC 1860:1109).4
In 1866, the Harris County Tax Records reported Michael Curtin with Lot 11 valued at $1,000 and $100 in
improvements (HCC-TR 1866). Michael Curtin purchased L. N. Daly’s interest in Lots 9 and 10, with
improvements thereon, for $1,700 on October 31, 1866 (HCC-DR 1866:3:580). Harris County Deed Records
(1866) indicate one small improvement on Lot 11 and one large building on Lots 9 and 10, all of which were
assembled by the Curtins between 1860 and 1866.
According to the 1866 Houston City Directory, M. Curtin continued to work as a laborer and to reside on
Preston Street, between Jackson and Chenevert streets. In 1867, Michael Curtin was listed with Lots 9, 10,
and 11 in Block 117, valued together at $2,000 ($666 per lot) and $100 in improvements (HCC-TR 1867).
According to census records (USBC-HC 1870:76-81), the Curtin family continued to reside in Houston’s
Third Ward: Michael Curtin, 40, M, W, no occupation, born in Ireland; Catherine, 40, F, W, Keeping House,
born in Ireland. Sons, Martin, 18, an apprentice tanner, is listed as being born in England, while James, 16,
also an apprentice tanner, is noted as born in Louisiana. Henry Curtin, 14, attended school and is listed as
born in Kentucky, while Katie, 9, is noted as born in Texas. The 1870 Houston City Directory lists M. Curtin
residing on Jackson Street, between Preston and Prairie streets. The Harris County Tax Records of 1870
report that Lots 9, 10, and 11, owned by Michael Curtin, are valued at $400 per lot “and improvements”
(HCC-TR 1870).
The Harris County Tax Records of 1874 list Mrs. M. Curtin with Lots 8, 9, and 10 with an increased value of
$833 per lot. Michael Curtin’s wife, Catherine, died in Houston in May 1874, and in her will, dated April 13,
1874, she left her entire estate, real and personal, to her husband and children; the probate inventory lists Lots
9, 10, and 11 (HCC-PR 1874:C:143). Catherine Curtin’s son, Martin, was named executor of the estate.
On August 4, 1876, James H. Curtin and Michael Curtin deeded a two-thirds interest in Lot 9, with
improvements thereon, to Henry M. Curtin for $666 (HCC-DR 1876:15:852). One year later (August 11,
1877), Henry M. Curtin additionally purchased from Michael Curtin Lots 9, 10, and 11 “with improvements
thereon” for $740 (HCC-DR 1877:17:498). On August 9, 1876, Michael Curtin was remarried to Mrs. M. E.
Barnett in Harris County (HCC-MR 1876:426:7957). A few weeks later, on August 23, 1876, Michael’s son,
Martin Curtin, married Miss Alice M. J. Hurd in Harris County (HCC-MR 1876:429:7966).
4

Martin James and Henry Curtin were noted as born in Louisiana in the 1860 census, but the 1870 census notes different
birthplaces.

67

In 1877, Michael Curtin and his new bride, Mary, had a baby girl, Nettie. Another daughter, Maggie, was
born in September 1879. On March 18, 1878, James H. Curtin was in Montgomery County when he executed
a deed to Martin Curtin for Lots 10 and 11 for $100 (HCC-DR 1878:18:36). Brothers Martin and Henry M.
Curtin then gave a Quit Claim Deed to Michael and Mollie Curtin on Lot 11 in October 1879, and J. T. Wells
executed a Quit Claim Deed on all his interest in Lots 9, 10, and 11 to Michael, Katie and Henry M. Curtin in
March 1882 (HCC-DR 1879:10:145, 1882:24:230).
By 1880, Michael Curtin and second wife, Mary, and their family were enumerated as residing at 416 Preston
at Jackson Street on June 24, 1880: Michael Curtin, 48, M, W, Laborer, is listed as being from Ireland; Mary,
32, F, W, House Keeper; Mary E., 9, F, W; Nettie, 3, F, W; and Maggie, 9 months, F, W, are each noted as
born in Texas. Harry (Henry), 24, a bank clerk, was born in Louisiana (USBC-HC 1880:B:120).
The 1880 Houston City Directory indicates Michael Curtin worked at the I&GN Railroad and resided on the
east side of Jackson Street, between Preston and Prairie streets. Michael Curtin’s sons, Martin and Henry M.
Curtin, had a tinware business, M. Curtin and Company, at 17 Congress Street, between Main and Fannin
streets. Henry M. Curtin also worked as a bookkeeper for Houston Savings Bank and boarded at the Barnes
House on the northwest corner of Main and Texas streets. The Curtin brothers’ company dealt in stoves,
tinware, tin, copper, and sheet-iron work. James H. Curtin, another son of Michael Curtin, worked with his
brothers as a tinsmith at M. Curtin and Company.
The Houston City Directory of 1882 lists Michael Curtin as a laborer residing at 416 Preston Street, between
Jackson and Chenevert streets. Henry M. Curtin (M. Curtin and Company), a teller at Houston Savings Bank,
is listed as living in the home of his father, Michael Curtin. The 1882 directory also indicates that M. Curtin
and Company (Martin and Henry Curtin), who were contractors of tin, shell, gravel, and sheet-iron roofing,
were located at 54 Fannin Street. In 1882, the Harris County Tax Records reported that H. (Henry) Curtin
was paying taxes on Lots 9, 10, and 11 in Block 117, valued at $2,000, as well as on Lot 3 and part of Lot 4,
Block 13, worth $1,500.
Although Henry M. Curtin continued to report the lots in the Harris County Tax Records through 1899, Hugh
Warwick bought Lot 10 from Katie Curtin for $1,000 in March 1882. At the same time, he also bought Lot 9,
with improvements, from Henry M. Curtin for $1,250 in notes (HCC-DR 1882:24:223-224).
While Michael Curtin and his family were associated with Lots 9, 10, and 11, from 1860 to 1882, he was
involved with a handful of additional land transactions. His first activity noted in the Harris County Deed
Records occurred in September 1864, when he secured “10,000 square feet beginning [on the] north side of
Shaw Street” (HCC-DR 1864:1:528). Curtin also appeared to be involved with buying and selling part lots in
Block 196 during 1877.
Louis Harde Family
Louis Harde and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-3, Lot 3, and Parcel 117-4, Lot 4,
from 1859 until approximately 1890. Louis Harde was a first-generation Texan, an immigrant to Texas in the
1850s from Oldenburg, Germany. He settled in Harris County in 1859, shortly after he married Emma
Cabanis in Galveston County on July 28, 1858 (HCC-MR 1858:508).
Louis Harde’s first land purchase in Harris County was made in August 1859, when he bought Lot 3, with
improvements, and Lot 4 in Block 117 (HCC-DR 1859:V:663, 664). Following purchase of Lots 3 and 4, the
Hardes had a daughter, Ella, in 1860. While in Houston, Louis Harde first became a dealer in the dry goods
and grocery business in 1866, clerking at T. W. House’s Dry Goods and Grocery located on Main Street,
between Franklin and Congress streets (Houston City Directory 1866).

68

A second child, William, was born to Louis and Emma Harde in 1866. In the 1867 Harris County Tax
Records, Louis Harde was reported with Lots 3 and 4, valued at $1,000 per lot. The tax rolls list Harde’s Lots
3 and 4 with improvements holding the $1,000-per-lot value.
Harde continued to deal in groceries, listed in the 1870-1871 Houston City Directory as a wholesale and retail
grocer and commission merchant at 33 Main Street. He resided on Chenevert Street, between Preston and
Prairie streets. The directory also indicates that Harde was vice president of the Houston Turnverein that year
(1870-1871).5 Harde appears to have been previously involved with the group, since the Harris County Deed
Records for 1862 reflect a power-of-attorney secured by Louis Harde from the Turnverein Association (HCCDR 1862:Z:71).
The Harde family and others were enumerated in the census on July 2, 1870, as living in the Third Ward of
Houston: Louis Hardy, 39, M, W, Wholesale Grocer, born in Oldenburg; Emma, 32, F, W, Keeping House,
born in Sicily; Ella, 10, F, W, Attends School, born in Texas; William, 4, M, W, At Home, born in Texas;
Agnes Rower, 27, F, W, no occupation, born in Sicily; Ameil Rower, 7, M, W, At Home, born in Texas;
William Rower, 4, M, W, At Home, born in Texas; and Agnes Donden, 18, F, W, Domestic Servant, born in
Saxony (USBC-HC 1870:69-74).
In 1874, the Harris County Tax Records listed Louis Harde as owning Lots 3 and 4, valued at $1,250 per lot.
Harde also reported eight or nine lots in Block 440 on the south side of Buffalo Bayou, valued together at
$400. According to the 1877, 1880, and 1882 Houston City Directories and the 1880 census, Louis Harde
appeared to move from Lots 3 and 4 and was possibly renting a place in the neighborhood. The Harris
County Deed Records and the 1882 Tax Records, however, continue to reflect Harde’s ownership of these
lots.
During 1877, Louis Harde appeared to change occupations, becoming a cotton commission merchant and a
state agent for the American Powder Company at the southwest corner of Main and Commerce streets. His
residence at the time is listed on the southwest corner of Congress and Hamilton streets (Houston City
Directory 1877).
On November 12, 1878, Louis Harde’s daughter, Ella, married Emile Blaffer in Harris County (HCC-MR
1878:145:9542). Emile Blaffer of Blaffer and Company was a soap manufacturer, a commission and
forwarding merchant, and a dealer in grain, hops, malt, and brewers’ and distillers’ supplies on the west side
of Fannin Street, between Preston and Congress streets (Houston City Directory 1880).
By 1880, Louis Harde went into business with a neighbor, Samuel L. Gohlman, as Gohlman and Harde,
Cotton and Commission Merchants, at 26 West side Main Street, between Commerce and Franklin streets.
His residence at the time was on the southwest corner of Congress and Hamilton streets (Houston City
Directory 1880).
Harde and his family were enumerated in the census on June 26, 1880, at 256 Congress at Hamilton Street:
Louis Harde, 58, M, W, Commission Merchant, born in Prussia; Emma, 42, F, W, Housekeeping, born in
Sicily; William, 14, M, W, At Home, born in Texas; and House Servant Robert Scott, 21, M, B, born in Texas
(USBC-HC 1880:B:129). By 1882, Harde had gained a new partner, David L. Campbell, and the business
was known as L. Harde and Company, remaining cotton factors and general commission merchants at 29
Commerce Street, between Main and Travis streets (Houston City Directory 1882).
5

The Turnerverein was an athletic and intellectual organization founded by a group of German immigrants in 1854
(Harris County Historical Society 1942:305). The group sent companies of volunteers for the Civil War. The
Turnerverein also organized the first Volksfest celebration in Texas in 1869.

69

According to the 1882 Harris County Tax Records, Louis Harde paid taxes on Lots 3, 4, and 5 in Block 117,
the lots having a combined value of $2,000 ($666 per lot). According to the tax rolls, Harde did not have
other property at that time. However, Harde had bought the adjacent Lot 5, Block 117, from F. A. Schmidt in
August 1875 (HCC-DR 1875:14:582).
During Louis Harde’s ownership of Lots 3 and 4, from 1859 to about 1890, he was involved with buying and
selling other property in Harris County. His next land purchase in the county did not occur until May 1888
when he bought two lots in Block 25, Chapman’s Second Addition (HCC-DR 1888:40:631).
Joseph Mueller Family
Joseph Mueller (sometimes spelled Miller or Muller) and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel
117-4a, Lot 5, Parcel 117-3, Lot 3, and Parcel 117-4, Lot 4, between 1848 and 1856. Joseph Mueller and his
family possibly arrived in Texas during the mid 1840s, with Joseph Mueller making his first and only
purchase in Harris County on April 17, 1848, when he secured from James Wells, Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in
Block 117 (HCC-DR 1848:M:587). Six months later, on October 2, 1848, Joseph sold the same lots and “all
the building materials now upon the premises” to Francis Anthony Mueller (HCC-DR 1848:N:75). Six
months prior to the sale, Francis Antonio Miller married Catharine Phillipine Hilge, a native of Germany, on
February 14, 1848, in Harris County (HCC-MR 1848:66).
Joseph Mueller was deceased by January 1849, as recorded in a deed dated January 13, 1849, whereby
Francis Anthony Mueller conveyed Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the widow Florine Mueller (HCC-DR
1849:O:137). The family does not appear to have filed probate papers for Mr. Mueller. Widow Florine
Mueller was enumerated on the census on September 3, 1850: Florian (Florine) Miller, 46, F, $100, born in
France; and Isidore, 17, M, Blacksmith, born in France (USBC-HC 1850:63). Francis Anthony Mueller was
also reported on the census on September 19, 1850, with his wife and baby son: Antone F. Miller, 32, M,
Cooper, born in Germany; Catrine, 27, F, born in Germany; and John F., 1, M, born in Texas (USBC-HC
1850:312).
On December 30, 1854, Florine Miller deeded Lots 1, 2, and 3, with improvements, to her son, Isidore Miller
(HCC-DR 1854:R:417), who had married in the previous year on March 12, 1853, to Elizabeth Plessman
(HCC-MR 1853:420). Isidore sold Lots 1, 2, and 3 in November 1855, and sold Lot 4 in December 1855
(HCC-DR 1855:P:591-594). Isidore Mueller, heir of Florine Mueller (deceased by 1856), retained Lot 5 until
February 23, 1856. At this time, he transferred it to Elizabeth Mueller “for the consideration of care and
assistance shown to said Florine Mueller, my mother, in her last sickness by Elizabeth Miller and at the
special request of my mother before her death” (HCC-DR 1856:S:257).
Apparently, the estate of the Muellers was probated in New Orleans, Louisiana. On August 25, 1856, Isidore
Mueller, still residing in Harris County, reacquired Lot 5 for $100 from Josephine Brun (née Muller) and her
husband, Lawrence Brun, of New Orleans, Louisiana. The transaction was made by the Brun’s attorney, S.
Brown, as the final settlement of the estate of the deceased Florine Mueller, with Isidore Mueller and
Josephine Mueller Brun being the sole heirs (HCC-DR 1856:P:675). Isidore Mueller sold Lot 5 to F.W.
Schoeverling for $50 with a vendor’s lien on December 18, 1856 (HCC-DR 1856:P:724). The Mueller family
did not appear to buy or sell any other property in Harris County.
Frederick W. Schoeverling
Frederick W. Schoeverling and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-4a, Lot 5, for two
years, between December 1856 and December 1858. Frederick Schoeverling, a native of Westphalia,
Germany, arrived in Texas in about 1847; his first purchase in Harris County occurred on April 5, 1847, when
he bought lots in the neighborhood on Block 163 (across Chenevert Street, to the east of Block 117) (HCCDR 1847:N:253).

70

Frederick Schoeverling worked as a carpenter during his life in Houston. On December 16, 1847, Frederich
Wilhelm Schoeverling married Maria Catharina Munning (known as Caroline), a native of Prussia (HCC-MR
1847:52). He and his family were enumerated in the census on November 1, 1850 as: Fredk. Schererling
(Schoeverling), 29, M, Carpenter, $300, Germany; Caroline, 19, F, Germany; and Anna Stoppell, 10, F,
Germany (USBC-HC 1850:404).
By the time Frederick Schoeverling bought Lot 5 on December 18, 1856 (HCC-DR 1856:P:724), the
Schoeverling family had two children: daughter Caroline, born in 1852, and son Julius, born in 1855.
Another daughter, Annie Schoeverling, was born during 1858. Frederick Schoeverling owned Lot 5 until
December 15, 1858, when he sold it with improvements to Otto Trautvetter for $200 (HCC-DR 1858:U:576).
The Schoeverling family did not appear to buy or sell any other property in Harris County within their twoyear ownership of Lot 5. The family, however, remained in the immediate neighborhood on Block 163, as
reflected in the Harris County Deed Records.
Otto Trautvetter
Otto Trautvetter was associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-4a, Lot 5, between 1858 and 1860. Otto
Trautvetter was in Harris County with his three sisters before 1849. Trautvetter’s parents, Theodor and
Antonetta Trautvetter, were possibly deceased in January 1849, as R. A. Hanks, a Harris County citizen and
carriage maker, applied for the guardianship of the minor Trautvetter children (HCC-PR 1849:T:54). Otto’s
sister, Emma, later married John W. Stansfield in 1856. Otto Trautvetter (spelled Troutweller in the census)
and his sisters were enumerated on October 28, 1850, at R. A. Hanks’ household in Harris County: Otto
Trautvetter, 18, M, Carpenter, Germany; Emma Trautvetter, 12, F, Germany; Anna Trautvetter, 10, F,
Germany; Antonia Trautvetter, 9, F, Germany; reported with R. A. Hanks, 48, M, Carriage Maker, $700,
Kentucky; Theresa Hanks, 50, F, Germany; Matilda Erhardt, 12, F, New Jersey; and Peter Erhardt, 10, M,
Texas (USBC-HC 1850:368).
Trautvetter, a native of Germany, received a grant for citizenship in Harris County on December 29, 1854
(Harris County District Court Minutes, Eleventh Judicial District 1854:G:383). On December 15, 1858, Otto
Trautvetter, then about age 25, made his first purchase in Harris County when he bought Lot 5 in Block 117
from Frederick Schoeverling (HCC-DR 1858:U:576). Otto Trautvetter, like Frederick Schoeverling, made his
living as a carpenter in Houston.
One month before Trautvetter sold Lot 5, he was enumerated in the census on October 10, 1860, as residing at
H. Schulte’s household, a brewer from Prussia: Otto Trautvetter, 24, M, Carpenter, $1,500 in real estate and
$150 in personal estate, born in Saxony (USBC-HC 1860:706-710). On November 15, 1860, Otto Trautvetter
sold Lot 5 to Henry Fox (HCC-DR 1860:X:533).
On the same day Trautvetter sold Lot 5, he bought from Henry Fox two and one-half lots in Block 126 on the
south side of Buffalo Bayou (HCC-DR 1860:Y:489). However, Trautvetter possibly left Harris County by
1866, as he is not listed in the 1866 Houston City Directory. Trautvetter also had secured a patent for 320
acres in McCullough County from the State of Texas in 1859. The patent was filed for record in 1867, about
the time he disappeared from Harris County (HCC-DR 1867:5:339).
Henry S. Fox Family
Henry S. Fox and his family were associated with Block 117, Parcel 117-4a, Lot 5, between 1860 and 1869.
Henry S. Fox was born about 1833 in Prussia. He was in Harris County by 1857, purchasing a lot in Houston
and 320 acres in Bell County, Texas (HCC-DR 1857:T:296).
Henry Fox became a merchant and dealer in dry goods in Houston. He was first married to Elizabeth
Gohlman on December 8, 1857 (HCC-MR 1857:C:447). The October 19, 1860, census listed Henry and

71

Elizabeth as living in the Third Ward: H. Fox, 27, M, Merchant, $500 in real estate, $12,000 in personal
estate, born in Prussia; Elisabeth, 18, F, born in Mississippi; A. Fox, 16, M, Clerk, born in Prussia; and
Pauline Fox, 18, F, born in Prussia (USBC-HC 1860:974).
Two months after the Fox family were enumerated on the 1860 census, Henry Fox secured a warranty deed
for Lot 5 from Otto Trautvetter on November 15 (HCC-DR 1860:X:533). The second marriage of Henry Fox
was to Melina (Lena) Gohlman on October 20, 1863 (HCC-DR 1863:D:398). Three years later, in 1866, the
first Houston City Directory lists H. S. Fox, Dealer in Dry Goods, as residing on Chenevert Street, between
Preston and Prairie streets. Henry and Lena Fox had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1868. On January 25, 1869,
Henry Fox and his wife, Lena, sold Lot 5 and improvements for $2,100 to Julia Stansfield of Galveston
County (HCC-DR 1869:10:3).
A year after the sale, Fox moved his family back to the Third Ward where they were enumerated in the census
on July 15, 1870. According to the census, Henry Fox, 37, had become a wholesale iron merchant; his wife,
Lena, a native Texan, was 24 years old and keeping house; daughter Elizabeth was two years old, and a new
month-old baby, Mary Ann, had been added to the Fox family. Also enumerated with the Fox family in 1870
were domestic servants Minerva Kile, 27, F, B, from Georgia; Clare Alexander, 18, F, M, from Mississippi;
Francis Phillip, 13, F, B, (Attends School), from Georgia; Sallie Jones, 22, F, B, from New York; and Johnny
Jones, 2, M, B, born in Texas (USBC-HC 1870:453-462).
While Henry Fox owned Lot 5, he also bought other property in Harris County. In November 1861, Fox
bought half of Block 467 on the south side of Buffalo Bayou, which he partitioned in March 1866 (HCC-DR
1861:Y:532, 1866:2:432). In July 1863, he bought part of Lots 2 and 12 in Block 20 in downtown Houston
(HCC-DR 1863:1:196, 3:351). During August 1867, Fox secured two acres in the Harris and Wilson two
leagues of land (sold in 1870B1871), and in November 1867, he bought property out of the Samuel Harris
Survey (HCC-DR 1867:5:426, 475, 188/480, 9b/255). In August 1869, H.S. Fox bought half of Block 296 on
the south side of Buffalo Bayou, and sold the same in February 1872 (HCC-DR 1869:7:600, 10:264). After
selling Lot 5, Block 117, the first purchase Fox appears to have made was for three lots in Block 46 and two
lots in Block 12, on December 15, 1871 (HCC-DR 1871:10:137). On May 15, 1874, Henry S. Fox was
named one of the directors of the Board of Trade and Cotton Exchange, organized in the parlor of the
Hutchins House (Harris County Historical Society 1942:259).
More than 20 years after Henry Fox and his wife sold Lot 5, Block 117, J. Arthur Tempest, a Houston
architect, built a house for the family at 1206 Main Street (Houghton et al. 1991:93, 157). The grand house,
built between 1892 and 1893 next to the Van Alstyne house, was described as a chateau, symmetrical, with
shingle and wooden blocks. Family history has it that after Fox died, his son moved the house back from the
street and reoriented it to face 906 Dallas Avenue. Lanoma Apartments were built in the back yard, and Fox
Apartments were built on the original Main Street home site. The Fox house was a rooming house until
demolition in 1927 (Houghton et al. 1991:93, 157).
FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK 118
Peter W. Gray Family
Peter W. Gray and his wife were associated with Block 118, Parcel 118-4, Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8 and
12 between 1850 and 1866. Peter W. Gray owned all of Block 118 from 1850 to 1866. He was the first of six
children of William Fairfax Gray and Mildred Richards Stone Gray, and was born on December 12, 1819, in
Fredericksburg, Virginia.
The Gray family arrived in Galveston on December 24, 1838, after William F. Gray had visited Texas in early
1836 and attended a convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836. In the last few years of his
life, William F. Gray devoted much of his time to the founding of Christ Church, the first Episcopal church
established in Houston. William and his son, Peter, were both charter members of the church in 1839.

72

William F. Gray died in Galveston on April 16, 1841, and his wife Mildred on July 1, 1851. They were
buried in the Episcopal cemetery, although they have since been reburied in Glenwood Cemetery in Houston,
as have most of the Gray family members.
Peter W. Gray would become one of Houston’s most prominent attorneys. After the death of his father in
1841, Peter replaced him as the district attorney for Houston on September 18, 1841, and in the same year he
was elected alderman for the Third Ward. Peter was elected to the First State Legislature in 1846, to the State
Senate in 1854, and was named district judge for Southeast Texas until the Civil War. Peter Gray was also a
chosen delegate to the Secession Convention in 1861, and was elected as a representative to the Confederate
Congress. Peter served in the House of the Confederate States Congress from 1861 to 1865, and he was a
volunteer aide for the staff of General A. B. MacGruder at the Battle of Galveston during 1863 (Rosenberg
Library Press 1967).
On January 25, 1843, Peter W. Gray married Abbey Jane Avery, a native of Connecticut, in Harris County
(HCC-MR 1843:A:260). The couple had no children. On September 19, 1850, Peter W. Gray was listed on
the Harris County Slave Census as owning a 42-year-old Black male. The Grays were enumerated in the
census on November 1, 1850: Peter W. Gray, 31, M, Lawyer, $10,000, born in Virginia; Jane, 27, F, born in
Connecticut; and Milly R. Gray, 45, F, born in Virginia (USBC-HC 1850:398).
One week after the census was taken, on November 8, 1850, Peter bought Block 118 and two other town
blocks and lots (HCC-DR 1850:P:309). Then, during his time as district judge, Peter Gray sold the southwest
corner of Block 118 (Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8 and 12) to his brother, Edwin F. Gray, on August 24,
1858 (HCC-DR 1858:U:348). Peter sold other lots in Block 118 on the same day to his sisters and their
families. Less than a decade later, Peter W. Gray sold the northwest corner lots in Block 118 to his brother,
Allen Charles Gray, on April 25, 1866 (HCC-DR 1866:2:600). The Houston City Directory for 1866 lists P.
W. Gray with the firm of Gray and Botts, Attorneys at Law, who were located on Fannin Street, between
Labranch and Crawford streets. A. C. Gray was with the firm of Gray, Strickland and Company, Book and
Job Printers, Bookbinders and Blank Book Manufacturers, in Kennedy’s Building located on the corner of
Travis and Congress streets. His residence was opposite the courthouse, on Fannin Street, between Congress
and Preston streets.
Edwin Fairfax Gray Family
Edwin F. Gray and his family were associated with Block 118, Parcel 118-4, Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8
and 12 between 1858 and 1863. Edwin F. Gray, another son of William Fairfax Gray, was born on March 15,
1829, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Edwin came to Texas with his family in 1838, and in 1841, the year of his
father’s death, Edwin was appointed as midshipman in the Texas Navy at the age of 12. He participated in
the Tampico and Campeche expeditions on the flagship, Austin. At the age of 17, Edwin F. Gray was
appointed as midshipman in the United States Navy on April 18, 1846, and he went on to serve for more than
10 years. On September 15 and 16, 1855, E. F. Gray was promoted to master and lieutenant. He married
Rosalie Woodburn Taylor, a native of South Carolina and daughter of Captain E. W. Taylor, in Harris County
on June 8, 1857 (HCC-MR 1857:C:396). Less than six months later, on December 29, 1857, he resigned
from U.S. Navy commission (Rosenberg Library Press 1967:xiii). On September 6, 1858, Edwin F. Gray was
appointed as the state engineer of Texas (Rosenberg Library Press 1967:xiv).
On August 24, 1858, Edwin F. Gray bought the southwest corner of Block 118 (Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots
8 and 12) from his brother, Peter Gray (HCC-DR 1858:U:348). Within the following year, a son, William
Fairfax Gray, was born to Edwin and Rosalie. On October 6, 1860, the Harris County Slave Census listed E.
F. Gray with a 55-year-old Black male. The Gray couple and their baby son were enumerated in the census
on October 29, 1860: E. F. Gray, 31, M, Civil Engineer, $5,000 in real estate, $2,000 in personal estate, born
in Virginia; Rosella (Rosalie) W., 22, F, born in South Carolina; and William F., 1, M, born in Texas (USBCHC 1860:1132).

73

During 1860, Edwin F. Gray served as secretary of the Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway Company. A
daughter, Blanche Cora Gray, was born to the Grays on March 25, 1862. On November 17, 1863, five years
after the purchase, Edwin F. Gray sold the southwest corner of Block 118 to S. Kottwitz (HCC-DR
1863:1:300). Edwin F. Gray was later in the Confederate Service with the Fourth Texas Infantry throughout
the Civil War and was promoted to lieutenant colonel (Rosenberg Library Press 1967:xiv).
Allen Charles Gray Family
Allen Charles Gray and his family were associated with Block 118, Parcel 118-3, Lots 9 and 10 and part of
Lots 8 and 11 from 1866 to ca. 1900. A. C. Gray, the third son of William F. Gray, was born on October 3,
1830, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. A. C. arrived in Texas in 1838 with the rest of the Gray family, and later
established a well-known book printing and binding business in Houston. However, in 1855 at the age of 25,
Allen Charles Gray was working as a printer for The Times newspaper in Louisville, Kentucky (Rosenberg
Library Press 1967). He married Amanda Ellen Bostick, a native of Maysville, Kentucky, on January 25,
1855, in Louisville (Jefferson County, Kentucky-Marriage Records 1855:6:94). A. C.’s new bride, Amanda,
had been previously married and brought three children from her first marriage. By December 19, 1855, A.
C. Gray and his wife had their own baby girl, Fanny Doswell Gray, who was born in Kentucky.
One of A. C. Gray’s stepdaughters, Ellen Burkhead, died on November 4, 1858, in Louisville, and Gray took
his wife and family to New Orleans, Louisiana. The family had moved to Harris County by 1861. A son,
Ebenezer Nichols Gray, was born in Harris County on July 13, 1861. From 1861 to 1865, A. C. Gray was a
Confederate government printer and was appointed by then Texas Governor Richard Coke to reestablish the
state printing operations (Rosenberg Library Press 1967:xiv).
The 1866 Houston City Directory lists Allen Charles Gray with the firm of Gray, Strickland and Company,
Book and Job Printers, Bookbinders and Blank Book Manufacturers, Kennedy’s Building, located on the
corner of Travis and Congress streets. A. C. Gray’s residence was opposite the courthouse on Fannin Street,
between Congress and Preston streets. This was the original residence of his father, William F. Gray.
On April 25, 1866, A. C. Gray bought the northwest corner lots in Block 118 from his brother, Peter W. Gray,
and moved his family to the block on the corner of Jackson and Prairie streets (HCC-DR 1866:2:600). A. C.
Gray’s son, Ebenezer N., would later recall that their house was moved in 1867 to the corner of Prairie and
Jackson streets. In 1870, the Houston City Directory listed A. C. Gray (A. C. Gray and Company), Job
Printing and Bookbinding, on the corner of Congress and Travis streets. His residence was on the corner of
Jackson and Prairie streets. A. C. Gray and family were enumerated in the census on July 6, 1870: Allen C.
Gray, 39, M, W, Printer, born in Virginia; Amanda, 39, F, W, Housekeeping, born in Kentucky; John W.
Burkhead, 23, M, W, Bank Clerk, born in Missouri; Jennie Burkhead, 17, F, W, born in Kentucky; Fannie
Gray, 14, F, W, born in Kentucky; Edwin (Ebenezer) Gray, 8, M, W, born in Texas; and Mary Collins, 27, F,
W, born in Mississippi (USBC-HC 1870:144-148).
A. C. Gray was the owner and editor of the Houston Telegraph in 1873 (Rosenberg Library Press 1967:xiv).
His daughter, Fanny Gray, married Edwin Theodore Dumble, son of James F. Dumble, in Harris County on
June 15, 1876 (HCC-MR 1876:412:5919). According to the 1877 Houston City Directory, A. C. Gray
remained in the printing business, living on the corner of Prairie and Jackson streets. His son, Ebenezer, lived
at home and worked as a clerk for the Houston and Texas Central Railroad Company (H&TC).
E. T. Dumble moved in to his new bride’s family home; he was enumerated in the 1880 census as living with
A. C. Gray at 242 Prairie Street: A. C. Gray, 49, M, W, Editor of The Telegram, born in Virginia; Amanda,
49, F, W, Housekeeping, born in Kentucky; John (Birkhead), 33, M, W, Traveling Salesman, born in
Missouri; Jennie (Birkhead), 26, F, W, Assistant Housekeeper, born in Kentucky; Ed (Eb.), 18, M, W,
Railroad Clerk, born in Texas; E.T. Dumble, 28, M, W, son-in-law, Railroad Clerk, born in Indiana; Amanda
Dumble, 24, F, W, born in Kentucky; Millie Dumble, 3, F, W, granddaughter, born in Texas; and two Black

74

servants: Kate Watson, 22, Cook, born in Texas; and James Watson, 22, Laborer, born in Maine (USBC-HC
1880:617).
The 1880 Houston City Directory lists A. C. Gray as the Business Manager, Secretary, and Treasurer of the
Houston Telegram, with his residence located on the southeast corner of Prairie and Jackson streets. His son,
Eb. N., was listed at his parents’ home and still clerked at H&TC. By 1882, A. C. Gray went into business
with a partner, Ed. Smallwood, Smallwood and Gray, Book and Job Printers, Bookbinders and Rulers, located
at 103 Congress Street. His residence at this time was 242 Prairie Street, on the corner of Jackson Street
(Houston City Directory 1882). The directory also indicates that Eb. N. still resided at father’s home, where
he is listed as a medical student.
On January 17, 1889, A. C. and Amanda Gray’s son, Dr. Ebenezer N. Gray, married Theodosia May Cage,
and they later adopted a son, Gordon Gray. After E. N. Gray graduated from Jefferson Medical College in
Philadelphia in 1893, he returned to Houston to practice medicine for 57 years, and was involved in numerous
organizations and society groups.
Samuel and Mary Jacobs Family
Samuel and Mary Jacobs were associated with Block 118, Parcel 118-4, Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8 and
12 between 1865 and 1882. Samuel Jacobs, born in Prussia, and his wife, Mary, a native of New York, were
in Louisiana prior to coming to Texas as their daughter, Fannie, was born in Louisiana about 1852.
Samuel and Mary Jacobs arrived in Texas by 1854, the year in which another daughter, Nannie, was born into
the Jacobs’ family. Samuel Jacobs supported his growing family as a tailor in Houston and Galveston. The
Jacobs added three sons, Isaac, Benjamin, and Solomon, to the family between 1856 and 1859. Mary Jacobs
bought the lots comprising the southwest quarter of Block 118, Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8 and 12, for
$3,000 on February 25, 1865, when the children were between the ages of 6 and 12 years old (HCC-DR
1865:2:229). The purchase of the lots appears to be the only land transaction made by the Jacobs couple in
Harris County.
The large Jacobs family was enumerated in the census on July 6, 1870 as living in Houston’s Third Ward:
Samuel Jacobs, 49, M, W, Tailor, born in Prussia; Mary, 47, F, W, Keeping House, born in New York; Fanny,
17, F, W, At Home, born in Louisiana; Nannie, 15, F, W, At Home, born in Texas; Isaac, 13, M, W, Attends
School, born in Texas; Benjamin, 12, M, W, Attends School, born in Texas; and Solomon, 11, M, W, Attends
School, born in Texas (USBC-HC 1870:147-151).
The 1866 and 1870 Houston City Directories list S. Jacobs as a clothier located on Main Street at Congress;
Mrs. M. Jacobs list their residence in 1870 on the corner of Texas Avenue and Jackson Street. The 1869
Wood map indicates the home of S. Jacobs on the southwest quarter of Block 118. On December 27, 1871,
both of the Jacobs’ daughters were married in Harris County. Miss Fannie Jacobs married Edward
Moskowitz, and Miss Nannie Jacobs married Emanuel Raphael, a native of England who was working as a
clerk for the H&TC Railroad (HCC-MR 1871:396:3902, 392:3885; USBC-HC 1870:238-244).
Samuel Jacobs, although listing his residence at the corner of Jackson and Texas streets, was conducting his
business as merchant tailor in the City of Galveston (Houston City Directory 1877). The directory
additionally lists Buck (Isaac) Jacobs living at Samuel Jacobs’ home and working as a salesman for A. Harris
and Bro. (Adolph and Jacob Harris), who dealt in wholesale and dry goods, boots, shoes, hats, caps, and gents
furnishing goods at 35 Main Street on the corner of Franklin Street.
Samuel Jacobs does not appear to have been at home when the census taker enumerated the Jacobs’
household at 261 Texas Avenue on June 22, 1880: Mary Jacobs, 45, F, W, (nativity not noted); Solomon, 21,
M, W, Dry Goods Clerk, born in Texas; Vina Kinnly, 18, F, Mu, House Servant, born in Louisiana; John

75

Lockhart, 12, M, B, At Home, born in Texas; and Celia Kinnly, 25, F, Mu, Domestic Servant, born in
Louisiana (USBC-HC 1880:A:114). The Houston City Directory for 1880 lists Samuel Jacobs’ residence on
the northeast corner of Jackson Street and Texas Avenue. Buck Jacobs, a salesman, and Solomon Jacobs, an
entry clerk, are noted as working at A. Harris and Bro. on the northeast corner of Main and Franklin streets.
Both Jacobs brothers boarded at their parents’ home.
In 1882, Samuel Jacobs continued his work in the tailoring business. The Houston City Directory lists
Samuel Jacobs as a merchant tailor at 263 Preston Street, with a residence at 261 Texas Avenue, on the corner
of Jackson Street. According to the directory, Samuel’s sons still lived at home. Buck (Isaac) was a traveling
salesman for Greenleve, Block and Company, whose sample room was located at 55 Main Street. Ben was
working as a clerk at S. Jacobs’ tailoring shop. Solomon found work as a drummer that year.
Samuel and Mary Jacobs lived on the corner of Texas and Jackson streets until August 9, 1882, when they
sold Lots 6 and 7 and part of Lots 8 and 12 to their son, Solomon Jacobs, for $5 with “love and affection”
(HCC-DR 1882:25:48). Solomon also secured a deed for part of Lot 8 for $50 from his parents in the
following year, on October 6, 1883 (HCC-DR 1883:28:265). One year later, on November 27, 1884,
Solomon Jacobs sold the same lots for $1,375 to his older sister, Fannie Moskowitz (née Jacobs), to be her
separate property (HCC-DR 1884:31:27). Fannie and Edward Moskowitz held the lots for approximately two
years, selling in 1886.
FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK 162
William Cohen Family
William Cohen (sometimes spelled Cohn) and his large family were associated with Block 162, Parcel 162-1,
Lot 10, from 1862 until 1898. William Cohen and his wife, Teresa, both natives of Prussia, appeared to have
been in the United States by 1852, as their sons, Isaac and Solomon, were born about 1852-1853 in Louisiana.
Rebecca and Adolph were born in 1856 and 1858, respectively, in Missouri; and Coleman was born about
1860 in Mississippi.
The Cohens possibly arrived in Texas by 1861, as another son, Joseph, was born in the state about 1861, the
family thereby becoming first-generation Texans. The Cohens’ first purchase in Harris County occurred
when they bought Lot 10 on June 2, 1862 (HCC-DR 1862:Z:95). The Cohen family at that time had five
children ranging in age from one to nine years old. William Cohen established a career in the tailoring
business during his life in Houston.
Once the Cohens settled into their new home in Houston, they became associated with the Hebrew
synagogue, Beth Israel. The Hebrew Congregation of Houston was chartered by the State Legislature soon
after its organization, on December 28, 1859. During 1866, the congregation held 56 members, with William
Cohen serving as one of the trustees (Houston City Directory 1866). By 1866, William Cohen had
established his tailoring business, with the city directory that year listing W. Cohen of the firm of Cohen and
Sigle (Isaac Sigle), Merchant Tailors, on Main Street, between Preston and Prairie streets, with his residence
on the corner of Prairie and Chenevert streets.
Benny Cohen, son of William and Teresa, came into the family about 1866, and another son, Herman, arrived
about December 1869. The 1869 Wood map shows the Cohen home on Lot 10. On June 16, 1869, the
Hebrew temple cornerstone was laid during ceremonies led by the Grand Lodge of Masons and Reverend
Jacobs of New Orleans, the “New building being erected corner of Franklin and Crawford streets” (Houston
City Directory 1870).
The Cohens and their eight children were enumerated in the census as living in the Third Ward on July 6,
1870: William Cohen, 46, M, W, Tailor, born in Prussia; Teresa, 44, F, W, Keeping House, born in Prussia;
Isaac, 18, M, W, Clerk in Store, born in Louisiana; Solomon, 17, M, W, Clerk in Auction, born in Louisiana;

76

Adolph, 12, M, W, At Home, born in Missouri; Rebecca, 14, F, W, At Home, born in Missouri; Coleman, 10,
M, W, Attends School, born in Mississippi; Joseph, 9, M, W, Attends School, born in Texas; Benny, 4, M, W,
At Home, born in Texas; and Herman, 8 months, M, W, born in Texas (USBC-HC 1870:145-149).
According to the 1870 Houston City Directory, Cohen had a new tailoring partner, the firm being known as
Cohen and Backstrum, Merchant Tailors, 42 Main Street, with his residence on the corner of Prairie and
Chenevert streets. Cohen’s partner was Andrew Buckstrum. Cohen’s tailoring business was reported on the
Products of Industry Schedule (USBC-HC 1870:151-154) in Houston for the year ending June 1, 1870: Cohen
and Buckstrum, Merchant Tailors, $2,000 capital invested, hand power, two sewing machines, two males
employees over age 14; materials included an unknown amount of “cloths of all kind” valued at $1,300, and
production of $4,240 worth of a variety of clothing.
The Cohen’s oldest daughter, Rebecca, married J. Bernstein in Harris County on January 19, 1876 (HCC-MR
1876:368:5087). William Cohen died in Houston later that same year, on November 3, 1876, and the family
buried him in Beth Israel Cemetery (Teter 1997). Jacob Bernstein, like Rebecca’s father, made his living as a
merchant tailor. The 1877 Houston City Directory lists Jacob Bernstein, Merchant Tailor, on the northeast
corner of Main and Prairie streets. He resided at Mrs. Paulina Rosenfield’s boarding house on the north side
of Congress Street, between Fannin and San Jacinto streets.
The widow Cohen and some of the Cohen children remained occupying Lot 10 in 1877. The City Directory
lists Mrs. William Cohen as a widow residing on the southwest corner of Prairie and Chenevert streets.
Solomon was a clerk for Adolph Cramer, Dry Goods, at 87 Main Street, while Adolph clerked for L.M. Jones,
Dry Goods, on the south side of Preston Street, between Main and Travis streets. Adolf also sold boots and
shoes at 85 Main Street. Coleman worked for William Spiess and Isaac Baer, junk dealers on the west side of
Commerce Street, between Milam and Travis streets (Houston City Directory 1877). In 1877, the Cohen
family probably attended Reverend Dr. J. L. Meyer’s sermons at the newly constructed Jewish temple, Beth
Israel, on the corner of Crawford and Franklin streets.
On June 23, 1880, Teresa Cohen, five of her sons, two retired boarders, and two servants lived at 93
Chenevert Street on the corner of Prairie Street: Teresa Cohen, 55, F, W, widow, Housekeeping, born in
Prussia; Solomon, 27, M, W, General Clerk in a dry goods store, born in Louisiana; Adolph, 23, M, W, Clerk
in shoe store, born in Missouri; Joe, 19, M, W, Clerk in dry goods store, born in Texas; Benj., 14, M, W, At
School, born in Texas; Henry, 11, M, W, At School, born in Texas; boarders Joseph Morris, 70, M, W,
Retired, born in Russia; and Polina, 40, F, W, Retired, born in Russia. Black servants Annie Eldridge, 25,
Cook, born in Louisiana, and Annie, 4, born in Texas, are also listed (USBC-HC 1880:A:117:611).
Teresa Cohen and her sons continued living on the corner of Prairie and Chenevert streets in 1880, according
to the city directory for that year. Solomon still clerked for Adolph Cramer’s dry and fancy goods store at 65
Main Street between Preston and Congress. Adolph remained clerking for L. M. Jones at 61 and 63 Main
Street, selling clothing, hats, caps, and gents’ furnishing goods, as well as boots and shoes, and Joseph worked
as a clerk at Morris T. Rogers’ dry and fancy goods store on the south side of Preston Street, between Main
and Travis streets (Houston City Directory 1880).
Teresa’s oldest son, Isaac Cohen, had moved out by 1880, and was a telegraph operator boarding at the
Barnes House on the northwest corner of Main and Texas streets (Houston City Directory 1880). In 1880, the
Jewish synagogue known as Beth Israel was located on the southeast corner of Crawford and Franklin streets
and was led by Reverend Jacob Voorsanger on Saturday nights and Saturday mornings (Houston City
Directory 1880).
By 1882, Joseph Cohen was a peddler living at Mrs. Paulina Rosenfield’s Boarding House at 140-143
Congress Street at Caroline. Isaac Cohen worked in the Houston and Texas Central general offices as a

77

telegraph operator and boarded with Louis A. Bryan, a surgeon and physician residing at 172 Rusk Street,
between Main and Fannin streets (Houston City Directory 1882). Mrs. Teresa Cohen died in Houston on
April 20, 1895, and was buried in Beth Israel Cemetery (Teter 1997). Lot 10 in Block 162 was held by the
estate of Teresa Cohen through 1898 (HCC-TR 1898).
While William Cohen and his family were associated with Lot 10, the Cohens did not appear to actively
buy and sell property in Harris County, although in October 1863, the couple did secure a Bond for Title
for Chattels (HCC-DR 1863:1:275). In December 1872, Theresa Cohen acquired Lot 9 and part of Lot
11, both in Block 162, adjacent to their home. This was the only other land purchase in which Mrs.
Cohen was involved (HCC-DR 1872:10:756).
FAMILIES ASSOCIATED WITH BLOCK 173
Hugh G. Pannell Family
Hugh G. Pannell and his family were associated with Block 173, Parcel 173-4, Lots 9 and 10, between 1865
and 1884. Sarah A. Pannell, wife of Hugh G., initially secured all of Block 173 on October 21, 1865 (HCCDR 1865:2:130). Sarah and Hugh Pannell deeded Lots 9 and 10 in July 1867 to their son, Reid Flint Pannell,
who turned the same lots back over to his parents in December 1868 (HCC-DR 1867:4:318, 1868:7:59).
Born in about 1812 in Norfolk, Virginia, Hugh G. Pannell was in Texas by 1840. His first purchase in Harris
County occurred in March 1840. Hugh G. Pannell married Sarah Anne Tally, a native of Texas, in Harris
County on June 16, 1844 (HCC-MR 1844:A:324). The union of Hugh G. and Sarah Pannell would eventually
lead to a large family, all first-generation Texans.
The couple had two children, Reid Flint (born about 1845) and Mary Jane (born about 1847), by 1850. Two
more children had been born into the Pannell family within the next 10 years: Elizabeth (born 1856) and
Andrew Jackson (born 1858). By 1870, Alice, Cora, Sadie, and Ida were born.
H. G. Pannell initially made a living as a farmer, but by October 1860, he was working as a cabinet maker in
Houston’s Third Ward (USBC-HC 1850:559, 1860:1044). He became sexton of the city in 1860 and
remained in the position until 1865. Hugh G. and Sarah Pannell’s oldest daughter, Mary Jane, married
George Wait on July 19, 1864 in Harris County (HCC-MR 1864:492).
One year later, on October 21, 1865, Sarah A. Pannell secured all of Block 173 and deeded Lots 9 and 10 to
her son, Reid Flint, in 1867. Sarah and Hugh Pannell reacquired the corner lots in 1868. One of the
neighborhood children, Ebenezer N. Gray, recalled passing by “Old Man Pannell’s” shop during the yellow
fever epidemic in 1867. Gray recounted that Panell was the only undertaker in the city, and he noted the
activity: “He had several men working day and night making rough pine coffins and he could not get them
made fast enough” (Gray 1934).
The Pannell family was enumerated in the census as living in the Third Ward on July 5, 1870: Hugh G.
Pannell, 59, M, W, Undertaker, born in Virginia; Sarah A., 40, F, W, Keeping House, born in Texas; Reid
Flint, 24, M, W, Cabinet Maker, born in Texas; Lizzie, 14, F, W; Andrew J., 12, M, W; and Alice V., 9, F, W,
are each listed as attending school and being born in Texas; Cora, 8, F, W; Sadie W., 3, F, W; and Ida C., 1, F,
W, are each listed as being born in Texas (USBC-HC 1870:97-107). The Pannell family in 1870 also housed
three young adults: Samuel Nolan, 17, and Frank Nolan, 16, both of who are listed as white males attending
school and being born in Texas; and Emily Nolan, a Black domestic servant, also born in Texas.
In the 1870 Houston City Directory, H. G. Pannell is noted as an undertaker on the corner of Caroline and
Prairie streets. His son, Reid F., worked as assistant undertaker on Prairie Street, between Caroline and
Austin streets. Hugh G. Pannell is listed on the Products of Industry Schedule for the year ending June 1,
1870, as “H. G. Pannell, Undertaker, $4,000 capitol invested, Hand powered, one male employee older than
age 14; materials included Pine lumber, cloth, and hardware for the production that year of 285 coffins,

78

valued at $800” (USBC-HC-PIS 1870). On December 15, 1870, the City Council elected Reid F. Pannell to
the city sexton position. Reid Flint Pannell married Amelia Paulina Fisher the following year, on June 1,
1871, in Harris County (HCC-MR 1871:324:3175).
According to the 1877 Houston City Directory, Reid F. Pannell operated his undertaking business at 57
Prairie Street, between Caroline and Austin streets, and his residence is listed on the corner of Jackson and
Prairie streets. His advertisement reads: “R. F. Pannell, Undertaker and Furnisher, Dealer in Wood and
Metallic Cases, Coffins and Caskets, a General Assortment of Undertakers’ Goods always on hand” (Houston
City Directory 1877). R. F. Pannell also offered burial robes, crepe trimmings, etc., and Pannell would “Take
charge of Funerals, Embalm, furnish Hearse and Carriages” (Houston City Directory 1877).
H. G. and Sarah Pannell’s daughter, Miss Alice V., married William H. Henderson, a native of Arkansas, on
November 17, 1879, in Harris County (HCC-MR 1879:258:9878). By December 1, 1879, another Pannell
daughter, Belle (Elizabeth), married Charles Ed. Heider in Harris County (HCC-MR 1879:265:9899).
Hugh G. Pannell was deceased before the census taker enumerated the family on June 24, 1880, as living at
163 Prairie Street: Sarah Pannell, 50, F, W, Housekeeping, born in Texas; Bettie, 24, F, W, Assistant
Housekeeper, born in Texas; Jack (Andrew J.), 21, M, W, working in grocery, born in Texas; and Sadie, 13,
F, W, at school, born in Texas. Sarah Pannell’s orphan nieces also lived with them: Louise and Mary Tally,
14 and 9, respectively, are listed as attending school and as being born in Texas. Harriet Tally, 7, also born in
Texas, is also listed (USBC-HC 1880:631).
According to the 1880 census, Sarah’s daughter Alice and husband lived with the Pannells in 1880: William
Henderson, 26, was a printer and was born in Arkansas; Alice, 19, was listed as a housekeeper. Two Black
women laundresses, Fannie Cassels, 66, born in Kentucky, and Mary Harris, 35, born in Arkansas, also
belonged to the household (USBC-HC 1880:631).
Reid Pannell and his family of five children were enumerated in the census on June 23, 1880, at 224 Prairie
Street: R. F. Pannell, 33, M, W, Undertaker, born in Texas; Amelia, 28, F, W, Housekeeping, born in Texas;
Mary, 8, F, W; Iona, 5, F, W; A. C., 3, M, W; and Hugh, 1, M, W, each of whom was born in Texas. Adopted
daughter, Kate Smith, 9, F, W, born in Tennessee, and Annie Hawkins, 30, a Black servant and cook born in
Texas, are also noted (USBC-HC 1880:622).
The June 23, 1880, Harris County Census indicates several working families occupying “Pannell’s Quarters”
at the corner of Hamilton and Prairie streets. Families noted on Prairie Street include the following: James
Cooper, 36, a Mulatto Brickmason born in Tennessee; Emmer, 27, a Black Housekeeper born in Texas;
Scharlott, 9; Josephine, 8; Pinky, 5; and James, Jr., 2, are all Blacks born in Texas (USBC-HC 1880:601).
Other occupants include Charles Powels, 33, M, B, Laborer; Francis, 24, F, B; Pinky, 8, F, B; Oliver Connor,
19, M, B, Laborer; and Louise, 21, F, B, Laborer, all born in Texas, and William Powels, 48, a Black Laborer,
who was born in Virginia (USBC-HC 1880:602). Sampson Marsh, 24, a Black Laborer born in Georgia, and
Rosa, 18, a Black Laundress born in Texas, are also listed (USBC-HC 1880:603). Other families on the 1880
census indicated as occupying Pannell’s Quarters and noted on Hamilton Street include the following: Ann
Knuckels, 50, a Black Laundress born in North Carolina; Joseph, 18, a Black Laborer born in Texas; and
William, 4, a Black male born in Texas (USBC-HC 1880:604), along with Martha Jones, 45, F, B, Cook, born
in Mississippi; and Mary Jones, 18, F, B, Laundress; Augusta, 16, F, B, Laundress; Wilson, 12, M, B, listed as
being at school; and Jordon, 10, M, B, also “At School,” were all born in Texas (USBC-HC 1880:605).
Reid F. Pannell continued to operate his undertaker business at 57 Prairie Street, between Caroline and Austin
streets, residing on the southeast corner of Prairie and Crawford streets in 1880. His brother, A. J., lived with
him, selling groceries and provisions at 83 Milam Street between Prairie and Preston streets (Houston City

79

Directory 1880). Alice Pannell Henderson was a widow by 1882 and lived with her mother, according to the
1880 Houston City Directory.
By 1882, the Houston City Directory did not list Reid F. but listed Andrew J. Pannell as an undertaker, with
his “warerooms” and office located at 153-157 Prairie Street, between San Jacinto and Caroline streets, his
groceries, wines, liquors at 79 Milam Street, and his residence at 163 Prairie Street. Sarah A. Pannell sold
Lots 9 and 10 on February 14, 1884 (HCC-DR 1884:29:227).

PART III
THE CULTURAL ARTIFACTS

9
IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF CERAMIC
VESSEL SHERDS
Randall W. Moir

This chapter presents the findings of the analysis of over 2,700 ceramic vessel sherds recovered during the
Ball Park at Union Station Archeological Project. The category ‘ceramic vessels’ includes fragments from
clay vessels, clay containers, and clay dishes that fall within the divisions of earthenware, stoneware, or
porcelain. It excludes all non-vessel ceramic items such as porcelain dolls, bricks, clay sewer pipes, ceramic
doorknobs, tiles, stoneware or ball clay tobacco pipes, clay insulators (see Chapter 12).
Ceramic vessel sherds were the fourth most common category of artifacts recovered. Faunal/floral remains
(animal bone and other food remains, as well as plant material) constituted the most frequent artifact grouping
recovered, followed by bottle glass and nails, which were the second and third most common artifact groups.
A few artifact categories were only selectively sampled, such as brick and brick fragments, and they
undoubtedly would have outnumbered many other categories if they had been 100 percent recovered. If so,
ceramic vessel sherds would undoubtedly have been the fifth most frequent artifact grouping.
The frequency of ceramic sherds in the Project Area is also reflective of the time period covered by
occupation (i.e., features dating after about 1870 were not excavated as noted in consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission [see Chapter 3]). Instead, the investigation focused upon deposits older than 1870
when consumption of glass bottles and jars was just beginning to increase in frequency in Texas urban society
mainly as a result of expanding railroad connections. Consequently, if one had retrieved the remains of all
1870-1920 features, the ranking of ceramics would have been probably bypassed by tin cans and possibly
some other architectural artifact categories (e.g., window glass).
As noted earlier in this report, the large number of urban blocks affected by Ball Park at Union Station project
made the 1870 cut-off date practical and helped focus the available effort on a smaller subset of historical
resources, given excavation deadlines and funding constraints. This cut-off also affected the kinds of deposits
removed for detailed analyses. Consequently, results presented in this chapter, like the report as a whole, are
directed toward examining archeological issues and evaluating material remains for the approximate 18351870 period (with a few later exceptions). The port of Houston was not economically connected to other
major inland commercial centers in the United States until 1873 when the Houston and Texas Central
(H&TC) railroad completed a critical rail link in north Texas. The H&TC route eventually connected
Houston directly to St. Louis by joining the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad in Denison, Texas (Moir
1999a:7). This connection opened a direct link to the Midwest industrial core of the U.S. and brought both
new markets and cheaper goods overland rather than by boat to Houston’s residents. Ceramic vessels from
potteries in the Midwest, particularly Ohio, would begin to seriously replace British wares by the late 1870s.
The pre-1870 period of focus for these excavations, however, does not include a substantial proportion of
American-made ceramic vessels except among some stonewares and possibly a few yellowwares. By far,
most ceramic vessels were made in Great Britain and thus probably came to Houston more directly by water
and shipping rather than any major overland route.
As noted, by far the greatest number of the ceramic vessels identified from features dating before 1870 were
made in Great Britain or Europe rather than the United States. Furthermore, most of the ceramic containers

81

and dishes discussed in this chapter served common utilitarian roles. The vessels were typically used for
eating and drinking (cups, plates, saucers, pitchers, bowls, platters, etc.), processing foods (mixing bowls,
colanders, etc.), cooking (baking dishes, pans, etc.), storing foods (jars, crocks, jugs, bowls, bottles, etc.), and
storing or packaging nonfood substances (creams, cosmetics, oils, etc.). There were also a few ceramic
vessels that served primarily decorative functions, such as vases, bowls, ornate plates, cups, etc. Finally, there
were a few comparatively special vessels among the ceramic assemblage that did not function either in
foodway activities or as common utilitarian ceramic containers. Examples include fragments of a candlestick
holder and sherds from children’s toy dishes.
This chapter is organized in two sections, with parts of the data provided in Appendix D. The first section
discusses ceramic vessel research themes, and the second is a summary of findings and interpretations. The
first section provides a summary of analysis methods applied to the recovered ceramic vessel sherds. It
explains the differences between the enumeration methods applied to some features vs. the minimum vessel
estimates applied to others. The research themes section also discusses the dating and age assignment
methods used, as well as the usefulness of assessing discard contexts and household profiles. Important
refuse terms and definitions are reviewed, and a simplified model of ceramic vessel fashions from
approximately 1820 to 1890 is also reviewed, based upon a synthesis of a number of projects and publications
for sites in Texas and Louisiana.
The second section is a summary of findings and interpretations derived from the ceramic vessels analyses. It
provides a brief overview of the major trends and patterns observed from looking solely at the ceramic data.
In particular, it summarizes the major kinds of contexts from which ceramics were recovered and then places
these contexts within a broader understanding of urban lifeways in Houston and elsewhere. Some
comparisons are made between other urban and rural excavations. Finally, certain kinds of features are
reviewed in terms of their ceramic vessel contents and are evaluated using information from published
sources and other references. Insights gained from the ceramic vessel data are then reviewed in light of
current theoretical issues in historical archeology, and some additional conclusions are drawn. The ceramic
data, when combined with the other Ball Park archeological data, provide a strong case for using
interdisciplinary approaches to urban sites from the nineteenth century and offer some additional insights to
our understanding of this period in America’s past.
Data provided in Appendix G present detailed results of the ceramic analyses organized by feature number
and presented by city block. Ceramic vessel data provided from each feature in this chapter resulted from
examining the ceramics in each feature without using any other artifact data to modify or influence ceramic
interpretations. This method has both strengths and weaknesses, as discussed towards the end of the chapter.
Ceramic sherds from the most important features are discussed in more detail by provenience (lots and levels)
and are enumerated using all sherds recovered. Information is given on the ages and percentages recovered
for each individual vessel. Percentages refer to the completeness of each enumerated vessel and are rough
estimates, probably accurate within 2 to 6 percent for either very small or very large vessel portions (i.e.,
portions from 1 percent up to about 25 percent or greater than 85 percent), and 5 to 13 percent for larger
vessel portions of common forms (i.e., portions greater than 25 percent up to 85 percent).
A few select examples of the more than 700 ceramic vessels are illustrated. Features with few ceramic vessel
sherds or with little internal stratigraphy are typically reviewed in less detail. Each detailed feature discussion
ends with an assessment of the household most likely responsible for the ceramic vessels. This required
evaluating the discard context of the ceramics using only the ceramic vessel data. Appendix G provides some
data derived for 64 feature contexts containing ceramic vessel sherds.

82

CERAMIC VESSEL RESEARCH THEMES
Analysis of the ceramic vessel sherds from the Project Area was focused upon gathering several levels of
information to pursue different kinds of research themes. First, purely descriptive data were needed from
each feature and each sub-context within each feature (i.e., level and lot), so that one could understand the
nature of each deposit. These data included the number of sherds and vessels in each feature and level, as
well as their general ages and basic vessel types.
At a more interpretive level of analysis, the research required forming a decision about how the ceramic
sherds ended up in various feature contexts. This necessitated reviewing the various archeological contexts in
the Project Area, and applying some of the terms and approaches developed by Schiffer (1972, 1975, 1976,
1977, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1995) and South (1977a, 1977b, 1978a, 1978b, 1979) with other work in this realm
(e.g., Moir 1997a, 1998; Moir and Hietala 2000). While this approach might seem rather basic, it required
reconstructing ceramic vessels and using all sherds recovered from a particular feature or context to determine
whether the sherds represented captured sheet refuse or intentionally discarded broken vessels. As the data
reveal, this is not a simple undertaking. Consequently, some attention is given below to refuse terms and
refuse contexts to make the data more understandable.
The ceramic research themes include an assessment of a household’s possible socioeconomic profile for some
features using only the ceramic data. This step also included attributing ceramics to certain households based
upon temporal data and available deed/title information. Once again, ceramic interpretations seemed to vary
depending on sample size and lot ownership history. Certainly, the synthesis of all artifact data along with
ceramic data might give a more conclusive understanding of each feature (see Chapters 5 and 20).
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The ceramic research required several methodological considerations to be able to pursue the major themes of
interest. First, the clear identification and simple description of the vessels represented by sherds from each
feature was of primary interest. Second, the age and discard period responsible for the ceramic vessel suites
in each feature was of great interest. In order to accomplish this task, sources of contamination, such as sheet
refuse or obviously later intrusive ceramic sherds, had to be removed from the main body of the assemblage
to derive a basic deposition date. Third, the discard context required assessing how ceramic sherds ended up
in a particular feature and whether they were directly deposited as trash or were redeposited material from
some prior interim context. Finally, the ceramic vessel analyses focused upon possible household information
encoded in the sherd assemblages. It looked at some of the more apparent socioeconomic and ethnic data
present in the ceramic vessel assemblages from well-dated and well-understood features to probe possible
household affiliations. Each of these points is discussed in greater detail below.
Ceramic Vessel Counts by Feature
The identification and description of ceramic vessels recovered from each feature were of primary interest. It
made little sense to count sherds using simple attribute categories from each context when one could, with
some extra effort, repatriate various pieces back to their parent vessel. This was even more meaningful when
it was apparent that the number of sherds per ceramic vessel varied fairly substantially depending upon the
amount of in situ crushing. In fact, post-burial events seemed to add considerably to the physical compaction
of some features and the further breakage of their contents. Consequently, reconstructing the number of
vessels present in each feature was far more useful than counting sherds, since most breakage of vessels did
not produce uniform or predictable sherd lots.
Having said this, there were a few features where vessel counts or estimates were not performed. This
occurred when the features mainly contained reworked sheet refuse and the sherds were too fragmentary to be
assigned to individual vessels within the effort allocated for the research. Still, a substantial amount of time
was devoted to vessel identification and minimum vessel estimates in order to understand the composition of
many features and to accomplish the overall ceramic goals.

83

This raises a very important point of distinction. The physical delineation of individual ceramic vessels is
referenced by two different names in this chapter, depending on the approach used to accomplish the results.
For example, ceramic enumeration (CE) refers to ceramic vessel counts derived for a feature when each
vessel is repatriated with all of its excavated sherds recovered from that particular feature. This may result in
a fully complete or a nearly complete reconstruction of the entire vessel depending on how many crossmending sherds are present, or it may simply reveal that only one or two sherds without any refitting were all
that were recovered. The process of enumeration of vessels was continued until all sherds from the particular
feature under review were assigned to a specific ceramic vessel (of course, small chips and other very, very
small fragments without any helpful attributes would be left unassigned). The entire process is very thorough
and requires checking each sherd for repatriation with its parent vessel. Consequently, ceramic enumeration
was very time consuming and, therefore, it was not attempted on every assemblage. It was typically applied
where the results were expected to be most productive and the effort level was considered acceptable.
The second vessel counting method is more commonly used in ceramic studies because it takes far less time
since it is less thorough. It is referred to here as minimum vessel estimations (MVE) and follows the practice
developed by faunal analysts. It involves counting the probable minimum number of ceramic vessels using
mostly diagnostic sherds rather than the entire feature assemblage. Unlike ceramic enumeration, it focuses
mainly on diagnostic rims, bases, footrings, and other decorated sherds to differentiate the minimum number
of vessels recovered from a feature. Plain sherds lacking any diagnostically useful attributes remain
unassigned to any vessel, and it is presumed that the total number of counted vessels would be higher if full
enumeration was performed; hence the term ‘minimum vessel count.’ Minimum vessel estimates were
applied to features where sheet refuse was abundant and sherd sizes were much smaller, making enumeration
too labor intensive.
Age Assignments and Dating Methods
The second major analysis task was focused upon evaluating the age and probable discard period responsible
for the ceramic vessels in each feature. The internal stratigraphic distribution of both sherds and individual
vessels within each major feature had to be assessed. When the features were complex, as well as when the
spatial distribution of vessels involved multiple contiguous excavation units, this took time and patience. The
available information on each feature was reviewed, consisting of written summaries of descriptive notes.
While placing a time frame on each ceramic assemblage may seem simple, it required understanding whether
the sherds were discarded as refuse immediately after a breakage event or whether they were incorporated in
the feature as redeposited material at a much later date. As such, these results were dependent upon
determining the discard context of each feature, especially if multiple contexts might have been responsible
for the ceramic sherds in a feature. In this way, the age assessments had to be made in concert with the third
research task, which focused upon the discard context responsible for each vessel or each group of sherds.
Discard Contexts
Discard contexts, the third research theme, was focused upon assessing how ceramic sherds ended up where
they were excavated. Did the sherds come from vessels that were broken and simply thrown or cast into a
feature along with other refuse and debris while the feature was open? Or did the sherds end up in the matrix
of a feature by a less direct and more circuitous route? Unfortunately, archeological literature on discard
contexts is unduly murky, since some past emphasis seems to be projected from prehistoric research issues,
particularly the focus of Schiffer (1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1995). The contributions of
South (1977a, 1977b, 1978a, 1978b, 1979) expand on Schiffer’s terms and recognize some of the
shortcomings regarding historic artifact contexts (see South 1977a:296-299). The ceramic research here
draws on the contributions of both Schiffer and South, as well as on the author’s experience, to create a more
appropriate set of contexts for evaluating the Project Area’s features.
Consequently, the third research theme directly addressed the meaningful context of ceramic vessel sherds
from features. It required developing more appropriate terms to examine what can be clearly determined for

84

ceramic sherds found in different kinds of features. Instead of attempting to determine if an item was
essentially used or not used where it was found, as Schiffer (1972, 1987) has often postulated, these ceramic
studies were focused upon first distinguishing captured or re-deposited sheet refuse from discarded but broken
vessels. This required determining whether ceramic vessels were reconstructable from their feature contexts
or whether they were more akin to displaced and reworked sheet-refuse remains that had been re-deposited
such that vessel reconstruction was no longer possible.
As it turned out, many features displayed evidence of both directly discarded broken ceramic vessels
(expended vessels) and re-deposited sherds probably from captured sheet refuse and reworked yard fill.
Displaced refuse is present when fill material containing artifacts and items from elsewhere on the premises
was moved to a feature to level the ground or seal pungent refuse layers. Analysis of features also revealed a
few examples where ceramic vessels were probably accidentally dropped or lost rather than intentionally
discarded. Only a few features revealed a preponderance of ceramic sherds coming from a single source.
Consequently, ceramic discard contexts are very important to the interpretation of many of the project’s
features, and therefore are discussed in greater detail below.
Household Profiles and Ceramic Associations
The last major research theme guiding the ceramic vessel analyses was focused upon household information
encoded in the sherd assemblages for well-dated features. Effort was set aside to look at the possible
socioeconomic and ethnic affiliations of the households responsible for the ceramic vessels recovered from
features with potentially single household affiliations. The range of vessel forms and types was also
examined for activity-specific, gender-specific, or class-specific groupings. This detailed level of analysis
required focusing upon vessel assemblages that were particularly well controlled. The deposits had to contain
in situ, primary discarded refuse of short duration and not re-deposited material lacking clear household
affiliation. The ceramic assemblages also had to be from a single household and not from mixed household
contexts. As such, only a few features contained ceramic assemblages that appeared to meet these criteria.
Additional Considerations
The foregoing research themes and approaches outline the primary focus of the ceramic analyses beyond
purely descriptive information. Obviously, the interpretation of ceramic vessels from features required an
understanding of how they ended up in the feature (i.e., older sheet refuse that had been captured by a feature
and incorporated in its matrix required to be separated from other directly discarded materials). In a few types
of features, such as privies that were cleaned out periodically, this required some patience and detailed
inspection of the ceramic data by level. If redeposited sherds were not identified and separated from those
intentionally thrown into a feature, then one would end up with, for example, ceramic age estimates that were
artificially inflated due to the older re-deposited material. Consequently, the following terms are helpful to
define so that the ceramic methods used here can be fully understood.
Major Refuse Terms and Definitions
Definition of the following terms originally comes from the work of Michael Schiffer (1972, 1976, 1995)
concerning site formation processes. Schiffer identified more clearly certain kinds of relationships between
artifacts that had been generally recognized by archeologists for years but had not been so carefully defined in
the analyses of archeological assemblages. Schiffer’s terms include primary refuse, which identified artifacts
discarded at their place of use (e.g., a broken stoneware jug thrown aside at a spot in the yard where it was
used); secondary refuse, which recognized artifacts discarded at some place other than their place of use (e.g.,
broken bottles and food refuse carried away from a house site and discarded in a dump); and de facto refuse,
which applied to artifacts entering the archeological record as a result of no intentional human effort or proactive discard activities (e.g., a tool left under a porch and then forgotten about or a coin accidentally dropped
and lost) (Schiffer 1972:161-163).

85

Stanley South (1977a:297) drew directly on some of Schiffer’s concepts and offered yet a few more terms of
his own to address contexts he felt were equally important in historical sites. For example, South suggested
the term in situ-de facto to differentiate objects that retained their systemic context but had entered the
archeological record as a result of nonhuman activities (e.g., the accidental burning of a structure leaving
behind in situ furniture remains and other personal items in the ruins). He also suggested the term primary-de
facto refuse for items left in their place of use but accidentally abandoned, which therefore entered the
archeological record without intentional discard activities (South 1977a:297). The loss of artifacts such as
buttons, pins, coins, and beads through cracks in a wooden floor represent examples of primary-de facto
refuse. Finally, South (1977a:297-298) noted the importance of displaced refuse where primary and/or
secondary refuse were re-deposited by natural elements (erosion) or human activities (landscaping, filling in
depressions, constructing new buildings, etc.) in a new location.
South (1977a:297-299) realized that applying such terms to the contents of specific deposits would also
require exacting techniques to isolate and record very important kinds of contextual distinctions. The end
result, however, would offer archeologists greater data for interpreting certain aspects of human behavior and
natural elements encoded in archeological deposits and assemblages. He also realized that using location
relationships among artifacts for classifying the historic archeological record would be by no means a
definitive endeavor. In fact, he felt that better methodological tools would also be developed as archeologists
focused upon the importance of associational relationships and their usefulness for interpreting past human
behavior and culture.
In terms of the Ball Park features, the above kinds of concepts have been extended and even modified to
better fit the problems at hand. First, the definition of ‘place of use’ has to be more clearly defined since very
few artifacts are captured in the historic archeological record at the same precise location where they were
either last used or used most frequently. Consequently, in Historic period sites, such as urban house lots in
mid nineteenth-century Houston, focusing too much on precise place of use becomes rather self-defeating. At
one level, many of the artifacts discarded onsite were used in multiple areas before they were finally
discarded, abandoned, or lost. A porcelain cup or its broken sherd(s) may end up in a privy either (1) by
accident – the whole cup was knocked into the privy; (2) on purpose – to hide evidence of a broken cup; (3)
as the result of discarding some broken items and food wastes from the main house – its sherds were among
the secondary refuse thrown away; or (4) as re-deposited material when soil was used as fill – a single sherd
was in the fill used to cover the privy to better control the offensive odors. Determining which events
occurred becomes futile.
Of course, there are more scenarios to explain how a broken porcelain cup or its representative sherd(s) were
incorporated in the matrix of a privy. Perhaps the sherd merely fell in as the upper walls of the privy pit were
eroded into the adjacent older sheet refuse after the feature had been abandoned for several years, or maybe a
child playing near the privy simply tossed the old cup into it for amusement. The list can go on and on. The
point here is that determining whether an artifact ends up where it was last used requires a level of contextual
control that is often beyond archeological methods.
Instead of focusing upon contextual polemics, the research implemented for the Ball Park ceramics attempted
to determine if various feature contexts likely contained re-deposited ceramic vessel material, directly
discarded broken ceramic vessel material, or both. In terms of re-deposited ceramic sherds, the most
significant attributes observed were those indicative of sheet refuse. While there can be many other instances
of re-deposited ceramic vessel material, the most common is sheet refuse contained in fill used to landscape a
yard, level a depression, or seal a feature. The author has studied sheet-refuse materials from historical sites
for a number of years (see Moir 1987a, 1997a, 1997b). It is possible to recognize ceramic sheet-refuse sherds
by their characteristically small physical size. They also often display visible trampling attributes (scuff-type
parallel scratches), serrated edge damage, soiled and stained edge matrix, and sometimes differentially
weathered faces. Sheet refuse consists of ceramic sherds, as well as other artifacts that have been

86

intentionally discarded in yard areas and thrown directly on the surface of the ground where the material is
repeatedly trampled and subsequently reduced and scattered across even larger areas over many years of
occupation. At some sites, the sheet refuse may be reworked for many decades. The end result is that very
few sherds from the same vessel ever remain within a few meters of each other (see Moir 1997a). Instead,
they become highly scattered by a broad host of specific quick-time processes that are not yet fully
understood but certainly better understood using the concepts behind the definition of a dispersed midden
(Moir 1997a).
The specific processes behind the formation of a dispersed midden are well beyond this chapter and were the
subject of a previous treatise (Moir 1997a) and some more recent attempts at statistically modeling their
formation (Hietala and Moir 2000; Moir and Hietala 2000). Suffice it to say that a dispersed midden is, by
definition, so extensively reworked that it retains few reconstructable ceramic vessels in any one area and
instead would require the excavation of an entire house lot to be able to refit even 40 percent of the sherds
from each discarded ceramic vessel. Consequently, when soil matrix containing dispersed midden is
incorporated as fill in a feature, it contains very few sherds from any one vessel and, therefore, cross mending
is very infrequent. Several examples of dispersed midden material captured in feature contexts in the current
project contained dispersed midden, and they underscore the characteristics so common for these kinds of
deposits (see Feature 5017 [F5017] for an excellent example).
In contrast, directly discarded ceramic vessel sherds are most often easily separated from dispersed midden
material by their large sherd sizes and frequent cross mending. Unlike redeposited, dispersed midden
material, directly discarded sherds typically represent the disposed remains of broken or chipped vessels that
are no longer desirable. In some cases, whole vessels are also accidentally lost or dropped into certain kinds
of features, such as privies; it can be problematic to distinguish them from intentionally discarded whole
vessels.
In a few features, especially privies, whole ceramic vessels were occasionally recovered and many could not
be definitively associated with a precise reason for their discard. Among the few examples that might be
labeled as intentionally discarded refuse were imported British Bristol-glazed stoneware beverage bottles (ale,
beer, stout) (see Switzer 1974:9-14) that were likely discarded after their contents were consumed. Some
chamber pots were also recovered intact from privies. They probably were either accidentally dropped in or
were tossed in when they were no longer wanted (one has several chips and cracks). Last of all, several small
toy dishes were also recovered from privy fills and seemed to represent vessels that were either accidentally
dropped or intentionally thrown in by children.
Postdepositional Breakage
The discussion of discard contexts cannot be complete without mentioning one other very obvious process at
work on urban features. There is considerable breakage of whole vessels and large sherds that occurs well
after the items were deposited in the ground. This is in addition to the obvious examples of freshly broken
sherds that were apparently fractured by heavy construction equipment as vehicles were moved across parts of
the project, or when sherds were split by a trowel or shovel as units were excavated and cleaned. Excluding
these freshly broken examples, there were still other numerous examples of sherds, and even whole vessels,
crushed and broken in situ years ago, since the edges of the sherds were well stained and discolored.
Some of the old breakage among sherds undoubtedly occurred as the matrix of certain features was
compacted by the weight of its overburden. Other sherds may have been broken when the rail yard and depot
were constructed in the early 1900s. This phenomenon is clear after studying ceramic breakage. Specifically,
it is very hard to fracture a ceramic vessel into more than 18 pieces simply by dropping it at arms’ length or
by banging it against a larger, non-breakable object (see Moir 1997a:505-506). In fact, many ceramic vessels
broke into less than 10 fragments, excluding very tiny pieces that would pass through a 0.25-in (6 mm) wire
mesh. Thus when ceramic vessels end up fractured into 25 to 40 fragments, most of this breakage occurred

87

after the sherds were buried in the ground rather than before that point. While this seems intuitively obvious,
it is still generally overlooked in the analyses of archeological materials.
Postdepositional breakage is quite evident in grave goods; the Tunica Treasure Report shows some excellent
examples of post-burial breakage (Brain 1979:37, 60, 63, 70, 76). Other examples of postdepositional
breakage is shown in Miller and Stone (1970:45, 89), where a large platter is broken into 26 sherds, and a
porcelain saucer broken into 20 sherds. Looking closely at the kinds of fracture lines present, one can identify
many of the postdepositional fractures by their morphology and angles.
Last of all, some features, in particular privies and cold-storage compartments, were occasionally cleaned out
and subsequently used for trash disposal prior to complete abandonment. If the job was very well done, very
few ceramic sherds and other items may have remained in the feature after the final cleaning was complete.
If, on the other hand, the cleaning was only 70 percent complete, some ceramic vessel sherds would have
been left behind, and the proportion of cross-mending sherds would vary depending upon the parts that were
not taken away. Thus some vessels now represented by only a few sherds in feature fill may have been
entirely represented before any cleaning was performed. After multiple cleanings over a 5- or 10-year period,
a privy may contain a widely mixed ceramic assemblage in its lowest stratum, with only the latest broken
vessels fully reconstructable and all other vessels in varying degrees of partial sections due to repeated
cleaning episodes.
The importance of recognizing the precise context of ceramic vessels and ceramic sherds in a feature is
crucial. For example, the number of originally whole vessels discarded in a feature cannot be determined if
they were not collected as a discrete broken cluster in the field and retained that way during laboratory
procedures. If they were mixed with all other remains from a level, it may be problematic to determine
whether they were whole or nearly whole when they were discarded and only fractured later as the feature
naturally compacted. Conversely, if their sherds were thrown into the feature in several separate batches over
a period of a week, this kind of disposal behavior would also not be distinguishable without retaining precise
provenience data.
In closing this discussion of discard contexts, it is not practical to excavate every feature with such great care
that all sherds retain their three-dimensional intrafeature provenience. This is particularly true with the
current project, since over 100 features were excavated and many more were assessed and mapped. However,
the full interpretation of ceramic vessels and sherds in some features is limited without knowing the full
relationship of all their sherds. Even if the sherds came from different levels, their interpretation changes if
the sherds were superimposed over each other vs. having originated in opposite corners of a meter-long pit.
Overview of Common Post-1820 Ceramic Fashions
The Ball Park at Union Station ceramic assemblage provides a nice overview of common ceramics available
post 1820 to approximately 1900. The following is a brief summary of the major ceramic traditions found in
eastern Texas and nearby Louisiana (e.g., Moir 1987a, 1987b, 1988, 1992, 1996a, 1996b, 1997a, 1998, 1999b,
1999c, 2000), as well as elsewhere (e.g., Moir and Drinkwater 1981; Moir and Rosebrock 1979; Moir and
Sampson 1993). It provides a baseline for the more detailed discussion of feature assemblages given later in
this chapter.
Pre-1820 ceramic vessels are not represented in the assemblage. This is expected, given the historical
settlement of the Project Area as known from documentary records (see Chapters 7 and 8). If present, such
ceramics would reveal early polychrome pearlwares (ca. 1795-1815 varieties), late varieties of creamware
(light-colored creamwares with royal rims, or with overglazed black transfers, etc. for the pre-1820 period),
and certain recognizable transfer-printed patterns on pearlwares and late pearlwares, as well as earlier
varieties of shell-edge wares (Moir 1996a, 1997b). These styles and types are notably absent in the current

88

assemblage but were evident in several sites located just 200 miles east of Houston and occupied from
approximately 1780 to 1850+ (Moir 1999b, 1999c, 2000).
Ceramic vessels common for the 1820-1835 period in the assemblage are scarce and include late cockled
shell-edge late pearlwares (see F7013) and other patterns of relief-molded edgewares (late pearlwares and
early transitional whitewares, see F7013), certain types of banded and annular wares on late pearlwares and
early transitional whitewares, and varieties of transfer-printed patterns mainly in blue, including some
negative transfer patterns on late pearlwares and early transitional whitewares. Some examples of transfer
patterns are shown in Samford (1997) as well as Miller (1991). Chinese-variant patterns, as well as British
views of scenes and scenery, would be common (see Samford 1997). During this period, fine tablewares
were overwhelmingly imported from Great Britain, and some porcelain came from Europe. American-made
wares were relegated to storage and utilitarian functions and mainly included salt-glazed stonewares and leadglazed redwares.
The 1835-1850 period was a time of significant change in ceramic tableware fashions and traditions.
Tablewares started out as thin whitewares with a host of colored transfer-printed monochrome patterns in
green, brown, red, bluish green, light blue, and black common. The patterns include exotic views, floral
designs, Classical motifs and scenes, Romantic scenes, and Gothic designs (see Samford 1997 for pattern
definitions). Many types of banded, slipped, and annular whitewares and late pearlwares were also common
at the beginning of this period. They continued through time, changing to thicker bodied wares by the mid
1840s to the early 1850s. Shell-edge decorated wares begin in this period as late residual cockled edges on
late pearlwares and whitewares and then are replaced by non-cockled thicker whitewares and early
transitional ironstones. As the period progressed, thicker wares eventually include plain and patterned
ironstones that replaced the older thin ware traditions, especially in urban settings where fashion
consciousness was the rule among the middle and upper classes.
The 1840s also included mainly thick-bodied transfer-printed and relief-molded/patterned ironstones for use
by the wealthier families, while the less affluent households continued with some of the older styles
transposed onto new bodied wares. Transfer-printed colors used were light blue, dark blue, mulberry (a
purplish black), green, brown and some red. Spatterwares on thinner whitewares were common before 18401845 as decorative wares for less affluent households; they were soon replaced by cut-sponge decorated
thicker wares after the early 1840s. The thicker ironstone wares of the 1840s started to appear without any
transfer-printed patterns in the late 1840s, and soon took over fashion among the upper class by 1855. The
more ornate wares still retained molded patterns in plain white and blue tinted ironstones. Thus by 1850, the
upper classes sought full sets of thick, patterned ironstone and even porcelain, whereas the lower classes
seemed to continue with the transfer-printed older wares or settled for plain white non-patterned wares (i.e.,
no relief designs or molded and paneled motifs).
The 1850-1865 period witnessed the end of certain decorated motifs and hand-painted wares and the
dominance of undecorated white ironstone and ironstone-like wares. Still a few households seemed to prefer
transfer-printed wares on these newer bodies, and these contemporary patterns can be distinguished from the
older wares. Among most other households, undecorated white- and blue-tinted ironstone and ironstone-like
wares were dominant. Shell-edge and hand-painted wares disappeared among the stock of most sellers by the
mid 1850s, and transfer-printed wares became a minor offering when compared to undecorated wares. Reliefpatterned ironstone, however, continued among the more fashionable wares, although not many households
could afford them, especially after the Civil War blockade stopped the importation of British wares between
1861 and 1865. Consequently, many wares purchased in Houston after 1865 do not stay up to pace with
fashions seen in the Northeast or in Europe. In fact, the strata deposited during the latter years of the Civil
War may contain a preponderance of older pre-1860 wares, since replacements for fine tablewares were not
available until after mid 1865.

89

The 1865-1880 period saw a large influx of ceramic vessels, beginning in late 1865, to replace those broken
and worn out during the previous four years of war. Vessels at this time included a range of fashionable
wares that catered to both older tastes (some transfer wares and older transfer decorated wares). For many
families, however, simple plain designs in undecorated ironstone-like wares were all that could be afforded
given the disastrous economic toll taken by the war. Some merchants likely would have purchased very nice
ceramic wares, since they were reaping strong profits from the resumption of trade and several years of pentup consumer demand. Consequently, the styles of the 1865 to 1880 period reveal a stronger dichotomy
between well-to-do vs. poor households. The well-off families had nice matching sets of wares in ironstone
and porcelain, whereas the poor likely were using mismatched sets of very plain vessels.
In the 1870s, railroad service initiated a change in the flow of goods and commodities into Houston after the
route to St. Louis and the industrial Midwest was opened in 1873. The potteries in Ohio and other northern
states were, by 1855, able to seriously compete with British and European wares after consumers
acknowledged the acceptable quality of American tablewares. Consequently, the post-1870 features in the
current project would expect to begin to show a larger proportion of American-made fine tablewares as
railroads offered a cheaper way to import ceramic vessels from American potteries than trans-Atlantic
shipping. However, since most of the features excavated were selected because they were sealed before 1870,
testing this hypothesis is limited to only a few deposits (e.g., F1049, F2001, F2002, F7019, F7032, and
F7044).
The few ceramic vessels from post 1870 contexts revealed that wares started to get thinner again after 18801885, possibly due to the competition of styles made by American firms. Relief-molded wares became more
common after 1890, with overglaze monochrome decalcomania wares increasingly more common after 1895.
Many wares were decorated with gilded designs and gilded edging as well as polychrome overglaze
decorations after 1895-1900. Also, undecorated utilitarian tablewares were still available for the poorest of
households. American maker’s marks become more frequent after 1895 and dominant Texas ceramic
assemblages by about 1910.
The above summary is a thumbnail sketch of ceramic fashions and wares for Texas households that offers a
beginning point to examine the wares from the current project. It glosses over the broad variation possible in
tightly dated assemblages to give a picture of changing fashion in ceramic vessels over the decades. The
importance of socioeconomic status for each household has only been cursorily addressed; more about this
aspect of ceramic assemblages is discussed in the concluding section of this chapter. Some of the
contributions of George Miller’s socioeconomic scaling methods (Miller 1980, 1984, 1987, 1991) on this
topic are brought into the discussion, and the Ball Park ceramic data set provides a means to evaluate that
kind of approach.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this section, a summary of features containing ceramic vessel sherds by block and lot ownership is
presented. The current project addressed parts of 34 residential lots scattered across 11 urban blocks, where
some historic occupations began as early as 1838 according to title records (see Chapter 8). The
archeological investigation was intentionally focused upon locating and sampling features that were older
than 1870 in order to maximize results and satisfy the Texas Historical Commission’s concerns for
compliance. In total, 80 discrete features was demarcated as potentially older than 1870; however, 18 of these
features did not produce any ceramic vessel sherds from the portions excavated. In Appendix G, ceramic
vessel data recovered from 62 distinct features spread across six blocks are reviewed on a feature-by-feature
basis.
Significance of Features Containing Ceramic Vessel Sherds
A total of 62 features yielded 2,708 fragments representing at least 867 ceramic vessels from the partial
excavation of six city blocks. While this is a sizable assemblage of vessels, it is not what would be expected

90

from the intensive search of over 30 house lots if the occupants discarded their broken ceramic vessels in
trash pits, privies, or other features on their premises. This point is not to discredit the ceramic material
recovered but rather to place it within the larger social context that more fully understands and appreciates
pre-1870 southern lifeways. Instead, the ceramic data underscore the fact that broken vessels were more
likely discarded as sheet refuse rather than intentionally tossed into pits, depression, holes, and privies. In this
regard, the 62 features that produced ceramic data also provide a broader view of each house lot because they
frequently captured sheet-refuse samples from earlier activities. These sheet-refuse sherds, when recognized
for what they represent, bring with them other kinds of information that broaden the range of data recovered
from each lot. This point becomes more evident as this final section on the ceramic data regrouped the
information back into house lot contexts.
Ceramic Vessel Evidence: Basic Feature Concepts and Results
Analysis of the 62 features containing ceramic vessel sherds produced few repetitive patterns from a
depositional context. That is, each major feature (i.e., defined as containing more than five ceramic vessels)
seems to have its own unique ceramic contents and depositional history. In fact, there were no features where
one could fully reconstruct an entire group of ceramic vessels. Reconstructable vessels are an important
constituent denoting modern dumps and some kinds of special trash pits. The recovery of so few fully
reconstructable ceramic vessels reveals that major trash pits where a household discarded all their unwanted
refuse over a period of five years or more were not among the excavated features. These kinds of
concentrations of broken ceramic vessels representing the discarded remains of household items thrown away
and subsequently sealed from future activities were not evident. This means that trash pits used for burying
unwanted household waste on a repetitive basis for more than a couple of years were not encountered, since
they would presumably also have yielded dozens of fully reconstructable ceramic vessels.
Consequently, the special use or unique depositional history of each of the features yielding ceramic sherds
cannot be ruled out when ceramic data are considered. It cannot be assumed that each feature’s ceramic
assemblage has a similar depositional history, which makes it harder to form comparisons on a one-to-one
basis. One feature may be the result of refuse thrown away by a tenant cleaning out an outbuilding, while
another may be the reworked remains of several privy cleanings upon which some household refuse was
discarded and then yard debris tossed in to close the pit. The possible sources of partially reconstructable
ceramic vessels and large amounts of sheet refuse make a clear interpretation of many of the features hard to
construct. Instead, the chaotic nature of the urban house lot seems to indicate that finding time capsule
assemblages of entire deposits of common everyday household trash is not easy.
As a result, the following comparisons were considered using the suggested functions/ major characteristics of
most features that had been assigned during excavation. It is hoped that the labels assigned to various features
provide one way to sort the features into meaningful groups. They create five major feature categories and
also a sixth ‘catch-all’ group with one-half dozen other rather unique features. Each group is discussed
below.
Postholes, Piers, and Structural Foundations (n=39)
This category consists of ceramics removed from holes and pits used to seat wood posts or brick piers and
other brick structural remains. Ceramic data from postholes are given in Table 9.1; data from brick piers and
foundations are given in Table 9.2. A total of 6.1 percent of all the ceramic vessels enumerated came from
postholes or pier holes. Another 34 percent came from brick wall roots, foundations, and scatters associated
with structural remains. In a few cases, some artifacts came from the post mold rather than the surrounding
posthole, but this apparently was not indicated for ceramic sherds. There were 18 postholes and 13 brick
piers listed in the feature inventory used during ceramic analysis. Seven other brick features were also
included. Ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from 11 postholes, seven brick pier holes, and five other
brick features, indicating 59 percent of these kind of features actually captured ceramic sheet-refuse sherds.
Since postholes and brick pier holes are not very large, these data suggest that ceramic sheet refuse was fairly

91

common in the areas investigated and had a good chance to be captured in the fill used to seat posts and piers.
Only two brick pier holes and two postholes also contained a few ceramic sherds larger than common sheet
refuse.
The average ceramic sheet-refuse index for both piers and postholes was fairly high whenever ceramic sherds
were recovered. They indicate that about 90 percent of the ceramic sherds recovered from both kinds of holes
represent captured sheet refuse. Typically, from four to six ceramic sherds were recovered (excluding the
ceramic-less holes), representing two to four vessels per hole (again, when ceramic sherds were present).
Imported stoneware vessel sherds were absent, chamber pot sherds were very scarce (only one vessel
indicated), and domestic stoneware sherds very scarce (only two vessels indicated). Only five porcelain
sherds were recovered from these features, and 72 refined earthenware sherds were recovered.
In some yard areas, the absence of ceramic sheet-refuse sherds or any other sheet-refuse artifacts in postholes
or brick pier holes may indicate an initial structure built before any sheet refuse had accumulated in the
vicinity of the holes. When such occurrences form linear patterns, they define early fences or early structures
constructed in areas when substantial sheet refuse had not yet accumulated. On some lots, this may have
occurred during the 1840s, 1850s, or even 1860s if previous owners never constructed any improvements.
This ceramic analysis did not integrate results of other artifact data sets, so conclusions are not reached.
Possible candidates for early construction are brick piers F5002, F5003, F5007, F7010, F7022, and F7023.
Posthole candidates include F1050, F1053, F7042, F7043, F7049, F7050, F7051, F7054, and F7064.
Examination of artifact contents from postholes and pier holes requires complete removal of fills and
separation of post mold from posthole. In some cases, fence posts are pulled or left to rot and can capture
sheet refuse at the end of their life span as material falls down their ghost holes. Consequently, careful
separation of the post mold from the posthole can help distinguish these differences. Excavators may find it
difficult to visually separate these two areas, and so artifact occurrences may be accidentally misinterpreted.
Two features in this group, F5017 and F7005, were responsible for 265 ceramic vessels. Feature 5017
contained a sizable sample of sheet refuse that had been captured in a brick-laden depression; F7005 consisted
of a large complex of foundation deposits that also contained captured sheet refuse. It was sampled by more
than 11 test units. Both features yielded ceramic sheet refuse from the 1840s and 1850s, while F5017’s sheet
refuse also extended through the 1860s and well into the 1870s. Both features, along with the 61 others
yielding ceramics, underscore the importance of ceramic discards in the formation of sheet refuse on mid to
late nineteenth-century Houston house lots. In fact, one suspects that a greater majority of broken ceramic
vessels were scattered around the yard than carted offsite before 1875.
Refuse Deposits (n=21)
This category consists of sherds recovered from shallow depressions and artifact clusters. Some may have
been recovered from shallow holes dug for specific purposes, while others may have been excavated from
shallow yard wallows that collected sheet refuse and larger items. The degree and extent of feature definition
in the soil must have varied greatly since the ceramic sherd data provide no clear patterning. The ceramic
data from these refuse clusters are given in Table 9.3.
In all, 20.4 percent of all enumerated ceramic vessels (177 of 867 vessels) came from these amorphous refuse
deposits. They averaged about 22 ceramic sherds, representing roughly nine vessels. The range, however,
was great, and only 5 percent produced five ceramic sherds or less. At the other extreme, three of the features
produced 66, 69, and 73 ceramic sherds (see Table 9.3). The age of many of these refuse deposits also varied;
12 predated 1870, while another five mostly postdated 1870. Three refuse clusters contained too few ceramic
sherds to be able to confidently assign a date. They yielded 10.6 percent of the imported bottles and 19
percent of all chamber pots. These percentages closely match their overall ceramic vessel ranking (i.e., 20.4

percent), but these artifact clusters produced only 6.25 percent of the enumerated domestic stoneware vessels.
Distribution of these features, however, is heavily dominated by Block 117 occurrences, with 12 of the 20
features on parts of this block. Three were recovered from Block 103, three were from Block 118, and two
were from Block 173. Soil depositional episodes may be partly responsible for some of these refuse scatters,
since they appear to contain mainly sheet-refuse sherds. In fact, an average 83 percent of the enumerated
ceramic vessels were less than 10 percent complete (mostly only were about 2 to 4 percent complete).
This indicates sheet-refuse origins (see Table 9.3). If other artifact categories indicate otherwise, some of
these features may have more complex origins where some artifacts are directly deposited along with sheet
refuse containing ceramic sherds. The ceramic data point to two such features in this grouping that have
much higher frequencies of non-sheet-refuse sherds in them. Feature 1048A contained only 27 percent sheetrefuse-sized ceramic vessel fractions (14 ceramic vessels), while F2005, a post-1870 feature, held three
ceramic vessels at only 33 percent.
One of the post-1870 features, F6001, was called a ‘trash pit,’ but its ceramic indices do not seem to support
this label. In fact, 84 percent of its 25 ceramic vessels were enumerated from sheet-refuse sherds representing
less than 10 percent recovery fractions. Other ceramic indices also suggest that this feature may not contain a
high proportion of directly deposited ceramic refuse. Unless other artifacts show very different origins, this
feature may be more in line with these refuse scatters than with intentionally created deposits.
One other feature in this group, F7013, also consisted entirely of sheet refuse based upon the ceramic vessel
data. It was unique in that the ceramic sheet-refuse sherds were apparently captured and then protected before
they had been dispersed and trampled for very long. They are tangible evidence of sheet refuse that had been
apparently sealed in a soil horizon protected beneath a structure for a considerable period of time before
finally being buried and sealed. Buried sheet refuse is discussed in Appendix G.
Privies (n=8)
This feature grouping (Table 9.4) yields the strongest evidence for containing a greater proportion of
intentionally discarded ceramic vessel sherds than any of the feature groups compiled. Still, privies and
suspected privies also contained a fair amount of ceramic sheet-refuse material and did not yield pure deposits
with large quantities of intentionally discarded broken ceramic vessels. They underscore the probable fact
that privies also were not the main feature used to dispose of broken ceramic vessels. If so, one would expect
to find at least one privy example containing an assemblage of fully reconstructable broken ceramic vessels
where the refuse had not been cleaned out and the privy filled with atypical refuse before final sealing and
closure
Instead, the sample of eight privies reveal no privies with large sample of fully reconstructable ceramics,
suggesting that broken ceramic vessels were not simply cast into privies and subsequently carted offsite as the
privies were periodically cleaned. While two privies, F7001 and F7057, produced larger recovery fractions
for their ceramic vessels (i.e., six sherds per vessel on the average), they yielded only five and two ceramic
vessels, respectively, numbers that are well below the average number of 8.85 vessels/feature produced by the
Refuse Deposit group.The eight features identified as privies shared few physical characteristics (size, shape,
lining type, etc.) and produced widely varying ceramic assemblages. The mean ceramic vessel count for the
eight privies (F1048B, F1049, F1063, F1065, F5014, F7001, F7009, and F7057) is 28 vessels with a standard
deviation of 29 vessels, underscoring the lack of any predictable population average.
Deposits recovered from privies and suspected privies, based solely upon their ceramic data, suggest that they
were filled over comparatively short time spans on the order of 5 or 10 years at most. When older sheetrefuse ceramic sherds were also captured, they artificially extended the estimated lifespan of the privy. One
would expect that most privies used by a single household would need emptying or simple maintenance every
couple of years, if not sooner. A privy full of concentrated, decomposing human waste would eventually be

96

so unpleasant that even if it was not full, its users would either have it cleaned out or add a layer of fill just to
seal the odors. In either case, one would anticipate that most shallow depth privies (i.e., those less than 3.5 ft
[approximately 1 m]) would not be used for more than 10 years before they would have to have been
abandoned and sealed or cleaned and rejuvenated. Of course, the physical size or capacity of each privy and
the number of people using it, as well as how often odor-sealing fills were added and if rain water or ground
water affected their capacities, would also determine their active use-spans.
The estimated age or time span of each privy, based upon their ceramic contents, is given in Table 9.4. If one
excludes privy F7057, since it could not be dated very well using only two ceramic vessels, the average age of
the remaining seven other privies is 8.9 years with a standard deviation of 3.4 years. While these figures look
reasonable, the lack of precision in using ceramic date estimates cannot be overlooked. In fact, one cannot
discriminate two years of use from seven years of use if dozens and dozens of tightly datable ceramic vessels
are not recovered. In fact, both privies 1048B with 77 vessels and 5014 with 36 vessels may have been used
for only four or five years before being sealed; one cannot distinguish this shorter use-life given the broad
ages of many of the ceramic vessels recovered. The point is that when most ceramic vessels have
acquisition/use lives of 10 to 15 years, it is very hard to distinguish time periods finer than eight years. The
short probable deposition spans given in Table 9.4 were deduced on evidence of multiple matching vessels,
narrow pattern popularity dates, and occasional short-term manufacturer marks.
Many privy deposits revealed ceramic assemblage components that also have been used over longer time
periods and their contents were removed periodically, leaving open the question of how much ceramic debris
was cumulatively disposed in them. If one assumes that the eight identified privies are representative of
privies overall, then one would expect that at least one of them would reveal an example of intentionally
discarded ceramic vessels where full reconstruction was possible.
Only 14 features, or 22.6 percent (14 of 62), contained repetitive evidence of receiving intentionally discarded
broken ceramic vessels. The criterion used for making this decision required at least 50 percent or more of
the ceramic vessel assemblage from a feature to consist of more than 10 percent recovery fraction per vessel.
The 10 percent recovery fraction was used to remove most common sheet-refuse sherds from those that
entered the feature directly after a vessel was broken and discarded. That is, only 14 features yielded ceramic
vessel assemblages where at least one-half of the ceramic vessels consisted of 10 percent or more of each
vessel being recovered. This is, of course, rather generous and still does not indicate that the feature acquired
even a majority of the ceramic vessel sherds being discarded.
Instead, the 10 percent recovery fraction was used to separate most intentionally discarded vessels from
recaptured sheet refuse and other kinds of secondary debris that had derived from directly discarded sherds
rather than sheet refuse. The criterion, however, only required that more than 10 percent of a vessel was
recovered; consequently, this inflates the actual number of whole or nearly whole reconstructable vessels
recovered. Of course, the excavations were focused on pre-1870 features, and so all of the following
viewpoints are restricted to primarily pre-1870 contexts. If, in fact, one removes ceramic bottles from
consideration and looks only at the ceramic tablewares, kitchenwares, and related fine ironstone/whitewares
and porcelain vessels, the number of broken but fully reconstructable vessels tossed or buried in feature
contexts is less than two dozen, or less than 5 percent. There are less than 60 ceramic tableware vessels that
were more than 50 percent reconstructable from sherds, underscoring the fact that broken ceramic vessels
apparently were not discarded in the pre-1870 pits and privies unless these pits and privies were periodically
and thoroughly cleaned out and their contents carted off the premises every year or two. This, however,
seems unlikely, since sheet-refuse ceramic sherds are ubiquitous. Most abandoned pre-1870 privies and
sealed pits seldom revealed reconstructable ceramic vessels indicative of broken vessels intentionally
discarded by a household. One would expect that the last stage of some privies before they were ultimately
abandoned and sealed would preserve a representative sample of directly discarded refuse and spare their
contents from being removed from the premises.

None of the privies produced a really outstanding sample of dozens of fully reconstructable ceramic vessels.
The closest exception was F1048B, a privy that contained sheet refuse, recaptured sheet refuse, and
intentionally discarded ceramic vessel sherds. While it produced evidence of 77 ceramic vessels, only 16 are
50 percent or more reconstructable. That is, only 20.7 percent of its entire ceramic vessel assemblage appears
to be from intentionally discarded ceramic vessels that were 50 percent or more reconstructable. The
intentionally discarded ceramic vessels include seven ironstone/whiteware tablewares/utility wares (one
child’s chamber pot, two plates, two saucers, one platter, and one child’s cup), an ironstone/whiteware
ointment jar, a large porcelain saucer/twiffler, a yellowware mug, a porcelain finger bowl, a small gilded
porcelain toy basket, a gilded porcelain soap (?) dish, and three Bristol/Bristol-glazed imported stoneware
bottles. Only two ceramic tablewares, a plate and a saucer, were 100 percent reconstructable, whereas four
non-tablewares are both 100 percent complete and still unbroken (an ointment jar and three imported
stoneware bottles).
Wells and Cisterns (n=6)
The project identified two wells and four cisterns (Table 9.5). One of the cisterns produced no ceramic
sherds; however, it was not fully investigated after sampling indicated that it contained post-1870 fills. The
three other cisterns and two wells produced 70 ceramic sherds combined, or a total of 41 vessels or 4.7
percent of the entire vessel assemblage. Only one of these features, F7015, may have been sealed prior to
1870, based solely upon the ceramic sherd data, whereas all the other features in this group were sealed after
1890 (see Table 9.5). This is expected for water sources, since they would have been strategically valuable so
long as they were operating properly and not contaminated. Apparently, F7015 was no longer needed or had
gone sour, since it was filled before public water systems were available. It may have been closed when the
structure it was next to, F7005, was demolished. The recent age of ceramic sherds in all of the other
wells/cisterns indicate that they were filled after public water systems were available and fully dependable.
A few older sheet-refuse sherds from the 1840s were redeposited along with the fills used to seal these
features (e.g., F7015 and F7020). They indicate that some soil was probably taken from adjacent yard areas,
since occupation on this particular block (Block 117) started in the late 1830s. As the project’s filled wells
and cistern examples reveal, few households could afford to spoil their water source before 1890. Only after
public water systems were reliable did urban families begin to abandon their wells and cisterns, eventually
filling them rather than having to maintain them. Clean fills or artifact sparse fills for sealing urban wells
before 1890 seem to be more common, based upon both the current features and also on the author’s
experiences.
Drains and Gutters (n=3)
Three features were identified as buried drains or covered gutters that apparently carried runoff into adjacent
areas or features (see Table 9.5). Only one appears to have been constructed before 1870, F7045. In fact, the
ceramic sherds it contained include captured sheet refuse discarded in the first 10 years that the block was
occupied. It is estimated that the gutter may have been constructed sometime between 1848 and 1850, based
upon the small assemblage of ceramic vessels recovered. Most of the sherds appear to be sheet refuse
captured in the fill pushed back into the ditch covering the gutter. There is a possibility that the gutter may
have been constructed as late as about 1855, since the ceramic sherds may have been fully representative of
all the other artifacts also captured in the fill (see Chapter 10).
The other two gutters, F7021 and F2003, were constructed much later; therefore, they contained more recent
material along with older recaptured sheet refuse. The ceramic sherds indicate post-1880/1895 deposition
dates, making their material too recent for further consideration. They also contain 100 percent ceramic
sheet-refuse sherds, indicating that some broken ceramic vessels were still being discarded in yard areas
during the late 1800s.

Miscellaneous Other Features (n=4)
Four features fall into this category by default, since they did not fit in any of the previously noted groupings
(Table 9.6). Features 7032, 7033, and 7034 were glass alignments probably used as landscaping borders.
Feature 7032 also contained 94 ceramic sherds representing eight vessels. The other two features contained
one and 10 sherds (representing four vessels), respectively. The last exception, F7036, included at least 32
buried imported stoneware bottles along with a small sample of captured ceramic sheet refuse.
SUMMARY
Except for F1048B and F7036, no features containing 50 percent or more non-sheet-refuse ceramic vessels
produced a total ceramic count greater than 14 vessels. This adds further support to the view that ceramic
vessels broken in pre-1870 contexts were discarded more often in places other than privies and pits. While
some household refuse was undoubtedly carted off each block during the pre-1870 period, apparently a
meaningful percentage of broken ceramic vessels were simply tossed into yard areas to add to the
accumulation of sheet refuse. Only the fill matrix from one feature, a posthole (F7053), yielded a ceramic
sherd larger than typical sheet refuse. It contained fragments representing 30 percent of an ironstone
whiteware cup. The 61 other features that contained ceramic vessel fragments also produced typical sheetrefuse-sized sherds. Consequently, all of these features support a model of households discarding a
proportion of their broken ceramic vessels by using common sheet-refuse disposal practices. This requires
considerable reduction of the sherds, so that single vessels end up in 50 to 100 fragments and are subsequently
scattered across the active house lot. Then, as pits and holes are excavated, filled, and sealed, small sheetrefuse-sized ceramic sherds are captured by their fill matrix and incorporated in their assemblages.
The Ball Park Project’s master feature list includes 80 features predating 1870 (see Appendix C). The list
excludes many post-1870 architectural remains and features, since they were not within the time frame of
primary interest. Some of the features that were assigned numbers did not produce any ceramic vessel sherds.
Other features were either entirely sterile or simply produced other kinds of material (brick piers,
architectural materials, bottle glass, etc.). A discussion of features not containing ceramic sherds is beyond
the focus of this chapter. Only the briefest summary is offered here (Table 9.7).
If disposal of broken ceramic vessels as sheet refuse was not practiced by families living on a particular block
and lot, one would not expect many ceramic sherds in features that also were back-filled with topsoil from the
yard. To pursue this possibility, the distribution of features containing ceramic sheet refuse was checked.
Table 9.8 presents the results.
A comparison of the estimated oldest captured ceramic sheet refuse evident from feature fills with the earliest
occupant/dwelling noted for each lot produced mixed results. Only eight lots produced ceramic sheet-refuse
initial dates from feature fills that fell within about five to 10 years of their archival dates for initial dwelling
constructions (Lots 103-2, 102-3, 102-8, 117-Wells occupation, 117-3, 117-5, 117-11, 118-12, and 173-9).
Seven lots produced ceramic sheet-refuse estimates that were too late (Lots 118-3, 118-7, 118-8, 162-9, 16210, 163-6/7), and five lots yielded estimates that were more than 10 years too early (Lots 102-9, 117-1, 117-8,
117-9, 162-11) when compared to the construction date of their first dwellings. Six lots did not yield enough
ceramic data from features to make any assessment (Lots 117-2, 117-4, 117-6, 117-7, 117-10, 117-12).
The weak correlation between initial lot occupation and oldest sheet refuse is due to several factors. First,
some lots received sheet refuse from households occupying adjacent lots well before there were any dwellings
built exclusively within their lot lines. For example, occupation on Block 118 consisted of quarter-block
holdings in the late 1850s, making it likely that sheet refuse from the occupants of the large house on Lot 10
undoubtedly extended across much of Lot 9 and possibly even into the north half of Lot 8. Second,
estimating the earliest evidence of sheet refuse from limited feature contexts may not always correlate with
the earliest occupation of a lot, since the age of the ceramic vessels may be five, 10, or sometimes even 15
years older than the date when they were cast into the yard. This is particularly true when the household was

101

well established and still used many of its older vessels. On occasion, ceramic sheet-refuse sherds may also
appear younger than their sheet-refuse age when they are from newly purchased wares just coming into
fashion. Finally, the number of captured ceramic sheet-refuse sherds recovered from each feature was often
not very large. Sample size played a role in the accuracy of estimating the oldest sheet refuse when small
samples were not representative of the earliest occupation of a lot.
Summary of Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 103 (Feature Series 1000)
Two of the nine features tested on Block 103 did not produce any ceramic vessel sherds. The ceramic-sterile
features were on Lots 2 and 3, and the Lots 7/8 line. Three other features on Lot 2 (F1048A, F1048B, and
F1049), however, produced sheet-refuse sherds in their fill matrix. Two other features on Lot 3 (F1025 and
F1066), one on Lot 8 (F1063), and another on Lot 9 (F1065) also contained sheet-refuse-sized ceramic sherds.
Consequently, occupants of Lots 2, 3, 8, and 9 discarded a fair proportion of their broken ceramic vessels in
their yards. Some of these sherds were subsequently captured by some features before they were permanently
sealed.
Seven features produced ceramic vessel sherds in the excavations conducted on Block 103 (F1025, F1048A,
F1048B, F1049, F1063, F1065, and F1066). A total of 151 ceramic vessels was identified in the analysis of
the sherds from all of these features. Only six features, however, produced ceramic vessels counts greater
than three vessels. These include two privies (F1048B and F1065), two possible privies (F1049 and F1063),
and two refuse scatters (F1025 and F1048A). One feature produced only trace amounts of ceramic vessels
mainly from recaptured sheet refuse (F1066). This synthesis addresses the features that contained the larger
ceramic assemblages.
Only three major clusters of features on Block 103 yielded small- to medium-sized ceramic assemblages: (1)
along the middle of the Lot 8/9 north boundary line (F1063 and F1065, producing a total of 25 ceramic
vessels); (2) in the extreme north corner of Lot 2 and spilling over into Lots 3 and 12 (F1048A, F1048B, and
F1049, producing a total of 100 vessels); and (3) near the middle of Lot 3 (F1025, producing a total of 22
vessels). These clusters are addressed by age and ownership below.
Robert Brewster apparently constructed the first dwelling on Block 103 (on Lot 8). The oldest ceramic sherds
in sealed feature context on Block 103 were recovered from F1065, a privy located just north of the Lot 8/9
boundary line. Since Brewster owned the entire block, the material in F1065 appears to date solely from his
period of ownership. Brewster allegedly moved to another section of Houston in 1848 and sold the entire
block to James Dumble in August 1853. Feature 1065 contained a modest assemblage of 14 ceramic vessels,
based upon both recaptured sheet refuse and directly discarded broken wares. Only about 36 percent of its
ceramic vessels were apparently from captured sheet refuse. The age span of ceramic wares in F1065
suggests that the household responsible for the vessels was established in the early 1840s if they came from
only one family. The feature was probably sealed when the block was sold to James Dumble in 1853.
Feature 1063, located approximately 4-5 ft (1.5 m) south of F1065 on Lot 8, was identified as another
possible privy. The ceramic sherds it contained seemed to have been discarded in the approximately 1850 to
1855 period, with this feature being sealed by 1860 at the latest. A total of 11 ceramic vessels was identified;
73 percent (n=8) were from captured sheet refuse. Consequently, this feature was probably constructed after
1853 and used by the occupant of Brewster’s house for a few years after Dumble acquired ownership of the
block. Some of the captured sheet refuse, of course, relates to ceramic vessels discarded during Brewster’s
ownership. The practice of discarding broken ceramic vessels into these pits apparently changed along with
the ownership shift after 1853.

Feature 1025 was located towards the back of Lot 3, and the ceramic vessels identified within it date from
Dumble’s ownership. Once again, the ceramic sherds are mainly from captured sheet refuse and seem to date
from the 1865 to 1875 period, with some older sherds also present. The feature yielded evidence of 22
ceramic vessels probably related to a structure/dwelling shown straddling Lots 2 and 3 in 1873. This structure
was apparently built after 1869 and may indicate that F1025 postdates 1869. The occupant of this structure is
unknown but is the most likely candidate for the ceramic refuse in F1025. Also, apparently Dumble owned
the lot during this same period, thus the occupant would have been a tenant living in a tenant house.
Feature 1048A, F1048B, and F1049 were located in the extreme northern corner of Lot 2 and were related to
the occupant of Lots 2 and 3. They produced ceramic vessels related to the post-1856 occupation of this
section of the block, along with some sherds from older vessels or older sheet refuse. All three features
contained a large percentage of directly discarded ceramic material, as well as a smaller proportion of
captured sheet-refuse sherds (27 percent, 38 percent, and 50 percent captured sheet refuse for F1048A,
F1048B, and F1049, respectively). A comparison with other features on Block 103 and elsewhere in the
Project Area reveals that these captured sheet-refuse percentages are low.
The oldest feature based solely upon ceramic data among these three on Lot 2 was F1048B, a barrel privy. Its
ceramic material suggests that it was used for a considerable period of time from the late 1850s to about 1870.
Also, some of its material was directly related to the ceramic vessel sherds in F1048A; cross-mended sherds
verified this situation (see Appendix G). The ceramic material in F1048A appears to be much shorter in
depositional time span and was assigned an approximate 1865 to 1872 time frame. This would place
abandonment of both features at about the end of the Frederick Schweikart period of ownership (1866-1872).

104

Feature 1048B, however, may have been constructed by John Stansfield, with continued use by subsequent
occupants until its abandonment in the early 1870s.

lots not listed did not produce features containing ceramic vessels sheet refuse
Block 162, Lot 9, used by Lot 10 occupant
italicized dates indicate possible related evidence from adjacent lots or trace amounts of sheet refuse

The last feature of importance, from a ceramic viewpoint, on Block 103 is F1049. It was located just south of
F1048B and was identified as a possible privy. It was considerably later in date and yielded ceramics
suggesting an approximate 1880 to 1885 period of deposition, along with some older captured sheet refuse.
The owner of the lot during this period was Mary Williamson.

105

As the above discussions reveal, the oldest ceramic feature contents were recovered approximately 16-25 ft
(5-8 m) from the oldest purported dwelling constructed on Block 103 and located on Lot 8. They came from
F1065 and are representative of a household established in the early 1840s. The ceramics were brought to this
block apparently in 1848, based upon archival data. Evidence of pre-1850 ceramic sherds in sheet-refuse
contexts elsewhere on Block 103 is restricted to the extreme northern corner of Lot 2 and apparently relates to
John Stansfield, who occupied the closest dwelling from 1856 to 1865. Thus the pre-1856 sherds probably
belong to the older ceramic vessels brought to this part of Block 103 by the Stansfields when they moved onto
the premises in 1856 or 1857. Finally, F1025 yielded both discarded ceramics and captured sheet refuse that
are compatible with the construction and occupation of a structure after 1869, but before 1873, based upon
archival maps. The occupant of this dwelling is not mentioned in archival data, and the ceramics in F1025
indicate that its household contributor had brought along some older wares.
One vessel (Vessel 10) from F1025 predates 1850 and was probably from Brewster’s occupation rather than
from the Stansfield’s occupation. It underscores that the extraneous scatter of sheet refuse can occur quite
easily in urban settings. Overall, however, the age of ceramic sherds by lot from Block 103, even when
recaptured sheet refuse is taken into account, matches quite well with the archival record for occupational
phases.
Summary of Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 118 (Feature Series 2000)
Block 118 is best viewed by its quarter-block occupations after 1850 and up to about 1870. Although the
entire block had only two dwellings before 1850, ceramic vessel evidence from this earliest occupation
starting in 1839 in the vicinity of Lot 4 was not forthcoming despite exposing a sizable, high-probability area.
In the end, excavated areas were focused on the far back corners of three of the four quarter-block partitions.
The northwest quarter block produced no significant pre-1870 features, after about 20 percent of its highest
archeological potential area was searched (i.e., highest potential for backyard privies and refuse pits).
Similarly, about 13 percent of the highest potential area was searched on the northeastern quarter block and
no significant pre-1870 features were uncovered. It did produce ceramic sherds from 11 vessels deposited
around the beginning of the twentieth century from F2001, indicating that some in situ material was
encountered. The lack of pre-1870 ceramic sheet refuse in materials from F2001 may indicate extensive
landscaping activities and the removal of older yard soils sometime after 1870.
The southwestern quarter block produced no significant pre-1870 features after nearly 10 percent of its area
was searched. It did, however yield eight features that were documented, four of which produced evidence of
16 ceramic vessels compatible with post-1870 discard activities (F2002, F2003, F2004, and F2005). Once
again, the features revealed no recognizable pre-1870 ceramic sheet refuse, suggesting that most pre-1870
soils had already been removed from the areas where post-1870 features were encountered. In addition, the
four post-1870 features that produced ceramic vessel sherds revealed that post-1880 ceramic sheet refuse did
form across this portion of the block. F2005, which produced 22 sherds from three ceramic vessels, also
contained non-sheet-refuse ceramic sherds, all postdating 1870 and probably sealed by 1885 at the latest.
The southeastern quarter block produced the only significant pre-1870 feature containing ceramic vessel
sherds (F2006). About 2 percent of its area was searched and only one feature was recognized. It was
designated as F2006 and produced 22 sherds representing five ceramic vessels that are indicative of wares
discarded in the late 1850s and 1860s. Four of the ceramic vessels are represented by sheet-refuse-sized
sherds, suggesting that post-1855 yard soil was still intact when the feature was filled. The first occupant of
this quarter-block section of Block 118 was C. W. and Nancy Sears, who apparently moved there in 1859, and
moved away by March 1866. This feature may be related to their occupation if the ceramics are also
representative of the ages of rest of the remains.
The lack of ceramic sherds from vessels older than 1870 from three of the four quarter-block sections (Lots 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, and half of 3 and 12) examined on Block 118, despite reasonable sampling, suggests

106

that extensive reworking of yard soil seems to have taken place by 1880. Archival data reveal that several
dwellings were moved from their lots before 1870; this may have contributed to the loss of pre-1870 intact
sheet refuse in the features sampled (see Chapter 8). In fact, the oldest dwelling constructed on Lot 4 was
apparently moved several times across the block by Peter Gray between 1850 and 1870. The second oldest
dwelling was also moved from it first location on Lot 8 to Lot 10 in 1850. Finally, the dwelling shown on
Lots 1 and 2 in 1860 may have been moved there by 1859 and then off again before 1869. It was apparently
relocated on Lots 9 and 10 by 1866. Also, another structure appears to have been moved to Lots 9 and 10 by
Allen Gray shortly after he acquired the premises in 1866.
The lack of older sheet refuse in the feature fills on the excavated portion of Block 118 may be directly
related to the physical relocation of dwellings on the block between 1850 and 1870. In any event, the post1870 dates for ceramic vessels from three-fourths of the block and the lack of ceramic-rich, pre-1870 features
beyond F2006 make it hard to interpret the pre-1870 residents much beyond the data presented in Appendix
G.
Summary of Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 163 (Feature Series 4000)
Block 163 excavations were limited since the foundation of a standing structure obscured about 30 percent of
the lots. Only parts of Lots 6 and 7 were cleared; they produced no pre-1870 features, although they were
apparently occupied by 1839. Of the two features investigated, one was a posthole designated as F4001 that
produced no ceramic sherds. The other was a cistern designated as F4002 that yielded only late nineteenthcentury ceramic sherds and a few older sheet-refuse sherds. The earliest occupation suggested by the older
captured ceramic sheet refuse in F4002 is the 1850s. Since only 10 ceramic sherds were recovered from
F4002, the small ceramic sample conveys limited information. Little more can be said about the occupation
of this block, based solely upon ceramic vessel sherds.
Summary of Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 162 (Feature Series 5000)
Block 162 excavations were focused on parts of Lots 9, 10, and 11. Although a total of 10 features was
recorded, only seven features yielded ceramic vessel sherds. Among these seven features, only two yielded
sizable ceramic vessel counts. F5014 contained evidence of 36 vessels, while F5017 contained sherds from at
least 126 vessels. The remaining five features were brick pier pits that had captured mainly sheet-refuse
sherds when they were constructed (F5005, F5006, F5008, F5009, and F5019).
Ceramic vessel data from Lot 9 came from one feature (F5017), which had captured sheet refuse indicative of
occupation spanning from the late 1840s to about 1880. Ownership of Lot 9 does not suggest that any
dwellings were constructed on it until after 1873; this is backed up by various historical maps. In fact, the
only occupant on the entire block up to 1870 lived in a dwelling on Lot 10. This suggests that even though
F5017 and F5019 are physically located just beyond Lot 10, their pre-1865 ceramic vessel sherds were
probably nevertheless discarded by the household living on Lot 10. The privy listed as F5014 appears to have
been sealed by 1870, if the ceramic vessel fragments are equally representative of all other artifacts. A major
change in ownership occurred in 1871 when the Waits purchased property on Block 162 and subsequently
constructed improvements before selling the property to Hyman and Theresa Block in May 1873. This being
the case, F5014 would have had to be abandoned by the occupants of Lot 10, the Cohen family, since it was
located on property purchased by the Waits. The Cohens moved to Lot 10 in 1861; the age of the ceramics in
F5014 includes some vessels acquired in the mid to late 1850s. Analysis of all ceramic vessels from F5014
suggests that some older 1850s sheet refuse had been captured by the feature, attributing a portion of its
ceramic assemblage to earlier occupants of Lot 10 before the Cohens moved onto the premises.
Feature 5017 presents the same situation, since it contained extensive ceramic sheet refuse from the mid to
late 1840s to the late 1860s. Consequently, this ceramic material must also have been discarded by the
household that occupied Lot 10. The northern edge of F5017 was located just 6 ft (1.8 m) from Lot 10’s
southern lot line, placing this feature in close proximity to Lot 10 occupation. The feature was sealed in the

107

1870s and may have been filled with soil containing sheet refuse taken from elsewhere on this section of
Block 162. A few younger ceramic sherds (i.e., post 1870) seem to have been incorporated in the matrix of
feature after it was initially sealed, probably by occupation on Lot 9, in the late 1870s. The discussion of
F5017’s ceramics in Appendix G attempts to associate the vessels to two major periods of ownership, with the
assumption that the artifacts were discarded by the occupants of Lot 10. No matter who discarded the
material in F5017, it unquestionably reveals that a sizable number of ceramic vessels were discarded by sheetrefuse practices from the 1840s to the 1870s. The origin of F5017 has not been determined. It may represent
a dismantled chimney base from an outbuilding (kitchen?) used by Lot 10 occupants and demolished before
new improvements were built on this part of the block in the late 1870s or 1880s.
The last group of features with ceramic sherds on Block 162 were brick piers from two dwellings on Lot 10
(F5005, F5006, F5008, F5009, and F5019). One structure was built after 1880 or 1885, based upon the
ceramic sheet refuse recovered from them, although sample sizes were too small from many to confirm this
view. If the structure had extended across the south line of Lot 10 and into Lot 9, the brick piers had been
removed after 1895 or 1900, and their empty pits overlooked, since they dated too recent. The 1895 Sanborn
map shows a dwelling on Lot 10 whose south face just crosses into Lot 9. If it was responsible for some of
the brick piers uncovered on Lot 10, its matching set on Lot 9 was not uncovered in the excavations. A
concrete platform constructed across this area on Lot 9 by 1916 may have contributed to the complete
removal of this last set of brick piers leaving only the deeper section of F5017 intact after 1916.
The ceramic sherds from features on Block 162 provide a partial picture of discarded vessels related to the
occupation of Lot 10 from the 1840s to the 1870s. Since only Lot 10 had a dwelling on it before 1870, this
part of Block 162 offered reasonable potential to look at the material culture of a single household.
Unfortunately, the dwelling was inhabited by several different families over a period of 22 years until the
Cohen family bought the premises and moved off the property in 1861. One of the previous owners was
Jacob DeCordova, who lived on Lot 10 around 1839 to 1841. The lack of occupant histories for the preCohen ownership period makes it hard to connect the older ceramic vessels to specific households. The
discussion given in Appendix G provides the most detailed interpretations of F5017.
In conclusion, 175 ceramic vessels were recognized from sherds recovered from features on Block 162. They
provide a glimpse into the ceramic possessions discarded by families living on one lot from about 1848 to
1870 (i.e., Lot 10). Distribution of several of the features indicates that the occupation and activities of Lot 10
apparently spewed over into adjacent lots, since no other houses stood on Block 162 until after 1870. Sheet
refuse captured in the two major features (F5014 and F5017) provides tangible evidence of these
undocumented activities before 1870.
Last of all, although archival evidence suggests that a dwelling stood on this block as early as 1839, ceramic
vessel evidence is lacking from 1839 to 1848. Either the ceramic representation of the seven features is
skewed against the first 10 years of occupation, or its intensity was less than expected, leaving fewer ceramic
discards behind. Possibly other artifacts from these same features may tell a different story for this block or
may strengthen the picture provided from ceramic vessels. Whatever the case, it seems reasonable to infer
that greater development of the block after 1870 contributed to the sealing of the two primary features
encountered just outside the boundary lines of Lot 10.
Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 173 (Feature Series 6000)
Excavations on Block 173 were focused upon Lots 8 and 9 that apparently had a dwelling on them by 1839
but which was missing by 1860. A newer dwelling was standing on Lot 9 by 1869 and was occupied by
Hugh Pannel, according to the 1869 W. E. Wood map. The premises stayed in the Pannel family until the
1890s when they were sold. Two features, F6001 and F6002, were identified on Lot 9 that produced a
combined total of 29 ceramic vessels. Both features appear to relate to the Pannel household, since the
ceramics suggest deposition between 1867 and 1882. Both features also contained ceramic sheet-refuse

108

sherds rather than a preponderance of directly discarded broken ceramic vessels. Some of the sheet-refuse
sherds in F6001 may relate to vessels acquired in the late 1840s or early 1850s. Other sheet-refuse sherds
relate to vessels discarded around the time the features were open and in the process of being sealed. Most of
the vessels, however, are compatible with ceramic types acquired after 1865 and, therefore, probably
discarded by the Pannel household. Since only 29 vessels were recognizable, little more can be said about the
household.
Ceramic Vessel Data from Block 117 (Feature Series 7000)
Excavations on Block 117 touched all 12 lots. Ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from 38 features
consisting of three privies/possible privies (F7001, F7009, and F7057), two cisterns (F7015 and F7020), two
related gutter/piping features (F7045 and F7021), a brick cooler (F7003), a well (F7024), nine postholes
(F7002, F7012, F7027, F7030, F7044, F7046, F7047, F7053, and F7055), two brick piers (F7016, F7052), 11
less well-defined refuse deposits or scatters (F7007, F7008, F7011, F7014, F7019, F7025, F7026, F7037,
F7039, and F7040), two other architecturally related features (brick scatter F7038, brick alignment F7031),
and six special features (a sealed section of early yard midden as F7013, brick footings for an early house as
F7005, a charcoal concentration as F7018, intentionally buried stoneware bottles forming alignments as
F7036, and intentionally buried glass bottles forming alignments for F7032, F7033, and F7034). A further
nine features were investigated that did not produce any ceramic vessel sherds (three brick piers F7010,
F7022, and F7023; five postholes F7042, F7043, F7049, F7054, and F7064; and refuse deposit F7029).
Ceramic data results from this block are summarized by lot and parcel below.
Lot 1 had five features investigated, three of which contained ceramic vessel sherds (F7019, F7020, and
F7021). These three features were sealed comparatively late, probably around 1895 or 1910, depending upon
the feature selected. They produced evidence of older ceramic sheet refuse, along with contemporaneous
ceramic discard. The first documented occupant of Lot 1 occurred between 1856 and 1858 when Francis
Ferrar apparently constructed a dwelling (see Chapter 8). The oldest ceramic vessels recognized date from
the 1840s, suggesting that either the earliest occupant was an older household that brought some older vessels
with them, or that soils used to fill some features on Lot 1 carried older material onto this portion of the block.
A total of 42 ceramic vessels was identified; however, the lateness of the features made their assemblages less
significant given the research design for the project. A description of the vessels from these three features on
Lot 1 is given in Appendix G.
Lot 2 excavations were focused towards the front of the lot and did not produce any pre-1870 features. Lot 2
had a dwelling by 1860 and was the second to the last lot to be developed.
Lot 3 was also developed after 1857 and excavations covered over 90 percent of it. Ten features were
investigated, nine of which yielded ceramic vessel sherds. A total of 84 ceramic vessels was recovered; most
were discarded after 1860 or 1870. Three of the oldest features were probably sealed in the 1860s (F7003) or
1870s (F7034 and F7038). Another three features were probably sealed in the 1890s (F7027, F7031, and
F7032). These late features also contained some older captured ceramic sheet-refuse sherds in their fills that
indicated earlier occupation from the 1850s onward. Lot 3 was first occupied about 1859, suggesting that the
oldest captured sheet refuse may have been from occupants living on adjacent lots (e.g., Lots 11 and 12).
Lot 3 also yielded ceramic sherds indicative of directly discarded material in F7003, F7032, and F7036.
Among these, F7036 was unique and consisted of imported German stoneware bottles intentionally buried
upside down, just off the back wall of a dwelling constructed about 1857. The stoneware bottles were
possibly buried in the late 1850s or 1860s, although a precise date for their burial cannot be determined at this
time (see F7036 discussion in Appendix G). The other two features consisted of a small brick-lined cooler
(F7003) that was probably sealed by 1861 or 1865, and a glass alignment with late ceramic material
intentionally discarded in the feature, probably sealed by 1890 (see F7032).

109

Lot 4 was investigated along its back section and only one feature was identified: a posthole that yielded a
possible early sherd from a pearlware-like vessel. The fragment is small and little more can be said. The first
dwelling on this lot was constructed about 1855. The small sherd may be from an earlier occupation of Lots
11 and 12 rather than from post-1855 activities on Lot 4.
Lot 5 yielded sherds from five ceramic vessels and other remains in a barrel-lined privy shaft (F7001). Only
one feature was identified on the back portion of this lot; four of its ceramics vessels are from broken items
that were directly discarded into it. The privy’s ceramic vessels suggest that it was used in the late 1860s or
earlier 1870s. There were four suggested owners or occupants of Lot 5 between 1865 and 1875, and it is not
possible to determine which household may have been accountable for discarding ceramic vessels in this
feature. Other artifacts may help narrow the age of the privy so that a likely household can be selected.
Investigations on Lot 6 produced only one feature (F7007) that contained ceramic vessel sherds. These sheetrefuse-sized sherds are from six ceramic vessels. They were probably deposited as sheet refuse in the 1845 to
1850 period (see F7007 discussion in Appendix G) and would be compatible with occupation of this lot by
the Bouillet household who constructed the first dwelling on this lot in 1848. While Mr. Bouillet was an older
French emigrant with a younger Swiss-born wife about 20 years his junior, the ceramic assemblage was too
small to capture any obvious ethnic signatures. Maybe other items in the feature will convey a clearer picture
of their owners than what is evident from the ceramic vessels.
Lot 7 produced no pre-1870 features despite fairly extensive stripping. This may reflect on the Bouillet
household, since they occupied the lot along with their residence on Lot 6 from initial development in 1848 to
at least 1877.
Lot 8 contained 17 ceramic-laden features fully within its lines and two other features that were 90 percent
within its boundaries (F7005 and F7009). It also had six postholes and a brick pier that produced no ceramic
vessel sherds. As such, 51 percent of all features investigated on Block 117 were within Lot 8 (26 of 51
features). They yielded several of the oldest historic ceramic assemblages recovered in the Project Area (e.g.,
F7011, F7013, F7014, F7026, and F7045) and strong evidence of ceramic sheet refuse discarded in the 1838
to 1860 period, along with some younger ceramic material. Although the chain of ownership title is not
perfectly clear for Block 117, Lots 8, 11, and 12 were retained by the Wells family until at least 1848. In
1851, Lot 8 was apparently sold at a Sheriff’s sale, but subsequent deeds indicate that Jane Wells sold the
same lot to Martin Floeck in December 1855, indicating that some legal wrangling may have taken place. In
any event, the pre-1848 sealed features on Lot 8 apparently relate to the Wells ownership, while the post-1855
to 1865 sealed features fall within the Floeck ownership. Unfortunately, Martin Floeck also owned dwellings
on Lot 10 (Block 117) and Lot 5 (Block 103), suggesting that he speculated in local property with houses.
The age of ceramic vessel fragments in each feature, however, may not directly correspond to the age of the
feature, since it depends on how each one was deposited. If the sherds are from broken vessels directly
discarded into the feature, they are contemporaneous with the feature; if they are captured sheet-refuse sherds,
they may be either roughly contemporaneous or older than the feature.
As noted previously, the ceramic sheet-refuse percentage provides a measure of how many ceramic vessels
within a feature lacked sherds larger than the size range of common sheet refuse. This percentage value for
the features on Lot 8, except F7005, was 100 percent for 13 features, and was 80 percent or greater for all but
two features with ceramic sherds (F7018 and F7053). Feature 7005 is excluded because it covers an entire
house foundation and has too many different sampling contexts to be combined in any meaningful way. The
two other feature exceptions with lower sheet-refuse percentages are both post-1850 deposits that account for
a combined total of only three ceramic vessels (or three sherds). In comparison, the other 15 features account
for 188 vessels (395 sherds), based upon individual feature counts, even when F7005 is excluded. Feature

110

7005 produced a rough vessel count of 139 ceramic vessels. Consequently, sheet refuse was apparently the
primary mode of ceramic vessel discard practiced on Lot 8 from its initial occupation by 1838 up to 1860 and
beyond.
The interpretation of ceramic vessels from F7005 is complex and problematic. In order to accurately assess
its ceramic vessel inventory, the entire ceramic collection would need to be laid out and checked for original
cross mends and same-vessel correlations (full vessel enumeration). This was not attempted given fiscal
limitations on the analyses and a greater focus on other feature issues. In fact, all ceramic sherds from all pre1848 features on Block 117 may share vessel designations; full enumeration is the only way to determine if
duplicate counts have occurred. Thus we are unable to say at this time if some of the pre-1848 sheet-refusesized sherds noted in F7007, F7008, F7011, F7013, F7014, F7026, and F7045 come from the same vessel
scattered across broad areas, the same ceramic matching set, or are merely from similar ceramic sets without
checking each example closely and looking for cross mends and other unique identification marks (body
defects, glaze defects, unique marks or unique wear patterns, etc.).
Lot 9 yielded only one possibly pre-1870 feature, a wood-lined privy, after about 20 percent of it was cleared.
Ceramic sherds from this privy account for only two ceramic vessels, providing little insight into the
household responsible for them.
Lots 10 and 12 produced no significant features and thus no ceramic samples. Lot 11, however, produced
fragments from 16 ceramic vessels from the excavation of three features (F7039, F7040, and F7044). These
mainly contained sheet refuse from a broad time period spanning from the 1840s up to the 1910s or 1920s.
Occupation of this lot apparently started with the Wells family certainly by 1842 and possibly even four years
earlier.
The oldest ceramic material on the entire block suggests that the Wells family made extensive use of much of
the block, since their house was located near the center of it and they owned all 12 lots. Records also indicate
no other occupants on Block 117 before 1848. Consequently, all ceramic vessels from the 1830s and early
1840s were probably discarded during the Wells ownership period. Many of the sherds were discarded as
sheet refuse and then were captured by features over the next 30 years of occupation of the block. Ceramic
sheet refuse probably from the Wells occupation period was evident from Lot 1 (F7019; green shell-edge
plate, ca. 1828-1835), possibly from Lot 4 (a pre-1840 sherd in F7002), and considerably evident on Lot 8
(F7007, F7008, F7011, F7012, F7013, F7014, F7026, and F7045, with many different pre-1842 ceramic
vessels). After 1848, three new dwellings were constructed on Lots 5, 6, and 8 of Block 117, and ceramic
sheet refuse from their occupations would have mixed with the older Wells debris. Families in these houses
would have brought some ceramic vessels from the early to mid 1840s when they established their
households. Some evidence of sheet refuse of the appropriate age for these three dwellings was recognized
from features on Lots 5, 6, and 8, as well as several adjacent lots (Lots 1 and 9). The extent of activities
evident from pre-1860 ceramic sherds recovered from this block indicates broad sheet-refuse disposal
patterns, extensive reworking of yard soils, or both.

GLASS MANUFACTURE AND USE IN THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY
Shawn Bonath Carlson

The nineteenth century represents a transitional period in the manufacture of glass. For nearly 2,000 years, all
glass was free-blown. Beginning in the nineteenth century, technological changes were introduced that used
various molds and lipping devices to achieve more uniform shapes. Combinations of shaping methods were
used throughout most of the nineteenth century. By the turn of the twentieth century, these methods were
consolidated by the introduction of machine manufacture. Some hand finishing continued during the early
part of the century, but for the most part, bottles and window glass manufactured during the first quarter of the
twentieth century are indistinguishable from those manufactured during the last quarter of the twentieth
century.
Although technological changes of the nineteenth century were most certainly related to the ease of
manufacturing glass, each decision to implement a different method resulted in new diagnostic attributes that
serve as chronological indicators for the archeologist. Because multiple attributes can be present in a single
artifact, particularly bottle glass, glass artifacts oftentimes provide the best chronological information about an
archeological site. These manufacturing attributes have been summarized by various other writers (BaugherPerlin 1982; Deiss 1981; Jones 1986; Jones and Sullivan 1985; Munsey 1970; Switzer 1974). This chapter
provides an overview of these manufacturing techniques and the terminology used to describe them, discusses
the glassware recovered from features excavated at the Ball Park at Union Station site, and attempts to
recognize trends in the glassware assemblage that are representative of nineteenth-century Houston. A
complete description of all analyzed glass artifacts is found in Appendix E.
EVOLUTION OF GLASS SHAPING AND FINISHING
At the turn of the nineteenth century, all glass vessels and containers began as a glob of molten glass attached
to the end of a blowpipe. Blowing through the pipe caused the molten glass to balloon out, and various
shapes could be achieved with careful manipulation of the glass. This phase of the process was known as
‘shaping.’ Later, a pontil rod was attached to the base of the vessel and the blowpipe detached so that the
mouth could be finished, hence the term ‘finish,’ which is typically used to describe bottle rims. The various
methods of shaping and finishing that were introduced during the nineteenth century are summarized below.
The diagnostic characteristics of those techniques form the basis for the chronological assessment of the glass
assemblage recovered during the current project.
Shaping
Containers
Glassblowing originated during the first century B.C. in the eastern Mediterranean and continued as an offhand process in the production of glass vessels until the late nineteenth century when machine production was
introduced (Frank 1982:19-21, 38; Munsey 1970:30). Thus during the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
before the formal platting of Houston, free-blown vessels were still being shaped by tactile manipulation with
the blowpipe (Deiss 1981:12; Jones and Sullivan 1985:17-22; Munsey 1970:30-32). Further shaping was
done through marvering (rolling) or the use of a carved wooden block, but the end product was always an
asymmetrical vessel. Designs were attained by blowing these irregularly shaped vessels into a pattern mold.

112

Pattern molds are also called small-size piece molds (Deiss 1981:12-15; Jones and Sullivan 1985:31-32;
Munsey 1970:38) and were a precursor to the dip mold.
The full-size dip mold, in use by the 1730s in England, provided the uniformity for commercial containers
that an off-hand product could not (Deiss 1981:15-17; Jones and Sullivan 1985:24-26; Munsey 1970:31, 38).
The generally square or cylindrical shapes were tapered to allow easy removal from the mold. Intended only
to shape the base and body, a dip mold required that the shoulders and finish be shaped by hand. Dip molds
were popular until the 1860s and made of various materials including, wood, fired clay, and metal.
Identifying characteristics include the pebbled surface caused by chilled metal molds and the glass blowover
encircling the shoulders of bottles blown into these molds.
Increased development of American commercialization and manufacturing during the nineteenth century
resulted in the proliferation of multiple-piece molds, which sped up the shaping process. The two-piece mold
was introduced during the second decade of the nineteenth century (Deiss 1981:48-49, 92; Jones and Sullivan
1985:26-28; Munsey 1970:39). Distinctive mold shapes and embossed advertising, made possible with the
use of a hinged mold, helped proprietors increase sales, while at the same time reduced the risk of competitors
counterfeiting their products. Two-piece molds are distinguished by seams on opposing sides that cross the
base. They were in use until the 1870s.
By the 1830s, a three-piece mold had evolved in the United States from the one-piece dip-bottom mold. It
was fitted with a two-piece section above the body that formed the shoulders and neck, hence the three-piece
dip-bottom mold, also known as a Ricketts-type mold (Deiss 1981:51; Jones and Sullivan 1985:29-30;
Munsey 1970:39). Used primarily for liquor bottles, these molds are easily distinguished by the vertical
opposing side seams on the neck that meet the horizontal seam around the shoulders. As with the one-piece
dip mold, they were tapered to allow easy removal of the container from the mold. By the middle of the
nineteenth century, use of this mold had expanded beyond liquor bottles and was used as late as 1905.
The next improvement in shaping occurred in 1858 with Mason’s three-piece plate-bottom mold (Deiss
1981:56; Jones and Sullivan 1985:28, 41; Munsey 1970:40). It was similar to a two-piece mold with
opposing seam lines extending from lip to base, but at the base a third section was added and a seam encircled
this base plate, either on the base or on the heel of the container. The base plate served to center the
container, thus allowing a uniform finish to be incorporated into the mold. Because the finish was
incorporated in the mold, there was no need for a pontil rod and thus no pontil scars. Mason initially used this
mold for threaded canning jars but later extended it to smaller mouthed bottles. When cracked off from the
blowpipe, these containers had rough lips that were ground smooth until use of the blowpipe was discontinued
in the 1860s. Sometimes these are referred to as blow-back molds. The shaping process continued to be used
until 1915.
By the 1880s, the turn-mold process had been introduced. This method eliminated mold seams by rotating the
bottle prior to its removal from the mold (Deiss 1981:68; Jones and Sullivan 1985:30-31; Munsey 1970:40).
Identifying characteristics include the absence of any seams or embossing and sometimes the presence of
horizontal striations on a highly polished cylindrical bottle. Use of the turn-mold was discontinued in 1905
following introduction of the automatic bottle machine.
Various semiautomatic machines were developed between 1892 and 1903 to produce glass containers (Deiss
1981:78-83; Jones and Sullivan 1985:35-39; Munsey 1970:40). It was Michael J. Owen’s patent of 1903 that
introduced complete automation to the glass industry. Utilization of this process was not immediate, but by
1930, 100 percent of containers were machine-made. In machine manufacture, the parison is formed in a
blank mold and then transferred to a full-size mold where its final shape is blown. Diagnostic characteristics
include mold seams, particularly those along the top of the lips; cup or post bottom seams; vertical ‘ghost’

113

seams along the sides of bottles; an irregular circular Owen’s scar on the base left from cutting the glass gob
from the parison mold; and a regularly shaped circular valve mark.
Tableware
The shaping of tablewares initially paralleled that of bottles, with off-hand shaping and pattern molds being
used at the beginning of the nineteenth century (Deiss 1981:32). Blown three-mold, a process using a threepart hinged mold, reached its popularity during the late 1820s (McKearin 1974:64). Vessels blown into this
full-size mold are recognized by three vertical seams and patterns that were the inverse of that carved into the
mold. Two basic mold shapes, bottle and tumbler, were used, and most vessels required further off-hand
manipulation, especially the addition of handles and other appendages. Flint, or leaded, glass was used for
most of these items. The blown three-mold process was abandoned in the 1830s after introduction of pressing
machines.
Pressed glassware first became available in the late 1820s and had the advantage of producing handled pieces
(Deiss 1981:72-75; Jones and Sullivan 1985:33-35; McKearin 1974:66). The process involves pressing a gob
of molten glass between a mold and a plunger. Pressed designs could be attained easily and more
economically than cut glass. The ‘lacy’ patterns with a stippled background helped hide imperfections in the
glass. Use of pressing machines quickly became widespread and contributed to the growing market for
inexpensive tableware. Characteristics of pressed tableware include seam lines and sometimes cutting scars
from removing excess glass. Pontil scars may also be found, although they are likely to be ground and
polished. In 1864, a more economic glass formula, using soda lime, was substituted for the previous leadbased flint glass (Husfloen 1992:52). Pressed glass continues to be made today, while cutting and engraving,
which requires hand working on flint glass, diminished throughout the nineteenth century.
Flat Glass
One of the earliest methods of producing flat glass was the off-hand crown process (Deiss 1981:26-28). Glass
gathered on a blowpipe was marvered and manipulated into a flattened parison. This was transferred to a
pontil rod and then spun in a furnace until it became a flattened disk. The extreme heat caused it to have a
brilliant surface, and its thickness varied from the center to its edges. Panes cut from this glass are extremely
small and usually ornamental. Its limited use gave way to the more efficient cylinder glass in the 1820s.
In the cylinder process, a long cylinder was blown (Deiss 1981:30). After the ends were removed, it was split
lengthwise and flattened in an annealing oven. Its large size allowed larger panes of glass to be cut than the
crown method allowed, and there was less waste. However, it has a lower reflective quality than crown glass,
and sometimes imperfections result from the splitting and annealing processes.
Semi-automation of sheet glass manufacture occurred in 1903 when the Lubbers cylinder window-glass
machine was introduced (Deiss 1981:84-85). The new process eliminated the need for glass blowers, but
splitting of the cylinder continued to be done by hand until 1917 when full automation was achieved by the
Libbey-Owens Sheet Glass Company. Plate glass is characterized by its uniform thickness, polished surface,
and absence of blemishes.
Finishing
Containers and Tableware
The most rudimentary bottle finish was formed by reheating the cracked-off surface of the bottle neck (Deiss
1981:20-21; Jones and Sullivan 1985:40; Munsey 1970:32, 42). This surface is where the blowpipe was
detached. By rotating the neck, a smooth fire-polished surface was created, and the lips were then shaped for
a cork closure with a porcellows (tongs). Further manipulation of the lip created a flanged (everted) finish,
which allowed for greater pouring control. If the lips were turned flush against the interior or exterior
(folded), the lips had greater strength. In the production of tableware, fire polishing was the most common

114

treatment of rims. Straight, flanged, and folded bottle finishes were all popular until improved finishing
techniques were introduced in the 1870s.
Ground surfaces are also found on bottle finishes and tableware rims (Jones and Sullivan 1985:40). Rough
grinding is generally done to remove excess glass or fit a closure to a bottle. More careful grinding,
resembling fire polishing, is found on tableware rims. Decorative grinding, or the use of scalloped or sawtoothed edges, is also a tableware technique.
The applied string rim was a band of glass applied to the exterior surface of the bottleneck to give it greater
strength (Deiss 1981:21-24; Jones and Sullivan 1985:40; Munsey 1970:32). It also served to hold the string
encircling the cork stopper. The popularity of this finish began to wane in the 1840s when lipping shears
were introduced.
When an applied string was tooled, it became an applied tooled finish (Deiss 1981:51; Jones and Sullivan
1985:40; Munsey 1970:32). Tooling was done with lipping shears that created a uniform finish and allowed
the use of standardized corks. The use of applied tooled finishes diminished in the 1870s as new technology
was introduced.
Improved tooled finishes were incorporated in the body of the bottle mold but required reheating to eliminate
the rough lip that Mason experienced with his 1858 mold (Deiss 1981:58-59; Jones and Sullivan 1985:40;
Munsey 1970:32). This finishing technique was not possible until development of the glory hole that allowed
reheating without heating the whole vessel. After reheating, the finish was tooled to eliminate the rough lip
and shape the interior for a cork closure. Improved tooled finishes are characterized by the absence of mold
lines on the upper part of the finish.
Machine-made finishes were also incorporated into molds but did not require the reheating and hand finishing
that improved tooled finishes did (Deiss 1981:80; Jones and Sullivan 1985:40-41; Munsey 1970:32). Vessels
made by this process are characterized by seam lines that extend the length of the body and encircle the
orifice.
Empontilling
Empontilling refers to the process used to hold a bottle or other vessel by its base while the opposite end, the
finish or rim, is being manipulated (Deiss 1981:18-20; Jones and Sullivan 1985:45; Munsey 1970:32, 47-48).
Usually a pontil rod with a small bit of molten glass is used for this task. When the molten glass is attached to
the base, the molten glass cools and adheres, securing the pontil rod in place. he blowpipe can then be
detached from the other end and the finishing touches completed.
When a pontil rod was used, it was a solid iron rod; alternatively, the blowpipe was a hollow rod. Scars left
by these two instruments differ (Jones 1971:68-72; Munsey 1970:47-48). The pontil rod leaves a solid,
circular scar of glass, whereas the blowpipe leaves a ring of glass. The blowpipe used as a pontil was by far
the most common method used in bottle manufacture. A third method, the improved pontil, was simply a hot
iron rod that adhered to the bottle base because of the extreme heat (Deiss 1981:24). Its scar is identified by
the iron scale that is sometimes left, as well as the absence of glass residue. Lastly, a sand pontil leaves a
faint stippled appearance. The molten glass was dipped in sand to allow adhesion but leave as little glass
residue as possible.
Beginning in 1850, the snap case, a claw-like device that gripped a bottle almost like a hand, was introduced,
thus eliminating the need for a pontil rod (Jones and Sullivan 1985:46-47; Munsey 1970:48). Finishes
continued to be hand manipulated until about 1870 when improved technology saw the demise of the snap
case as well.

115

Pontil rods continued to be used on tableware into the twentieth century. The scars were frequently ground
and then polished, leaving little evidence of their presence.
COMPARISON OF GLASS ASSEMBLAGES FROM FEATURES
Analysis of glass artifacts from the Ball Park Project Area focused upon the minimum number of vessels
identified. Although 7,244 individual items of glass were recovered, these were separated into the categories
of minimum number of containers (n=386), minimum number of tableware pieces (n=155), and minimum
number of ‘other’ items (n=32). Curved glass, with no diagnostic attributes other than color, and flat glass
were considered separately. In the following discussion, reference is made to specific artifacts that are
described in more detail in Appendix E. Features are described more fully in Chapter 17.
Foundations, Brick Piers, and Postholes
There were no whole containers or vessels recovered from foundations, brick piers, or postholes in the Project
Area (Table 10.1). This is probably not unusual considering the fact that these are built features rather than
excavated features. Most recovered artifacts probably represent sheet refuse that accumulated around the base
of these features.

Features 5002, 5003, 5005, 5007, 5008, 5009 (1890s house on Cordova lot)
This series of brick piers represented the remains of a house depicted on an 1895 Sanborn Fire Insurance map
of Houston (see J. K. Wagner & Company, Inc. and Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. 1997:Figure 8).
Each pier was sectioned and a unit dug around the base to reveal any builder’s trenches. No trenches were
apparent, and the sparse collection of recovered artifacts is believed to be sheet refuse that accumulated over
time around the base of the pier. Most of the glass artifacts are curved fragments that have little diagnostic
value. A single fragment from Feature 5008 (Container 147) is the applied down tooled finish of a bottle, ca.
1825-1875. This is consistent with an earlier structure (see below) that occurred on the site.
Features 5004, 5006, 5019 (Cohen house)
These brick piers were associated with William Cohen’s ownership of the lot in approximately 1861-1899+.
The piers were sectioned in the same manner as those above. Based upon their location and condition, they
appeared to represent a smaller, earlier structure situated inside the perimeter of the 1890s structure. Glass
artifacts recovered from Feature 5006 include three containers. One, Container 144, is a cylindrical amber

116

bottle with horizontal striations, suggesting that it was finished in a turn mold ca. 1880-1905. It has a deep
conical pushup and a flat heel. The second, Container 145, is a light olive wine bottle with a deep conical
pushup and large mamelon but with no pontil scar. It probably dates from 1830-1905. The last, Container
146, is a soft-drink bottle with an improved tooled finish, rounded top, and rounded lip. A molded inscription
on its side reads: Union Bottling Works. It dates at least from 1870-1915.
Feature 5019 also had several diagnostic glass artifacts. Container 162 is a clear green bottle with a one-part
straight finish folded to the interior; it probably dates to 1855. Container 163 is a light olive bottle possibly
finished in a turn mold. One clear undecorated tumbler, Tableware 88, was also found, as were fragments of
a chimney lamp (Other 23). Again, these artifacts most likely represent sheet refuse associated with the 1890s
structure mentioned above. There is no clear association of these piers with the Cohen family other than their
absence from the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps and their generally older appearance, i.e., soft orange brick.
Feature 7005 (Wells House)
Feature 7005, a massive brick spreader foundation, measured 18.4 x 38.1 ft (5.6 x 11.6 m). It was constructed
on top of wooden planks used to level the bricks. Artifacts associated with this feature actually came from 14
excavation units placed in a variety of locations, mostly adjacent to the interior and exterior of the foundation,
but also in the center of the structure. Other artifacts came from surface collections, profiles, and beneath the
wooden foundation planks. Glass artifacts were recovered from five excavation units and beneath two planks.
Excavation units were dug in one to three levels of 10 cm each. Fifteen containers were recovered, along with
eight pieces of tableware and one lighting device. No whole objects were recovered. Containers include
wine, whiskey, snuff, and condiment bottles, a toiletry bottle, and unspecified bottles. Tableware includes a
pressed bowl or saucer, a contact molded bowl, stemware, tumblers, and pressed hollowware. A lamp
chimney fragment was also recovered.
The wine bottles (Containers 247, 250, 253, 254, 255) are consistently dark olive in color with applied tooled
finishes. A pictorial whiskey flask (Container 259) was also found. The single snuff bottle (Container 248) is
olive with a flanged finish. One of the condiment bottles (Container 251) has a folded finish and a large bead
on the neck, while the other (Container 260) is a wide-mouthed jar with a flanged finish. The toiletry bottle is
12-sided, blown into a dip mold, and exhibits a glass pontil scar on the base.
All four tumblers (Tablewares 112, 114, 115, 116) are quite different. Although one (Tableware 112) is only
a fragment of a fluted tumbler, another (Tableware 114) is a 12-sided, fluted tumbler with sharp edges,
suggesting it was also cut. The base appears to be polished and the heel is ground. The next tumbler
(Tableware 115), also fluted, has only seven sides and a shallow depression, suggesting that its pontil scar has
been ground. The last tumbler (Tableware 116) is ribbed; its ribs are narrow and v-shaped. A shallow
indentation and a very small mamelon appear on the base of the tumbler.
Other tableware items include a clear pressed glass bowl or saucer with a starburst design on the base
(Tableware 109), an aqua contact molded bowl with ribbing (Tableware 110), a stemware base with a glass
pontil scar (Tableware 111), and horizontally ribbed hollowware (Tableware 113). The last item is a clear
lamp stem with glass disks between the base and the font (Other 27).
Excavation units placed around Feature 7005 were mostly filled with dark gray silty clay and a low density of
artifacts. Artifacts found beneath the foundation planks were also quite sparse but clearly indicate that the site
was in previous use or that artifacts were deposited during construction of the house. Unfortunately, the glass
artifacts are not particularly diagnostic. The single fragment from beneath Board No. 10 is a ribbed tumbler
(Tableware 116) with a very small mamelon on the base and no evidence of grinding. The mamelon should
be diagnostic, but its date and function are currently unknown (Jones and Sullivan 1985:Figure 79; Munsey
1970:49, Figure 5). Container 260, a wide-mouthed condiment bottle with a flanged finish, was found

117

beneath the south and east wall planks. This artifact has a long range of manufacture, probably ending around
1870.
Glass artifacts recovered from excavation units tend to date between 1860 and 1870. Ceramic artifacts date
between 1855 and 1860 (see Chapter 9). Recovered flat glass has a mean date of 1864.52+/-7 years. All of
these suggest a construction date sometime between 1860 and 1870. These dates are consistent with the
purchase of the property by Andrew Dunlap in 1865, who continued to own the property until 1882.
In summary, most glass artifacts recovered from structural features were not in situ. That is, they were
secondary deposits that had been initially dropped or discarded and then kicked around the site, becoming part
of the sheet-refuse midden. Even artifacts recovered from beneath the foundation planks of Feature 7005
probably represent existing sheet refuse. As such, they cannot be confidently tied to one particular owner or
activity. However, they are chronological indicators that provide some information about changes taking
place on site. The density of glass artifacts found in these features ranged from none to 288 per cubic meter
and averaged about 60 per cubic meter. The highest densities seemed to be clustered around the oldest
structure, the Wells house.
Wells and Cisterns
Feature 2002 (Well)
Artifacts recovered from this well were collected by hand sifting through trackhoe buckets of dirt removed
from successive levels (Table 10.2). Artifact density was sparse; the well had obviously been filled with what
appeared to be relatively sterile silty clay. The only artifacts collected came from the bottom meter of fill.
Three bottles, including one whole one, and two pieces of tableware were collected. The whole bottle is
cylindrical with an improved tooled patent finish; it has been blown into a three-piece cup bottom mold.
There is some evidence of a possible sand pontil scar on the base. A molded inscription on the side of the
bottle reads: Dr. Thompson’s\Eye Water\New London\Connt (Container 138). This bottle dates from at least
1870-1915. A second, partial container is a soft-drink bottle blown into a three-piece cup bottom mold with a
molded inscription on one side that reads: Star Bottling Works\Houston, Texas. This bottle probably
postdates 1874 (Janet K. Wagner, personal communication 1999). The last container, also a soft-drink bottle,
was blown into a three-piece cup bottom mold with a post. A molded letter ‘F’ on the post sources it to the
Pittsburgh company of William Frank and Sons, 1870-1876. The two tableware fragments are both clear,
undecorated stemmed goblets. These few artifacts indicate that the well was filled after 1870, probably
around 1880, when indoor plumbing was introduced in Houston.

Feature 2003 (Well Gutter)
Feature 2003 was a brick drain attached to Feature 2002 (well). Only a very few pieces of non-diagnostic
curved glass were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7024 (Well)
Artifacts analyzed from this well came from hand excavation of the upper 3 ft (1 m) of interior fill. Later, the

118

well was cross-sectioned, and some artifacts were recovered by trackhoe bucket from each of the four zones
before the well collapsed. Many appeared to date from the twentieth century. Most notable, a porcelain
commode, was recovered.
Glass artifacts recovered by hand excavation were primarily fragments of curved glass with little diagnostic
value. Colors of curved glass include clear amber, aqua, light olive, dark olive, opaque white, pink flashed,
and ruby flashed. Two containers could be identified. One is an oval-shaped flask (Container 319), the other
is a patent medicine bottle with an improved tooled finish and a crazed surface (Container 320). Molded
letters on this bottle indicate that it held the herb ‘elecampane’ and was bottled in Dayton, Ohio. This bottle
dates from about 1870-1915, suggesting that the well was filled at a time similar to Feature 2002, or after
1870.
Features 1001, 1002, 3001, 4002, 7006, 7015, 7020, and 7058 (Cisterns)
Although 13 cisterns were exposed during the investigation, only eight fell within the study period of 18301870. Because of the depth and instability of the cisterns, each was mechanically sectioned so that a profile
and photograph could be taken. The trackhoe bucket was used to remove interior fill in general levels that
were then examined for artifacts. Four of the eight cisterns had no glass artifacts present. From the other
four, only a handful of artifacts were collected to determine the date the cisterns were filled. For the most
part, the cistern fill was sterile and only a few diagnostic artifacts were collected. All were probably filled
between the years 1870 and 1880.
Privies
Feature 1048B
Feature 1048B, a barrel privy, was excavated in eight levels of 10 cm each, with 124 glass containers,
tableware, or lighting objects recovered (Table 10.3). Of these, six were whole vessels found in Levels 2, 3,
4, 7, and 8. A wide variety of bottles was recovered, including bitters, champagne, and wine bottles; patent
medicine bottles and a medicine vial; a soda bottle; perfume and toiletry bottles; condiment, olive oil, and
sauce bottles; an ink bottle; and a demijohn. Other vessels include goblets, tumblers, wine glasses, cordials,
saucers, bowls, serving dishes, and a vase. Fragments of lamp chimneys were also found. Cross mends for
Tableware 14 were found in Levels 2, 3, and 5, and for Tableware 35 in Levels 4 and 6.

Tumblers are most frequently occurring item and are present in a wide variety of styles. All are clear, and
most have a fluted or honeycomb pattern, although ribbed, paneled, and undecorated specimens were also
found. One tumbler can be identified as the Arched Band and Prism pattern, which dates to the 1850s (Grow
1982:76). At least one tumbler is cut glass, and some have ground lips and ground pontil scars.

119

Wine bottles were also found in abundance. All have applied tooled finishes and have been blown into dip
molds. The finishes vary from sloped tops and down-tooled string rims to flat tops and rounded string rims;
some have distinct grooves between the lip and string rim. Variety is also present in the dip molds.
Specimens were found with and without pontil scars, with and without mamelons, with flat heels or rounded
heels, with shallow or deep push ups, and with conical, dome, or bell-shaped pushups. Of the three light olive
champagne bottle finishes recovered, one has a fire-polished cracked-off lip, untooled laid-on ring, and drawn
neck with a shiny surface, while the other two are more finished with a sloped top and tooled laid-on ring.
Condiment bottles include a green wide-mouthed bottle with an applied tooled finish, an aqua cylindrical
bottle with a ground top, and a faceted catsup bottle with a three-piece plate bottom mold. Also, a clear green
olive-oil bottle with a cracked off finish, an untooled laid-on ring, and formed in a one-piece dip mold with a
bell-shaped push-up and no pontil scar was recovered. Lastly, a clear sauce bottle with a flanged finish and
drawn neck, and a dark aqua cathedral pickle jar made in a two-piece mold with a ground pontil scar were
collected.
Dates of manufacture for glass artifacts provided chronological information about each of the levels
excavated in this feature. The lower levels (Levels 5-8) seem to have been filled between the years 1858 and
1860. Two whole containers, Container 100 and Container 104, were found in Level 8 and substantiate filling
of the feature by 1860. Container 100 is a cylindrical bottle blown in a dip mold with a blowpipe pontil scar
and flanged finish that dates from approximately 1830-1860. Container 104 is Dr. Holland’s Vegetable
Hygienic Syrup bottle blown in a two-piece keyed mold with a glass pontil scar and an applied tooled finish;
it dates from about 1850-1860. However, Tableware 52, a partial vase made in a three-piece plate bottom
mold with chamfered corners and a ground pontil scar, narrows the time frame for Level 8 to 1858-1860.
Each of the succeeding levels, Levels 5, 6, and 7, were also dated to this period, based upon the introduction
of the three-piece plate bottom mold in 1858 and the cut-off date of ca. 1860 for pontil scars.
The upper levels (Levels 1-4) suggest that there was a gap in the use of this privy. In Level 4, a lavender
fluted tumbler (Tableware 33) was found that suggests this level was not filled until after 1880. Each of the
succeeding levels contained artifacts dating between about 1860 and 1880, indicating that the privy was
probably filled over a short period of time after 1880.
Based upon glass artifacts recovered from Feature 1048B, there appears to be two periods of filling for this
feature: one dates to around 1860, the other dates to around 1880. Chronological data from the ceramic
analysis suggests a fill period of 1848-1870. Window glass recovered from the privy provides a mean date of
1877.23. John Stansfield, who owned the property between 1856 and 1865, is probably responsible for the fill
in Levels 5-8. Much of the material in these levels dated between 1850 and 1860, suggesting that Stansfield
cleaned up the site midway during his ownership. After 1865, a string of people owned the property. The 20year gap in use indicates that the privy was not used after 1860; it was probably filled by a post-1880 owner
and then capped as public utilities became available in Houston.
Whole bottles found throughout this feature make it clear that trash was being dumped directly into the privy.
The variety of bottles, which include patent medicine bottles, olive oil, perfume, and other unidentified
bottles, also suggest that this was not selective dumping as, for instance, liquor bottles would indicate.
Fragments of Tableware 14 found in Levels 2, 3, and 5, and of Tableware 35 in Levels 4 and 6 indicate that
trash was also being collected from around the site before it was dumped into the privy.
Stratigraphic information for Feature 1048B supports the idea of two separate episodes of filling. The top
half of the barrel was apparently destroyed, and feature definition did not become clear until Level 3.
Excavators combined artifacts recovered from both the feature and its matrix through Level 4. At this point, a
wooden plank had been placed across the top of the barrel. From Level 5 through Level 8, the feature was

120

clearly defined and there were no artifacts recovered from the matrix of the feature. Level 7 was the only
level that exhibited lime and clumped newspapers. Throughout all eight levels, artifact density was high,
averaging 370 artifacts per cubic meter. The upper four levels were distinguished by the presence of large
bone and some building materials, such as wood, brick, and nails.
Feature 1063
Feature 1063 was excavated in three levels of 10 cm each. Five distinct but fragmented containers, tableware,
or lighting objects were recovered, but none was whole. Two were recovered from the surface, one from
Level 1, and two from Level 2. A tumbler in the Ashburton pattern was recovered from the surface of the
feature. This tumbler has a ground base and is covered in an unidentified black film. An eight-sided fluted
tumbler was also recovered from the surface; it has a ground base and is covered with the black film as well.
Fragments of an unidentified clear green bottle were recovered from Level 1, and fragments from two
separate lamp chimneys were found in Level 2.
This feature lies next to Feature 1065 and probably represents a second privy excavated after Feature 1065
was filled. Tumblers with the black film also occur in Feature 1065, although none seems to cross-mend
between features. It is possible, since the tumblers in Feature 1063 were found on the surface, that they were
spillover from Feature 1065. In any case, Feature 1063 was never excavated to any depth, suggesting that it
was perhaps only a temporary facility.
Feature 1065
Feature 1065 was excavated in 12 levels of 10 cm each. Twenty-nine distinct but fragmented glass
containers, tableware, or lighting objects were recovered. Of those 29, five are whole. The first seven levels
had from 0 to two glass containers/vessels represented per level, while Levels 9 and 10 had the highest
numbers of artifacts. Levels 8, 9, 10, and 12 had whole containers/vessels recovered.
Artifacts recovered from the privy include 12 water tumblers ands one whiskey tumbler, three patent
medicine bottles, a medicine vial, an apothecary jar, and a beaker; an olive-oil bottle, a condiment jar, a widemouthed condiment jar; three lamp chimneys, and three unspecified bottles. Cross mends were found in
Levels 6 and 11, Levels 10 and 12, and Levels 10 and 11.
Tumblers were the most commonly occurring artifact recovered from the privy and were found in Levels 2, 5,
6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Seven of the 12 clear tumblers are fluted with no specified pattern. One has a
honeycomb pattern (Figure 10.1), and the remaining four exhibit the Ashburton pattern, which dates from
approximately 1840-1870 (McKearin and McKearin 1948:394-395). The single whiskey tumbler is also
fluted. The number of flutes per vessel ranges from 6 to 8 to 10. One of the tumblers has a ground heel and
ground pontil scar. Interestingly, seven of the tumblers and the whiskey tumbler were covered with an
unidentified black film. The only other artifacts exhibiting this film are a medicine bottle and some tumblers
recovered from the adjacent privy, Feature 1063. Since the film was not present on all artifacts recovered
from the privy, it is presumed that those exhibiting the film acquired it while stockpiled elsewhere on the site
prior to being deposited in the privy.
The next most common group of artifacts is best categorized as medicinal. Three patent medicine bottles,
Containers 119, 123, and 124, exhibit varying manufacturing techniques. Container 119 is shaped in a twopiece mold but lacks a pontil scar, indicating that it had to have been handled with a snap case. Thus it would
have been manufactured sometime between 1860 and the early 1870s. The patent finish on this bottle is
flanged and ground.
Container 123 is shaped in a three-piece plate bottom mold and exhibits a ground blowpipe pontil scar. Since
plate bottom molds have been dated to 1858 (Davis 1949:82), and pontil rods were largely discontinued by

121

1860, this bottle probably dates to the very short period of 1858-1860. Embossed lettering on the sides of the
bottle indicates that it was from a chemist, but the company name is indistinguishable.

Figure 10.1. Tumbler with honeycomb pattern
recovered from Feature 1065 (privy).

Container 124 is also shaped in a two-piece mold and exhibits a blowpipe pontil scar. The applied tooled
finish has a flat top, a rounded lip, and a rounded string rim. Embossed advertising on the bottle sides reads:
Lyon’s Kathairon for the Hair, New York. In 1861, Harper’s Weekly advertised this product for those who
were prematurely gray or losing hair (Wilson 1981:65). Although the product was advertised after 1860, the
use of pontil rods had largely been discontinued, thus suggesting that the bottle type found in Feature 1065
was probably not made long after 1860.
Other medicinal artifacts include a vial, a beaker, and an apothecary jar. The aqua vial is made in a dip mold
and exhibits a blowpipe pontil scar. These attributes suggest a manufacturing date range of 1830 to 1860.
The clear beaker has no diagnostic attributes other than a flared rim. The apothecary jar, measuring 1.25 in
tall x 2 in (3.2 x 5.1 cm) in diameter, has straight, shallow sides but no mold marks. It does, however, have a
series of horizontal lines beneath the lip, indicating that it had been shaped while the vessel was turning. A
pontil scar is evident on the base. The absence of mold marks and the presence of a pontil scar suggest that
this small item may have been free blown and shaped by hand. A manufacture date of 1830 to 1860 is
suggested.
Chronological information from Levels 7-11 was used to establish a date range for each level, based upon a
minimum range of time during which the artifacts occurred together. The earliest manufacturing date for an
artifact is 1825, the latest is 1875. By applying the minimum range technique to Levels 7-11, the minimum
range during which the artifacts in these combined levels occurred together is 1858-1860. A mean flat glass
date of 1868.75 was also derived, but the glass fragments are so large that it is likely that these pieces
migrated downward due to their weight. Thus the glass may have been deposited at a different time.
Given the cross mends present in Levels 6 and 11, the whole containers present in Levels 8-12, and the virtual
absence of artifacts in Levels 1-7, this privy appears to have been filled during a relatively short period of
time around 1860. Although most of the assemblage dates from the period 1840-1860, there are two artifacts
that narrow this range considerably. One is a patent medicine bottle (Container 120) found in Level 9 that is
shaped in a two-piece mold but lacks a pontil scar, thus suggesting the use of a snap case. These attributes

122

narrow the date range of this artifact from 1860 to the early 1870s (Davis 1949:82). The other artifact, also a
patent medicine bottle (Container 124) that was found in Level 10, is shaped in a three-piece plate bottom
mold and exhibits a ground blowpipe pontil scar. The three-piece plate bottom mold with a blowpipe pontil
scar dates from 1858-1860 (Davis 1949:82). The overlap of these two artifacts is around 1860. Although
most of the artifacts recovered from Feature 1065 may represent refuse deposited across the site during
Robert Brewster’s ownership of the property from 1847 to 1853, the two patent medicine bottles extend this
deposit to James Dumble’s ownership beginning in 1853.
The relative absence of glass in the first seven levels of this privy suggests that these levels were filled
differently than Levels 8-12. In fact, there were several differences. The first two levels primarily consisted
of sand mixed with silty clay, along with brick, wood, and metal artifacts. Beginning in the third level and
continuing through Level 7, the silty clay became more predominant and deposits of ash and charcoal were
apparent. The brick fragments continued in these levels. Levels 8 and 9 were again characterized by sandy
soil, as well as large window glass fragments and other large items. Levels 10-12 were characterized by
alternating layers of clay, loam, and loam mixed with lime; the greatest density of artifacts was found in these
levels.
The strong odors emanating from this privy, combined with the presence of lime in the lower levels, suggests
that this was still an active privy when it was filled. However, the fact that Container 124 with a
manufacturing date of 1858-1860 occurred in Level 10 is significant. This suggests that it had not been long
since the last cleaning before trash was being dumped into the privy. The first episode of dumping is
represented in Levels 10-12, where alternating layers of clay, loam, and lime were intermixed with the highest
density of glass artifacts. Levels 8-9 represent the next episode where sandy soils and large artifacts were
introduced. Levels 3-7 are characterized by numerous deposits of charcoal and ash along with small brick
fragments. Lastly, Levels 1-2 were sandy soils with construction materials (brick, wood, nails, etc.)
The nature of deposits in Feature 1065 suggests that around 1860, when James Dumble had owned the
property for about seven years, he began serious renovation and cleaning of the property. The fact that the
privy was still in use when filling began may indicate that the privy house itself was in disrepair, perhaps
accounting for the construction materials found within the privy pit. Other deteriorating outbuildings could
also account for this material, and general cleaning up around the site could account for artifacts that predate
Dumble’s occupation of the site.
Feature 5014
Feature 5014, a rectangular wood-lined privy, was excavated in eight levels of 10 cm each. Fifteen distinct
containers or tableware were recovered, two of which are whole. These include one unspecified hollowware,
six unspecified bottles, one condiment bottle, two bitters bottles, a flask, three tumblers, and a demijohn. No
cross mends were found.
Some of the more diagnostic specimens include Container 150 from Level 2, an amber ‘log cabin’ bitters
bottle, possibly ‘Kelly’s Old Cabin Bitters,’ that postdates 1862. Another unspecified bottle from Level 2,
Container 148, is clear and fluted with side seams to the lip. The blowover mold had a threaded finish that
had been ground at an angle. This specimen dates from 1858-1915. Also from Level 2 are two bottle
specimens that could be quite old. One, Container 153, is a very thin-walled olive bottle with numerous air
bubbles, while the other (Container 154) is a very thin-walled flask with an impressed pattern. The demijohn,
which looks as though it was made from two layers of glass, came from Levels 3 and 4. Also from Level 3 is
a bottle with an applied tooled finish. The tumblers are all fluted, coming from the lower levels of the feature.
The two most diagnostic have six sides and eight sides, respectively, seams around the heel, and pontil scars.
Despite the high density of artifacts in this feature, there are few glass artifacts that could narrow the time
frame within which this feature was filled. A general date for the glass would be after 1860. The ceramic
artifacts indicate two fill dates: one around 1850 and the other around 1868-1870. Window-glass fragments

123

provide a mean date of 1864.46"7 years. Ownership of the property prior to 1860 is attributed to Jacob de
Cordova, although he did not live there. From 1861-1899, the property was owned by William Cohen, who
most likely filled this privy.
Stratigraphic information indicates that the first three levels of this feature had ashy deposits. In fact, Level 2
was almost entirely ash. By Level 4, the ash had disappeared. The presence of ash may serve as an indicator
that the privy was filled in two separate episodes. Artifact density was high throughout, averaging 156
artifacts per cubic meter, declining dramatically by Level 8.
Feature 7001
This barrel privy was excavated in six levels of 10 cm each. There were nine distinct containers or tableware
recovered, of which three are whole. Glass artifacts include one snuff bottle, two wine bottles, three
unspecified bottles, one bowl, and one tumbler. There are no cross mends.
The rectangular amber snuff bottle, Container 202, has a flanged lip that has been ground. Heels are
chamfered and the surface is rippled. It was recovered from Levels 4 and 5; its estimated date of manufacture
is 1850-1860.
Container 203, a dark olive wine bottle found in Level 6, has an applied tooled finish with a flat top, down
tooled lip, and down tooled string rim; the cork was preserved. This bottle dates from 1825-1875. Another
(whole) wine bottle, Container 207, also came from Level 6. Its applied tooled finish has a flat top, flattened
lip, and down tooled string rim. A seam around the shoulders and side seams half way up the neck indicate
that it was formed in a three-piece dip bottom mold with a drawn neck. There is lipping visible on the uneven
heel and the shallow pushup has a small mamelon at the center. Both the bottom and base of the bottle has a
rippled appearance. This bottle dates from 1830-1860.
A clear ovoid bottle, Container 206, has an applied tooled patent finish with a possible ground lip. This
whole bottle was formed in a three-piece plate bottom mold, but there is no pontil scar present. An inscription
impressed on its sides reads: A J. I. Brown & Sons, Boston. This bottle dates from 1858-1875. An ovoid
aqua bottle also has an applied tooled patent finish, but it was blown in a two-piece mold. The letter H is
embossed on the shallow pushup, and a sand pontil scar is present. This bottle dates from 1825-1860. Both
ovoid bottles were found in Level 6.
Tableware recovered from Feature 7001, also in Level 6, includes a clear bowl with a cut ribbed design
(Tableware 101) and a fluted tumbler (Tableware 102).
Stratigraphic data indicate that the top three levels of this privy were probably sand fill. The first level also
contained oyster shells, which were used elsewhere on the site as fill. There were a few artifacts in Level 3
and 4, but most were found in Levels 5 and 6, where the feature fill changed to a silty clay rather than sand.
Level 6 contained a cache of whole bottles. Based upon the glass artifacts recovered throughout the feature, it
appears that the privy was filled after 1860. It may have been filled over a short period of time with the
bottles placed in the bottom and the sand fill added shortly thereafter. Based upon ceramic artifacts, the
estimated date range for this feature is 1852-1865, and the mean flat glass date is 1855.03+/-7 years. Deposits
in this privy are most likely associated with the tenure of Harry Fox, who owned the tract from 1860-1869.
Feature 7009
Feature 7009 was excavated in nine levels of 10 cm each. There were 29 distinct containers or tableware
recovered, none of which is whole. The highest density of artifacts occurred in Levels 5 through 8; fragments
of two items, Containers 276 and 294, have cross mends in adjoining levels. Recovered artifacts include
unspecified bottles and hollowware; wine, champagne, case, patent medicine, condiment, toiletry, and snuff
bottles; tumblers and wine goblets.

124

Five wine bottles were recovered (Containers 273, 274, 275, 284, and 286). Containers 273 and 275 are both
fragments of dark olive bottles. The first was formed in a dip mold with a dome shaped pushup, pontil scar,
and deep impression in the center of the dome with an estimated date of manufacture between 1830 and 1860.
The second has a 75-mm-thick finish with a tooled flat laid-on ring dating from 1825-1875. The other three
wine bottles are all of light olive glass. Container 274 has an applied tooled finish with a sloped flat top and
down tooled string rim resembling that illustrated in Jones (1986:60, Figure 38), also dating from 1825-1875.
Container 284 is similar but has a flattened lip. Container 286 was formed in a three-piece plate bottom mold
and has a small mamelon in the center of the base. Its date is estimated at 1858-1860. The single champagne
bottle (Container 280) is represented by a finish with a flat laid-on ring.
Other bottles of note include a light olive snuff bottle (Container 279) with a flanged finish that was formed in
a two-piece mold. No pontil scar is evident. Two aqua toiletry bottles (Containers 272 and 281) have faceted
sides (with 10 to 12 facets), and one of these has been formed in a three-piece plate bottom mold. The
condiment bottles include side panels from three cathedral pickle jars (Containers 282, 283, and 287).
Two tumblers were also recovered from this feature. Tableware 121 is a clear fluted tumbler with nine sides.
The shallow indentation on its base is off center, and the pontil scar is ground. The second tumbler,
Tableware 122, has a folded lip. Inside the lip is what appears to be a metallic band that must have been
applied before the lip was folded to the interior of the vessel. One clear fluted wine goblet (Container 124)
was also found. Other tableware of note is a piece of hollowware with a diamond point pattern (Tableware
125).
Chronological information derived for each of the levels in this privy suggests that Levels 5 through 9 were
filled after 1860 and the upper levels a bit later, by 1865. Ceramic artifacts reflect a time range of 1845 to
1855, but there was no flat glass recovered as in the other features. Martin Floeck held title to this property
from 1855-1865, suggesting that he was responsible for filling the privy. The absence of whole bottles further
suggests that Floeck filled the privy in the process of cleaning up trash around the site and then dumping it
into the privy pit. The lowest levels of the privy, Levels 8 and 9, were quite high in artifact density and the fill
dirt was a silty clay. In Level 5, a layer of fine light gray sand had been deposited over the interior of the
feature and continued in various places into Levels 6 and 7. Artifact density in these three levels was not as
high. The top four levels had the lowest artifact density and were disturbed by construction of the railroad in
approximately 1908. Oyster-shell fill had contaminated each of these levels.
Feature 7057
Feature 7057 was excavated in only one 10 cm level. Four glass containers were found. These include two
unspecified bottles, a beer bottle, and a water bottle. No flat glass was present.
The unspecified bottles include an amber bottle blown into a dip bottom mold with a shallow indentation and
small mamelon (Container 356). A dark olive applied tooled finish with a flat top and down tooled lip
(Container 357) is the second bottle. An amber beer bottle (Container 358) has an applied tooled finish with a
flat top, flattened lip, and down tooled string rim, which gives it a date of 1825-1875. Lastly, the water bottle
(Container 359) was blown in a three-piece dip bottom mold with base plates reading:
SAXLEHNERS.BITTERQUELLE on the outside ring, and HUNYADI\JANOS in the center. This bottle
dates from 1863-1900. Based upon glass artifacts, this feature was probably filled between 1860 and 1870.
Ceramic data estimates a time frame of 1850. Catherine Curtin, who owned the property between 1860 and
1875, is probably responsible for the filling of this privy.
Seven privies were discovered during the course of excavations. Four of these were wood lined, two were
barrel lined, and one was unlined. All had artifacts deposited in them during the years 1858-1860, at least.
Four privies had whole bottles recovered from them, indicating that these artifacts were directly deposited
into the privies rather than collected from elsewhere around the site. Artifact density ranged from 45 artifacts

125

per cubic meter in Feature 1065 to 370 artifacts per cubic meter in Feature 1048B. Feature 7057 had 8,809
artifacts per cubic meter, but this high number has been attributed to hastily collected artifacts during the final
hours of the excavation. If Feature 7057 is removed from the database, the privy densities average about 155
artifacts per cubic meter. The range of densities does not seem to be related to time, as the privies are roughly
contemporaneous. Nor is it related to depth, as similar densities are found in both shallow and deep privy
pits. Neither does the variety of artifacts seem to be a factor. For example, Feature 1048B, with a density of
370 artifacts per cubic meter, and Feature 7009, with a density of 68 artifacts per cubic meter, have the
greatest variety of artifacts of the seven privies. The density of these privies thus may be related to other
factors, such as wealth of the lot occupants, location, or length of use.
Refuse Deposits and Trash Pits
Feature 1025
Feature 1025 was excavated in four levels of 10 cm each. Some 33 containers or tablewares were recovered,
three of which are whole vessels (Table 10.4). Thirteen vessels were recovered during backhoe scraping and
the remainder came from Levels 1 through 3. There were no cross mends between levels.

Most of the recovered containers are unspecified bottles (n=16) or condiment bottles (n=9). Other bottles
include wine, champagne, medicine, patent medicine, toiletry, and soft drink. The only tableware is a single
tumbler.
The typical condiment bottle recovered is aqua, with a large mouth, folded out round tooled finish, and a neck
ring. Many had been blown into three-piece plate bottom molds. Only one could be identified as a catsup
bottle (Container 24); the rest are assumed to have held pickles or fruit. One bottle, Container 13, has a
diamond shape with a molded crown on its base. Container 14 has the same crown but is rectangular.
Generally, the unspecified bottles were also blown into three-piece plate or post bottom molds and have
applied tooled finishes.
One wine bottle, Container 11, was blown into a three-piece dip bottom mold with a post. A separate plate
around the post reads: Wood Portobello, dating it to 1868-1905. The champagne bottle, Container 12, has a
cracked-off finish (not fire-polished) with an irregular laid-on ring. Its surface is shiny.
Two patent medicine bottles were also recovered. One, Container 7, is a rectangular cobalt blue bottle with
an applied down tooled finish. It was blown into a two-piece mold, has chamfered corners, and a sand pontil
scar. One panel reads: F. E. Suire & Co., Cincinnati. Another reads: Wayne’s Diuretic Elixir. No information
could be found on this company, but the bottle probably dates between 1850 and 1860. The second bottle,
Container 9, is ovoid and is also blown into a two-piece mold. Its base has a shallow indentation with a sand
pontil and a small mamelon-type protrusion on the interior. Molded advertising on the side reads: Dr.
126

Guysott’s Yellow dock & Sarsaparailla\John D. Park, Cincinnati, Ohio. It probably dates between 1818 and
1860. The single medicine bottle (Container 32) has an applied tooled finish with a pouring beak.
The single toiletry bottle, Container 4, was blown into a cylindrical three-piece plate bottom mold and has an
expanded base and horizontally ribbed body (Figure 10.2). Its drawn neck is topped with a crude applied flat
finish, a blowpipe pontil scar is evident on the base. An inscription on the side reads: E. M. & Son. This
bottle probably dates to between 1858 and 1860.

Figure 10.2. Perfume bottle (Container 4) recovered from
Feature 1025 (refuse deposit).

One soft drink bottle, Container 31, was found in this assemblage. It was blown into a three-piece plate
bottom mold and has an improved pontil scar. The finish is an applied blob top. A molded inscription on the
side reads: Pablo & Co., No. 270 & 272 Royal St., N. O. This bottle probably dates from 1825 to 1860. The
single tumbler, Tableware 1, is a clear undecorated vessel with no diagnostic markings.
Chronological information from the glass artifacts suggest that Level 3 in this feature had to have been filled
by 1860, Level 2 by 1870, and Level 1 by 1880. Ceramics recovered from Feature 1025 dated between 1858
and 1870. A mean flat glass date of 1843.89+/- 7 years was also calculated. James Dumble, who purchased
this property in 1853, had a long tenure and is the only person who could have been associated with this
feature.
Stratigraphic data indicate that this feature was created from artifacts strewn on the ground over a period of
time, i.e., there was no pit dug. Recorders noted that there was no distinction between feature soil and the
surrounding silty clay matrix. When first exposed by the trackhoe, this feature was characterized by a large
number of bottles, suggesting that it was a bottle dump. Excavation further revealed burned and cut bone,
along with ceramics, glass, and metal. The location of Feature 1025 along a back lot line suggests that refuse
was dumped on the ground along a fence line, in a shallow drainage, or perhaps in a copse of trees between
lots. The artifact dates further suggest that this was an ongoing practice.

127

Feature 1048A
Feature 1048A was excavated in one level of 3 cm and one level of 10 cm. Five containers were recovered;
one of these is whole. The whole bottle, Container 40, has a one-part straight finish that is folded to the
interior. It was blown into a two-piece mold and has a blowpipe pontil scar. On the side, it reads: Mrs.
Winslow’s Soothing Syrup, Curtis & Perkins, Proprietors. The bottle dates from about 1844 to 1860. The
remaining bottles are unspecified but exhibit several diagnostic attributes. Container 36 was blown into a
three-piece plate bottom mold with a shallow indentation and blowpipe pontil scar. Container 37 is a 12sided bottle that was blown into a two-piece mold and also has a blowpipe pontil scar. Container 38 has a one
part straight finish that was burst off and tapered down. Container 39 has an applied tooled finish with a
drawn neck.
This feature was probably created after 1858 and during the tenure of John Stansfield, owner of the property
from 1856 to 1865. Ceramic artifacts suggest a date range of 1850 to 1870 for the feature. No flat glass was
recovered from the deposit. Feature 1048A was adjacent to Feature 1048B, a privy, and may be related to it.
There was enough distinction between the two deposits that excavators felt justified in separating the feature
into two parts early during its excavation.
Feature 6001
Feature 6001 was excavated in six levels of 10 cm each. Fifty-three items, including 37 containers, 12
tablewares, three lighting objects, and one closure, were recovered. The containers are mostly characterized
by unspecified bottles (n=14), as well as wine, condiment, champagne, soft drink, ink, medicine, and patent
medicine bottles. Tablewares include eight tumblers, three goblets, and a candlestick. Cross mends were
found for Containers 174 and 181 in Levels 1 and 2.
Five wine bottles were recovered from Feature 6001 (Containers 171, 176, 190, 198, and 200). Container 176
is dark olive with an applied tooled finish exhibiting a sloped top, flattened lip, flattened string rim, and a
distinct groove between the lip and string rim. This finish probably dates from 1835-1855. Container 200 is
also dark olive and blown into a dip mold. The heel is abrupt, with a small mamelon at the center of a deep
conical pushup. Mold lines indicate that the pushup was formed outside the dip mold. This bottle probably
dates from 1830-1860. Two of the bottles, Containers 171 and 190, are light olive. One was blown into a dip
mold with a rounded heel and shallow pushup but no pontil scar; it dates from 1830-1905. The last bottle,
Container 198, is dark olive, but not the early ‘black’ glass. It was spun in a turn mold and exhibits horizontal
striations and an abrupt heel.
Nine patent medicine bottles were also recovered from Feature 6001 (Containers 172, 174, 177, 183, 185,
188, 191, 194, and 196). Most of these had been blown into three-piece plate or post bottom molds. Two,
Containers 172 and 174, have pontil scars despite use of the plate/post bottom mold. Containers 191 and 194
have suspicious scars on their bases. Finishes on these bottles are quite varied and include applied tooled
patent, applied hand tooled prescription, applied down tooled, one part straight patent, hand finished
prescription lip, and an improved tooled patent. Some have whole or partial identification of their contents or
the proprietors, including: Tarrant & Co., druggists, New York; R.&G. Atwright; Elias Howe, Jr., New York;
and A . . . ETORS\ . . . OW’S\ . . . SYRUP.
Five condiment bottles were also found (Containers 166, 167, 175, 180, and 186). Container 166 was blown
into a three-piece cup bottom mold with a shallow depression. Lipping is evident around the heel, and there is
a possible improved pontil scar. The bottle probably dates from about 1860-1870. Container 167 was also
blown into a three-piece cup bottom mold and exhibits a sand pontil scar. Container 175 has a finish with a
sloped top, ground lip, and slightly rounded string rim. This bottle probably dates from 1825-1875. The last
two containers are cathedral-style pickle bottles that date from about 1840-1880.

128

Eight tumblers (Tableware 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98) and three goblets (Tableware 90, 99, 100) were
recovered from Feature 6001. The tumblers are undecorated, ribbed, and fluted, and one has a starburst
pattern on the base. Tablewares 90 and 99, clear goblets with a honeycomb pattern, can be identified as the
Vernon Honeycomb pattern from the Boston & Sandwich Glass Co. (Grow 1982:224, Figure 42-4, Plate 26;
McKearin & McKearin 1948:407, Plate 213, No. 1). It has also been known as ‘Cincinnati’ or ‘New York’
and dates to the 1850s. The third goblet, Tableware 100, also has a honeycomb pattern (but not the Vernon
Honeycomb).
Other glassware of note includes a soft-drink bottle (Container 165) with the inscription: George Schwitzer,
No. 19, Orange St., New Orleans. One aqua bottle has a tree-like design spreading out from a recessed oval
panel (Container 181). Lastly, a translucent white candlestick, ca. 1860-1880, was found (Other 25) (Figure
10.3) (see also Spillman 1983:275).

Chronological data indicate that Feature 6001 was filled sometime after 1860. The lowest level was
characterized by glass artifacts dating between 1830 and 1860. The next three levels were probably filled
between 1860 and 1880. Increased deposition occurred in Level 2, probably between 1880 and 1900. Level 1
was characterized by a conglomeration of artifacts, including early dating objects. A ceramic date range
derived for this feature is 1865-1882, and the mean flat glass date is 1893.95. Based upon land ownership
records, the most likely occupants responsible for filling of this feature were the Pannells. R. F. Pannell
owned the property from 1867-1868, and H. G. Pannell owned it from 1868-1884.
Feature 6001 was a distinctly excavated pit measuring about 3 ft (1 m) in circumference and about 20 in (50
cm) in depth. It was densely compacted with large-sized artifacts, and was located in a side yard about 16 ft
(5 m) from the house. Another refuse pit, Feature 6002, was also located nearby, suggesting that this area of
the lot had been selected for refuse disposal.
Feature 6002
This feature was excavated in three levels of 10 cm each. A single bottle was recovered; no flat glass was
evident. The bottle, Container 201, was blown into an eight-sided three-piece plate bottom mold and has a
sand pontil scar. It dates from about 1858-1860. Ceramics recovered from the feature date from the 1850s.

129

This feature, like Feature 6001, was probably also associated with the Pannell family. It was filled with silty
clay and abundant charcoal in addition to a high density of artifacts.
Feature 7013
This feature was characterized on the surface by ceramics, glass, metal, and brick fragments. A significant
amount of charcoal was present, but no faunal remains were recovered. Feature 7013 was excavated in three
levels of 10 cm each. Seven bottles, one tumbler, and one lamp chimney were recovered. All are examples
of early nineteenth-century manufacture. Container 297 is dark olive with an applied tooled finish, rounded
lip, and rounded string rim. Olive Jones (1986:71, Figure 53) dates this finish to the 1820s-1830s. The
second wine bottle, Container 303, has an applied tooled finish with a flat top, down tooled lip, and flattened
string rim. Jones (1986:69, Figure 51) dates this finish from 1800-1837. Also recovered was a single
champagne bottle with a fire-polished cracked-off lip and an untooled laid-on ring. A clear snuff-like bottle
with a fire- polished flared finish was also found. The condiment bottle has an applied tooled finish with a
flat top, a rounded laid-on ring, and a fire polished lip. One faceted tumbler, possibly cut, was also found.
Eight recovered glass artifacts came from Level 1 and one came from Level 2; none was recovered from
Level 3. Those artifacts recovered from Level 1 were deposited sometime between 1835 and 1850, while
those in Level 2 were deposited between 1800 and 1835. Ceramic artifacts date the deposit from 1838-1845.
There was no flat glass recovered from the feature. Landowner records indicate that James Wells owned the
property from 1838-1848, and Henry B. and Joseph Witt owned it from 1848-1856. Most of the artifacts can
be attributed to Wells’ occupation.
Two refuse deposits (Features 1025 and 7013) and three trash pits (Features 1048A, 6001 and 6002) were
found during the investigation. Three of these features had whole bottles recovered, indicating that they were
primary deposits. Deposits made in these features overlap in time from about 1850 to 1860. The density of
artifacts within these features ranged from 41 to 1,377 per cubic meter, with an average of 600 per cubic
meter. Depth ranged from 0.5-16 in (2-40 cm). Feature 1025 and 6001, which had the greatest densities of
artifacts, also had the widest variety of artifacts, whereas Features 1048A, 6002, and 7013 had much narrower
assemblages mostly characterized by wine bottles.
OVERVIEW OF GLASS ATTRIBUTES
The following overview focuses on manufacturing attributes recorded for the glass collection. Although these
attributes were described at the beginning of the chapter, this discussion strives to isolate those attributes, or
combination of attributes, that make them unique in the context of nineteenth-century Houston.
Containers
Bottle finishes provide some of the most chronologically significant data about glass. For example, in this
assemblage, 37 percent (n=88) of the finishes are applied tooled, a technique used between 1825 and 1875
(Table 10.5). Another 1 percent (n=2) have applied string rims, 10.5 percent (n=25) are fire-polished, 6
percent (n=14) are folded, 5 percent (n=14) are flanged, and 15 percent (n=36) exhibit applied neck rings. In
other words, 75 percent (n=179) of bottles are finished using free-hand techniques that were primarily in use
before 1870. Of the remaining finishes, 11 percent (n=27) have improved tooled finishes, which were made
between 1870 and 1915 and served as a time marker for the final years of the time period under study. The
last 14 percent (n=33) are variations on early machine-made finishes and reflect late dating features, long used
features, or contamination from late dating sheet refuse.
Of the 73 features producing glass, 25 percent (n=18) have pieces with applied tooled finishes present.
Fourteen percent (n=10) have pieces with fire-polished finishes. Fourteen percent (n=10) have pieces with
applied neck rings. Twelve percent (n=9) have pieces with folded finishes, and 7 percent (n=5) have flanged
finishes. These five finish types routinely occurred together in contexts dating from 1858-1870. When

130

improved tooled finishes were present, regardless of earlier dating finishes being present, the assemblages
generally date to between 1870 and 1880. Thus the five finishes described above, when found together, are
representative of the third quarter of the nineteenth century in Houston. Likewise, the presence of improved
tooled finishes is an indication of deposits dating to the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Bottle bases have entirely different manufacturing attributes related to either holding the bottle or centering
the bottle. Molds whose use overlapped during the period 1860-1870 included two-piece molds (1818-1870),
three-piece dip molds (1835-1905), one-piece dip molds (to 1860), three-piece plate bottom molds (18581915), and cup bottom molds (1870+) (see Table 10.5). In this assemblage, the cup bottom mold was the time
marker indicating the end of the study period. One-piece dip molds account for 32 percent (n=104) of the
bottles in the assemblage, 29 percent (n=94) are three-piece plate bottom molds, 14 percent (n=45) are twopiece molds, and 9 percent (n=29) are cup bottom molds.

131

A cross tabulation of mold types with bottle finishes in the assemblage revealed similar results (i.e., bottles
blown into two-piece molds and one-piece dip molds have fire polished finishes, applied tooled finishes,
folded finishes, and flanged finishes). Bottles made in a three-piece plate bottom mold occur with a much
broader range of finishes, including fire-polished, applied tooled, flanged, improved tooled, and machinemade crown. Three-piece dip bottom molds are found only with applied tooled finishes. Cup bottom molds
first appeared with improved tooled finishes and with all subsequent machine-made finishes.
A cross tabulation of specific diagnostic attributes with various molds yielded limited results. From a
collection of 143 bottle bases, 65 percent (n=93) have pontil scars. Mold types associated with these pontil
scars are two-piece molds, three-piece dip molds, one-piece dip molds, and three-piece plate bottom molds.
Other attributes observed were small, dimple-like mamelons (18 percent, or n=24), which occur with onepiece dip molds, three-piece dip molds, and three-piece plate bottom molds. Large mamelons (2.2 percent,
n=3) occur only on one-piece dip molds. Chamfered heels (13.9 percent, n=20) are found on two-piece molds
and three-piece plate bottom molds. Other attributes that occur less frequently include an orange-peel finish,
Owen’s scar, ‘Federal Law Forbids Sale or Re-use of this Bottle,’ and horizontal striations (Table 10.6).

From the total assemblage of 5,767 items, 4,035 items could not be classified to function (i.e., curved pieces
of bottle or tableware glass). Thus 1,732 items could be identified (Table 10.7). From this group, bottles and
jars account for 1,364 items. The remainder includes 368 tableware pieces. Unclassified bottles (28 percent,
or n=488), wine bottles (25 percent, or n=429), and patent medicine bottles (8 percent, or n=141)
predominate. In the tableware category, tumblers (12 percent, or n=214) are most abundant. Other frequently
occurring items include bowls, goblets, wine glasses, condiment jars, medicine bottles, pickle jars, soft drink
bottles, and champagne bottles.
Proprietors
In addition to mold marks reflecting the construction method used for bottles, there were also mold marks
whose purpose it was to advertise the manufacturer of the bottle contents. Sometimes these marks were
complete, and sometimes there was information available about the various companies; often, however, the
information was elusive. Table 10.8 summarizes the information we currently have about these marks, while
the discussion below elaborates on the more well-known manufacturers.
Curtis and Perkins (ca. 1844-1894+). Curtis and Perkins were the proprietors responsible for the popular
patent medicine, ‘Mrs. Winslow’s Soothing Syrup.’ By 1861, the manufacturers had already made a fortune
from the syrup (Vanity Fair 1861). It was used to soothe children who were cutting teeth but also cured ‘wind
colic’ and diarrhea (Overland Monthly 1894:671). In 1894, it was advertised as having been made for over
50 years.

132

Emerson Drug Company (pre 1907). The Emerson Drug Company of Baltimore, Maryland, is most
recognized for its blue ‘Bromo-Seltzer’ bottles (Toulouse 1971:339). Prior to 1907, the bottles were made by
Cumberland Glass Company of Bridgeton, New Jersey. When Emerson Drug Company built the Maryland
Glass Corporation in 1907 in Baltimore, the blue bottles became one line in a series of products manufactured
there.

Eisner and Mendelson had moved to New York.

in the absence of documentary data, some dates were derived from archeological data

Jacob Hostetter (ca. 1853-1954). Jacob Hostetter was responsible for the cure-all stomach bitters marketed
by his son, David, and partner, George Smith (Ketchum 1975:101-102; Spillman 1983:71). In 1869, the
Overland Monthly advertised free distribution of “The Great Pictorial Annual” for Hostetter’s Stomach Bitters
(Overland Monthly 1869). Another advertisement appeared in 1890 (Overland Monthly 1890). Both times,
the company was located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the formula was also being bottled (Ketchum
1975:102).
Lyon’s Kathairon for the Hair (1854-1869). Advertised in Harper’s Weekly in 1861, Lyon’s Kathairon was a
preparation for prematurely graying hair (Wilson 1981:65, 135).
Mexican Mustang Liniment (ca. 1825-ca. 1948). A preparation for both horse and human, Mexican Mustang
Liniment was first produced around 1825 in St. Louis, Missouri, by George W. Westbrook (Joseph 1993:293294). By 1853, offices operated by A. G. Bragg and Company were located in both New York and St. Louis
(DeBow 1853). In 1871, production moved to New York, where the Lyon Manufacturing Company
continued making this preparation until about 1948.
Saxlehner’s Bitterquelle (ca. 1863-1900). Bitterquelle was a bitter-tasting Hungarian spring water recognized
for its gentle laxative effects (Toulouse 1971:257-258). Bottles were also marked ‘Hunyadi Janos’ in honor
of John Hunyadi, a Hungarian national hero who lived from 1385-1456.
Tarrant and Company (1859-1906). This drug company operated out of New York for over 100 years, and in
1869, advertised its seltzer aperient as being “sold universally by Druggists” (Appleton 1869; Joseph
1993:292). After 1906, the name was changed to The Tarrant Company.
Bottle and Glass Manufacturers
In addition to proprietors’ advertisements, bottle glass companies also advertised their glassworks on bottles.
Some of the better known companies whose marks were found on bottles recovered during the project are
described below.
Aqua Pure Bottling Company (1907-1926). This company, which bottled soda water, was founded by Dr.
James H. Bute in 1907 and went into receivership in 1908 during H. B. House’s tenure as manager (Janet K.
Wagner, personal communication 1999). In 1917, the company was managed by A. J. Elliott, and from 19231926 by J. J. Tamborellor. During Tamborellor’s tenure, the company was located at 1919 Crawford Street.
R. Cooper and Company (1868-1928). Richard Cooper became the owner of a glass works in Portobello,
Scotland, in 1859 after his partner, William Bailey, died (Toulouse 1971:141-143). His brother-in-law,
Thomas Wood, stepped in to fill Bailey’s spot until 1868 when the two men divided the property. Cooper
continued his share of the glass works under the name Richard Cooper and Company, using the trademarks

136

‘Cooper,’ ‘Cooper and Portobello,’ or ‘Portobello.’ Around 1928, the company was acquired by Wood Bottle
Company and later merged with United States Glass.
William Frank and Co. (1858-1876). William Frank operated a glass works in partnership with his brotherin-law in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, beginning in 1858 (Toulouse 1971:193-195). In 1866, Frank’s brother-inlaw deeded his share of the company to Frank, and the company name changed to William Frank and Sons.
The factory, known as Frankstown Glass Works, burned in 1876, and Frank retired from the glass business.
Houston Carbonate Company (1892-1893). This company was in business for only two years as both
producers and bottlers of soda water and mineral water (Janet K. Wagner, personal communication 1999). It
was located at 114 Preston Street in Houston and was owned by W. B. Crawford and Company.
Palmer and Company (ca. 1871-present). Solon Palmer’s glass manufactory began operations in Cincinnati,
Ohio, in 1847 and continued there until 1871, when it moved to New York (Toulouse 1971:413-414).
Palmer, called the ‘Perfumer to America since 1847,’ had a Cincinnati shop named the ‘Solon Palmer
Perfumery Depot.’ The bottle recovered from the current project was a perfume bottle.
Star Bottling Works (1874-1962). With its long period of operation, Star Bottling Works of Houston bottled a
wide variety of products over the years (Janet K. Wagner, personal communication 1999). Beverages
included soda, sarsaparilla, ginger ale, mineral water, sassafras beer, celery and iron beer, and a multitude of
flavored drinks and punches.
Texberry Bottling Works (1922-1958). Texberry was first established by C. M. Jett in 1922 at 315 Crawford
Street in Houston (Janet K. Wagner, personal communication 1999). It was quickly sold to Samuel Schwartz
of Schwartz Bottling Works in 1923.
W. T. and Company (1857-1938). The Whitall, Bro. and Tatum Company, operating out of Millville, New
Jersey, was only one in a series of owners of this glass factory dating back to 1806 (Toulouse 1971:544).
They continued operations until 1938, when they sold it to the Armstrong Cork Company of Lancaster,
Pennsylvania.
Willington Glass Company (1830-1872). The Willington Glass Company of West Willington, Connecticut,
was organized and in operation by 1815, although probably under a different name (McKearin and McKearin
1948:209-210). In 1847, it was sold but continued under the name of Willington Glass Company for an
indeterminate period of time. The company failed in 1872.
Wood’s Bottle Works (1868-1905). Thomas Wood, brother-in-law to Richard Cooper, was a partner in
Cooper and Wood of Portobello, Scotland, until 1868 when the in-laws went their separate ways (Toulouse
1971:141-143). However, their new companies, Wood’s Bottle Works and Richard Cooper and Company,
operated side-by-side until about 1930, when the two companies were subsumed by Distillers Co., Ltd.
Tableware
Three types of manufacturing techniques were used in the tableware assemblage: press molding, contact
molding, and optic molding. Of the 155 pieces of tableware recovered, 152 are probably press molded, two
are contact molded, and one is optic molded. Jones and Sullivan (1985:33) describe press molding as a
process whereby the molten glass is pressed into a mold using a plunger. The exterior of the object takes the
shape of the mold and the interior takes the shape of the plunger. This type of molding is particularly evident
in the 87 tumblers that were recovered.
Contact molding is a process where glass is blown into a patterned mold. The exterior surface of the object
takes on the pattern of the mold, and the interior surface parallels that pattern (Jones and Sullivan 1985:23).

137

One bowl and one indeterminate hollowware represent the contact-molded pieces recovered in the current
project.
In optic molding, glass is blown into a pattern mold and then transferred to a full-sized mold where it is
enlarged (Jones and Sullivan 1985:32-33). During enlargement, the pattern transfers to the interior of the
object leaving the exterior smooth. The single optic molded item recovered during the current project is a
tumbler with interior ribbing and a smooth exterior.
Other attributes observed in this assemblage include five pontil scars, eight ground pontils, one ground heel,
one ground lip, three pieces of cut glass, and one small mamelon. Since the formula for soda lime glass was
not developed until 1864, it is presumed that this collection is primarily leaded glass. Thus most of the
tableware is clear with very few exceptions, including one each of translucent white, aqua, and opaque light
blue, and two yellow, and three ruby flashed.
Decorations are quite varied with fluting and ribbing on tumblers being the most abundant (Table 10.9). One
tumbler has cut fluting. Honeycomb patterns, diamond patterns, and flat faceting or paneling are also
popular. Etching and frosting are limited to two objects each. A single example of silveria was found. Jones
and Sullivan (1985:50) describe this as a “decorative technique in which a thin layer of metallic foil is
sandwiched between two layers of transparent glass.” Used during the fourth quarter of the nineteenth
century, silveria was not named until approximately 1900.

Beginning in the 1840s, pressed tablewares became available in complete table settings (McKearin and
McKearin 1948:394). Popular patterns were used to promote whole lines of wares including goblets, wines,
sugar bowls, creamers, decanters, etc. Below is a listing of the patterns represented at the Ball Park site.
Arch Pattern (ca. 1825). The Arch Pattern consists of two rows of arches (flute-like), the bottom one shifted
laterally so that it overlapped the upper row (see Grow 1982:62, Figure 4-0; McKearin and McKearin
1948:391, Plate 200, Figures 32 and 34). Grow’s (1982:62) example dates to 1825 and is attributed to the
Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, while McKearin and McKearin (1948:377) generally attribute their
examples to the 1840s and 1850s, possibly made in the Pittsburgh region. Feature 1048B of the current

138

project yielded an example of this pattern in a six-sided tumbler with a glass pontil scar present (Tableware 45
[Cat. No. 144-78]).
Arched Band and Prism (ca. 1850s). The Arched Band and Prism pattern is characterized by a row of arches,
each arch with a smaller one within it (see Grow 1982:76, Figure 7-5). The maker is unknown. Two
examples of this pattern, both tumblers, were recovered from Feature 1048B (Cat. No. 77-8) and Feature 1049
(Cat. No. 143-9).
Ashburton (ca. 1840-1870). Ashburton was one of the earliest pressed pattern tablewares available and has
been attributed to both the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company and the New England Glass Company,
Cambridge (Grow 1982: 199, Figure 34-0; McKearin and McKearin 1948:347, Plate 209, No. 2). Both
companies, established around 1832, may have been producing Ashburton pieces by the late 1830s or early
1840s (McKearin and McKearin 1948:350, 377). The pattern is composed of indented ovals and was found in
both tumbler and wine glass form at the Ball Park site (e.g., Feature 1065, Tablewares 63-65 [Cat. Nos. 87-10,
-11; 91-1, 3-11; 91-2] and Feature 7003, Tableware 108 [Cat. Nos. 27-174, -175]) (Figure 10.4.)

Figure 10.4. Remains of a stemmed glass with the Ashburton
pattern recovered from Feature 7003 (brick cooler).

Blaze Pattern (ca. 1840-1870). A single bowl was recovered in this pattern which is vertically ribbed
(Feature 7019, Tableware 137 [Cat. Nos. 21-240, -241, -242; 25-19]). The upper edge of the ribbing is
undulating, creating an effect like flames, hence the name (see McKearin and McKearin 1948:404, Figure 6,
Plate 208).
Diamond Band with Tulip (1860s). This pattern has two elements: a diamond band below the rim of the
vessel, and a tulip design encircling the bowl. Grow (1982:160, Figure 24-9) attributes the pattern to the
Bryce Brothers of Pittsburgh. Three cordials in this pattern were recovered from Feature 1048B (Tablewares
24, 40, 41 [Cat. Nos. 88-296, 137-12, 137-75]).

139

Excelsior (1840-1870). Excelsior is one of the early pressed patterns known as a ‘thumbprint’ because the
indented circles resemble thumbprints (Husfloen 1992:30-32; McKearin and McKearin 1948:394, Figure 16,
Plate 208). Grow (1982:77, Figure 7-7) attributes the pattern to the Pittsburgh area. A single example of this
pattern was found in tumbler form from Feature 5017 (Tableware 85 [Cat. No. 25-139]).
Flattened Sawtooth (1845-1865). Flattened Sawtooth is described by Ruth Webb Lee in Grow (1982:91,
Figure 11-8) as follows: “Instead of a sharp-pointed apex to the diamond, it is truncated, the flattened end
looking as though a knife had cut off the point.” Grow (1982:90) attributes this pattern to the mid 1800s, as
does Husfloen (1992:34). A rectangular serving dish with very similar characteristics (i.e., size of diamonds
may be smaller) was recovered from Feature 1048B (Tableware 44 [Cat Nos. 137-123-126).
Horn of Plenty (1845-1865). Horn of Plenty is described by Husfloen (1992:33, Figure 5-6) as “composed of
a row of cornucopia standing upright on their tails.” McKearin and McKearin (1948:395) state that this
pattern, with its more intricate design, represents a trend that developed following the earlier but simpler
patterns such as Ashburton and Excelsior. Grow (1982:90, Figure 11-7) attributes it to the Boston and
Sandwich Company but also notes that it was made by the M’Kee Brothers of Pittsburgh, under the name
‘Comet.’ Fragments of what is believed to be a bowl were recovered in this pattern from Feature 5017
(Tableware 83 [Cat. Nos. 25-133, -134; 56-57).
Jacob’s Ladder (1876-?). Jacob’s Ladder is a post-Civil War pattern that was patented in 1876 by the Bryce
Brothers of Pittsburgh and has been described as featuring “vertical wide bands of a crisscross, trellislike
design alternating with horizontal bars suggesting a ladder” (Husfloen 1992:64). Grow (1982:92; Figures 1111, 25-4, 28-6) has several good illustrations of this pattern and notes that it is non-flint. Fragments of a wine
glass in this pattern were recovered from Feature 1048B (Tableware 20 [Cat. No. 88-288]).
Raised Diamond (1840-1870). Raised Diamond goblets, champagnes, and wines were advertised as early as
1840 (McKearin and McKearin 1948:394). Little information was found about this pattern and it was not
illustrated. However, ‘raised diamond’ describes some fragments recovered from Feature 1048B (Tableware
21 [Cat. Nos. 88-289]).
Vernon Honeycomb (1845-1865). Vernon Honeycomb is an indented hexagonal pattern that Grow (1982:224,
Figure 42-4) attributes to the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company but notes that it has also been known as
‘Cincinnati’ and is similar to ‘New York.’ Although Husfloen (1992:45-48) only refers to the ‘Honeycomb’
pattern, he notes that because of its popularity, it has probably never been “completely out of production since
the 1860s.” McKearin and McKearin (1948:Figure 1, Plate 213) illustrate ‘Vernon Honeycomb.’ Remnants
of a goblet in this pattern were recovered from Feature 6001 (Tablewares 90, 99 [Cat. No. 8-18, 34-222).
Of the 5,767 glass artifacts analyzed, 368 are classified as tableware. Tumblers are the most frequently
occurring item (58 percent, or n=214), but wine glasses (11 percent, or n=42) and goblets (5 percent, or n=19)
are also common. Candlesticks, vases, and matched sets of toiletry bottles are less common. Decorations
vary, but fluting, ribbing, and geometric patterns predominate. Cutting, etching, and flashing are less
frequent.
SUMMARY
Of the 7,244 glass artifacts recovered from six blocks during the Ball Park at Union Station excavations,
5,767 were closely examined in a detailed analysis (see Appendix F). Analysis focused only on artifacts
recovered from feature contexts. A simple overview of glass colors present in these features initially
confirmed our success in isolating primarily 1870 or earlier contexts for study. Only a handful of lavender or
emerald green colors are present; clear, aqua, light olive, dark olive, amber, and clear green predominate,
accounting for 70 percent of the assemblage.

140

Chronological assessments of diagnostic attributes also confirmed our discovery of pre-1870 contexts (see
Table 20.5 [Chapter 20]). Assessments were made using a method that determines the minimum time range
that artifacts must have occurred together during their production period. For each provenience studied, a
single minimum end date of manufacture and a maximum beginning date of manufacture were determined
from the artifacts present. Together, these two dates provided a conservative time range during which the
provenience was active.

ARCHITECTURAL MATERIALS, HARDWARE, AND FURNISHING
GOODS
Allan D. Meyers

Construction and domestic furnishing materials were available in Houston from its earliest days, particularly
for those who could afford them. By and large, such materials were imported until the early 1840s. The firm
of Doswell and Adams was importing and selling pre-cut timber, kegs of nails, brick, and kegs of white lead
for paint by February 1837 (Houghton et al. 1991:66). Timber was imported into Houston from as far away
as Maine, and it is known that pre-cut timber was imported from older Gulf Coast cities, such as New Orleans
and Mobile, Alabama (Houghton et al. 1991:66). Other materials, when not commercially imported, were
brought by individuals directly to Houston from locations along the Atlantic seaboard. For example, in the
1840s, the son of John Harris (for whom Harris County is named) plucked doors, windows, and brass
hardware from a three-story brick residence being demolished in New York City, and brought these materials
back to Harris County for use in his own house (Houghton et al. 1991:68).
Local production of construction materials and home furnishings gradually increased in the 1840s. A new
brickyard was established along either Buffalo or White Oak bayous for each of the years 1841, 1842, and
1843 (Democratic Telegraph and Texas Register [DTTR] 1842; Harris County Courthouse-Deed Records
[HCC-DR] 1843:H:402; Morning Star [MS] 1842:3b). The banks of Buffalo Bayou, near present-day Sam
Houston Park, proved to be the location of greatest brickmaking activity within the city. No less than four
brickyards eventually operated on both sides of the bayou near this location. In addition to bricks, the
opening of a brass foundry in the city was announced in the Morning Star in November 1841. J. W. Kinney
advertised iron and brass “cabinetware” in the February 18, 1846, edition of the Democratic Telegraph and
Texas Register, while early in the following year, J. D. Groesbeeck advertised 50 kegs of nails (DTTR 1847).
Kemeys and Sampson advertised nails and “English wrought nails” in March 1848 (DTTR 1848).
By 1850, a wide array of construction materials and domestic furnishings were available from both local
production and imports. The 1850 United States Census for Harris County lists 13 blacksmiths in Houston,
and the manufacture of many local iron commodities is likely attributed to them. Germans account for more
than half of the blacksmiths in the census, suggesting that iron working was particularly common among that
ethnic group. The census listing of 43 carpenters and five cabinet makers in the City of Houston also attests to
the growth of local construction and furnishing industries. Numerous merchants in Galveston were importing
all sorts of domestic furnishings from the eastern seaboard before the Civil War, and many of these materials
eventually made their way to Houston. Advertisements in the February 5, 1856, edition of the Galveston
Weekly News demonstrate the extraordinary variety of materials that were available to early Houston
consumers. Many of these advertisements, including that by William Tasker of New York, boasted large
stocks of “English, French, and German Fancy Goods” (Weekly News 1856a, 1856b).
Large-scale foundries in Houston emerged shortly after the Civil War. The 1870-1871 Houston City
Directory, for example, notes two foundries in the city. One of these, Phoenix Iron Works, is also depicted in
the 1869 Wood map of the city. It was located on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, near Preston Avenue. In
the 1870s, Phoenix Iron Works widely publicized its capabilities for making cast iron and brass furnishing
materials (Houghton et al. 1991:79).

142

In addition, mass-produced hardware from other parts of the country could be purchased in Houston via
catalog orders by the end of the Civil War, if not some years before. One of the most comprehensive of these
commercial publications was the 1865 edition of the Illustrated Catalog of American Hardware of the Russell
and Erwin Manufacturing Company (Russell and Erwin 1980 [1865]). Another good example is the 1869
catalog of the Dover Stamping Company of Boston, Massachusetts (American Historical Catalog Collection
[AHCC] 1971). Such publications were forerunners to Sears and other well-known department store catalogs.
They reflect both the mass production and wide distribution of hardware. Moreover, such catalogs have
become invaluable tools for archeologists whose responsibility it is to identify and interpret the material
remains of mid nineteenth-century sites such as those uncovered during the Ball Park at Union Station
Archeological Project.
This chapter discusses architectural materials and domestic hardware recovered from feature and sheet refuse
deposits excavated during the current project. The artifacts are discussed according to broad functional
classes, and feature and site proveniences for each are provided for cross-referencing purposes. The
discussion of architectural materials focuses largely on nails and bricks, since these are the two predominant
classes of recovered architectural materials. The section includes brief background information, as well as the
application of several techniques used to address artifact form, function, and chronology at both the
interfeature and intrafeature levels of analysis. Descriptions are then presented of selected hardware,
furnishings, and household artifacts that, despite occurring in low frequencies across the Project Area, still
possess functionally or temporally diagnostic qualities. These materials are tied, when possible, to similar or
identical products advertised in catalogs during the middle and late nineteenth century. Arms and
ammunition, in the form of lead shot, one bullet, and one pistol, were also recovered during excavation.
These are described towards the end of the chapter, followed by a brief discussion of the miscellaneous
collection of recovered agricultural and transportation artifacts.
NAILS
Technology and Distribution
Archeologists recognize three basic types of nails from nineteenth-century sites in the United States (Edwards
and Wells 1993:2; Wells 1998). Hand-forged (i.e., wrought) nails are the earliest type, being most common
before the 1830s. Hand-forged nails lack uniformity and are tapered on all sides of the shaft. Nineteenthcentury machine-cut nails are a second type, characterized by a squared shaft with two tapered and two
parallel edges. Machine-cut nails with hand-hammered heads were manufactured as early as the 1790s but
decreased in popularity after 1815 (Edwards and Wells 1993:36). Machine-headed cut nails were also
produced in limited quantities before 1800, increasing in uniformity and popularity by the 1820s (Edwards
and Wells 1993:52-57). Cut-nail production did not reach its peak until the period of 1850-1888 (Orser
1988:191). Cut nails were gradually replaced by a third type, wire nails, which are round headed and
processed from metal cylinders. First introduced in France in the early 1800s, wire nail production began in
the United States about 1855 (Shepard 1981:81). Wire nails were not widely distributed until the late 1880s.
By 1900, they accounted for well over 80 percent of nail production in the United States (Sutton and Arkush
1998:Table 6).
Function
The size and shape of a nail often determine its function. For centuries, nails have been produced according
to their context of use (Edwards and Wells 1993:Figure 34). For example, standard nails with heads that
project from the shaft on all sides are known as common nails. Common nails larger than about 4 in (10.2
cm) are generally considered to be spikes. Sprigs (headless nails) and brads (L-shaped or reduced-head nails)
are commonly used in finishing work. Tacks are small nails with exaggerated heads that are used for
carpeting and other interior elements.

143

The pennyweight system is the traditional method used by manufacturers to classify nails by length.
Pennyweight, denoted as d, is based upon quarter-inch increments in nail lengths, beginning with 1 in (2.54
cm). For example, a 2-in (5.1 cm) nail is 6d, while a 2.25-in (5.7 cm) nail is 7d (see Table 11.1 for
conversions). The pennyweight scale is slightly modified beyond 10d. Most, if not all, sizes of nails were
likely available to Houston residents by the 1840s. Contemporary advertisements in the Democratic
Telegraph and Texas Register (1847, 1848) announced kegs of nails among other architectural materials. The
February 5, 1856, edition of the Galveston Weekly News includes an advertisement for nails ranging from 4d
to 40d. Several blacksmiths established in Houston by 1850 may have locally manufactured a variety of
functional nail sizes (Houghton et al. 1991:73).

By the mid nineteenth century, very specific usages were designated for common nails of various lengths
(Table 11.2). Proportions of common nail sizes may provide at least minimal information about the presence
and location of certain architectural elements in the archeological record. For example, nails larger than 12d
were used for framing, while 8-10d nails were used for flooring and siding. Nails ranging from 6-7d were
used for clapboards, wall boards, and ceilings. Nails between 4-5d were generally used for wooden shakes
and shingles, while 2-3d nails were used for lathing and shingles.
Nails in the Project Area
Data recovery excavations yielded 715 complete nails and 3,086 nail fragments. As shown in Figure 11.1, the
relative frequency of nail fragments closely approximates the relative frequency of complete nails on each of
the five blocks where nail recovery occurred. Exactly one-half of the materials were recovered from
41HR820, the block subjected to the most intensive excavations. Despite the considerable project-wide
sample, individual feature yields were generally low and uninformative. Of the 43 features producing
complete common nails, only 10 yielded samples numbering more than 15. In addition, only four features
produced more than 40 complete nails.

Figure 11.1. Relative frequencies of complete nails and nail fragments.

The author sorted all complete nails according to basic method of manufacture, length, and functional form.
The author then examined the relative frequency of such attributes between features, as well as within
features, in order to assess chronological and functional variability within the entire nail assemblage.
Machine-cut nails constitute the predominant type of nail recovered from the Project Area. In fact, cut nails
account for more than 92 percent of all complete common nails in the assemblage (n=605). The
predominance of cut nails is not surprising, given that only those features believed to have been constructed
prior to 1870 were targeted for data recovery. Wire nails account for 5 percent of the recovered common
nails (n=33), while cut nails with applied heads (n=11) and hand-forged nails (n=7) account for the remaining
3 percent of the common nails. Excessive oxidation deteriorated the vast majority of the nails to the point
where identification of more subtle technological features, such as shaft burrs, clamp pinches, and buttressing,
was not possible.

Interfeature and Intrafeature Chronology
Several oft-cited studies (e.g., Fontana and Greenleaf 1962; Nelson 1963; Orser et al. 1987:549-588) discuss
how the relative proportion of cut nails to wire nails can provide a chronological index for nineteenth-century
structures or sites. Wire nail usage gradually eclipsed that of cut nails during the late nineteenth century; thus
the proportion of cut nails from any given provenience suggests a range of years for the construction of
architectural elements on the site. Table 11.3 lists the chronological index presented by Fontana and
Greenleaf (1962).

The author compared the cut nail and wire nail proportions for the 10 features with samples of complete
common nails numbering more than 15. As expected, the ratio of cut to wire nails is very high for all of these
features (Figure 11.2). Cut nails comprise 100 percent of the sample in four cases, indicating deposition that
minimally predates 1887. Cut nails also constitute at least 95 percent of the sample in five other cases,
suggesting that at least part of each feature may include deposition dating to the late 1880s.

Figure 11.2. Percentages of machine-cut nails among all complete nails (n>15).

Feature 7024 (F7024), a capped well within 41HR820, yielded the only considerable fraction of wire nails
within the Project Area. Based upon the dating key listed in Table 11.3, this may initially suggest an overall

146

deposition date in the 1890s. However, a closer examination of the vertical distribution of nail types within
this well-defined feature indicates otherwise. As shown in Figure 11.3, a clear pattern in the distribution of
nail types occurs within F7024. There is, in fact, a general decline in the relative frequency of cut nails from
the lower strata to the uppermost strata. The three lowest nail-bearing strata (Zones 2-4) yielded 100 percent
cut nails. The occurrence of cut nails decreases to 76 percent in Zone 1, and it decreases even further (67
percent) in the sandy fill directly under the concrete well cap. Despite the admittedly small intrafeature
samples, there is a general trend toward the abandonment of cut nail usage through the life of the feature. The
combination of stratified deposits and gradual decline in relative cut-nail frequency also supports the notion
that the well reflects multiple fill episodes. One possible interpretation holds that the initial fill episodes,
reflected by the lower strata, were deposited in the early or mid 1880s. Later fill episodes, as reflected by the
uppermost strata (Zone 1 and well cap fill), may have been deposited in the early 1890s.

A sample of 95 complete common nails from F5014 (41HR816) permitted a similar intrafeature examination
of the vertical distribution of basic nail types. Feature 5014 was a well-preserved wood-lined privy on the
property once owned by prominent Houstonian Jacob de Cordova. The author compared nail proportions
between arbitrary 10-cm levels within the feature. Again, there is a clear pattern in the distribution of nail
types (see Figure 11.3). There is a very slight decline in the relative frequency of cut nails from the lower
levels to the uppermost levels. The four lowest nail-bearing levels (Levels 4-7) yielded 100 percent cut nails.
Wire nails first occur in Level 3, which yielded 96 percent cut nails. Levels 1 and 2, near the surface of the
privy deposit, yielded 95 percent cut nails. The slight decline in relative cut-nail frequency in the feature due
to the late appearance of wire nails again suggests at least two, rather than one, fill episodes.
Among the 715 complete nails recovered from the Project Area, specialty nails account for only a small
fraction of the total (Table 11.4). Proportions of specialty nails range from 5 percent at 41HR816 (n=7) to 11
percent at 41HR812 (n=15). No specialized forms were among the small sample of nails from 41HR815. In
all cases, the number of specialty nails deriving from any one feature is so small as to be negligible.

Nail lengths, on the other hand, provide “a dimension beyond the absolute number of nails” (Jurney
1987a:87). Consequently, they may provide better insight regarding the presence of specific architectural
elements at the interfeature analysis level. Within an archeological context, nail size is generally determined
by the type of construction, its degree of modification, and differential rates of nail deterioration (Jurney
1987a:89-90). These processes are often difficult for the archeologist to detect, so analyses of nail-size data
warrant cautious interpretation.
The author compared relative frequencies of nail sizes from the six features with complete common nail
samples numbering more than 30. Four of these features are privy pits (F1063, F5014, F6001, and F7009),
one is a well (F7024), and one is a brick concentration (F5017). As shown in Figure 11.4, nail sizes 4d and
8d generally are the most common. In fact, the nail size distribution is clearly bimodal for F1063, F5017, and
F7024. In each of these cases, there is a high frequency of small nails (2-4d) and medium nails (8d). Small
4d nails suggest such architectural elements such as wooden shakes and shingles, while 8d nails reflect siding
or flooring elements.
Large nails (>10d) for house framing and fences are largely absent. Construction type probably explains the
dearth of large nail sizes within the six analyzed features. Privy features yielding substantial nail samples
were likely associated with nonessential standing architecture. Outhouses were often tenuous constructions
lacking elements of substantial framework, such as joists, rafters, and studs, which characterized household
residences.

148

Most outhouses also lacked floors, which require at least superficial framework. The 8d nails that occur in
high frequencies in the privy pits thus probably reflect siding and wall boards of the outhouse structure.

BRICKS
Houston’s Brick Industry in the Nineteenth Century
Bricks were imported into Houston shortly after its establishment in 1836. The firm of Doswell and Adams
sold imported brick by February 1837 (Houghton et al. 1991:66), with local brick production occurring in
Houston by the summer of 1837. In June of that year, Robert W. Rogers mortgaged to Thomas G. Masterson
of Tennessee, a “brickyard situated in the open part of Houston and all bricks that are on it” (HCC-DR
1837:A:21). Late nineteenth-century reports describe a brick kiln owned by a man named Hathaway on the
south side of Buffalo Bayou, at the logical western extension of McKinney Street (Houghton et al. 1991:74).
This kiln is also reported to have been in operation by the summer of 1837. The 1869 Wood map of Houston
depicts Hathaway’s property at this precise location, but there is no mention of a brickyard as there is on other
areas of the map.
Several additional brick manufacturers had established business in Houston by 1850, when the U.S. Census
for Harris County listed five bricklayers and two brickmakers in the city. Brickmaker James Brown had
leased a 6-acre parcel on White Oak Bayou by the summer of 1839 (HCC-DR 1839:D:333), and Valentine
Dalton established a brickyard in 1841, when he constructed the first brick residence in Houston for A. C.
Allen (Houghton et al. 1991:74; MS 1842:3b). Dalton not only erected the Allen’s brick house, but he also
dug a 43.5-ft-deep (13.3 m) well and lined it with 20,000 bricks (Houghton et al. 1991:74). By 1842,
Nathaniel K. Kellum had established a brickyard on the south side of Buffalo Bayou in present-day Sam
Houston Park. The Democratic Telegraph and Texas Register reported on July 6, 1842, that Kellum’s yard
possessed a “large kiln of bricks, excellent quality, made from clay in that place.” In 1844, Kellum purchased
eight additional acres for the presumed expansion of his brickyard (HCC-DR 1844:I:394). Issac W. Brashear
had also established a brick kiln on the first four lots of Block 18 by 1843 (HCC-DR 1843:H:402). John and
Franklin Brown from Virginia, presumably brothers, were listed as brickmakers in the 1850 census. It is not
known if the Brown brothers were related to James Brown, who operated the brickyard along White Oak
Bayou in 1839.
Houston’s brick industry in the early 1840s grew to the point where local brick was actually being exported
(DTTR 1842:3a; MS 1842:2b). The fact that brick masonry proved to be the best defense against fire
stimulated growth in the city’s industry. Businesses along Main Street gradually replaced their original
wood-framed shops with brick masonry constructions as a safeguard against fires. Despite the rise in local
brick production, brick continued to be imported into Houston before the Civil War. Citing the establishment
of another new brickyard in Houston, the April 24, 1841, edition of the Morning Star remarked that it was
“folly” to continue to import brick from England and elsewhere. The Morning Star edition of June 30, 1842,
further defended the local industry by stating that bricks from Kellum’s brickyard were “as fine and durable
as imported bricks.”
Although local and imported brick was seemingly available prior to the Civil War, “brick houses were never
that popular, probably because of the high cost of bricks relative to easily available lumber” (Houghton et al.
1991:74). Only a few elements on a typical house lot (e.g., fireplaces, kitchen floors, piers, cisterns, and
wells) may have possessed brick construction (Houghton et al. 1991:65). Even after the turn of the century,
brick residences in Houston were rare. Sanborn Fire Insurance maps of 1907 attest to the lack of brick houses
in the city, as “only a small fraction of the housing stock in Houston was of brick construction, and probably
not more than 5 percent of the large, expensive houses were of brick” (Houghton et al. 1991:96).
Houston’s brick industry grew steadily after the Civil War. The 1869 Wood map depicts two large adjacent
brickyards (Young and Stanley) on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, across from Kellum’s business. The
1870-1871 Houston City Directory notes 8-10 brickyards, suggesting a continual growth in the industry
(Houghton et al. 1991:75). Immediately following the Civil War, brick manufacturing began in earnest along
Cedar Bayou at the eastern edge of Harris County. Between 1870 and the 1920s, anywhere from six to nearly

150

a dozen brickyards operated along the banks of Cedar Bayou near present-day Baytown (Hole 1972:62).
Cedar Bayou bricks were “shipped by barges, schooners, and freighters to Houston and Galveston,”
contributing to construction in those cities (Hole 1972:62, 77). While brick importation may have continued
in the second half of the nineteenth century, locally produced bricks most likely accounted for the vast
majority of brick-masonry constructions in Houston.
Manufacturing Methods
Brickmaking authorities recognize three basic brick types: soft mud, stiff mud, and dry pressed (Gurke
1987:13). Soft-mud bricks were made initially by hand and later by semiautomatic machines. Stiff-mud and
dry-pressed bricks were manufactured with fully automated equipment. Attempts to mechanize brickmaking
were being made as early as the 1790s (Gurke 1987:86); however, successful mechanization in the brick
industry did not occur until the 1840s and was generally limited to select brickyards in the eastern United
States (Gurke 1987:87). Mechanized methods of brick manufacture gradually spread across the United States.
Gurke (1987:84) notes that “by the mid-nineteenth century . . . the main kinds of brick machines in use today
had already been invented and were in use, and at the beginning of the twentieth century machines could
virtually eliminate hand labor from all aspects of the industry.”
Advances in brick production tended to lag behind on the frontier. For example, the American Northwest did
not see its first soft-mud machines until around 1867 (Gurke 1987:148). The introduction of stiff-mud and
dry-pressed brick machines occurred there in the late 1880s. Local newspapers document the operation of
soft-mud brick machines in Texas by the mid 1850s. For example, an advertisement for “A. Hall’s Patent
Brick Machines” appears in the February 5, 1856, edition of the Galveston Weekly News, boasting that the
horse- or hand-powered machines produced 170,000 bricks per day. Unfortunately, the extent to which
brickmaking machines were successfully used is not clear. According to the accounts of former Cedar Bayou
brickyard workers in the 1960s, brickmaking technology in Harris County lagged far behind other parts of the
country. They recount that mechanized brickmaking was not introduced to the area until the early part of this
century (Hole 1972:62). Handmade soft-mud brick apparently predominated during the nineteenth century in
Harris County, at least in terms of the eastern Harris County brickyards.
According to the account of Mr. Nelson A. Martin, first published as a series in the Baytown Sun beginning
February 12, 1968, and later republished by Hole (1972:65-78), Cedar Bayou bricks consisted of two parts
topsoil and one part clay. The raw materials were soaked for at least 24 hours to soften them, and were then
mixed together in a horse-powered mill. The molder placed a lump of brick mud into a wooden three-brick
mold. Both the lump and the mold were sanded prior to placing the former into the latter, a technique known
as sand striking. The molder placed the lump of brick mud firmly into the mold and trimmed the excess from
the top using a wooden stick. According to Mr. Martin, the trimming stick measured 16 in long, 1.5 in wide,
and 0.25 in thick (41 x 4 x 0.6 cm). Mud bricks fresh out of the mold were termed ‘green,’ as they had not
yet been fired. Green bricks were stacked to air dry for three to four weeks. While early brickyards stacked
green bricks in the open, late nineteenth-century brickyards stacked them under sheds to protect them from
excess heat or rain. Up to 300,000 green bricks were then placed in a kiln and fired for up to eight days.
Fired bricks frequently remained in the kiln until they were ready for shipment. In the late nineteenth century,
1,000 bricks sold for $6.00 in Galveston. Brickmaking during the nineteenth century was generally a
summertime operation, since cold winter weather would freeze and break green bricks before they could be
fired. Brickyard workers spent the winter months cutting the great quantities of wood needed to fire the brick
kilns in the summer.
Bricks in the Project Area
Bricks and brick fragments were essential components to many of the structural features uncovered during the
current project. Cisterns, wells, gutters, foundations, and piers were numerous throughout the Project Area,
and all of these were constructed with brick. The most striking was F7005 on 41HR820. Nearly one-half of

151

this intact brick house foundation was well preserved, thus providing an excellent sample of bricks to
examine. In most cases, at least one complete brick from each of the other brick features was collected for
comparative analysis.
Analysis entailed the examination of all brick pieces at least one-half of the original size. Brick fragments
less than one-half size are included in the artifact inventory but were not individually examined. The author
analyzed 24 whole bricks and 13 large brick fragments from 30 distinct features throughout the Project Area.
Fifty whole bricks from F7005 were also examined. The size dimensions (length x width x thickness) of all
complete bricks were recorded. Diagnostic evidence of specific manufacturing techniques was also
systematically recorded.
Feature 7005
Available evidence indicates that handmade soft-mud common bricks exclusively comprised F7005. All
bricks in the sample (n=50) clearly exhibit a coarse ‘struck’ face, which is typical of the soft-mud variety
(Gurke 1987:102). The underside of the brick (which was face down in the mold) is quite smooth and
uniform in comparison to the struck surface. In 84 percent of the cases, a few incised parallel striations occur
on the struck surface of the brick. The struck surface was created when the brick molder used a blade to trim
the excess mud from the mold. Striations on the top surfaces of these molded bricks suggest that at least some
of the planes used to shave the excess were wooden, since metal blades generally left gouge marks. Previous
studies have designated the use of wooden planes as ‘stick-trimmed,’ and metal blades as ‘blade-trimmed’
(see Gurke 1987:103). However, the single coarse surface alone does not immediately reveal handmade
production since the earliest semiautomatic machines still required workers to trim the excess mud by hand.
‘Lips’ are the morphological features that most betray the specific method of manufacture for the soft-mud
bricks from F7005. A lip “is a slight excess of clay usually found adjacent to the struck surface of the brick.
It may be caused when the brick is struck and the clay is pushed downward and outward as the strike moves
across the face of the brick” (Gurke 1987:108). Albeit infrequent, lipping is considered one of the most
distinctive marks on handmade bricks (Gurke 1987:108). Of the 50 whole bricks examined, 13 (26 percent)
possess this specific sign of handmade manufacture.
Several other formal characteristics of the bricks from F7005 are worthy of note in the context of Mr.
Martin’s Cedar Bayou recollections. First, the mixing of topsoil and clay to make brick mud, as recounted by
Mr. Martin, would have introduced foreign materials, such as gravel and fibers, but gravel or fiber inclusions
in the bricks from F7005 are rare. Only four bricks in the sample (8 percent) exhibit foreign inclusions.
Perhaps a higher grade of brick, one consisting of more pure clay and less topsoil, was employed in the
construction of F7005. Second, Mr. Martin recounts how the wooden molds in the Cedar Bayou brickyards
were sanded to keep green bricks from sticking to them. All of the bricks from F7005 are presumably sand
struck, as other lubricating materials (e.g., water and oil) would have left distinctive traces on the bricks.
Bricks from F7005 are unmarked and range in color from bright orange to strong red. Overall, brick color is
fairly consistent from F7005. Brick color is normally variable due to the position of individual bricks in the
kiln, as well as the duration of firing and raw materials. There is frequently as much variation in brick color
within a kiln as there is between kilns or between brickyards (Gurke 1987:116-117). Therefore, the
consistency in brick color at F7005 is noteworthy (see below).
Other Features
Thirty other features also yielded handmade soft-mud common bricks, varying in color from light yellowish
orange to strong red. None of the bricks is marked. Among morphological characteristics, 91 percent of
these bricks (31 out of 34) clearly exhibit a struck face. Parallel striations, indicative of stick-trimmed bricks,
occur on the struck surfaces in just under half of the cases (44 percent). The distinctive lips of handmade

152

bricks were encountered on 29 percent of the 34 bricks examined, a surprisingly similar percentage to that
observed on the sample of bricks from F7005. Foreign inclusions, such as fibrous material and pebbles, were
observed in 47 percent of the bricks. This suggests that topsoil and clay were mixed to create brick mud,
something that was recalled by the Cedar Bayou brickmakers but not readily evident at F7005. Like the brick
from F7005, all brick from other features was presumably sand struck as no significant evidence of other
lubricating materials was encountered.
Sizes of Handmade Brick
South (1964a) developed an index based upon the overall size of bricks from historic-period sites. Brick
measurements for length, width, and thickness (in inches) are each multiplied by eight and then added
together to arrive at an index value. The index represents the total number of eighths of an inch contained in
the brick’s three measurements. South (1964a:70) presents data from a number of eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury sites. He notes that there was a long American tradition for brick sizes between 115 and 130 eighths
during this period (South 1964a:69). The standard of the twentieth century is somewhat smaller, measuring
113-114 eighths. South (1964a) correlates time with relative brick size, but his data reflect no general linear
trend. Consequently, South (1964a:73) concludes that brick size “is generally an invalid tool for dating due to
its relatively standardized form throughout the centuries.”
Fawcett (1980:Table 16) presents an expanded data set on brick size for eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
sites. His data also show no linear change in brick size over time (Fawcett 1980:Figure 12). Fawcett
(1980:114) notes that the brick index “can be biased by [variations in brick form resulting from] specific
functional construction needs.” Function also influences the size and shape of bricks (Gurke 1987:117; Kelly
and Kelly 1977:85).
The sample of whole bricks from F7005 is quite consistent with respect to size. About 40 percent of the
bricks in the sample measure precisely 8.125 x 3.75 x 2.25 in (20.6 x 9.5 x 5.7 cm), with the remainder being
either slightly smaller or larger. South’s (1964a) index was used to convert the various measurements to
single values and to plot the frequency of these values (Figure 11.5). The central tendency of brick indices
from F7005 is 113, which falls outside the traditionally held range for nineteenth-century brick. In other
words, brick from F7005 is somewhat smaller than that usually encountered on nineteenth-century sites,
particularly mid nineteenth-century sites. These brick sizes closely approximate twentieth-century standards
established for mechanized methods of production. For example, in 1918, the National Brick Manufacturers
Association established a common brick standard of 8 x 3.75 x 2.5 in (20.3 x 9.5 x 6.4 cm) (index=114)
(Gurke 1987:117).
More important than the central tendency of brick indices from F7005 is the low variability in frequency
distribution (s=0.90), as nearly all indices are tightly clustered around values of 113-114. Compare this to the
frequency distribution for the sample of whole bricks from the 30 other features (see Figure 11.5). The
distribution of brick indices is normal, with a mean and mode of 115. Not only is the central tendency
slightly higher, but the standard deviation for the distribution (s=2.41) is nearly three times that exhibited by
the sample from F7005. In short, brick size for the sample at F7005 is much more uniform than that for the
sample of nineteenth-century brick at other features.
Consistencies in size and color, together with the purity of the raw material, suggest that the brick constituting
F7005 was a high-quality product. The manufacturer of brick for F7005 seemingly had the expertise and
equipment to exert tight control over the mining, molding, and firing processes to produce such consistent
results. This may have translated into higher prices for the consumer. As brick was already an expensive
commodity in Houston, the brick used to construct F7005 may have been reserved for the privileged few that
could afford such high quality.

Handmade Tabby Brick. Spanish and English colonists in the New World used ‘tabby brick’ (made of oyster
shell, sand, and lime) as a building material from the sixteenth century. Despite Houston’s proximity to the
coast, tabby was not as common in the city as it was along the Atlantic coast, from South Carolina to Florida
(Sheehan et al. 1999:39-41; Taves 1996:22-25). Nevertheless, a few scarce references to its use do exist. The
house of prominent Houstonian William Fairfax Gray, constructed in the 1830s, is reported to have been
covered with tabby concrete (Houghton et al. 1991:75). Moreover, the July 11, 1859, edition of the TriWeekly Telegraph in Houston noted “an experiment in the way of building being tried by Mr. L. B. Bearce. . .
He is putting up a concrete house of shells, sand and cement. We are inclined to believe it will prove cheaper
than brick and fully as lasting” (Ti-Weekly Telegraph 1859).

F1048B yielded a tabby brick. This complete brick measures 8.25 x 3.875 x 2.25 in (21 x 9.8 x 5.7 cm),
producing a South (1964a) index value of 115. This brick exhibits a rectangular depression on one side that
measures 3.5 x 2.5 in (8.9 x 6.4 cm); it resembles the ‘frog’ feature found on some standard mud bricks.
Gurke (1987:112) states that the frog served several purposes for mud bricks: it provided a key for mortar, it
reduced the weight of the brick, and it permitted the brick to dry and fire more quickly. Perhaps it served a
similar function for tabby bricks.
MISCELLANEOUS HARDWARE AND FURNISHINGS
Several other classes of architectural/hardware artifacts were recovered during data-recovery excavations.
With the exception of locks, lock accessories, and furnishing hardware, clearly identifiable forms of these
classes occurred in relative low frequencies across the Project Area (Table 11.5).
Locks and Lock Accessories
Locks
Site 41HR818 yielded an iron door-lock casing with a brass bolt. The square iron case is 3 in (7.6 cm) wide
and closely resembles Model No. 512 of the upright-rim knob locks advertised in the Russell and Erwin
Catalog (1980:17 [1865]). Upright-rim and horizontal-rim locks were the two basic door-lock forms available
in the mid nineteenth century. This variety of door lock consisted of an iron case measuring ca. 4 x 3 in (10.2

154

x 7.6 cm), two brass bolts, and an accompanying brass key. The locks were “packed with escutcheon plates
and screws,” while mountings and ceramic door knobs were available for an additional charge (Russell and
Erwin 1980:16-17 [1865]).
Part of a cabinet or chest lock was encountered in F5014 on 41HR816. The iron cabinet-lock casing with
brass detailing is rectangular and measures 3.5 x 2.5 in (8.9 x 6.4 cm). It includes a raised piece of brass
defining the keyhole, which in hardware vernacular is termed a bushing. A brass keyhole cover, known as a
drop, is also present. The drop is marked: A. . NT. This is perhaps an abbreviation for ‘patent.’ The Russell
and Erwin Catalog (1980:106-110 [1865]) illustrates several padlock varieties with the distinctive drop and
bushing features. None of their cabinet lock designs actually includes these features.

Feature 7021 yielded a third lock specimen with iron and brass elements. The fragmentary nature of the
artifact precludes definitive identification, but it closely resembles the “wrought iron flush bolts” advertised in
the Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:96 [1865]). These bolts consist of a thin iron plate between 0.75-1.25 in
wide (2-4.5 cm) and from 6 to 42 in long (15-107 cm). A “projecting thumb piece” made of brass is near one
end of the iron plate (Russell and Erwin 1980:96 [1865]).
Keys
Keys were common enough by the nineteenth century to have been manufactured from a variety of metals.
Data recovery excavations yielded keys manufactured from brass, iron, and lead (or a lead alloy). Feature
1063 yielded a common brass door key of the type that would have fit the upright door lock from 41HR818.
The Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:55 [1865]) illustrates several keys that are essentially the same as the
one recovered from F1063. Feature 5017 yielded an iron square key, probably for an interior cabinet lock
(Russell and Erwin 1980:128 [1865]). An iron cabinet or padlock key was recovered from F6001. Feature
7021 yielded both a key and key ring of a lead-based material, although the general type of key is unknown.
Knobs
Excavations also yielded three ceramic knobs that may well have been accessories to door locks such as those
recovered from 41HR818. Feature 6001 yielded two plain porcelain knobs with diameters measuring 2 and
2.25 in (5.1 and 5.7 cm). Feature 5017 yielded a 2-in (5.1 cm) ceramic knob with a dark brown glaze, known
as ‘mineral’ in hardware vernacular. Plain porcelain and mineral were the only knob varieties advertised in
the Russell and Erwin Catalog. Knob size listings in the catalog range from 0.63-2.25 in (1.6-5.7 cm),
suggesting that the recovered knobs were among the largest sizes available in the mid nineteenth century.
While ceramic knobs were a common accessory to door locks, they also comprised parts of other domestic

155

elements. For example, the Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:47, 51, 66, 73, 81 [1865]) advertised porcelain
and mineral knobs for cupboards, refrigerators, French windows, sash doors, and house bell pulls.
Escutcheons and Hasps
Escutcheons are the ornamental plates surrounding keyholes. While nineteenth-century escutcheons were
produced from such varied materials as porcelain, wood, and bone, the most common material was metal.
Manufacturers produced escutcheons in numerous shapes and decorative styles. They frequently included
drops that covered and protected the keyhole.
Two escutcheons were recovered during excavation. Feature 5008 yielded a rectangular brass escutcheon
measuring approximately 3.5 x 1 in (8.9 x 2.5 cm). Feature 1025 yielded a rectangular escutcheon fragment
of cuprous metal, perhaps also brass. The precise size of this escutcheon fragment is unknown.
In addition to the escutcheons, an ornately decorated brass hasp was recovered from F1065. The hasp would
have served to fasten the lid of a small box, perhaps a jewelry, glove, handkerchief, or music box. These
hasps were often plated with silver, but there is no direct indication of that on the specimen recovered. The
1897 Sears Catalog illustrates several good examples (Israel 1968: 351, 523).
Furnishing Hardware
Casters
Two furniture casters are among the furnishings recovered during data-recovery excavations. Casters are
mounted wheels in a swivel frame that support chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture. Nineteenthcentury casters consisted of metal frames with wheels of wood, metal, porcelain, or rubber (Russell and Erwin
1980:159 [1865]). Brass and iron were common metals used in caster manufacture.
Feature 6002 yielded a 1.1 in (2.9 cm) round brass socket caster, virtually identical to an illustration in the
Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:159 [1865]). Perhaps the wheel was made of wood since only the caster
frame has survived. Feature 7044 yielded a second caster with an iron frame and a porcelain wheel. The iron
has deteriorated to the point where identification of the caster style is difficult. The lack of a socket or other
platform above the wheel suggests that it may have been a bed caster (Russell and Erwin 1980:159 [1865]).
Coat and Hat Hooks
Coat and hat hooks with one or two rungs were a common household wall furnishing. Standard hooks of the
mid nineteenth century were manufactured from cast iron, while more expensive varieties were made of brass
and included a small porcelain knob at the end of each hook (Russell and Erwin 1980:85, 153 [1865]).
Two locations within the Project Area yielded coat and hat hooks. Feature 5014 yielded two complete and
one partial coat and hat hook of cast iron. All three hooks are identical, each with two hooks and two
locations for screw attachment into the wall. In fact, the partial hook is still attached to fragments of the
wallboard from which it once hung. A similar, but smaller, cast-iron coat and hat hook was recovered from
41HR812. This specimen is identical to “Coat and Hat Hooks No. 1,” illustrated in the Russell and Erwin
Catalog (1980:85 [1865]). The three hooks from F5014 differ from the catalog illustration only in the
positioning of screw attachments.
Drawer Pulls
Four drawer pulls were recovered from the Project Area, with three of these from F6001. Foremost among
the F6001 materials is a miniature brass lifting handle with a gilt finish that measured 2 in (5.1 cm) and
weighed 3 oz (93.3 g). Lacking strong attachments, this handle must have been part of a delicate item, such
as a jewelry chest, and probably was just as decorative as it was functional. An iron strap-handle drawer pull
was also recovered from F6001. It is probably large enough to have derived from a trunk or standard chest of

156

drawers, although no other specific details can be drawn from the deteriorated item. Lastly, identical dropring-style drawer pulls were recovered from F6001 and F5014. These simple drawer pulls include thin iron
rings measuring approximately 1.25 in (3.2 cm) in diameter.
Foot Scraper
A cistern (F4002, 41HR819) yielded a cast-iron foot scraper. Foot scrapers were iron cross bars, typically
located outside a house, that were used to scrape mud from shoes or boots. Many foot scrapers were screwed
on to a wooden plank that formed part of a step or porch (e.g., Israel 1968:88). Some had a plate attachment
with a shaft that enabled it to be set into stone. Molten lead was poured through the shaft to secure it. Many
foot scrapers included a dark japanned finish. The most elaborate included two brushes that helped clean
footwear, and dishes to collect the deposited mud. The 1865 Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:143-144
[1865]) depicts 16 styles of foot scrapers with various amounts of ornamentation. The specimen from F4002
is one of the larger, essentially plain styles. It closely resembles Style Nos. 8 and 9 in the Russell and Erwin
Catalog. Such a foot scraper would have been an item of great utility in Houston, where heavy surface clays
produce notoriously sticky mud.
Bracket
Feature 7009 yielded part of a fancy cast-iron bracket. Cast-iron brackets were specifically advertised for
shelves in nineteenth-century catalogs (Israel 1968:92; Montgomery Ward Company [MWC] 1969:398;
Russell and Erwin 1980:387 [1865]). They ranged in size from 4 x 5 in (10.2 x 12.7 cm) to 19 x 23 in (48.3 x
58.4 cm), and were generally japanned or bronze plated. The precise dimensions of the partial bracket from
F7009 are unknown, but it is at least 5 x 7 in (12.7 x 17.8 cm).
KITCHEN ITEMS
Cast-Iron Kitchen Items
Excavations also yielded several cast-iron kitchen items, all of which were confined to F6001 and F7009. A
pot hook and a fragment of a cast-iron flat utensil handle were among the artifacts from F6001. The
fragmentary handle is similar to those illustrated for gravy strainers and ladles in the Dover Stamping
Company’s 1869 Catalog (AHCC 1971:71). Feature 6001 also yielded small fragments of a cast-iron pot or
pan with tripod legs.
A cast-iron frying pan measuring 10 in (25.4 cm) in diameter and 2 in (5.1 cm) in depth (also referred to in
catalogs as spiders) was among other cast-iron artifacts recovered from F7009. The pan is complete, except
for its cast-iron handle, and resembles all of the standard plain frying pans advertised in nineteenth-century
catalogs (AHCC 1971:70; MWC 1969:427; Russell and Erwin 1980:394 [1865]). Cast-iron frying pans
varied from 8-14 in (20-36 cm) in diameter. A 10-in (25.4 cm) cast-iron pan sold for $0.16 in the 1895
Montgomery Ward Catalog (MWC 1969:427). Feature 7009 also yielded fragments of an indeterminate castiron pot or pan with tripod legs, as well as three fragments of an iron pot hook that would have been an
accessory to any number of cast-iron hollowware objects, including kettles, scotch bowls, and boilers (Russell
and Erwin 1980:393 [1865]).
Various cast-iron stove parts were encountered at F2002, F4002, F6001, and F7024. Notable among these
artifacts was a stove plate cast with detailed floral and geometric designs recovered from F7024.
Table Cutlery and Tableware
Mid nineteenth-century manufacturers of kitchen utensils made a distinction between tableware, (i.e.,
flatware) and table cutlery. Tableware, including forks, spoons, ladles, and desert knives, were generally allmetal objects (Russell and Erwin 1980:341-343 [1865]). Most often silver, or silver plated, tableware utensils
were employed in more elegant table settings. Table cutlery, on the other hand, was characterized by
nonmetal handles attached to each side of the metal utensil. The blade or tine material on cutlery was usually

157

iron, although silver and silver-plated cutlery blades were also manufactured. Handles were manufactured
from materials such as bone, ivory, horn, ebony, and cacao wood (Russell and Erwin 1980:356-357 [1865]).
Some, if not all, of these materials were available on the Upper Texas Coast prior to the Civil War. For
example, a house-furnishing warehouse in Galveston advertised “Superior Quality, Ivory and Bone Handled
Knives, Forks and Carvers to match” in the February 5, 1856, edition of the Galveston Weekly News. By the
late 1800s, hard rubber and celluloid were other materials from which cutlery handles were made (Israel
1968:108; MWC 1969:446). Three-pronged forks and knives, dessert forks and knives, and carvers
constituted the principal items of common table cutlery.
Whereas the iron blades of table cutlery preserve poorly, handles often persist in the archeological record.
Commercially produced cutlery handles in the 1800s took three standard forms: oval, square, and octagonal
(Russell and Erwin 1980:356-357 [1865]). Oval handles were rounded at the end, while square handles, as
the name implies, were squared off at the end. Octagon handles were tapered along the edges of the two
faces. Hand-carved handles and other forms were also made but were not as common or widely distributed as
commercially produced types.
The price of table cutlery was determined by the handle material, the number of bolsters, the type of metal,
and the amount of decoration on the handle. A comparison of similarly designed cutlery depicted in late
nineteenth-century catalogs allows a comparison of the relative value of handle materials. Table 11.6 lists
1897 retail price data for sets of cutlery with steel blades and plain single-bolster handles. Retail prices for
similar merchandise in 1895 are comparable (MWC 1969:445-446). The data indicate that wood handles
were generally the cheapest, with bone handles also being relatively inexpensive at the time. Hard rubber
handles cost more than three times as much; their exorbitant price probably reflects the durability of the
material over wood and bone.

Nine features within the Project Area yielded a minimum of 10 pieces of table cutlery and four pieces of
tableware. The table cutlery pieces include eight handles and two ferrous knife-blade fragments. Table 11.7
lists summary information on the cutlery handles. All three handle forms described in contemporary
catalogs–square, oval, and octagonal–were recovered during the excavations. Polished bone and octagonal
shapes predominate among the characteristics of cutlery handles in the assemblage. Metal bolsters or other
detailing were evident on all but one of the handles. The polished bone handle with a true silver bolster from
F7047 is the only clear status marker in the assemblage.

A stag (i.e., deer antler) handle, presumably from a carver, was among the area of sheet refuse exposed on
41HR818. Stag was a material common to carvers, but uncommon to other table cutlery in the nineteenth
century. The numerous stag-handle carvers advertised in catalogs of the era attest to their popularity (Israel
1968:108; MWC 1969:446). To match the increased blade size, carver handles were more robust than those
of forks and knives. The stag handle from 41HR818 has a diameter of 3.25 in (8.3 cm) and is 4.5 in (11.4 cm)
long. An extension of the iron blade running through the handle was capped at the end to secure the handle
attachment.
Spoons comprised all four of the tableware pieces. Feature 5014 yielded two complete spoons that could
have conceivably belonged to a matched set. One is a plain silverplate teaspoon that measures 5.75 in (14.6
cm) in length and is stamped: G. D. L. The second is a large, plain silverplate tablespoon, perhaps a berry
spoon, that measures 8.75 in (22.2 cm) long and is stamped: Hall & Elton. No information on the two marks
was located, but they may signify manufacturers, importers, or distributors. The base metal for both spoons is
copper or a copper alloy. Feature 7005 yielded a small tinware spoon measuring 4.9 in (12.4 cm) long.
Measurements given in the 1897 Sears Catalog indicate that this tableware piece was most likely a coffee
spoon (Israel 1968:438). The undecorated spoon is also stamped, but the mark is illegible. The fourth
tableware specimen is a spoon fragment of lead-based metal recovered from F1025.
Child’s Silverware Mug
Since early colonial times, small metal cups with handles, generally known as mugs, have been popular in
America. It is known that “while large examples of a pint capacity or more were used by adults, smaller ones
. . . were often reserved for children” (Fennimore 1984:155). In fact, small silverware mugs, either pure silver
or sliver plated, were common christening gifts during the Victorian era (Fennimore 1984:154). The 1897
Sears Catalog illustrates no less than 13 styles of children’s mugs, including one in a satin-lined gift box
(Israel 1968:446).
Feature 5014 yielded four fragments of a child’s silverware mug, including the handle. Together, the four
pieces constitute a nearly complete specimen. The small mug is whitemetal and was presumably silver or
nickel plated, although no observable residue of the plating material remains. It has a cylindrical body with
flaring sides and a molded and beaded lip. It also possesses a low, slightly flaring foot rim. The handle is Sshaped with a spur at the upper end. The mug’s diameter is 1.75 in (4.5 cm) at its base, and it stood about 2.5
in (6.4 cm) high. A band with stippled patterning encircles the body just above the foot rim. A similar band
encircles the body of the cup just below the rim. These ornamental borders generally indicate machine
manufacture (Fennimore 1984:154).

159

Finial
Finials are small ornamental knobs attached to the lids of fine silverware table settings. During the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, finials were common accessories to such varied serving pieces as teapots, tankards,
water urns, pitchers, salt and pepper shakers, and sugar bowls (see Fennimore 1984). They could be also
found on other domestic items, such as vaseline and powder boxes (Israel 1968:456). Finials were functional
knobs on many objects, but they were simply ornaments on an equal number of pieces. Use of finials on
tankards provides one example of their ornamental nature, given that each tankard includes a hinged
thumbpiece that actually opens its lid.
Feature 7009 yielded a spherical finial manufactured from a heavy, lead-based metal. It was presumably
silver or nickel plated, although no observable trace of the plating metal remains. A pair of engraved circles
appears on both the northern and southern hemispheres of the specimen, while a pronounced mold line occurs
at its maximum circumference. A projection on the bottom of the finial possesses ridges on the interior that
allow it to be screwed down on top of a lid.
Glass Bottle Closure
Feature 5006 yielded a common, late nineteenth-century bottle stopper that provides a solid diagnostic piece
for the feature’s deposition. The piece is a Hutchinson’s Spring Stopper, a patented bottle closure invented by
Charles G. Hutchinson in 1879 and commonly used for mineral and soda bottles with classic ‘blob top’
finishes (Stewart and Cosentino 1976:24). The closure consisted of a heavy cuprous wire spring that
protruded above the bottle finish. A rubber gasket was attached to the bottom of the wire below the
bottleneck; it was secured against the neck of the bottle by the forces of carbonation. Manufacture of the
Hutchinson Spring Stopper was discontinued in 1912 (Riley 1958:98).
ARMS AND AMMUNITION
Ammunition from the Project Area falls into two general categories: lead shot (n=8) and a conical bullet
(n=1). Both forms were manufactured from cast lead, and their mold lines are occasionally visible. The size
of standard lead shot, or caliber, is determined by the diameter of the ball to the nearest one-hundredth of an
inch (0.25 mm). Table 11.8 lists calibers of lead shot encountered during data-recovery excavations.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, separate loading ammunition consisted of a paper
cartridge, gunpowder, and lead ball (see Hoyem 1981). The gunpowder and ball were deposited into the
paper, tied together with a string at one end, and the paper folded at the other end. When preparing to fire an
160

arm, one bit open the paper tube, poured the powder into the barrel, and rammed the lead ball down on top of
it. The most common shot during this time was .69 caliber, although multiple grapeshot often took the place
of a single lead ball. By the 1830s, primitive priming devices were attached to the paper tubes, which
essentially eliminated the need to bite open the cartridges (Hoyem 1981:24).
Aside from primary use as ammunition, lead shot was employed for domestic purposes. Consequently,
alternative uses and reuses of lead shot deserve at least brief mention. One example of its domestic use is
discussed by Jones (1986:21-22), who cites the use of lead shot for cleaning glass bottles. Its use was
encouraged, as it was soft enough to not scratch the interior of the bottles. However, extreme caution was
required in its use, since residue from the lead shot could result in poisoning. Jones (1986:22) cites the
archeological recovery of bottles with pieces of shot lodged between the kick-up base and the body.
Conical bullets were developed in Europe during the 1820s and 1830s (Hoyem 1981:31). One of the most
common was the ‘minie,’ a conical bullet named after the Frenchman who developed it in the 1840s (Hoyem
1981:31). The bullet had a hollow base, often encircled with three rings, which was initially covered with a
small piece of sheet iron. Other variations of the conical bullet followed the minie (see, for example, Smith
1994:Figure 4.6).
Drawn brass and India rubber cartridges were developed in the 1850s to accompany conical bullets (Hoyem
1981:80), although paper cartridges continued to be used throughout the Civil War (Smith 1994:71). The
single conical lead bullet from F7005 is a .45 caliber and includes two rings at its base. It lacks a hollow base,
and as such, is not a minie bullet by definition.
The only firearm encountered during the project was a .30-caliber double-barrel percussion lock pistol (i.e.,
cap and ball) from 41HR818. The side-by-side octagonal barrels are relatively short (3.5 in, or 8.9 cm),
suggesting that the firearm was a pocket pistol. While it is not known whether the bore was smooth or rifled,
rifling would probably not be effective on barrels of this length. The pistol most likely predates 1865, when
the use of metallic cartridges eclipsed that of separate loading ammunition. The artifact closely resembles the
type of pistol illustrated in Schroeder (1980:112, No. 583).
AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE, AND TRANSPORTATION
Horseshoes, Saddlery, and Wagon Hardware
The Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:250 [1865]) advertised various sizes of horseshoes in three patterns:
Government, City, and Southern. Both Government and City pattern horseshoes were heavier than their
Southern counterpart. Based upon illustrations in the catalog, the increased horseshoe width of City patterns
distinguished them from Government patterns. Mule shoes are distinguished from standard horseshoes by
being more straight and narrow. The “light mule” shoes depicted in the Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:250
[1865]) clearly demonstrate these differences.
Excavations yielded a single horseshoe each from F2005 and F7044. Neither of these neatly conformed to the
standard patterns advertised by the Russell and Erwin Company. For example, the horseshoe from F7044
weighs only 6 oz (187 g), whereas all of the 27 horseshoes advertised by Russell and Erwin weigh at least 10
oz (311 g). In addition, 41HR818 yielded two mule shoes from nonfeature contexts. One of these weighed 5
oz (156 g), which again is well below the minimum of 10 oz for mule shoes advertised by Russell and Erwin.
Perhaps the horseshoes were products of local foundries.
Six other metal items commonly associated with saddlery and wagon hardware were also recovered during
the fieldwork. These are listed by site in Table 11.9.

Handsaw
Handsaws, or panel saws, were just one of many different saw tools common in nineteenth-century
communities. Handsaw blades were cast iron and were often impressed with the name of the manufacturer.
Sizes in the mid 1800s generally ranged between 16 and 24 in (41-61 cm) (Russell and Erwin 1980:165
[1865]). Based upon their frequency in nineteenth-century catalogs (e.g., Russell and Erwin 1980:165
[1865]), saw handles were most commonly made of hand-carved beechwood, although walnut and apple were
also manufactured. Two, three, or four screws attached the handle to the blade.
Feature 7009 yielded a well-preserved panel saw with both blade and handle. The cast-iron blade, measuring
24 in (61 cm) long, would have been one of the largest panel saws available on a commercial basis. However,
it possesses no maker’s mark. The carved beechwood handle closely resembles those illustrated in the
Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:165 [1865]). Two screws or rivets secured the handle to the blade.
Hose Pipe Spigot
Feature 6001 yielded a spigot-like object made of nickel-plated brass. Comparison with illustrations in the
Russell and Erwin Catalog (1980:278 [1865]) suggests that it is a screw tip for a metal hose pipe. The screw
tip and hose pipe would have served the same number of domestic activities as water hoses do today.
Foundry Type
Three features within 41HR820 each yielded a single example of lead foundry type. Feature 7005 yielded a
type specimen with a raised typeface ‘G’ in eight- or nine-point font size. In printing vernacular, the piece
has three ‘nicks’ on its ‘belly’ and a single groove on the bottom. Feature 7025 yielded a type specimen with
a typeface ‘B’ in the same font size. It also has three nicks on its belly, and it may well be from the same type
set as the specimen from F7005. The third example comes from F7034, and the typeface is an apparent dash
or hyphen bar. It possesses four nicks on its belly and another nick on its body. Similar examples of foundry
type in archeological context are also known from the Constitution Hall site in Huntsville, Alabama (Wesley
1972:20).

CLOTHING, PERSONAL ITEMS, AND RECREATIONAL ARTIFACTS
Allan D. Meyers

Many clothing and personal items recovered from historic-period archeological sites, particularly those
predating the Civil War, provide us with a glimpse of the articles of contemporary, everyday life. The 1897
Sears Catalog referred to these ‘little necessities’ as “things that everybody needs and everybody must have.
They seemingly amount to but little, but people buy them every day” (Israel 1968:320). The historical record
reveals that a great variety of little necessities were commercially available on the Upper Texas Coast by the
mid nineteenth century. Those things not locally available were imported into Texas via the port of
Galveston. A testament to this appears in the following advertisement posted by a New York merchant in
1856, in the Galveston Weekly News:
COMBS, FANS, & FANCY GOODS
WILLIAM TASKER, 10 Park Place, New York, Invites the attention of Southern and Western
Merchants to his new stock of Fans, Combs, Hair, Tooth and Nail Brushes, Ladies’ Reticules,
Perfumery, Soaps . . . Jet and Bead Bracelets, Pocket Books, Dress Buttons, Pins and Needles, Hooks
and Eyes, Watch Guards, Wax, Coral and Glass Beads, Necklaces, &c. India Rubber Combs, Canes,
Balls and Toys of every description. Scissors, Razors and Cutlery, Gold and Gilt Jewelry, Accordeons
and Violins, including a general and very large stock of English, French, and German Fancy Goods,
which will be sold at the very lowest prices for Cash or Approved Paper [Weekly News, 5 February
1856a].

The advertisement imparts quite a bit of information. In a few short lines, it relates not only what types of
domestic products were available, but also many of the raw materials and general manufacturing locations.
What such an advertisement fails to reflect, however, is the appearance of the stated materials among an
actual domestic assemblage. It does not, for example, demonstrate the prevalence of certain everyday items,
or how wealth, ethnicity, life cycle, and geography influenced their popularity from household to household.
Probate inventories are one set of historical records that do provide an accounting of household possessions.
Unfortunately, they rarely provide detailed accounting of personal and recreational items. This owes to the
fact that probate inventories are inherently biased (see Benes and Benes 1989; Jones 1982; Main 1975). They
account for only a fraction of the total household goods, generally those deemed to have exceptional value.
Inventories usually account for only the property of male heads of households. They do not, as a rule, list
property belonging to the wife and children, since these items either were removed by heirs prior to the
appraisal or they were simply considered to be insignificant. Personal and recreational items are regularly
omitted from probate inventories, except in those rare instances when the estate is that of a woman.
Inherent biases are clearly evident in probate records of early Houston. Probate listings primarily focus on
metal and ceramic materials since such items were perceived to be the most valuable. Prior to the Civil War,
most estate inventories of decedent men from Harris County fully omit personal and recreational items.
Notable exceptions are the 1837 probate inventories of Addison Taylor and C. Kelley that mention “1 razor,
shaving strap, and box,” and “1 back gammon box,” respectively (Harris County Courthouse-Probate Records

163

[HCC-PR] 1837:A:27; volume and folio for Kelley missing). In marked contrast, the 1844 inventory of Mrs.
Sarah Howell sheds light on the variety of personal items in the possession of early Houstonians. The
inventory lists a silver thimble, eight finger rings, five breast pins, three studs, two clasps, nine additional
studs, one pair of gold spectacles, one pair of silver spectacles, and two gold chains with pencil and scissors
(HCC-PR 1844:F:357).
Given the inequitable structure of the historical record, a complete consideration of the everyday items of
early Houston is still wanting. Archeology often provides us with the best opportunity to evaluate the
popularity of many personal items in nineteenth-century households of the city. Personal and recreational
artifacts from archeological contexts provide us with tangible evidence of the common possessions taken for
granted by probate assessors. Individual specimens provide information on how such possessions varied in
size and shape. Moreover, the frequency of raw materials among certain artifact types provides clues as to
how fully they were integrated into the household assemblage. Relative frequencies of certain artifact classes
also inform us about how rapidly these goods were distributed after having been developed. Concurrently,
some of the items provide chronological information that assists the investigator in defining the archeological
context.
This chapter discusses clothing, personal items, and recreational artifacts recovered from feature and sheet
refuse deposits during the Ball Park project. It is subdivided into the following sections: (1) clothing and
footwear, (2) personal maintenance and grooming, (3) pocket accessories, and (4) recreation and other
activities. The discussion of clothing materials focuses largely on buttons and includes brief background
information, as well as the application of several techniques used to address artifact form and function at the
intersite and interfeature levels of analysis. The remaining sections include descriptions of selected artifacts
that, despite occurring in low frequencies across the Project Area, still possess functionally or temporally
diagnostic qualities. When appropriate, these materials are associated with comparable examples from other
historic-period sites in Texas, as well as with advertised products in late nineteenth-century catalogs. The
artifacts are discussed according to broad functional classes; general provenience information is provided for
cross-referencing purposes. Photographs and illustrations of selected specimens are also presented.
CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR
Buttons
In the early nineteenth century, large quantities of buttons and fasteners were imported to the United States
from Europe. By 1850, when the first information on nationwide button production became available, 59
button facilities were operating in the United States (Pool 1991:1). American button manufacturing escalated
rapidly thereafter, and by 1900, 238 facilities operated in the United States. During this time, numerous raw
materials were employed in button production. Pool (1987, 1991) has recently reviewed nineteenth-century
button types and their manufacture. This study closely follows the terminology and classifications of that
authoritative work.
Excavations yielded 174 buttons from 32 features. Individual specimens were manufactured from six basic
raw materials: bone, shell, porcelain (china), metal, glass, and rubber (Table 12.1). Figure 12.1 shows the
relative frequency of button materials across five sites within the Project Area (41HR812, 41HR815,
41HR816, 41HR818, and 41HR820). The relative distribution of button materials is remarkably consistent
from site to site. The one exception is 41HR815, and this can be easily attributed to the small sample size
(n=3). China buttons are generally the most common, followed in most cases by shell and then by metal.
Noteworthy is the extremely low frequency of bone, glass, and rubber buttons. Given that china buttons were
not introduced into America until the mid 1840s, the consistently high frequency of them in these pre-1870
archeological contexts reflects the rapid growth of their popularity and distribution.

164

Below is a brief discussion of the technologies and diagnostic attributes pertaining to each button material.
Specific excavated artifacts are examined when they possess temporally diagnostic elements, exceptional
decoration, or other uncommon features. Unless otherwise stated, counts given in parentheses refer to the

China (n=98)
China buttons (ca. 1845-1910), known as agates, or pearl agates, in the nineteenth century, were
manufactured by compressing porcelain powder into molds and then firing it. Englishman Richard Prosser
patented the process for manufacturing china buttons in 1840 (Pool 1991:7). By the mid 1800s, the china
button industry had taken root in England, France, and the United States. But France dominated the market
until the turn of the century. After World War I, various natural and synthetic plastic materials supplanted
porcelain in button production.
Subjected to misidentification in the past, china buttons are easily identified by the presence of pinprick-like
mold impressions on their backs (Storm 1976:118). Various china button forms exist, and several typological
schemes have been devised to classify them (e.g., Lamm et al. 1970; Pool 1987). These classifications are
often summarized in the voluminous contract literature available (e.g., Earls et al. 1996; Sauer et al. 1998),
and they will not be repeated here. Pool (1991) identifies 15 china button types, and these are the general
classifications employed herein (see Table 12.1).

165

While most china buttons are plain, at least four decorative techniques do occur on them with at least minimal
frequency. Some china buttons are simply painted in a solid color. Others are painted in solid colors around
the outer edge, a decoration commonly termed ‘ringer.’ Spatter or sponged designs, like those on ceramic
tablewares, are applied to the button face with a cut sponge dipped in paint (for an example, see Gross et al.
1993:Figure 39). Perhaps the most common decorative methods are transfer-printed designs across the button
face, referred to as calicos (Pool 1991). Calicos frequently take the form of hatching or tablecloth patterns.
Sutton and Arkush (1998:215) report that the manufacture of calicos in the United States was restricted to the
period 1848-1865.

Figure 12.1. Relative frequencies of button materials from five sites within the Project Area.

Ten of the 98 china buttons (10 percent) recovered during data recovery excavations are decorated. Six of
these are painted completely or just across the face in solid colors: blue (n=2), green (n=2), pink (n=1), and
mauve (n=1). Three china buttons possess the ringer design in brown, green, and combined pink and brown
bands. The mid nineteenth-century privy deposit designated as Feature 1065 yielded the only calico button
from the Project Area.
Shell and Pearl (n=33)
Buttons have been made from many different varieties of marine and freshwater shell over the last few
centuries. Commercial production of some shell button forms began in the early 1800s, and Americans
imported mother-of-pearl buttons from Europe until the mid nineteenth century (Pool 1991:6; Shepard
1981:83). Shell buttons were commonly used as “utilitarian fasteners for shirts, undergarments, and
children’s clothes” (Pool 1987:283). Late nineteenth-century catalogs identified various grades of ‘pearl’
buttons, but they rarely mention the term ‘shell’ (Israel 1968:319-320; Montgomery Ward and Company
[MWC] 1969:85).
While it is true that mother-of-pearl and other marine shells are generally more iridescent than freshwater
shell, distinguishing between the two materials is problematic for archeologists. This is because the “identity
of the shell frequently is lost once the button disk has been removed, since the inner layers of many different
[marine and freshwater] shells are nearly identical” (Luscomb 1997:177). The problems of identification and
classification are complicated by the fact that button manufacturers often sorted shell by color only, ignoring
the kind of shell or its origin. Therefore, all shell buttons, whether freshwater or marine, are considered as a
single classification for the purposes of this study. The only shell button to stand out among those recovered
is a four-hole example from Feature 1048A. This specimen possesses clear traces of brown paint.
Metal (n=22)
Nineteenth-century metal buttons were commonly manufactured from cast brass, pewter, whitemetal, or silver
(Olsen 1963:552). In 1807, Benjamin Sanders of Birmingham, England, patented a process for
manufacturing fabric-covered metal buttons (Pool 1991). In 1823, Sanders patented a three-part button that
consisted of a “domed face plate, back plate, and loop shank” (Pool 1987:277-279). The face plate often
included a stamped design; the black plate included a maker’s mark. The Gilded brass ‘Sander’s type’
buttons were common on military uniforms, including those from the Republic of Texas Army. These threepart metal buttons were later common accessories to civilian vests and overcoats.
Seven self-shank brass buttons with impressed marks were recovered from Feature 1048B (most are from Lot
144). Five of these are nearly identical, measuring 17.5 mm (28 line; see below for explanation) and reading:
I DUSBERG\IN AACHEN. Two of the specimens possess gilt residue, suggesting that all of the comparable
examples were probably gold plated. A sixth example bears the same mark but is only 12.5 mm (20 line).
The seventh button from Feature 1048B measures 11 mm (18 line) and is marked: NETT AND . . . FIELD’S
PATENT. Feature 7011 yielded one last marked metal button. It is cuprous metal with a loop shank
attachment that reads: IMPERIAL STANDARD. Information pertaining to the manufacturers or patent dates
for these three marks was not found.
Bone (n=13)
Bone was one of the cheapest and most common button materials, and a variety of bone buttons was
commercially produced in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The process involved cleaning and
softening a bone by boiling. After sawing the bone open and flattening it, the marrow was removed. Pool
(1991:5) relates how “blanks were cut and then spun on a lathe to thin the disk and apply the rim and
decorative rings.” Plain bone disks were often covered with fabric or attached to a metal loop shank to serve
as a button. Other bone disks served as the backs of brass or whitemetal buttons. Most commonly, bone
buttons had one to five holes for sew-through attachment. Bone buttons are largely non-diagnostic, although

167

Olsen (1963:Figure 1) states that five-holed bone buttons were common from 1750 to 1830. There is a dearth
of archeological evidence in support of this. For example, South’s (1964b:128) excavations at late
eighteenth-century sites yielded bone backs for metal buttons rather than the five-holed button types.
Among the small sample of bone buttons are three five-holed examples retrieved from Feature 1048B. Other
noteworthy examples from Feature 1048B are a four-hole bone button that was painted black, as well as a
spherical bone button that would have had a metal loop shank attachment. The loop shank specimen is the
only such button in the assemblage. Feature 5014 yielded a four-hole bone button bearing a distinctive mark
in the center from being spun on a lathe. Again, this is the only such example in the assemblage.
Glass (n=6)
Clear and colored glass buttons were produced from hand-blown and mold-blown techniques. Except for
innovations in attachment and design, these manufacturing methods went largely unchanged from the 1500s
until the 1800s (Pool 1991). In the nineteenth century, black glass buttons became popular as imitation jet, a
polished, dense black coal used in mourning jewelry during the Victorian era (Sauer et al. 1998:110; see also
Israel 1968:430; MWC 1969:84). Black buttons also imitated those popularized by Queen Victoria during her
mourning from 1861 to 1890 (National Button Society 1987:207). Pool (1991) reports how some small glass
buttons made in Czechoslovakia and Bohemia during the period 1840-1880 were termed ‘charmstring glass.’
These buttons were collected by young ladies, who received them as gifts from friends and relatives. After
collecting 1,000 buttons, a young lady was supposed to meet her Prince Charming.
Six features each yielded a single glass button. Features 5014 and 7024 yielded faceted black glass buttons.
The specimen from Feature 7024 possesses a loop shank, and presumably the example from Feature 5014 also
possessed one. Features 1048B, 7021, and 7036 also yielded examples of molded black glass buttons, and
only the specimen from Feature 1048B possesses any type of molded decoration. Feature 6002 yielded a 1-in
(2.54 cm) button, consisting of a hand-blown, red glass inset and a circular gilt brass casing. The method of
attachment is unknown, but it may have also been a loop shank.
Rubber (n=2)
Molded rubber buttons were popularized after Nelson Goodyear improved his father’s patent for vulcanized
rubber in 1851. These dark brown or black buttons, which emit a burnt tire odor when rubbed, were
manufactured in a variety of sizes. The earliest Goodyear buttons, which are generally quite rare, possess the
combination patent years 1849-1851 (Luscomb 1997:91). After 1851, the buttons were backmarked with an
abbreviation of the company name, Novelty Rubber Company (N. R. Co.), an abbreviation for patent (P.=T.),
and the date 1851 (Pool 1987:286). It is important to remember that 1851 does not indicate the manufacturing
date but rather the patent date.
Pool (1987:286) reports that because the Goodyear patent expired in 1870, buttons from the Novelty Rubber
Company made after that date will likely not possess patent dates. As such, all Goodyear buttons with the
inscription, ‘P.=T.,’ or the 1851 date are generally considered diagnostic of the period 1851-1870. In turn,
buttons backmarked with ‘Novelty Rubber Company’ but lacking the patent abbreviation or date are
diagnostic of the post-1870 period. Two rubber buttons encountered during data recovery excavations each
possess a molded Goodyear backmark that is diagnostic of the 1851-1870 period. Feature 6001 yielded a 15­
mm button (24 line) that reads: GOODYEAR’S N. R. Co. P.=T. The second rubber button measured 19 mm
(30 line) and was recovered from the stripped surface of 41HR816; it reads: GOODYEAR’S N. R. Co. P.=T.
1851.
Button Size and Function
Since the mid nineteenth century, button makers have categorized sizes of their merchandise according to the
‘Aline’ scale. Derived from the French term ligne, a line is a measurement representing 1/40 of an inch (0.64

168

mm) (Luscomb 1997:121). In other words, a 40-line button measures an inch in diameter (25.4 mm). Late
nineteenth-century catalogs, which list nearly all of their buttons in line measurements, even provide
conversion charts that explain the button scale to consumers (Israel 1968:319; MWC 1969:85). Table 12.2 is
an abridged conversion chart for English and metric measurements.

Among common button materials such as bone, shell, and porcelain, the button’s size is the best (and often
the only) indicator of its function. After reviewing Sears, Roebuck, and Company catalogs for the years
1897, 1902, and 1908, Sauer et al. (1998:106) were able to classify functional button sizes into three basic
classes. Small buttons, ranging from 10-16 lines, were commonly found on undergarments, shirts, and
trimmings. Medium-sized buttons, ranging from 18-30 lines, were common accessories on dresses, shirts, and
vests. Large buttons, considered to be greater than 30 lines, were used on coats and overcoats. With these
three categories in mind, the author plotted the frequency distribution of line sizes for the button assemblage
from the Project Area (Figure 12.2). Excluded were glass buttons, gaiters, and other button types that are not
normally measured in lines. This reduced the sample size from 174 to 158. The frequency distribution’s
central tendency for the entire Project Area is 18 line (0.45 in, or 11.4 mm). This is at the lower end of the
medium-sized button category, reflecting dresses, shirts, and vests. Large buttons are mostly nonexistent
throughout the Project Area.

The author also examined the frequency distribution of button size on each of the four blocks that yielded
adequate button samples (41HR812, 41HR816, 41HR818, and 41HR820). Histograms for each of these sites
largely imitate that for the entire Project Area (Figure 12.3), demonstrating that the distribution of button sizes
is fairly equitable across the Project Area. In each case, the central tendency of the size data approximates 18
lines. There are no examples of large buttons on two of the sites, and only a single example from each of the
other two sites. These frequency distributions closely resemble that for buttons from Sebastopol State
Historical Park in Seguin, Texas (Sauer et al. 1998). Investigators of that site aptly note that this “type of
distribution should be seen in any household, because undergarments and shirts had more buttons on them
than other articles of clothing. The lower numbers of coat and overcoat buttons likely reflect the warm climate
and the smaller numbers of buttons on these types of garments” (Sauer et al. 1998:107).

Data from the current project certainly support the above statement. The author would only add that
regardless of climate, there will be far fewer coats than shirts, dresses, and undergarments in any given
household.

Buttons as Economic Variables
In a study of clothing materials recovered during the Alamodome Project in San Antonio, Texas, Meissner
(1995b:161) suggests that historic-period button assemblages may reflect the relative economic positions of
site occupants. Using data gathered from an early twentieth-century catalog, she determines the theoretical
price for a single example of each button type found in her assemblage. A theoretical price is needed because
catalogs usually list button prices by the dozen or gross. In many cases, a gross of buttons would sell for only
a few pennies, making any individual button worth merely a small fraction of a cent. This fraction of a cent is
the theoretical price.
Meissner (1995b:161) uses the frequency distribution of button types at a site to estimate the mean price of
buttons in the assemblage. The formula operates under the assumption that button types and prices listed in
the catalog are applicable to buttons in an archeological context. This includes both temporal and
geographical continuity in prices. The theoretical price for each button type is multiplied by the number of
complete specimens in that type. An “average button price” is calculated by summing the subtotals and then
dividing the sum by the sample size (Meissner 1995b:161). This calculation is used to rank the respective
sites according to economic status. The following equation summarizes the method by calculating the mean
button price, Y, as follows:
Y = ∑ (yi)(f)
n
Where
yi = theoretical price for a given button type
f = number of complete buttons in each type
n = total number of buttons in the sample
Using the button assemblage from the project, the author examined this method on the interfeature level of
analysis. The price data of all the button types were adjusted to better fit the earlier chronological period
under investigation and the different button types present in the assemblage. Table 12.3 lists these late
nineteenth-century catalog prices and the theoretical prices for the respective button types. Of the 32 feature
deposits yielding buttons, six (Features 1048B, 5014, 5017, 6001, 6002, and 7021) yielded samples greater
than 10. Using the method outlined above, a mean button price was calculated for each sample of buttons
from the six features and the results were compared.
As illustrated in Figure 12.4, the data suggest that Features 5017 and 7021, on average, possess the most
expensive button materials and types. The mean prices for these features were equal ($0.004). On the other
hand, Feature 1048B possesses the least expensive button assemblage; it yielded a mean price of $0.0019.
The other three features fall in between these two extremes. Noteworthy is the fact that the three largest
values are products of the features with the three smallest sample sizes (n=11). Conversely, the feature with
the largest sample of buttons (n=36) yields the smallest mean price. Thus sample size may have directly
influenced the interfeature results. Other factors, including differential rates of preservation and site
formation processes, also could have biased the results of this analysis. Independent testing will be required
to confirm the validity of using buttons as an economic variable. Nevertheless, the analysis demonstrates one
way of quantifying button types and button materials. Given a substantial sample size, a more fruitful
approach to quantifying archeological button data may be the application of diversity measures, such as the
Shannon-Weaver index (e.g., Krebs 1972:506-508; Rothschild and Rockman 1982).

Project Area.

Miscellaneous Fasteners and Eyelets
Fastener hardware occurs in low frequency across the Project Area, with five different features each yielding
only a single specimen. Features 7008 and 7009 yielded slide buckles, which were common accessories to
nineteenth-century ladies’ belts or garter-hook loops (MWC 1969:98-99; Sauer et al. 1998:Figure 98c). The
buckle from Feature 7008 is cuprous with an embossed pattern of circles around the perimeter. The specimen
from Feature 7009 is ferrous, but it possesses a similar embossed pattern. Both of these buckles were likely
plated with silver or gold, as indicated in late nineteenth-century catalogs (Israel 1968:432; MWC 1969:99).
In addition to the slide buckles, a cuprous buckle (perhaps brass) from pants or a vest was recovered from
Feature 7026.
172

Suspender hardware was recovered from Features 6001 and 7003. The ferrous specimen from Feature 6001
closely resembles suspender hardware from the Eagle Island Plantation in Brazoria County (Gross et al.
1993:Figure 6D). The cuprous suspender loop from Feature 7003 is similar to those recovered from Fanthorp
Inn (Ing and Hart 1987:Plate 4A).
Several small cuprous eyelets for lacing shoes and articles of clothing were also recovered during excavations.
Eyelets, developed in 1828 specifically for women’s corsets (Finch 1991:343), were placed around lacing
holes in the textile. By the end of the nineteenth century, a punching tool was available that would set eyelets
into cloth or leather (Israel 1968:208). Among specific proveniences, Feature 6001 yielded five identical
eyelets measuring 0.125 in (3.2 mm). Feature 7024 yielded two 0.25-in (6.4 mm) eyelets, while Feature 5017
yielded another 0.25 in (6.4 mm) eyelet. A larger 0.5-in (127 mm) clothing eye was recovered from Feature
5009.
Beads
Data-recovery excavations yielded five beads from four features (1048B, 5014, 7019, and 7021). These
specimens represent four different methods of bead manufacture, with only two beads in this small sample
being technologically alike. The presence of these different bead forms warrants at least a brief discussion of
the method of manufacture for each.
Drawn
Lardner (1972:182-183 [1832]) details the process of making drawn glass beads. In short, glass is blown into
a tube, and a bead is cracked off the end. This results in air impressions that run parallel to the hole. The
bead edges are occasionally rounded or polished. Several drawn bead variations exist, and each has a separate
term. Donut-shaped drawn beads, the smallest bead type, are known as seed beads. Seed beads with
diameters less than 0.1 in (3 mm) are generally termed embroidery beads, while those with diameters from
0.1-0.2 in (3 to 5 mm) are referred to as pony beads (Sprague 1985:91). Drawn beads cracked off in longer
lengths are known simply as tubular beads. Feature 5014 yielded a single translucent white pony bead.
Wound
Wound beads are formed by pouring molten glass, or winding a softened cane of glass, around a clay-slipped
wire or reed. This results in striations and possibly air bubbles around the bead that are perpendicular to the
hole. The wire or reed was slipped, so a chalky residue may remain in the hole after the bead forms. Feature
7019 yielded a good example of a wound glass bead. Blue in color, this bead measures 0.3 in (8 mm) across
and is covered in striations and chalky residue. Feature 1048B also yielded a wound ovoid bead made of
black glass.
Molded
Beads of glass or other materials formed in a mold through any number of manufacturing techniques may
be considered molded. However, mold seams may or may not be present on the bead, depending on the
precise method of production. Sauer et al. (1998:123) claim that “faceted beads that are very uniform,
round beads that are perfectly spherical, and other symmetrical beads can usually be called molded.” One
molded black faceted bead was recovered from Feature 7021. Its material is either rubber or some other
unidentified organic plastic material.
Blown
These beads were produced in a two-step process: (1) heating a tube of glass to produce bubbles, and (2)
breaking the tube between the bubbles to make beads. Blown beads are hollow with characteristically thin
walls. As such, their recovery from archeological sites is rare due to their high frequency of breakage.
Feature 1048B yielded one spherical blown white glass bead with extremely thin walls.

Leather Footwear
Prior to 1840, most footwear in the United States was hand sewn (Anderson 1968:58). During the 1840s,
automatic pegging technology was adopted, resulting from at least three technological innovations. First, a
machine that produced wooden pegs was invented around 1811. Second, a hand-operated pegging machine
was introduced in 1829. Third, shoe-piece patterns and counters were developed in the 1830s (Anderson
1968:58). The invention of the sewing machine in 1846 made shoe production even more efficient. The first
true machine for shoe manufacturing, the Davey Pegging Machine, was created in 1854. It placed wooden
pegs in boots and shoes.
In 1860, a machine for sewing soles to uppers was introduced, and Colonel Gordon McKay improved this
apparatus in 1862 (Anderson 1968). McKay’s improved machine stitched both the shoe toe and heel for the
first time. The McKay machine became popular shortly thereafter and quickly replaced the earlier pegging
machines. About the same time, a second innovation revolutionized footwear. Prior to the Civil War, shoe
insteps were not shaped, and no distinction was made between right and left shoes (Anderson 1968). During
the war, however, so-called ‘crooked’ shoes with formed insteps were developed. These were, essentially, the
first right and left shoes.
Excavations yielded a total of 201 leather pieces, most of which were so small as to not yield any definitive
identification. Leather footwear predominates among identifiable specimens, and most of the indeterminate
specimens presumably derive from that same class of materials. Four features yielded a large majority (78
percent) of the leather material. Feature 6001 yielded 70 pieces, while Feature 5014 yielded 39 pieces.
Features 1025 and 7026 yielded 25 and 21 leather pieces, respectively. Among the examples from Feature
6001 were at least five ladies’ heels, a man’s heel, and an indeterminate heel with a ferrous heel plate
attached. All of these heel examples were nailed, and in most cases, the machine-cut cobbler’s nails were still
in place. One of the ladies’ heels also included a double-stitched shoe welt. Notable among the footwear
from Feature 5014 were at least two examples of ladies’ heels (nailed) and one example of a child’s shoe welt
with a nailed heel.
Heel Plates
Crescent-shaped metal heel plates were attached to leather or rubber soles by nailing heel nails through holes
in the plate. The 1897 Sears Catalog, which advertised heel plates for $0.02 per pair, stated that such plates
helped “prevent boots and shoes from wearing off at the heels” (Israel 1968:208). Heel plates were common
accessories to the cobbler’s equipment and were sold in children’s, ladies,’ boys’, and men’s sizes.
Data recovery excavations yielded six complete heel-plate specimens manufactured from brass and iron.
Feature 6001 yielded a set of matching brass plates from Level 4 and a set of presumably matching iron plates
from Level 5 (Figure 12.5). The maximum width for each of the two brass plates was 1.9 in (4.8 cm). They
each possess nine large and three small nail holes, and the irregular placement and shape of these holes on one
of the plates suggests handmade manufacture. The iron plates from Feature 6001 are in a more advanced state
of deterioration. Nevertheless, the maximum width of each measures 1.75 in (4.4 cm).
In addition to these matched sets, Feature 7001 yielded a single iron heel plate and Feature 5014 yielded a
single brass plate resembling the examples from Feature 6001. The iron plate measures 1.9 in (4.8 cm), and
the brass plate measures 1.75 in (4.4 cm) at their maximum widths. The brass heel plate also possesses 12
irregularly spaced nail holes, although all of these are small and similar in size. Of interest is a mark
impressed on the back of the plate that reads: AT. NOV. 29_856. Close examination of the brass heel plates
from Feature 6001 revealed an identical impressed mark on the back of one of these that reads: AT. NOV. 2_
18__.

174

The marks seemingly represent a patent date of November 29, 1856, for the heel plates. It is probably no
coincidence that the heel-plate examples consistently measure between 1.75 and 1.9 in (4.4-4.8 cm). These
measurements may represent two of the four standard sizes for heel plates as advertised in nineteenth-century
catalogs (e.g., Israel 1968:208), perhaps men’s and ladies’ varieties.

Figure 12.5. Matching brass heel plates recovered from Feature 6001.

PERSONAL MAINTENANCE AND GROOMING
Toothbrushes
Nineteenth-century toothbrush handles were generally made of bone or wood. Many commercially produced
toothbrushes included bristles apparently imported from France (Israel 1968:328). Although celluloid largely
supplanted wood and bone in toothbrush handles by the first part of this century, the 1923 Sears Catalog still
advertised an “Old Style” toothbrush with a “heavy bone handle” (Schroeder 1973:487).
Three bone toothbrush handles were recovered during excavations (Figure 12.6). Feature 1063 yielded a
bone handle fragment with a finely carved geometric pattern. The 0.5-in (1.3 cm) wide handle is relatively
flat, with its thickness tapering slightly toward the rounded end. The decorative pattern, which appears on
both sides of the handle, consists of two parallel lines running the handle’s length, with three sets of eight or
nine perpendicular lines running in between. Two carved concentric circles are evident near the narrowing of
the bristle head.

Figure 12.6. Carved bone toothbrush handle recovered from Feature
1063.

175

A second carved bone handle fragment was encountered in the sheet refuse deposit on 41HR818. This handle
is also 0.5 in (1.3 cm) wide, although in this case, the thickness is consistent, not tapering. Decoration on
both sides includes two carved parallel lines running the length of the handle. A hole carved through the
upper end allowed the toothbrush to be hung.
Feature 7005 yielded a bone handle that lacks decoration. The handle is heavier and slightly wider than the
two carved examples, tapering from 0.75 in (1.9 cm) at its rounded end to approximately 0.6 in (1.6 cm).
Combs and Hairpins
Rubber combs became fashionable in the United States after the original Goodyear patent for vulcanized
rubber was improved in 1851. The principal supplier of rubber goods to Texas in the 1850s was the Union
India Rubber Company of New York, and an 1856 issue of the Galveston Weekly News advertised “India
Rubber Combs” (Weekly News 1856a). The durability of hard rubber combs made them preferable to other
materials that were more likely to break. As depicted by the leading catalogs of the late nineteenth century
(e.g., Israel 1968:326; MWC 1969:105-106), various styles of fine- and coarse-tooth rubber combs were
available to consumers by that time. The catalogs proclaimed many of these comb styles to be “unbreakable”
(MWC 1969:106). Four rubber comb fragments are among the artifact assemblage from the Project Area.
Feature 1049 yielded the most complete specimen, a 6.75-in (17.2 cm) long comb with both fine and coarse
teeth. Feature 7001 also yielded one end of a fine tooth rubber comb. A single coarse tooth from a comb was
recovered from each of Features 5017 and 7014.
In addition to the rubber combs, a ladies’ crimped hairpin was recovered from Feature 7031. The hairpin is
ferrous, and such hairpins were commonly sold in bundles of 40 or more by the end of the nineteenth century
(MWC 1969:87).
Straight Razor
Straight razors for shaving are simple two-part constructions consisting of a blade and handle riveted together.
Late nineteenth-century straight razors possessed iron or steel blades ranging in width from 0.5-0.8 in (1.3 to
2.2 cm), although 0.6 in (1.5 cm) was by far the most common width. Standard razor length from rivet to
point was roughly 3.5 in (8.9 cm). While catalogs toward the end of the century advertised razor handles
made of pearl, ivory, rubber, and celluloid (Israel 1968:111-112; MWC 1969:444-445), bone and wood were
presumably also common handle materials in the early to mid 1800s. In fact, at least two of the advertised
celluloid handles were manufactured as “imitation bamboo” (MWC 1969:444-445).
Feature 5014 yielded three fragments of a straight razor that fit well with those described in late nineteenthcentury catalogs. The blade length, from rivet to point, is 3.2 in (8.3 cm), and its width is 0.5 in (1.3 cm). No
remains of the handle material were recovered.
POCKET ACCESSORIES
Pocket Cutlery
Mid nineteenth-century pocket knives were simple utilitarian tools used by many people. Knives advertised
in the 1865 hardware catalog of the Russell and Erwin Manufacturing Company have from one to six folding
blades of various sizes (Russell and Erwin 1980:359-366 [1865]). They lack the gadgets and nonessential
tools that were becoming popular by the end of the nineteenth century and have remained so today (see, for
example, MWC 1969:443). Late nineteenth-century catalogs depict pocketknife styles for men, ladies, and
boys (Israel 1968:109-110; MWC 1969:440-442).
The physical elements of pocket cutlery are the handle, metal bolsters, shield, and blades. Handles in the mid
1800s were manufactured from many of the same materials from which table cutlery handles were made
(Russell and Erwin 1980:359-363 [1865]). The bolsters were generally of silver, brass, or iron, and the blades

176

were of iron or brass. The shield was a small, thin plate of silver, pearl, or other material attached to the side
of the handle. The shield, or shields, was occasionally engraved with the name of the manufacturer or the
owner. The quality of each physical element obviously influenced the price of pocket cutlery. A comparison
of comparably designed knives in nineteenth-century catalogs allows the relative value of the handle material
to be isolated.
Table 12.4 lists price data for sets of cutlery in 1865 and 1897. The data demonstrate how buffalo horn went
from being one of the cheapest handle materials to the most expensive over the last half of the nineteenth
century. This probably reflects the ever dwindling availability of the material as the American bison
population declined. Pearl handles are notably expensive in both listings, a notion supported by the
conspicuous lack of that material among advertised boys’ knives.

Three features yielded five pocket knives during the data recovery excavations (Figure 12.7). The knives are
well preserved with the exception of the iron blades, which partially survive on only those from Features 7009
and 7014. As shown in Table 12.5, the knives exhibit a range of sizes, handle materials, and metals. Each of
the knives is nearly identical to those described and illustrated in the 1865 Russell and Erwin catalog
(1980:359-367 [1865]). However, none of the metal shields or bolsters features manufacturer’s marks or any
other designation illustrated in the catalog. In this small sample, brass is the most common metal for bolsters,
linings, and shields. Among the three knives recovered from Feature 5014, the Jacob de Cordova privy
deposit (ca. 1835-1862) is a notable status indicator. This is a four-bladed knife with a mother-of-pearl
handle and silver bolsters. If the catalog prices listed in Table 12.4 are any indication, the combined use of
these materials suggests that it was among the most expensive pocket knives available in the mid nineteenth
century.
Fan Blade
Feature 7021 yielded a small blade fragment of a ladies’ hand-held fan. The thin fan blade was manufactured
from bone and includes a pierced design. Comparable examples of ladies’ fan blades have been recovered
from Ashton Villa House Museum in Galveston and Sebastopol State Historical Park in Seguin, Texas
(Anderson 1985:Figure 40; Sauer et al. 1998:129). The Ashton Villa example is ivory, while the Sebastopol
example is bone.

177

Eyewear Lens
Feature 7021 yielded a spectacle or eyeglass lens. Nineteenth-century eyewear manufacturers distinguished
between spectacles and eye glasses, and catalogs of the era clearly demonstrates this (e.g., Israel 1968:462­
463; MWC 1969:203). Spectacles included bows, which are the curved sidepieces of the frame that pass over
the ear like modern eyewear. Eye glasses lacked such bows and, instead, pinched the nose with a cork or
rubber nose piece. Frames were manufactured from various metals, plated metals, and rubber (Bloomingdale
Brothers [BB]1988:131; Israel 1968:462-463; Russell and Erwin 1980:346 [1865]). Frame and lens shape did
not always vary between the two types of eyewear, making it difficult to discern whether the lens belonged to
one or the other.

RECREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
Marbles
Use of marbles is very ancient. Small clay and stone gaming spheres were made by the Greeks and Romans
(Opie and Opie 1997:17-19; Randall 1971), and they have been recovered from pre-Columbian sites in North
America (Webb 1994). England and Holland initiated commercial production of marbles in the seventeenth
century. By the late eighteenth century, however, Germany had emerged as the “almost exclusive producer of

178

marbles for commercial export” (Randall 1971). Germany remained the leading center for marble
manufacturing until the turn of the nineteenth century, when production began in the United States.
Stone, glass, and ceramic marbles used in numerous outdoor and indoor games were very popular among
“Young America” in the nineteenth century (The Manufacturer and Builder [MB] 1870:39). While boys are
usually associated with marbles, parlor games such as ‘nine holes,’ ‘hit and span,’ and ‘ring taw’ were
actually favored by young men more than by children in the nineteenth century (Opie and Opie 1997:31-32;
Walker 1975). Rowdy young men would frequently gamble on marble games to the dissatisfaction of
nineteenth-century clergymen in England (Opie and Opie 1997:32-33). Also overlooked is the fact that girls
have played marble-related games for centuries (e.g., Opie and Opie 1997:59, 62).
In recent years, great strides have been made in the study of marbles as historic artifacts (e.g., Carskadden and
Gartley1990a, 1990b; Carskadden et al. 1985; Randall 1971, 1979). Once thought to contain little more than
aesthetic value for collectors, these seemingly trivial articles are now known to possess some degree of
chronological and economic information (Carskadden and Gartley 1990a, 1990b). For example, Carskadden
and Gartley (1990b:15) observe that the “value collectors now place on certain types of marbles does not
necessarily (and in fact does not usually) reflect the relative worth of the marble in the nineteenth century.
Prices in the toy ads over a period of years are also useful in that they can reflect the decline in the popularity
of certain marble types.” Advances in our understanding of marble production, distribution, and use warrant a
brief review of the three primary raw materials and the diagnostic attributes of specific marble types.
Stone
Marbles fashioned from various grades of calcareous stone were produced in Germany during the 1740s and
again during the period 1850-1880 (Carskadden et al. 1985:91). A trade magazine of 1870 details the
production techniques for these limestone marbles in Saxony, Germany (MB 1870:39). In the second half of
the nineteenth century, agate marbles were manufactured from the refuse of agate mills and quarries in
Oberstein, Germany (MB 1870:39). Production of these colorful and expensive stone marbles peaked in the
1880s. Alabaster was at least one other stone material used in marble production, but its use was largely
restricted to the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Opie and Opie 1997:48).
Glass
While handmade glass marbles may have originated as early as the fifteenth century, commercial production
began in Germany in 1846 (Carskadden and Gartley 1990b:8; Randall 1971). By the late 1800s, factories in
England and the United States, including the Iowa City Flint Glass Company, initiated production of these
largely transparent marbles (Randall 1971). Many of these glass marbles included colored ribbons, or
‘swirls,’ between the cut-off marks. Machine-made glass marbles, which predominate today, were developed
in 1901 and were produced in earnest after 1905 (Carskadden et al 1985; Randall 1971). These largely
opaque marbles lacked the distinctive pontil marks that characterized earlier hand-made varieties (Block
1996).
Ceramic
Ceramic marbles encompassed the same variety of raw materials and manufacturing techniques that
characterized ceramic tablewares. Coarse earthenware spheres, known popularly as clays or ‘commies,’ were
the cheapest type of ceramic marble (Table 12.6). They could be made at home by simply baking small balls
of clay in an oven (Carskadden et al. 1985). Commercial production of molded clay marbles began as early
as the 1820s in Ohio, and several factories were producing them by the 1880s (Carskadden et al. 1985).
Slipped or painted clay marbles remained popular through the 1930s. In fact, the 1923 Sears Catalog
advertised bags of 150 colored clay marbles for $0.15 (Schroeder 1973:496).

179

Stoneware, or crockery, marbles were produced in Germany during the second half of the nineteenth century
(ca. 1850-1910) and exported largely for the American market. The most popular types, known as
Benningtons, contained cobalt blue or brown manganese glazes with pock marks from where they rested
against one another during the firing process. Manufactured as imitation agates, Benningtons were most
popular during the 1880s and 1890s (Carskadden and Gartley 1990a). The name ‘Bennington’ derives from
the Norton and Fenton Pottery Company in Bennington, Vermont, which produced tableware with similar
glazes (Carskadden and Gartley 1990a). However, no evidence exists to suggest that marbles were ever
commercially produced there, making Bennington a misnomer that continues to generate misleading
information in some archeological reports (e.g., Sauer et al. 1998:141).

Porcelain, or china, is the predominant ceramic marble material on American archeological sites. In fact,
Carskadden and Gartley (1990a) report that 80-95 percent of all recovered marbles from sites are chinas. Like
stoneware marbles, chinas were manufactured almost exclusively in Germany during the period 1830-1905
(Carskadden and Gartley 1990b:4; Opie and Opie 1997:49). Some indirect evidence exists to suggest that
china marbles were manufactured for a brief period in Indiana (Carskadden and Gartley 1990b:10). However,
even if these were truly china marbles, they were probably not widely distributed beyond the Ohio Valley.
China marble production involved firing kaolin or feldspar clay at high temperatures, frequently adding
painted decorations and/or glaze, and then refiring. Oil-based enamels were used to paint a variety of
geometric, floral, or scenic motifs in several different colors. Early china marbles (ca. 1846-1870) were
largely unglazed, while the majority of late chinas (ca. 1890-1910) were glazed (Carskadden and Gartley
1990b:17-18). A thorough comparative study by Carskadden and Gartley (1990a, 1990b) has resulted in a
typology and preliminary seriation of china marbles based upon the frequency of certain decorations in
securely dated contexts. That study provides the framework for classifying the marbles recovered during the
current project.
Marble Assemblage
Seven features yielded 29 marbles during data recovery excavations (Figure 12.8; Table 12.7). A twentiethcentury machine-made glass marble was also recovered from 41HR819 but lacks secure provenience. Among
the nineteenth-century assemblage, 90 percent were unglazed ceramic (n=26), while the remaining 10 percent
were glass (n=3). The ceramic marbles display a dichotomy in size: small marbles, varying from 0.6-0.8 in
(15-20 mm) diameter; and large marbles, varying from 1.2-1.4 in (30-35 mm) in diameter. The three glass
marbles do not fit neatly into these two size grades since they range between 0.7-1.0 in (18-25 mm) in
diameter. Most notable is the collection of 17 marbles from Feature 5014, the privy deposit of the Jacob de

180

Cordova family. The marble collection from this feature is securely provenienced, having been recovered
from arbitrary Levels 6 and 7 only.
Three handmade glass marbles with characteristic ribbon swirls are among the assemblage from Feature 5014.
The ribbons take various color combinations B among them red, white, green, and purple. One possesses a
pontil mark that imitates those found on many glass bottles of the mid nineteenth century.

Three coarse earthenware commies are also among the marbles recovered from Feature 5014. These lowfired gray pieces are 0.6-0.7 in (15-17 mm) in diameter. A brown Bennington marble is also among those
collected from Feature 5014. The presence of the Bennington in this feature is an anomaly, given that the
data compiled by Carskadden and Gartley (1990a, 1990b) indicate that Benningtons were most popular in the
1880s and 1890s. Perhaps the production and distribution of Bennington marbles are earlier than is currently
acknowledged.
The remaining 10 specimens from Feature 5014 may be classified as china marbles. According to the
classification system developed by Carskadden and Gartley (1990a, 1990b), five types are represented among
these 10 specimens (see Table 12.7). Undecorated examples account for three small marbles in the collection.
Among decorated marbles, the feature yielded large-size examples of two of the most chronologically
sensitive types, the ‘Daisy Wheel’ and ‘Type 1 Flower.’ The Daisy Wheel example possesses a brown 10­
leaf wheel with one wide band and four narrow concentric bands. Both the daisy-wheel design and the widenarrow band combination are decorative attributes diagnostic of the period 1850-1875. The large Type 1
Flower example is identified by its diametrically opposed flower motifs in dark green. One wide and two
narrow concentric bands accompany the flower designs and again suggest the period 1850-1875.
Feature 5014 yielded very small samples of two other decorative types that date to the period 1850-1910:
‘Leaves-Wreath’ and ‘Intersecting Parallel Lines.’ One large and one small example of the Leaves-Wreath
type, commonly identified as ‘Crow’s Feet,’ were recovered. The large example possesses green, teardropshaped leaves accompanied by four brown bands of intersecting parallel lines. The small example exhibits
brown leaves with three parallel concentric bands of green. The three examples of the Intersecting Parallel
Lines type, all of which are small, possess only the lines and no other decorative motif. Two examples
exhibit two bands of intersecting lines, while the third exhibits three bands. The colors of the bands are faint
and difficult to distinguish, although traces of brown and green are present.
Three other features (1048B, 7009, and 7021) yielded small examples of the Intersecting Parallel Lines type.
Feature 7009 also yielded a small ‘Bull’s Eye Type 2’ specimen, which is generally indicative of the 1850­
1875 period (Carskadden and Gartley 1990a:63). The marble possesses six unevenly spaced bull’s eyes in
green, black, red, and reddish brown. There were at least four variations on the bull’s eye motif. The six
wide central rings are each surrounded by a narrow ring, and this represents the variation identified as Type 2.
China Dolls
Nineteenth-century dolls were manufactured from a variety of materials, including fabric, leather, rubber,
wood, wax, and paper maché. Unfortunately, many of these materials are not likely to survive in the
archeological record, leaving ceramic doll parts over-represented in historic sites. Ceramic doll parts were
manufactured as early as 1750 (Shepard 1981:94) and became increasingly popular in the nineteenth century.
The terminology for ceramic dolls and doll parts varies widely among collectors and archeologists. In
general, unglazed ceramic doll parts are termed ‘bisque’ (e.g., White 1966:264), and glazed ceramic is
referred to as ‘china’ or ‘porcelain.’ Among doll types, there are three principal categories: china limb, frozen
charlotte, and jointed. China-limb dolls have a fabric body, with a ceramic head, arms, and legs. The
extremity parts include holes or grooves for string or wire attachments to the fabric. The ceramic head
usually includes the shoulder. Heads without the shoulders (i.e., socket heads) could be turned. China limb
dolls were a cheap compromise between rag dolls and completely ceramic dolls.
Frozen Charlottes, popular from the mid nineteenth century until the 1930s, were completely ceramic female
dolls without moving joints and usually less than 4 in (10.2 cm) tall. The name purportedly derives from a
New England ballad that recounts how a “young lady was frozen stiff after going for a sleigh ride in her
evening gown without a wrap” (White 1966:103). The dolls were either solid or hollow, and many possessed

182

gilt detailing. Male counterparts were termed Frozen Charlies, an African-American example of which was
recently recovered from the Sebastopol site (Sauer et al. 1998:Figure 119).
Securely dating ceramic dolls from morphology alone has been problematic for archeologists. However,
studies of nineteenth-century ceramic doll parts have identified several broadly diagnostic features that may
be useful. For example, the two-piece doll molds employed before the Civil War were largely supplanted by
one-piece molds during the 1860s (Shepard 1981). The existence of mold seams on the doll part is
presumably indicative of antebellum-era manufacture. Limb proportions seemingly also hold some
chronological value. Prior to 1870, limb proportions were natural (Shepard 1981:96). During the period
1870-1900, enlarged forearms and calves were manufactured on doll limbs to exaggerate small hands and feet
and, thus, match the prevailing notions of feminine beauty at the time. Hairstyles are also rough dating tools.
White (1966:51-53) has traced the evolution of hairstyles on dolls from the late seventeenth to nineteenth
centuries with some success. However, Meissner (1995a:60) aptly observes that such a dating strategy does
not account for the time after which a style became fashionable.
Six features and a sheet refuse deposit at 41HR818 each yielded a single china doll specimen (Figure 12.9).
The earliest examples may date to the antebellum period. For example, a flat-soled china doll foot from
Feature 7016 may date to this period as flat-soled feet became unpopular after the Civil War (Pritchett and
Pastron 1983:328). Feature 1049 yielded a Frozen Charlotte doll that is complete except for its broken legs.
The doll, which has traces of gilt on its hair, stands less than 4 in (10.2 cm), classifying it as a 10-cent doll.
Seams running down the shoulders and legs of the doll are indicative of two-piece molds, suggesting an
antebellum date for its manufacture (Shepard 1981). A bisque head-and-shoulder piece of a china limb doll
from Feature 7025 has a distinctly antebellum hairstyle (White 1966:22, 103). Paint residue indicates dark
hair, dark eyes, and a red complexion. However, the lack of mold seams suggests a one-piece mold
manufacture that was not popularized until the 1860s.

Figure 12.9. Examples of ceramic dolls recovered from the Project Area.

Four other china doll specimens do not possess diagnostic attributes, largely as a result of their fragmentary
nature. Feature 7024 yielded a 1-in (2.5 cm) Frozen Charlotte, otherwise termed a ‘penny doll’ (or ‘penny
baby’). It exhibits black hair, a rosy complexion, and bright red lips. Feature 7020 yielded a fragment of a
china limb doll leg with a string groove at the knee, which made its attachment to the cloth body possible. A

183

shoulder fragment of another china limb doll was recovered from Feature 6002. Despite its fragmented state,
attachment holes near the shoulder betray the style of china doll. Lastly, a fragment of a probable china limb
doll was encountered among the sheet refuse at 41HR818.
Toy Tea Sets
Miniature sets of ceramic and tin tableware were a popular diversion for girls in the nineteenth century, as
they are today. Common tin sets were Britannia tea wares or basic kitchen wares including as many as 42
pieces. Common ceramic sets, made of porcelain, whiteware, or stone china, were tea and toilet wares with
up to 24 pieces. Both tin and ceramic pieces were manufactured in various sizes by the late nineteenth
century; based upon catalog advertisements (e.g., MWC 1969:231), the size of the set was related to the age
of the girl using them. That is, smaller sets were intended for younger girls. This is demonstrated in the
following excerpt from the 1895 Montgomery Ward Catalog:
White Stone China Tea Set of 24 pieces, as follows: 6 plates, 6 cups, 6 saucers, 1 sugar bowl and
cover, 1 tea pot and cover, 1 creamer, 1 slop bowl. This set is large enough for a miss from 8 to 14
years of age. . . . The pieces in this set are larger than usually sold in toy sets; the cups stand 2 inches
high, and the plates measure 4 2 inches across [MWC 1969:231].

Whether tin or ceramic, these miniature tea sets were often decorated in imitation of popular adult versions.
Data recovery excavations yielded seven fragments of ceramic toy tea-set pieces comprising a minimum of
three teacups and two saucers (Figure 12.10). All of the pieces are either porcelain or semi-vitrified
whiteware (e.g., stone china). Significant is the fact that teacup fragments from Features 7019 and 7021
cross-mend, calling into question the integrity of these two features. This teacup includes floral and
geometric relief decoration. Sheet refuse from 41HR812 yielded an undecorated basal fragment from a
second teacup, and Feature 7031 yielded a similar basal portion of the third teacup. Among saucer specimens
was a relief-decorated sherd from Feature 7031 and a similar relief-decorated sherd from the sheet refuse at
41HR818. The vessel form for the remaining toy tea-set specimen is indeterminate.

Tobacco Pipes
White Clay Pipes
Clay tobacco pipes took two general forms in nineteenth-century America: one-piece bowl and stem and stubstemmed. One-piece white clay pipes were cheap and common commodities in the United States from early
Colonial times until the early 1900s. England traditionally manufactured and exported these pipes, with
counties such as Devon and Dorset representing the leading centers of production (Earls et al. 1996:260;
Scientific American 1869). Production of similar white clay pipes began in the United States in the 1820s,
although English imports continued to dominate the American market throughout the nineteenth century
(Earls et al. 1996).
An 1869 article in Scientific American details the method of kaolin pipe manufacture in England during the
1800s. In short, a ball of clay is rolled by hand to the proper size and then placed between iron molds. A
piece of wire the same size of the bore is placed between the molds, and a tool compresses the bulb area to
form a bowl. After being pressed in the mold, the pipes are air dried and then smoothed to remove the mold
impressions. The pipes are polished with hard wood and later fired in a brick oven. Overall, the process was
quite inexpensive, and in 1881, a gross (144) of one-piece pipes sold for $0.50 to $1.20 (Earls et al. 1996).
Plain one-piece pipes of the Colonial period gave way to more stylized pipes in the late eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries (see Noël Hume 1969:303). Nevertheless, most white clay pipes remained unglazed,
although glazed kaolin pipes did exist. One-piece pipes often included stamped makers’ marks, which are
very useful in providing diagnostic information (Noël Hume 1969:304-305; Shepard 1981:87).
Six features in the Project Area (7003, 7005, 7009, 7021, 7025, and 7045), all deriving from 41HR820,
yielded nine white clay pipe fragments (Figure 12.11). All were unglazed and unmarked. One very small
bowl fragment possesses a simple vertical ribbing pattern on its exterior, formed during the molding process.
A pipe-stem fragment broken near its bowl also exhibits striations that would have likely developed into this
type of ribbing pattern. Local comparative examples of rib-decorated white clay pipes were recovered from
the townsite of Old Velasco (Earls et al. 1996:260).

Figure 12.11. Examples of the remains of clay tobacco pipes recovered
from the Project Area.

Pipes were purchased, used, and discarded within a relatively short amount of time. As such, often they
contain valuable chronological information. Aside from manufacturers’ marks, kaolin pipe stems appear to
provide reliable dates for early historic-period sites (ca. 1650-1800), since their stem-bore diameters became
185

increasingly smaller over time (Binford 1961; Harrington 1954). The dating of kaolin pipe stems is unreliable
after about 1800, at which time the gradual decline in pipe-stem diameters ceased. The eight pipe stems
recovered from the site demonstrate this inaccuracy, as their diameters measure either 5/64 in (0.08 in, or 1.98
mm) (ca. 1710-1750) or 6/64 in (0.09 in, or 2.38 mm) (ca. 1680-1710). These date ranges are clearly outside
the possible range of occupation for early Houston settlement.
Stub-Stemmed Pipes
Stub-stemmed clay tobacco pipes are characterized by separate stem and bowl pieces. In general, a 5- to 10­
in (12.7-25.4 cm) tapered reed was inserted into the molded clay bowl and secured with a cork. In tracing the
development and distribution of stub-stemmed clay pipes, Walker (1975:97) suggests that the form derives
from Turkish antecedents of the seventeenth century. It was manufactured in the American colonies before
1740, and at least four centers of production emerged in Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio in the nineteenth
century. By the late nineteenth century, at least one production site was operating in Texas (Walker
1975:117). Moreover, stub-stemmed pipes were widely distributed across North America by the mid
nineteenth century. They have been recovered from archeological sites near Sacramento, California (1846­
1852), and Vicksburg, Mississippi (1862). Pipes manufactured in Pamplin, Virginia, were en route to
Montana when the ship Bertrand sank in 1865 (Walker 1975:116).
Walker (1975) describes the manufacturing process for stub-stemmed pipes. In general, local clays of various
colors were pressed in two-piece metal molds and then fired. Unlike one-piece kaolin pipes, many stubstemmed pipes were glazed. Whether glazed or unglazed, coarse earthenware pipes were known as
‘hamburgs,’ and stoneware pipes were termed ‘shakers.’ A great many stub-stemmed pipes were ornamented
with stylized moldings, including human effigies.
Two effigy examples are among the four stub-stemmed pipes recovered during excavations. Feature 7005
yielded a green-glazed coarse earthenware effigy pipe in the form of a Turk’s head. The molded image
depicts a man displaying a mustache and turban (see Figure 12.11). A prominent mold seam bisects the face.
A similar pipe from the Eagle Island plantation in Brazoria County is said to have been made in England and
was popular in the United States prior to the Civil War (Gross et al. 1993:115). Sheet refuse in 41HR820
(Excavation Unit 7012) yielded a second coarse earthenware effigy pipe. This highly stylized pipe, unglazed
and lacking much of the bowl portion, depicts a hand scratching a chin in a presumably contemplative pose.
Among the two non-effigy examples is an unglazed coarse earthenware stem and bowl fragment from Feature
7025. The mold seam is again prominent, and molded decoration includes a raised horizontal band and dotted
beads around the rims of the stubbed stem and bowl. This particular pipe must have been popular on the
Upper Texas Coast in the early and mid nineteenth century, as nearly identical examples have been recovered
from the townsite of Old Velasco in Brazoria County and Fanthorp Inn in Grimes County (Earls et al.
1996:260-261; Ing and Hart 1987:Plate 19A). In addition, Feature 5017 yielded the stem portion of a saltglazed stoneware pipe. Mold lines are pronounced and the stem lacks decoration. Excavations at the Eagle
Island Plantation yielded similar examples, and the investigators report that such salt-glazed stoneware pipes
may have been manufactured in Point Pleasant, Ohio (Gross et al. 1993:115).
Musical Instruments
Recovery of three musical instrument pieces provides insights into the pastimes of early Houstonians. Two
compelling articles derive from Feature 5014, the privy deposit on the Jacob de Cordova lot. The first is a
brass instrument lever, or key, such as those found on clariphones of the late nineteenth century (see Israel
1968:528). The lever was recovered from arbitrary Level 2, near the surface of the feature. The inscription
reads: PATENT\1858, which is concurrent with the documented use of the privy deposit (ca. 1835-1862).

186

The second article is a reeded instrument plate, perhaps from a harmonica (see Lebo 1987:Figure 10-1r). The
tin plate possesses a patterned design and a centered engraving that reads: Concert.
A third instrument part was recovered from the sheet refuse deposit at 41HR818. This is a brass reed plate
from a 10-hole harmonica. Based upon advertised brands in late nineteenth-century catalogs (MWC
1969:241), the 10-hole harmonica style was the most common.
Slate Stationary
Sixteen features and two sheet-refuse deposits yielded 41 slate board fragments during data recovery
excavations. Feature 7021 (n=10) and 1063 (n=6) yielded the most pieces. Single- or double-sided slate
boards were commercially produced in any number of sizes. Some were as large as 4 x 7 ft (1.2 x 2.1 m),
while others were only 5 x 7 in (12.7 x 17.8 cm) (BB 1988:143; Israel 1968:356). The larger boards had
wood frames, sometimes covered with felt. The smallest slate boards were often bound into ‘book slates’
with “fine black cloth covers” (Israel 1968:356; MWC 1969:119). The 1897 Sears Catalog touted slate
boards as being “suitable for home, Sunday, and private schools” (Israel 1968:356).
Seven features (2004, 5014, 6001, 6002, 7021, 7024, and 7027) yielded 13 slate pencil specimens. All of
these are apparently fragments, as the largest specimen is a fractured pencil measuring just over 3 in (7.6 cm).
Notable are the four pencil specimens from Feature 5014, the privy of the Jacob de Cordova family. Both
hard-grade chalk and slate pencils served as writing utensils for slate boards. At least two grades of slate
pencils were available by the end of the nineteenth century (Israel 1968:353). Natural slate pencils were 7 in
(17.8 cm) long and sold for $0.01-0.03 per pencil in 1897. Soapstone slate pencils were 5.5 in (14 cm) long
and sold for $0.10-0.12 per pencil. Slate pencils could be sharpened with a hand-held piece of grooved iron,
as shown in the 1895 Montgomery Ward Catalog (MWC 1969:116).
Sewing Materials
Three items related to sewing activities were among the artifact assemblage. Feature 6001 yielded a thimble
of presumably whitemetal material. Features 7021 and 7031 each yielded a single straight pin. The specimen
from Feature 7021 is cuprous. The precise metal constituting the specimen from Feature 7031 is
indeterminate, but it may be a whitemetal alloy.

PART IV
THE ECOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS

13
VERTEBRATE REMAINS FROM 41HR812, 41HR816,
41HR818, AND 41HR820
Brian S. Shaffer

In all, 3,495 vertebrate remains were identified from four sites within the Ball Park at Union Station
Archeological Project. The sites include 41HR812, 41HR816, 41HR818, and 41HR820, and include 22
feature areas. Goals of this analysis were to identify taxa exploited by occupants at each site and to determine
any discernable exploitation or economic patterns. Analysis results indicate very little exploitation of nondomesticated taxa. Cattle represent the majority of the domesticated specimens, with virtually all types of
standard or commercial meat cuts present in the faunal assemblage. The butcher’s tool of choice,
surprisingly, was not a smooth-bladed implement, such as a cleaver, but a handsaw. Sample sizes were not
sufficient to draw conclusions between features or sites.
METHODOLOGY
Faunal remains were analyzed according to the feature from which they were recovered, with each feature
treated as a separate analytical unit. Where possible, the following attributes were recorded for each
specimen: provenience, taxon, element, portion of element, side (of body), criteria upon which ages were
assigned, age of the animal, basic taphonomic information, and butchery data. Taphonomic information
included weathering, breakage, burning, cut marks, and unique observations. Butchered elements were
recorded based upon the type of butchering observed (i.e., saw vs. smooth blade), and if assessable, the
specific cut of meat represented. How the cuts of meat were used was identified using published sources that
document historic butchering practices (e.g., Dansie 1979; Schulz and Gust 1983a, 1983b).
While butchering marks were clearly evident on many faunal remains, the specimens were so fragmented that
taxon, element, or cut of meat could not always be determined. Where two sets of cut marks indicated the
specimen was from a particular cut of meat but the meat could not be identified, the distance between the
marks was used to make a distinction. If the distance between the two cuts was less than about an inch (2.5
cm), the cut of meat was generically referred to as a steak. If the distance was greater, the cut was generically
referred to as a roast. This measurement was also used to separate steak and roast cuts when the element
could be identified. For example, a cow femur shaft portion with two transverse saw marks greater than an
inch apart would be considered a round-cut roast.
Unique observations, such as medical disorders or detailed cut-mark descriptions, were also recorded.
Unusual or culturally modified specimens were observed under magnification using either a 10x hand lens or
a light microscope up to 30x. Data recording and manipulation followed a modified version of Shaffer and
Baker (1992). Data recording errors and encoding errors were kept to a minimum through the use of an errorchecking program developed for the faunal recording system (Carlson and Shaffer 1992) and through visual
inspection of the data.
Identification of the faunal remains was aided by the zooarcheology collection at the Institute of Applied
Sciences, University of North Texas. Specimens were identified as precisely as possible based upon
morphology, the historic setting of the site, and animal biogeography. Identification guides, such as Balkwill
and Cumbaa (1992), Gilbert (1980), Gilbert et al. (1985) Lawrence (1951), Olsen (1960, 1964, 1968), and
Schmid (1972), were also consulted.

188

Identifications were made with certain underlying assumptions previously noted by Driver (1992) for
zooarcheology. While zoological taxonomy is used to describe identified specimens, identifications were
made based upon an assumed realm of possibilities. This assumed realm was derived from the site’s context,
namely nineteenth-century Houston. In other words, both time period and geography were used as delimiters
for making identifications. For example, many fragments in the sample were simply identified as Bos sp. and
cf. Bos sp. (cattle). The identification to just the genus level stems from the possibility that more than one
species of cow may be present, B. taurus or B. indicus being the most likely candidates. While the recovered
specimens were compared both to cattle (B. taurus) and North American bison (Bison bison), the latter not
being identified, no attempt was made to compare the remains with other large artiodactyls, such as musk ox
(Ovibos moschata, from the American Northwest), yaks (Bos grunniens, from Asia), or wildebeests
(Connochaetes gnou or C. taurinus, from Africa). The author assumed that it was unlikely that these animals
were part of the possible meat choices for nineteenth-century Houstonians.
Specimens identifiable to class but unidentifiable to a more specific taxon were assigned to general body-size
classes where possible. Size categories used in this study include medium-sized fish (centrum width ≥5 to
<15 mm), large fish (centrum width ≥15 mm), large bird (duck, turkey-sized, or larger), medium- to largesized mammal (canid- to deer-sized), and large mammal to very large mammal (deer- to cow-sized). The
term ‘cattle’ in this report refers to beef only. The necessity for grouping the mammal categories into
combined sizes stems from the problem of individual bone fragments that may be large enough to represent a
dog, for example, but could also represent a fragment of small bone from a goat.
Identification of sheep and goat in the sample was problematic, since the distinction between these animals’
post-cranial elements is difficult. Due to the fragmentary condition of the remains, all were simply identified
as sheep-goat.
Other problems encountered during the analysis included limitations of the comparative faunal collection.
Taphonomic factors of burning, breakage, and butchering hindered identification in certain cases.
Where applicable, relative animal ages (subadult vs. adult) were assessed based upon bone fusion data, and in
limited cases, bone size. The most common form of such data was the state of metaphyseal closure (growth
center for most long bones), usually involving the fusion of the epiphysis to the diaphysis, and closure of any
other growth areas, such as cranial sutures. Bones were recorded as either unfused, fusing, or fused. If a bone
was unfused, it was determined that the animal was not fully skeletally mature and was still growing. Fusing
indicates that growth has stopped for that portion of the bone, and the metaphysis is disappearing. Animals at
this age may be considered almost skeletally mature. A fused bone indicates that growth has stopped and that
skeletal maturation has been reached.
Surprisingly, very few teeth (n=13) were recovered. This is unfortunate, since much of the literature on aging
of domestic animals is based upon the assessment of eruption and wear patterns on teeth.
Faunal remains were quantified using number of identified specimens (NISP) and minimum number of
individuals (MNI). The NISP count is simply the number of specimens identified in a given assemblage or
for a given taxon. As a measure of taxonomic abundance, it represents the maximum number of individuals
identified in an assemblage, assuming that each specimen is from a different animal. This number, however,
likely overestimates the actual number of individuals that comprise the assemblage since rarely will each bone
fragment come from a different animal. Data presented in this study are NISP unless otherwise stated as
MNI.
The MNI count for a given assemblage is typically defined as the greatest number of individuals represented
by duplication of skeletal elements. In addition, factors such as age (Bökönyi 1970:291-292), element size

189

(Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984:27), and stratigraphic position may also be considered when determining the
minimum number of animals represented in an assemblage. MNI tends to underestimate the actual number of
taxa that are represented in an assemblage.
Both NISP and MNI calculations were applied to the assemblage on a per-feature basis (Tables 13.1-13.8).
MNI counts were based upon the most frequent element for each identified age class for each taxon, using
each archeological feature as a single aggregate. Note that comparable categories of taxa were combined for
MNI purposes. For example, specimens identified as the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus and cf. Gallus
gallus) were combined to determine the minimum number of chickens.
CONDITION OF THE ASSEMBLAGE
The majority of faunal remains was recovered in generally good condition beyond the results of butchering.
Of the 3,495 specimens, only 15 have weather-degraded surfaces. A total of 503 specimens shows evidence
of burning. None of the burning appears to be associated with preparation of the animals for human
consumption. Of those 503 burned specimens, only 40 were identified as calcined (burned white), the most
advanced stage of burning; 234 are charred (burned black); and 228 show slight color changes with partial
charring from slight heating.
Breakage has significantly affected the assemblage, with the majority of specimens no longer their original
size. Only 101 specimens were recorded as unbroken. Of the remaining broken specimens, 3,202 exhibit
angular fractures and/or evidence that they had been butchered. A total of 192 specimens shows evidence of
spiral-type fractures, which result from fresh bone breakage (Johnson 1985). At prehistoric sites, when spiral
fracturing is found in high percentages or high concentrations, it is associated with the processing of bone for
marrow. This does not appear to be the case with this assemblage. Rather, the spiral-fractured bones are the
unintended results of various butchering practices. For example, spiral fractures were observed on nine
specimens that exhibit chop marks.
TAXA REPRESENTATION
With the exception of fish, toad, toad, turtle, rat, and possibly duck (Analtidae) remains, identifiable
specimens are dominated by domesticated taxa, including cattle, pig, sheep/goat, chicken, turkey, and cat.
The distribution of taxa within each feature of each site is presented in Tables 13.1-13.8. Cattle comprise the
most common taxon; as such, cattle remains were identified with the largest number of butchered elements of
the identified taxa. The contrasting numbers between NISP and MNI are apparent in Tables 13.1-13.8. The
combination of low overall frequencies per taxon per feature along with butchering of the remains resulted in
few elements that would be duplicated and result in MNIs numbering more than one.
Examining the three major mammalian taxa recovered (Table 13.9), it is apparent that only select portions of
these taxa are represented in the assemblage. Notably lacking are the phalanges, cranial, and mandibular
elements with associated teeth. These elements would usually be associated with discarded or non-edible
portions of the carcasses had the carcasses been butchered on site. Instead, the lack of these remains indicates
that most of carcasses were processed elsewhere; the portions that became incorporated into the assemblage
represent the end products used by the consumers. Most likely, these remains represent the consumer end of
commercially butchered meats.
The apparent lack of vertebral and rib elements is somewhat misleading (see Table 13.9). These elements
were often highly fragmented or butchered into small pieces such that their identification to taxon was not
possible. For example, 182 rib fragments from large/very large mammals were identified. Of these, nearly

The predominance of beef within the assemblage is surprising. While beef remains are usually larger, size
and preservation do not appear to represent significant factors in the representation of beef in this study. The
remains of smaller taxa appear to be quite well preserved. Given the equitable states of preservation, it would
be expected that other taxa, such as pig, sheep/goat, and chicken, would occur in higher frequencies, but these
occur in very low frequencies compared to beef remains. There is no clear reason indicated by the faunal
assemblage for this predominance of beef. It is possible that beef was the preferred meat of choice, although
this would represent quite a bias. It may be that beef was the most commonly available meat product and
hence its predominance.
AGE
Based upon relative aging of skeletal elements (primarily using epiphyseal fusion), most of the domesticated
taxa represented are of subadult age. Age determination was based upon elements or ends of elements that
could be assessed to estimate the difference between subadult and adult status. For example, proximal ends of
the humerus, femur, tibia, and ulna, and the distal ends of the femur, radius, and ulna fuse close to the time of
childhood. If these epiphyses were fused, the animal was determined to have been an adult. If these elements
were unfused, the animal was a subadult. Fusion of elements such as the distal humerus, distal tibia, or
proximal radius, on the other hand, were not used as indicators of adulthood because these elements fuse early
in life. If these epiphyses were unfused, the animal was assumed to be a subadult. None of the cattle, pig, or
sheep/goat elements recovered was significantly smaller in size to indicate that calves, piglets, or kids were
being butchered. In fact, some of the subadult cattle remains were larger than the adult cattle remains in the
comparative collection used for identification.
In all, 117 specimens of cattle were determined to represent subadults, while only 31 specimens were from
adults. Thirty-one pig specimens were from adults, with three from subadults. For the category of
sheep/goat, five were from subadults, with no specimens identified as adults. This breakdown of animal ages
indicates that most animals were selected for butchering probably after reaching full size but not full maturity.
In this manner, the butchers were able to maximize animal size while still butchering younger animals that
would be most tender.
BUTCHERY AND DIET
Table 13.10 presents identified cut marks and their respective combinations. Often, more than one type of cut
mark was present on a given specimen. The most common type of cut mark identified was that of the
handsaw, followed by chopping, then the use of other smooth-bladed implements for slicing and filleting.
The types of cut marks produced by smooth-bladed implements included slice, fillet (multiple parallel slice
cuts), and chop marks. Most slice cuts were probably produced with a sharp-edged implement, such as a
knife or cleaver, and were for the purpose of separating meat from the bone with no intent to cut through the
bone. Generally, these cuts were very shallow. Slice cuts may have been produced during the butchery
process or during consumption. Chopping marks were recorded as complete (all the way through the bone) or
incomplete (not transecting the bone). If a transecting chop was present on two edges, it was recorded as
double complete chop. Chop marks were most likely produced with large knives, cleavers, or possibly with
axes. There is evidence that at least nine specimens were butchered with an axe, as evidenced by the
extremely wide blade angle. On three specimens that experienced incomplete chops with wide blade angles,
the blade angle could be measured. All three measured approximately 90º; such a wide angle is more
indicative of an implement such as an axe than that of a knife or cleaver.
As noted, the most commonly used butchering implement was the handsaw. Handsaws produce marks on the
cut edge of bone that are roughly parallel but deviate slightly as the butcher moves or adjusts the saw angle
while cutting (Gust 1983; Kenyon 1991). As a result, remnant marks are not perfectly parallel. Sawing was
recorded as ‘handsaw’ when a singular sawed edge was present and ‘double handsaw’ when two sawed edges
were present.

Of the 779 specimens identified with cut marks, 668 have sawing marks. The wide-scale use of handsaws
indicates that the sites’ occupants were using meats that were subjected to standardized butchery practices.
This, in turn, suggests that meats were most likely commercially purchased instead of being from animals that
were dispatched and butchered at home on a family-by-family basis. If carcasses were being butchered at
home, it would be expected that there would be a much wider variety of butcher marks, and individuals in
each home would butcher animals in whatever fashion was convenient. It is unlikely that the several
households that produced these features would have selected the handsaw for butchering when other tools,
such as large knives or cleavers, would have been available and easier to use. The use of the handsaw as a
predominately commercial tool in this case matches the lack of discard or waste products found at each of the
four sites.
Table 13.11 presents the beef cuts that could be identified and ranked with confidence. Rib cuts are not
included due to their lack of confident identification. While there is little doubt that most or all of the rib
specimens identified as large/very large mammal do, in fact, come from cattle, when these specimens were
cut, it was usually only with one cut mark. Determining a specimen cut of meat was thus not usually possible.
With such ambiguity, this category has been omitted from this table. Using the ranking provided by Schultz
and Gust (1983b), some idea is given to what are better cuts versus less desirable cuts in terms of relative
costs. Ideally, better cuts were more expensive and hence higher ranked. A comparison of Table 13.11 with
Tables 13.1, 13.3, 13.5, and 13.7 reveals that as the frequency of cattle and large/very large mammal remains
increased, so too did the number of identifiable cuts of meat.
Analysis of Table 13.11 indicates a general practice of using economically lower-end cuts supplemented by
the occasional better cuts. But this evaluation may not be totally relevant for making economic assessments
regarding the sites’ occupants. Lower-end cuts may be less expensive, but expense may not be relevant to
cooking decisions. For example, roast cuts do not generally originate from the best (and more expensive) cuts
of meat. It might initially appear, therefore, that people consuming these cuts would represent a lower
economic level; however, it may be that it was simply easier to cook a single roast (usually coming from
round, chuck, arm, hindshank, or foreshank) than to cook multiple steaks for a group of people. Also, less
expensive cuts are often tougher and larger, requiring slow cooking to make the meat tender for consumption.
Larger cuts and tougher meat would also provide larger amounts of meat than would individual cuts. Hence,
if a person was cooking for a group, it might be more labor efficient to cook a larger piece of meat for a
longer period of time than to try to cook several individual steaks at once. In this study, a roast is defined as a
cut of meat being more than about an inch thick. In the case of many arm, foreshank (radius and ulna), or
hind shank (tibia) cuts, these were visually assessed at being 2 to 5 in (5 to 12.5 cm) thick.
In this assemblage, the tougher and less expensive cuts tended to be cut as roasts more often. For example,
round cuts (ranked as ‘3’ in Table 13.11) originate from the upper hind leg and may be cut as steaks or roasts.
Only two out of nine of these cuts were identified as roasts, with the rest being steaks. Of the 18 arm cuts
(ranked as ‘6’ in Table 13.11), four were steaks and 14 were roasts. Foreshanks and hindshanks were both
ranked as ‘9.’ Eleven of the 17 foreshank cuts and nine of the 10 hindshank cuts were identified as roasts.
Similar data were not available for pig, sheep/goat, or poultry cuts. The single pig cut identified from
41HR812, Feature 1065, was shank ham. A shank ham was also recovered from 41HR820, Feature 7013. A
ham steak was found at 41HR816, Feature 5017, with a neck slice or steak recovered from 41HR820, Feature
7001. Pig cuts identified at 41HR820, Feature 7003, include Boston butt and ham. The only sheep/goat cut
identified was a ‘sirloin off’ from 41HR820, Feature 7047. No cut marks or cuts of meat were identified on
avian bone.
It is interesting to note that these taxa were not generally being incorporated into the diet of the sites’
occupants. Additionally, the lack of wild taxa in the diet indicates little or no reliance on supplemental

hunting and fishing. Site occupants were undoubtedly dependent on local commercial butchers for the
majority of their meat products.
UNIQUE OBSERVATIONS
Five unique observations were made, all of which pertain to the medical conditions of the animals involved.
Feature 5017 at 41HR816 yielded a chicken tibiotarsus with medullary bone. Medullary bone is a “granular
or powdery substance which is deposited in the marrow cavity” of females of many avian species during the
breeding period and serves as a source of calcium for developing egg shells (Rick 1975:183). It may remain
present throughout the laying period (Rick 1975:184-185). In domestic species, medullary bone may be
present for months at a time (Rick 1975:185). Given the presence of medullary bone, it may be that the sites’
occupants raised chickens.
A pig scapula with an enthesophyte on its posterior ridge was recovered from 41HR820, Feature 7003. In this
case, the enthesophyte represents an ossified muscle attachment. The cause for this condition is unknown.
The reason for the fused chicken hind proximal phalanges from 41HR820, Feature 7034, is probably some
sort of trauma. Two phalanges were fused into a Y-pattern such that the proximal end of one has grafted on
to the midshaft of the next phalange.
Two cattle radii from 41HR820, Feature 7057, show subperiosteal reactive bone, the cause of which is not
readily apparent. The reactive bone appears localized to each of the bones’ surfaces.
Of notable interest was the recovery of a rat (Rattus sp.) from Feature 1048B at 41HR812. Twenty-one
elements were recovered, including one scapula, both humeri, one radius, one ulna, both innominates, both
femora, both tibiae, one fibula (detached from one tibia), both lower mandibles, and all eight teeth. Two
vertebrae, one sacrum, and several ribs were recovered that were simply identified as Rodentia that
undoubtedly came from this single animal. Lack of fusion of most of the epiphyses of most long bones
indicates the rat was subadult. These specimens represent the only nearly complete carcass recovered from
the four sites investigated. The rat does not appear to be associated with the dietary remains at the sites.
SUMMARY
Analysis of vertebrate remains from four sites and 22 features in the Ball Park Project Area reveals a pattern
of reliance on commercially butchered meat products, predominately beef. The combination of extensive
handsaw use combined with a lack of discard elements, such as feet or heads, indicates that butchery of the
remains was probably conducted offsite by commercial butchers. There is no apparent reason why the
assemblage is dominated by beef remains.
Across features and across sites, beef cuts include the very best and very worst cuts of meat. In general, the
higher the number of remains found, the greater the number of butchered specimens. When more butchered
remains were found, a wider distribution of remains was found. Even so, there tends to be a dominance of
economically lower-end cuts of meat. As noted, these cuts do not necessarily imply a lower economic status.
Reasons for using such cuts may correspond to culinary or feeding needs and ease of preparation. For
example, it may have been easier to slow cook one roast (lower ranked cut of meat) to feed several people
than it would have been to prepare several steaks. In addition, slower cooking would yield tender meat for the
consumers. The meat may have been cheaper, but not necessarily perceived as being a lower status
commodity.
Low frequencies of other taxa resulted in few cut marks for pig and sheep/goat remains. No cut marks were
evident on chicken, turkey, or duck remains. The presence of these taxa in the assemblage is assumed to be
the result of dietary use. The presence of rat remains from Feature 1048B at 41HR812 represents an animal
that died (rather than a food remnant) and was incorporated into the site as a nearly complete carcass.

PLANT REMAINS FROM THE BALL PARK PROJECT AREA
J. Philip Dering

This chapter presents analysis results from 48 flotation samples recovered during excavations at four
archeological sites in the Ball Park Project Area: 41HR812, 41HR816, 41HR818, and 41HR820. Analysis
was also conducted on a total of 199 macrobotanical lots from six sites within the project: 41HR812,
41HR815, 41HR816, 41HR818, 41HR820, and 41HR821. Material from 54 features was examined from
these sites, including five that were designated as privies, namely Features 1048B and 1065 (41HR812), 5014
(41HR816), and 7001 and 7009 (41HR820).
LABORATORY METHODS
Sample Types
Flotation samples are samples of archeological sediment that have been floated in water to separate lighter
charred plant remains from heavier material, or clays/silts that can be suspended in water and rinsed out of the
sample. The sediment samples from this project were floated by personnel from Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., and the light and heavy fractions were submitted to Texas A&M University for analysis. At
the same time, some macroplant samples, termed ‘nonflotation’ samples, were submitted for identification.
These samples include plant material that was either collected from archeological screens in the course of
excavation or had been extracted from archeological sediments during laboratory analysis. For the sake of
simplification, the author has subsumed all of these materials under the single term, ‘macroplant sample.’
Sorting Procedures
Standard archeobotanical laboratory procedures were used during analysis. The light fractions of the flotation
samples were sorted through a series of four nested geological screens with mesh sizes ranging from 4 to 2 to
1 to 0.45 mm. The material caught on the sieve levels and the pan was scanned for floral parts, fruits, and
seeds, and was simultaneously identified and counted. The heavy fractions of the samples were scanned for
plant material, which was then separated for identification. For quantification purposes, carbonized material
from the heavy fractions was combined with the material from the light fractions. The excellent conditions of
preservation encountered during the project allowed for both carbonized and uncarbonized plant remains to be
included in the archeological assemblage.
The original research contract specified that one identification would be obtained from each bag or lot
submitted to the laboratory. However, preliminary examination revealed that many of the macrobotanical lots
contained several specimens representing many taxa of both seeds and wood. Although these lots were not
completely analyzed due to the large size of the assemblage, they were nonetheless sampled; multiple
identifications were obtained from many of them.
Identification
All carbonized wood was identified by means of the snap technique, examined at 8 to 45 magnifications using
a hand lens or a binocular dissecting microscope, and compared to samples in the Texas A&M University
Archaeobotanical Laboratory herbarium. All seed identification was made by reference to collections at the
Archaeobotanical Laboratory and at the Tracy Herbarium, Texas A&M University.

201

Some woods are so similar that it was very difficult to identify the genus; likewise, archeological material is
often too fragmented or deteriorated to allow identification of the genus. Genera within a plant family,
however, are usually distinguishable, and for these reasons, the author has combined some taxa into wood
types. Identification in the ‘type’ category represents identification to the taxon level indicated by the name
of the type. In addition to normal taxonomic categories, the following wood types or categories are used in
this report:
1. Conifer Wood Type. Conifers include pine (Pinus sp.), juniper (Juniperus sp.), and bald cypress
(Taxodium distichum). Under certain conditions of preservation, the wood of these trees may be
indistinguishable under low magnification cross sections. The most likely identification of the conifer
wood is bald cypress.
2. Elm Family Wood Type. This family (Ulmaceae) includes many species of hackberry and elm. These
can be distinguished if the specimen is large and well preserved.
3. Willow/Cottonwood Wood Type. This type includes members of the Salicaceae family, willow, and
cottonwood, which are difficult to distinguish.
4. Prunus Wood Type. This type includes plums, apricots, and peaches.
5. Indeterminate Hardwood. This category refers to any woody seed-bearing plant; i.e., not a cone-bearing
tree, such as pine, cypress, or juniper.
At most open sites, postdepositional processes contribute to the reduction of plant assemblages, with the result
that only carbonized plant remains that resist oxidation and attack from insects or microorganisms are
considered part of the archeological record (Miksicek 1987:214). This is often not the case with historic
privies, where the plant material is deeply buried and protected by a structure for at least part of the time, as
well as being much younger than material from prehistoric sites (Dering 1991, 1997:280). This analysis will,
therefore, consider all plant materials, both carbonized and uncarbonized, for inclusion in the archeobotanical
assemblage.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Privies served as repositories for both fecal matter and household garbage. As such, they have the potential to
yield excellent data regarding land use, diet, structural materials, and material possessions within a settlement
or community. In particular, because plant remains often constitute a significant part of the assemblage from
these sites, botanical analysis of samples from historical sites has contributed to our understanding of diet,
materials used for construction, site formation processes, and land-use practices (Beaudry and Mrowsowski
1987:18, 1989:231; Dering 1991, 1997:273; Miller 1988:51). The author posited the following general
research questions for the macrobotanical study. The information generated by these questions can be
incorporated within the broader issues of land use, diet, and material culture:
1. What plant taxa and plant parts are present in the samples?
2. What is the origin of plants in the assemblage; i.e., are they native or introduced?
3. What are the sources of plant materials in the assemblage; i.e., were they introduced as fecal material,
household garbage, or yard refuse?
4. What is the probable function of each item; i.e., were they used as food plants, building materials, or
landscape plants?
ARCHEOBOTANICAL ASSEMBLAGE
Preservation in the analyzed features was excellent; all of the samples contained identifiable plant remains.
An estimated total of 16,916 seeds and 2,856 wood fragments weighing 6,584 g was examined. The actual
total of woody remains is greater than the numbers examined because the macroplant sacks were subsampled.
The samples were also fairly species-rich for open sites. Twenty-five seed/fruit taxa and 12 wood taxa are
represented in the plant assemblage, as shown in Table 14.1.
Wood
The 12 wood types recovered from the samples include native taxa grown in urban areas, native trees grown

202

for structural materials, and introduced taxa used for landscaping. By far the most common wood types are
conifers, hard pine, and cypress, a reflection of the large quantity of building material recovered from the
sites. Other woods identified include oak (also in the form of charcoal), basswood, elm, hickory, and walnut.

The most common wood type in the samples is hard pine planks, possibly obtained from loblolly (Pinus
taeda) or longleaf pine (P. palustris) stands in eastern Texas. Pine was a primary building material used to
construct frame structures and to line privy pits. The pine forests of eastern Texas were not commercially
exploited until after the Civil War. By the late 1860s, the amount of standing wood in the eastern half of the
United States was rapidly diminishing, and much of the northeastern states were deforested by the time the
southern forests were lumbered commercially. Forests in the midwestern Great Lakes states were logged or
burned in a series of catastrophes in less than 50 years (Walker 1991:22). The southern pine forests of eastern
Texas were virtually destroyed, although they were not intensely lumbered during the 60 years from 1880
until 1940 (Maxwell and Martin 1970). Although the mid nineteenth-century context of the current project
predates the largest logging operations of the region, most of the pine building material was probably locally
obtained.
Cypress, another locally grown building material, was used to construct some of the privies. Other woods
used in construction include oak, basswood, and elm. Three corks made from the bark of the tropical cork
tree are included in the floral assemblage. These would have arrived at the site as manufactured goods,
probably with a bottled product.
Oak is the third most common charred wood recovered. Oak charcoal was especially abundant in Feature
7009 (41HR820). Pine is not a suitable fireplace wood, and the recovered pine charcoal was probably the
result of trash-burning activities. Oak, however, is an excellent fuel and often was converted into charcoal by
stove fires (Maxwell and Martin 1970).
Some wood types in the features represent common landscape or orchard plants of the region; this refuse
would have resulted from regular landscape maintenance practices, such as pruning and clearing. These wood
types include native trees (oak, pine, hickory, and elm). Peach, plum, apricot, and oleander (Prunus sp.)
comprise the introduced trees commonly grown in orchards or yards.
Seeds, Fruits, and Nuts
Seeds from apples, peaches, apricots, figs, dewberries, strawberries, and grapes were recovered from the
features. These fruits were grown commercially and also in gardens or yards in the area. The abundance of
some material, including dewberries and grapes, indicates intensive use.
Dewberry/blackberry (Rubus sp.) and grape (Vitis sp.) seeds are the most abundant remains in the assemblage
and would have been either wild or cultivated, both being common in Texas. Dewberry vines grew
abundantly in the eastern half of Texas and were often developed into small commercial operations in the
second half of the nineteenth century. By the 1920s, parts of eastern Texas had developed into major
dewberry production areas (Talbert and Murneek 1939:269). Vineyards were also developed extensively
from around 1850, and by 1900, land committed to grapes exceeded 1,000,000 acres (Texas Almanac
1946:37).
Fruits that probably derived from wild stands include many of the same taxa that were grown commercially or
in yards. These are grape, dewberry, strawberry, wild cherry, and hackberry. Early accounts speak to the
richness of the local grapes, dewberries, and hawthorns (Geiser 1945:18).
Walnuts (Juglans nigra), pecan (Carya illinoiensis), and hickory (Carya spp.) nuts are also represented in the
assemblage. These nuts grow abundantly in the region and were collected by Anglo Texas settlers. The
recovered fragments of walnut and hickory, never grown commercially in Texas (Rosengarten 1984:52),
probably originated as yard trash. Pecans were the most important nut crop in Texas and remain so today.
During the early days of the Republic, wild pecans were collected and carried by wagons to Galveston to be
shipped east (Geiser 1945:13). Improved horticultural varieties were developed and introduced around 1870,
and the first commercial pecan orchards were developed in 1880 (Rosengarten 1984:56).

204

Garden plants in the assemblage include watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), introduced Old World melons
(Cucumis melo), and New World plants, such as corn (Zea mays) and squash or pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo).
All of these plants were commonly grown in gardens or could have been commercially obtained.
Purchased foods would have likely included the several hundred coffee beans recovered from Feature 1048B
(41HR812), as well as rice (Oryza sativa) and possibly fig (Ficus indica). The presence of coffee beans
indicates the attraction that this commodity has long held for Texans, and they might have been shipped to
Houston via Galveston. Widespread commercial production of rice did not occur in Texas until the twentieth
century (Geiser 1945:38).
Ruderals
Ruderals are plants that grow in areas of disturbed soils, especially around human habitations. Their presence
indicates either that surface materials have entered the privies accidentally or that yard trash was discarded
into the pits. Ruderals recovered include copperleaf (Acalypha virginica), goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.),
doveweed (Croton texensis), spurge (Euphorbia sp), carpetweed (Mollugo verticillata), knotweed
(Polygonum sp.), dock (Rumex sp), chickweed (Stellaria media), and clover (Trifolium sp.).
FEATURE ANALYSIS
Botanical analysis of features at the site was conducted to determine: (1) feature function, (2) formation
processes affecting features, and (3) feature content as related to land use and material culture of mid
nineteenth-century Houston. The labeling of a feature makes an assumption about its function. For example,
‘privy’ implies that the feature was used as an outhouse. However, privies were often cleared, and features
often change function throughout the occupational history of a site (Dickens 1985:162). Clearly, the features
described here have resulted from multiple activities. For example, Feature 1048B, a privy, contained large
quantities of dewberries, most likely introduced by defecation, and several hundred whole coffee beans. It
also contained large chunks of charcoal that must have been introduced as discarded trash. Cut limbs of
peach or plum trees indicate pruning activities. Clearly, this refuse represents a collection of behaviors that
centered around the household and will reflect on the activities of its inhabitants and the surrounding
community.
The following descriptions are arranged by site and feature. Many of the smaller features are summarized in
tables (see below).
41HR812
A total of seven features was sampled from this site, which contained the largest and richest assemblages
encountered in the project. Over 11,000 dewberry seeds and 100 grape seeds were recovered from the
features. Results of the botanical analysis of samples from this site are presented in Tables 14.2 and 14.3.
Features 1048A (a refuse deposit) and 1048B (a privy) comprised the largest part of the assemblage from
41HR812. Both were located in Block 103, Parcel 103-1. The privy was a wooden-barrel type, with vertical
slats bound on the exterior with wooden bands and fastened by cut nails (see Chapter 17). Dates for the use
of this privy, taken from associated glass bottle remains and tableware, extend from about 1855-1880. Apple,
apricot, peach, plum, strawberry, dewberry, grape, fig, squash, wheat, rice, and coffee, together with three
corks, were noted in this remarkable collection of plant remains. The presence of figs and rice may reflect a
fairly long reach for the markets of the area, although fig was eventually introduced as a garden plant, and
local fig varieties were developed by the early twentieth century (Geiser 1945:24). Flotation was particularly
effective in the recovery of small seeds, such as strawberry and dewberry, while walnut fragments were
present in the macroplant samples. Ruderals were abundant and include dock, carpetweed, chickweed, and
copperleaf.

Wood from Feature 1048B reflects both its construction and the discarding of other building and landscape
waste. Cypress and southern hard pine were the most common woods recovered from the samples, and a
small amount of basswood was also noted. These woods are useful construction materials, although only the
pine and cypress wood, present in the form of boards, could be directly attributable to construction. Oak,
which makes an excellent fuel wood and which occurred in the feature primarily in carbonized form, may be
attributed to charcoal used in cook stoves.
Pollen grains from Feature 1048B provide some interesting parallels to the macrobotanical analysis (see
Chapter 15). Identifications include cereal grain, plum or peach (Prunus sp.), corn, dewberry, grape, elm,
hickory, and oak pollen, all of which were noted in the macrobotanical assemblage. Other pollen types,
including sweetgum, dogwood, sumac, and the sunflower family, were not noted in the macroplant
assemblage. These were probably deposited by local pollen rain and most likely grew in the urban
environment of the immediate neighborhood. Mustard pollen probably represents ingestion of broccoli or
cauliflower, two plants unlikely to be preserved in the macrobotanical assemblage.
Feature 1048A, a refuse pit located very close to Feature 1048B, did not contain the large concentration of
seeds found in the privy. Only a few beans, some rice grains, and some pine wood were noted in this feature.
Feature 1065 was a privy constructed of vertical wood boards that averaged 36 in long x 18 in wide x 0.6 in
thick (92 x 46 x 1.5 cm). With a surmised depth of approximately 4 ft (1.2 m), the volume of the privy was
277 gallons (1,049 liters). It lacked support posts or fasteners (see Chapter 17). Active use of this feature
would have occurred from the 1830s to about 1871, based upon recovered ceramic, bottle glass, and flat glass
artifacts.
Feature 1065 contained wheat, dewberry, grape, and peach seeds. Ruderals include dock, spurge, copperleaf,
and chickweed. Almost 6,000 seeds were recovered; the vast majority (almost 5,800) is dewberry. The
presence of abundant dewberry seeds in the feature is a good indicator of its use as a privy as there can be few
other explanations as to how so many small seeds came to be concentrated in a pit. High dewberry counts
have been considered to be a characteristic of privy features in Austin, Texas (Dering 1991:3) and in Iowa
(Lutzow 1988:5).
The privy wood sample includes both pine and conifer wood. The conifer wood may be attributed to bald
cypress, although it was not possible make an absolute determination. The large quantity of pine and conifer
suggests that the privy was constructed of these woods. No other wood types were identified in Feature 1065.
Features 1025, 1049, and 1063 were identified as pits and were located in Parcels 103-3 and 103-1. They
contained pine, conifer, oak, and elm wood. No seeds were noted in any of the pits. The wood from all three
features is most likely a mix of yard trimmings and structural waste.

Thirty-four features were sampled from this site, which contained the second largest assemblage encountered
in the analysis. The majority of the plant material was recovered from Features 7001, 7005, and 7009. Most
of the features were very small and were sampled with one or two macroplant lots. Features 7001 and 7009
were identified as privies, and most of the seeds were noted in the former. Results of the botanical analysis of
samples from this site are presented in Tables 14.4 and 14.5.

Feature 7001 was a relatively small barrel privy with vertical slats that were bound on the exterior with
wooden bands and small cut nails. It was located in the southwestern corner of Parcel 117-4a, in the northeast
section of Block 117. Glass and bottle tableware date the use of the feature to around 1855-1860. The plant
assemblage from this feature is rather limited, consisting of 3,800 seeds, all of which are dewberry. Wood
types identified in the samples include conifer (possibly bald cypress), Prunus sp., which could be peach or
plum, and unidentified roots.
Feature 7009 was a large privy lined with milled cypress boards, averaging between approximately 53 and 89
in long x 8 in wide x 1 in thick (135-225 x 8 x 2.5 cm). With a surmised depth of about 28 in (71 cm), the
volume of the privy is estimated to have been about 530 gallons (2,007 liters) (see Chapter 17). Recovered
artifacts indicate that the feature was used from approximately 1855 to 1870.
41HR815
Five features were sampled from this site. No seeds were recovered from the samples. Evidently, the
material represents discarded boards, since all of the wood was identified as conifer, pine, or, perhaps,
cypress. Feature 2001 in Lot 34 comprised two pine knots that appear to have fallen out of a milled board.
Charred material recovered from Feature 2005 lacks anatomical structure and appears to be a small piece of
coal. Results of the botanical analysis of samples from this site are presented in Table 14.6.
41HR816
Samples from six features at this site were analyzed (Tables 14.7 and 14.8). The largest assemblage came
from Feature 5014, which on the basis of its seed content alone, obviously represents the remains of a small
privy filled with feces and kitchen refuse.
Feature 5014 was identified as a wood-lined privy with horizontal milled wood boards, averaging 29.5 in long
x 9.5 in wide x 0.6 in thick (75 x 24 x 1.5 cm. With a surmised depth of 31 in (78 cm), the volume of the
privy was approximately 132 gallons (499 liters) (see Chapter 17). Samples from this feature yielded 352
seeds, mostly dewberries. Other edible plant remains include corn, grape, and peach. No weed seeds were
noted.
Most of the wood remains from this feature are conifer (possibly cypress) and pine with a few Prunus sp.
(plum or pear) fragments. The largest pieces are conifer and pine, and some were milled into boards. The
wood appears to represent remains of building materials; very few tree trimmings were represented in the
assemblage from this feature.
Pollen includes cereal, corn, grape, dewberry, and strawberry. Pollen analysis suggests the presence of wheat
or barley (both cereals) and strawberry, which were present in the macrobotanical samples. Much of the
215

pollen assemblage was generated by locally grown trees, shrubs, and flowers, including oak, elm, grass, pine,
sunflower, and hickory (see Chapter 15).

Flotation and macroplant samples from Feature 6001, a large pit, were examined from this site (Tables 14.9
and 14.10). A single peach seed observed in a macroplant sample and a few dewberry seeds in the floatation
samples provide the only evidence of edible plant remains. Ruderals identified include knotweed and
goosefoot.
The wood assemblage consists of pine, conifer, Prunus sp. (plum or peach), and oak. The wood is a mix of
yard trimmings and discarded, severely deteriorated structural materials, mostly disintegrated conifer and
southern hard pine boards.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of 48 flotation samples and 199 macroplant samples generated a botanical assemblage of 37 taxa
consisting of almost 17,000 seeds and 3,000 wood fragments. Table 14.12 presents the taxa identified in the
analysis together with the probable use or source of the plant material. Plant remains include construction
material, edible plants, and landscaping plants. This assemblage has been adequate to at least partially
address the broader issues of land use and diet.
Land Use and Urban Environment
Nine ruderals represent almost 25 percent of the assemblage. The implication is that these weed seeds were
growing abundantly in the immediate vicinity of the pit features. In addition, pollen analysis yielded
abundant grass and sunflower pollen in all five of the analyzed privies (see Chapter 15).
A substantial overstory of trees is suggested by the macrobotanical and pollen assemblage. Shade trees
include elm, chinaberry, basswood, pine, and oak. Plum or peach trees, and pecan, hickory, and walnut trees
may have also been grown on these lots during their use history. Although most of these woody plants are
native to the area, chinaberry and oleander represent fairly early Old World introductions to the urban
landscape. Peach trees were one of the earliest introductions, having been established by the Spanish in the
sixteenth century.
Pollen analysis conducted by Marshall (see Chapter 15) provides additional information regarding the woody
component of the local landscape. Pine, oak, myrtle family, sweetgum, basswood, elm, sycamore alder, and
hazelnut pollen were recovered from the privies. Some of this pollen, especially pine, may have been
transported some distance into the site area. However, the presence of so many pollen types from tree taxa
suggests that trees and shrubs were part of the urban landscape.
Diet
Of the 37 taxa in the assemblage, 15 (40.5 percent) represent the remains of edible plants. Nine of these are
introduced taxa. Many, such as rice and coffee, were not locally grown and must have been obtained via
long-distance trade. Common garden plants, including watermelon, beans, squash, corn, and other melons,
may have been grown on the lots but would also have been available in the markets. Several orchard plants,
including apples, apricots, plums, peaches, and perhaps fig, may have been grown on the lots; however,
commercial production of many of these fruits flourished rather early in the history of Texas settlement. In
particular, peaches were grown in the immediate vicinity of Houston in large orchards by the 1850s (Geiser
1945:57).
Pollen analysis adds another dimension to our understanding of diet. Brassica sp. pollen indicates
consumption of broccoli or cauliflower. An intriguing finding is the presence of clove pollen, very common

219

in three of the five analyzed privies. In addition, cereals, fairly rare in the macrobotanical remains, comprise
up to 69 percent of the pollen in one privy. Macrobotanical analysis can identify cereals to the genus level;
therefore, it is possible to determine that most of the cereal pollen probably came from wheat or wheat flour.
In addition, corn pollen was present in all of the privies sampled.

Concluding Remarks
From the recovery of almost 12,000 seeds, the macrobotanical analysis has demonstrated that excellent
preservation conditions prevailed in the pit and privy features at the Ball Park archeological sites. The
assemblage has demonstrated the presence of an anthropogenic environment that still retained several
overstory trees. Building materials were overwhelmingly represented by southern hard pine and cypress
wood. The presence of fruits, especially the abundance of peaches, is an indication of thriving orchards in the
region. Fruit trees may have been grown in the yard as suggested by numerous discarded fruit-tree limbs.
Gardens may have flourished, but the presence of coffee, rice, figs, and wheat suggest that the nineteenthcentury Houstonians had access to a cosmopolitan array of commodities.

ANALYSIS OF POLLEN GRAINS RECOVERED FROM PRIVY
DEPOSITS AT 41HR812, 41HR816, AND 41HR820
Dawn M. Marshall

Determining the types of foods eaten by people in the past reveals as much about the world in which they
lived as it does about their health and diet. Subsistence patterns, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity can be
demonstrated through scientific analyses of plant remains. Plant pollen grains, common in archeological
deposits, are analyzed to give archeologists insights into the diets (and lives) of past generations. Studies of
plant macrofossils, insects, parasites, and associated artifacts are used towards the same goal.
This analysis examines select samples of plant pollen grains recovered from privy and refuse deposits at three
sites (41HR812, 41HR816, and 41HR820) investigated during the Ball Park at Union Station Archeological
Project. This excavation presents a unique opportunity to perform pollen analyses from deposits in a welldocumented historical context. The primary objective is to obtain important data about the diet and health of
nineteenth-century Houstonians. While there is much archeological evidence and historic documentation of
the general dietary preferences of those who lived in the nineteenth century, foods eaten by a specific group
are more difficult to ascertain. Analysis of pollen grains recovered from an excavated privy can be
particularly helpful in this regard, since a privy represents a contained unit often associated with specific
individuals.
Soil samples recovered from five privy features and three refuse features were processed and analyzed for
pollen content. These features were located in four of the 17 city blocks that comprised the Project Area.
Sample processing required chemical and mechanical preparation of the pollen grains for microscopic
identification. The relative concentration of each pollen type was then determined. An attempt was made to
correlate identified plant types with the socioeconomic status of individual families known to have lived in
the area.
This chapter begins with a discussion of the significance of pollen analyses related to the Project Area
features. It is primarily focused on privy features, since these deposits held the only significant pollen yields.
The origin and history of the privy are reviewed, followed by a brief description of the social and economic
history of Houston in the late nineteenth century. Methodology is described, and analysis results are
presented with short feature descriptions (feature details are found in Chapters 5 and 17). This chapter
concludes with a summary of economic and noneconomic pollen types represented at the Ball Park site, with
a synthesis of how these plant types can be related to nineteenth century Houstonians.
WHY STUDY PRIVY DEPOSITS?
Human waste management has always presented a challenge. Throughout prehistory, specific areas were
designated for the dumping of refuse, as evidenced by the presence of coprolites in the archeological record.
Coprolites, or preserved feces, recovered from numerous archeological sites have been analyzed for seeds
(Dering and Bryant 1992; Holloway and Bryant 1986; Puseman 1995), pollen (Bryant and Williams-Dean
1975), parasites (Reinhard 1990, 1992; Reinhard and Bryant 1992), phytoliths (Piperno 1988), bones (Crader
1990), and other types of botanical fibers and animal hairs (Bryant and Williams-Dean 1975). Through the
use of coprolite studies and related techniques, diet and other cultural patterns may be discerned (Reinhard
and Bryant 1992).
222

The outhouse in North America has become a nostalgic representation of an earlier period in our history.
Many of the studies on these structures are written by the casual researcher; however, there has been some
serious scholarship on the topic, mainly archeological site reports about places in which these historical
features have been found. The privy has been studied with regard to depth, type of construction, artifacts
recovered, and, more recently, what its contents can reveal about food consumption.
Archeological pollen deposits can reveal food types available in the past, what types of foods were preferred
in view of an individual’s cultural heritage, and, by extension, the health of individuals. Moreover, recovery
within a privy of pollen from specific plants that may have been costly or rare at the time can give a clearer
picture of where the group or individual stood on the social scale.
Often, the socioeconomic status of an individual can be determined, in part, from the construction, design, and
cleanliness of his/her privy (DeYoung and Hale 1973:16). It is assumed that the more elaborate and clean the
privy, and the more care that was taken in its construction, the more affluent the owner. Even if the aboveground portions of excavated privies are no longer present, as with the current project, social status can be
sometimes inferred from the type of construction evident below ground.
Privies and refuse deposits often harbor a wealth of information about domestic life, since they provided a
convenient dumping ground for all sorts of everyday objects. Inferences about social class, diet, and
urbanization have been made from studies of parasites on fecal matter (e.g., Reinhard 1990, 1992). Pollen
and phytolith fecal investigations have been used to determine diet, seasonality, human activity, and
environment (e.g., Bryant and Williams-Dean 1975; Holloway and Bryant 1986). Macrofloral and faunal
remains may also determine diet and food choices (see Crader 1990; Dering 1997; Dering and Bryant 1992;
Puseman 1995). Other studies include insect analyses (dung beetles, for example, infest certain plants and
thus may indicate the presence of plant types that are not identifiable through pollen or macrobotanical studies
[i.e., those that do not preserve well]) and sex determination studies (e.g., Sobolik et al. 1996). (Sex
determination studies based upon fecal remains are more specific for coprolite studies, although future
applications in privy analyses may one day be found.) In sum, by correlating written records with information
derived from feature analyses, conclusions may be drawn concerning the health and diet, as well as the social
circumstances, of specific groups of people living in a particular area.
In addition, privy studies can reveal actual dietary components. For example, clove pollen was found in
several of the excavated privies in the current project. It is known that cloves were used as a spice in meat,
drinks, and in fruit. Since not all of the privies in the Project Area contained clove pollen, their occurrence or
absence may reflect ‘like’ vs. ‘dislike,’ or possibly socioeconomic differences.
Privies have a long history of use, from Sumarians and Greeks to the Romans, through the Dark Ages, to the
present day. Privies can contain a large amount of information about the people who used them, including
data on diet, health, and even aspects of everyday life. Through the studies of pollen, phytoliths, macrofloral
remains, parasites, faunal remains, and insect parts, previously unknown or lost historical information may be
retrieved.
A ROOM WITHOUT A VIEW: THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE OUTHOUSE
Many names have been used for receptacles of human waste, including privy, outhouse, johnny, biffy, latrine,
garderobe, ajax, necessary, and loo. In more modern times, reference has been to the water closet, bathroom,
toilet, lavatory, head, john, powder room, and restroom. In most historical references, it appears that ‘privy’
is the most common term.
Privy is an early Middle English word derived from the Latin ‘privatus,’ meaning “apart, retired, secret, not
publicly known” (Lambton 1998:10). The concept of ‘private’ is referred to as early as the twelfth century, as
shown in the description of privies at Durham Monastery, England, where the “partition was of wainscot

223

close, on either side very decent, so that one of them could not see one another, when they were in that place”
(Lambton 1998:9). Often before and after that time, privies were not necessarily private.
The story of the privy goes back to the City of Habuba Kabir in Mesopotamia (present-day Syria) in 3300
B.C. Here, the earliest evidence has been found of a designated indoor place used for disposal of human
waste, with a system of pipes used to carry off waste water (Horan 1996:3). Evidence of privy use is also
found on the island of Crete dating to 2000 B.C., in the palace of Knossos: “the latrines, too, had a water
supply with wooden seats and earthenware pans” (Harris 1990:1). From Crete, it appears the Romans
adopted this idea and created the now world-renowned aqueducts. By A.D. 315, there were over 140 public
latrines in Rome, many of which were on a water-controlled sewer system (latrines referring to the communal
facility) (Harris 1990:3). Public latrines in Rome at this time were commonplace, as it was considered
acceptable for both sexes to use these facilities. In post-Roman times, waste disposal reverted to cesspits,
open drains, and later to the discharge of chamber pots into streets and rivers. Although a flushable toilet was
invented in 1596, it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that it came into common use. The
outdoor privy, or outhouse, was commonplace during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
During the Roman Empire, privies or latrines were not attached to private homes. Instead, “basins and pots
were used [and] looked after by slaves” (Lambton 1998:7). These containers, originally invented by the
Sybarites of Greece, were emptied into the streets below, a practice that continued well in the nineteenth
century (Horan 1996:10). Later, it became general practice to either dig a cesspit surrounded by a structure or
to dump the waste into streets and rivers, the last being the method of least resistance. Open drains and
sewers were still commonplace in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and later. Cesspits offered an
alternative, but these tended to be troublesome.
In A.D. 1189 and 1358, laws were passed in London in an effort to regulate the practice of human waste
disposal. These were largely ignored; the use of overhanging privies continued, whereby the bottom of the
privy opened directly onto the street below. It is estimated that by 1309, 2,000 tons of human waste were
carried into the Thames River every year, no doubt contributing to the epidemics that followed throughout the
history of England and the Old World. Following the Black Death in 1348, “huge cesspits were built in the
cities [and were] cleaned out . . . by gongfermors” (‘gong’ from the Saxon ‘gang,’ meaning to go off, and
‘fermor’ from ‘fey,’ to cleanse) (Harris 1990:4-5). Such cleaners, also known as scavengers, were required to
“clean the town streets and to impose fines on those who added to the dirt” (Lambton 1998:10).
The ‘garderobe’ was a privy found only in castles or other grandiose dwellings. The ‘wardrobe,’ a room for
washing and dressing, was usually attached to the garderobe. It was “built into the thickness of the wall and
approached by a right-angled passage – a kind of horizontal trap to waylay the wafting odours” (Lambton
1998:10). These were sometimes built to extend from the building’s exterior so as to allow the contents to
fall into the moat or river below.
Another privy design was the ‘ajax,’ first described in Sir John Harrington’s book, Metamorphosis of Ajax,
published in 1596. Harrington’s invention was “a water closet with a flushing system” (Harris 1990:6).
Unfortunately, the invention was 250 years ahead of its time, since few homes had access to running water.
Indeed, the only available information regarding waste disposal for the lower classes after 1348 comes from
Molly Harris, who notes that “so once again things slipped back to the old ways of relieving oneself: the rich
their ‘close-stools’ and the peasants to the fields” (Harris 1990:6). Close-stools were chamber pots built into
intricate chairs or stools for use in the home. With soft cushions for the seats, close-stools were more
elaborate and more comfortable than garderobes.
By the beginning of the eighteenth century, when indoor water systems became more widely available, the
use of water to dispose of human waste material became more popular. Several patents were registered
between 1775 and 1800. These include items such as a closet bowl that held water to a privy with a ‘forcing

224

pump’ design. It was not until the mid nineteenth century that an invention known as the ‘earth closet’
became widely known. Reverend Henry Moule patented this device in 1860. Earth closets “had portable
wooden frames and seats with a hopper at the back which was filled with dry earth or ashes, and a bucket
underneath. The user simply pulled a handle which released a layer of the earth from the hopper [that] fell on
the contents of the bucket” (Harris 1990:7).
During the nineteenth century, privies were cleaned at regular intervals by scavengers or ‘night men.’ In
ordinances from that time, strict guidelines were laid down to guard the privacy of the people and protect
them from the stench. House privies, when full, were either cleaned or were used as a trash receptacle and
then filled, usually with the dirt from the newly dug replacement privy. Often during spring cleaning, many
items would find their way to the privy (e.g., old shoes, broken plates, used rags, buttons, bottles, glass, or
anything else that was no longer of value). As a result, privies can yield a wealth of information not
otherwise obtainable.
The remains of parasites are often found in privies. Although preservation in privies and latrines is good,
under certain circumstances, such as freeze-thaw episodes or at sites with high concentrations of fungal
agents, preservation may be lost. In Houston, the freeze-thaw issue may not be relevant, but fungal activity
and repeated wetting and drying episodes may have affected the preservation of some privy remains.
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF HOUSTON
The advent of the Victorian Age ushered in a time of moral propriety, and just as people (deliberately)
ignored refuse in the street, they “tried hard to deny natural emotions and bodily functions” (Horan 1996:81).
Indeed, “when it came to relieving themselves, the Victorians went to great lengths to hide the action” (Horan
1996:81). Ingenious furniture was designed to hide the chamber pot or anything else that was affiliated with
the ‘unmentionable,’ and numerous methods were devised to conceal the act of ‘going.’ For example,
according to Sales (1929), the outhouse should be located in a straight line from the house on the way to the
woodpile. Then, when it became necessary to use the outhouse, it could be under the pretense of going to the
woodpile.
Despite a growing awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and good health, the majority of
Victorians still believed that filth was a necessary evil. They accepted the presence of refuse and human
waste flowing through the streets, believing it attracted “those pubescent particles of disease which are ever
present in the air,” according to medical doctors of the time (Barlow 1989:2). In fact, this idea was so
thoroughly endorsed that the practice of constructing privies “next to the kitchen hearthsides in order to keep
all food wholesome and vermin free” was common (Barlow 1989:2). Due to such misguided thinking,
disease was common in nineteenth-century urban areas, especially in cities such as Houston, where the
combination of humidity, high temperatures, poor sanitation, and increasing population resulted in numerous
epidemics.
Generally, nineteenth-century privies were above-ground structures constructed of stone/brick or wood.
Below the structures were pits, lined with wood, bricks, stone, clay, or wine barrels, that were periodically
required to be cleaned out. Construction and upkeep of privies were often regulated under city ordinances,
both as to construction and to upkeep or emptying.
Although Louis Pasteur made his discovery of the bacterial cause of disease in 1864, the connection between
privies and disease was not acted upon in Houston until a decade later when laws were passed outlining
specific instructions on how, where, when, and by whom the night soil should be handled. For example, the
City of Houston Charter of 1874 reads, “That it shall be unlawful for night scavengers or any other persons to
empty or remove or carry away the contents of any privy, vault or water closet, or any other receptacle of
human excrement, at any time except during the hours from 11 o’clock p.m. to 3 o’clock a.m.” (City of
Houston Charter 1874:98). In later revised codes of ordinances, the duty of the scavenger included the

225

“sprinkl[ing] of lime or other disinfectants” (City of Houston Charter 1904:222). The scavenger was also
required to pay a bond in order to operate and be paid for his services of removing the night soil from the
privies. Reports note that this was an unpleasant job but one that paid well. This duty was generally
performed by using a ‘shituss scoop,’ which was a large ladle with a long handle. It was used if the privy did
not have a removable drawer or container similar to the earth closet.
Health and Diet
The Victorian attitude towards their toilet has unfortunately resulted in many details about privy use being left
unrecorded; as such, important information about diet and health has been subsequently lost. Moreover,
contemporary details about food preferences and availability are similarly absent, since many recipes were
passed on by oral tradition only, and the food that people ate depended as much upon personal choice as it did
on cost. Cookbooks were uncommon and unpopular in the early part of the nineteenth century, and numerous
suggestions prevailed regarding what constituted a “well-balanced diet” (Montanari 1994:152-156; Ross
1993:46).
One of the earliest known cookbooks in North America was written by Amelia Simmons and was published
in 1742 (Hess and Hess 1989:12-13). It was a general cookbook that made recommendations about various
items, such as what type of lettuce to use, rather than a book exclusively filled with recipes. Indeed, the few
cookbooks of this period put forth a specific philosophy that substantiated the use of recipes found inside. For
example, Sylvester Graham, an early nineteenth-century American nutritionist, espoused an “avoidance of
undue dietary stimulation” and advocated vegetarianism (Ross 1993:44). Graham’s theory was, in fact, one
of the few that influenced many people to change their eating habits, and it eventually inspired others to write
cookbooks. Cookbooks in the modern sense did not become popular until the late 1800s, when advances in
kitchen implements, such as the appearance of the stove and numerous domestic appliances, allowed more
methods of food preparation.
Although European cookbooks generally promoted use of spices, there were significant differences in spice
selection (Montanari 1994:62). Many times, spice choice was left up to the cook. As one book states, “take
an ounce of pepper, an ounce of cinnamon, and quarter of saffron. This combination will go well with all
foods” (Montanari 1994:63).
As the nineteenth century progressed, the number of products found in local mercantile or general stores
increased. Both canned and dry goods became available, and as a result of the profitable spice trade between
Europe and the Far East, highly spiced foods were in vogue. Initially, expensive spices, such as ginger,
cinnamon, and cloves, were regarded as luxury items that only the wealthy could afford. In time, however,
the cost of spices decreased, so that by the beginning of the twentieth century, they were available to all levels
of social strata.
The Founding of Houston
As noted in earlier chapters, the City of Houston was established in 1836. It began as a speculative venture of
two enterprising brothers from New York, Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen, who purchased
land near Buffalo Bayou. In 1836, they placed an advertisement in the Democratic Telegraph and Texas
Register, claiming Houston to be the next “Eden.” Lured by the promise of riches, people rushed to the city.
It quickly grew from a small frontier town to a thriving metropolis. The population of Houston increased
from just 1,500 in 1837 to 78,800 in 1910 (Johnston 1991:144).
As with other fast-growing cities at the time, both in Europe and the Americas, Houston suffered from the
lack of proper methods of human waste disposal. Scarlet fever, scabies, small pox, diphtheria, tuberculosis,
typhoid fever, and cholera all plagued the city in its growing years. Typhoid and cholera are especially
connected with an unclean water supply and are most likely related to unsanitary waste conditions, since
“typhoid and cholera were spread by milk and water contaminated by fecal bacteria” (Barlow 1989:81). It

226

was not until the mid 1800s, when the region was struck by a series of epidemics, that “people begin to take
notice and make sanitation improvements” (Horan 1996:77-78; see also City of Houston Charter 1874, 1886,
1904).
As Houston’s population multiplied, so did the variety of ethnic groups occupying the city. Although records
by the city’s founders and early leaders give the impression that it was an exclusive enclave of Anglo
Americans, this cultural group would have been outnumbered if all other nationalities were combined. As a
result of the war for independence with Mexico in the early 1800s, Texas attracted men from around the
world. “At San Jacinto on that April afternoon, Sam Houston led into battle men from twenty-four American
states, from Austria, Canada, England, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, and
Scotland,” and many of them stayed (Johnston 1991:34). African and Native Americans also inhabited the
region.
Other ethnic and religious groups immigrated to the city. One such early immigrant, Jacob de Cordova,
became a “most prominent citizen of the early Jewish settlers” (Johnston 1991:36). As noted in Chapter 8,
Cordova, a wealthy man and a member of the Jewish Sephardic sect, arrived in Texas from Philadelphia via
Jamaica sometime in the 1830s. After spending a brief time in Galveston, he finally settled in Houston in
1837. Sometime before 1842, Cordova purchased a house from Horace Baldwin. It was located on Prairie
Avenue and Chenevert Street. Indeed, as we have already seen, Cordova’s house may be associated with
Feature 5014, one of the excavated privies in this project (see below).
POLLEN ANALYSIS
Archeologists frequently make use of excavated plant pollen grains to reconstruct past dietary information. It
is important to note, however, that such reconstructions can often be biased as a result of contamination of the
site by natural processes (wind, water, burrowing animals) and/or by cultural disturbances. The degree of
plant preservation within a site can also vary. Before discussing the method used to analyze the pollen grains
recovered from privy deposits at the Ball Park, it is necessary to provide an overview of the science of
palynology, with definitions of common terms.
Pollen grains and spores are two of the major forms of ‘palynomorphs,’ the remains of organic-walled
microfossils. In archeological sites, palynomorphs are deposited and accumulate with organic materials to
form sediments that become part of the archeological record (Bradley 1985:308). Palynomorphs are highly
resistant to decay and are thus generally well preserved. They have been recovered from terrestrial,
lacustrine, and marine deposits, some of which date back millions of years.
Numerous studies of pollen dispersion, also known as pollen rain, have been carried out in various regions
(Delacourt et al. 1984; Janssen 1966; Wright 1965). These studies note that some of the more important
aspects that influence pollen dispersion include the size and mass of pollen grains, pollen surface
ornamentation, grain morphology, the quantity of pollen produced, and the mode of dispersion (wind or
insect).
Insect-dispersed pollen types are limited to certain groups of angiosperms. It is such an efficient mode of
dispersion that these plants only need to produce a very limited amount of pollen. Very few of these pollen
types are dispersed into the atmosphere and very few generally occur in the archeological record, unless they
represent direct cultural activity involving specific insect-pollinated plants. Insect-pollinated flora is usually
underrepresented in most fossil pollen assemblages.
The majority of the fossil pollen recovered from any sedimentary environment, especially from archeological
sites, usually comes either from those plants that rely upon the wind to disperse their pollen or from plants
that were used during human occupation. In contrast to insect-dispersed pollen, plants that rely upon the wind
for dispersion of their pollen grains typically produce large and vast amounts of pollen to ensure that

227

pollination will occur. For example, it is not uncommon for a single pine tree to produce several billion
pollen grains. Not all windborne pollen is of the same size or shape, and not all windborne types are
produced in the same amounts. Therefore, before a fossil pollen record can be adequately interpreted, there
must be a clear understanding of the relationship between the morphological characteristics of each winddispersed pollen type and how those grains are dispersed from their source.
The final pollen interpretation from any archeological site is often complicated because not all pollen is there
by accident, nor is all pollen there as a direct result of cultural activity. Adjustments to the pollen data must
be made for pollen types that may have arrived as part of the background (noncultural) deposition. Factors
such as wind velocity, wind direction, topography, and vegetation density should be considered (Crane 1986;
Janssen 1966; Niklas 1985; Shaw et al. 1980; Tauber 1965; Traverse 1994; Wright 1965). Some dispersed
pollen types might be carried over the top of vegetation (canopy component) and thus travel long distances
before they fall to the ground. Other types may be dispersed into the vegetation (trunk component) and
therefore fall quickly to the ground, while other pollen types may be dispersed just prior to rainstorms and
thus be quickly removed from the atmosphere (rainout component) by the effects of precipitation (Tauber
1965).
Studies show that each type of wind-dispersed pollen type may have a different ‘sinking speed,’ or rate at
which it will generally fall to the ground in still air. When wind direction and force are combined with
sinking speed, the potential distance that a pollen grain will travel from its source to its final deposition can be
determined. The presence of certain pollen grains in a deposit may not necessarily reflect the presence of the
parent plant in the local vegetational component.
METHODS
Five privies and three refuse features were sampled for pollen remains during archeological investigations at
the Ball Park. In all, 48 soil samples were collected at approximately 10-cm increments from these features.
The samples were sent to the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A&M University, where 10-20 g of soil were
removed from each to be processed for pollen. Although 48 samples were analyzed, significant pollen
amounts were obtained only from 23 samples, and all of these were from privy features. Pollen counts from
these samples are tabulated in Appendix H. Results from the more significant samples are described below.
Each 10- or 20-g subsample of soil was first placed in a 600 cc Nalgene beaker. For quantification purposes,
two tablets of Lycopodium sp. spores (each tablet contains 13,500 ± 400 spores) were then added to each
beaker, as recommended by Stockmarr (1971). Lycopodium sp. is a fern ally, and its spores are often used as
an exotic ‘marker’ in fossil pollen studies. By using an exotic marker, one is able to determine if the fossil
pollen or marker spores are being damaged by the various chemical reagents in each step of the extraction
procedure. An added advantage is that the number of tracer spores vs. fossil pollen can be then calculated to
determine a ratio between the two types. This ratio provides a fossil pollen concentration value for each
sample.
Fossil pollen concentration values are normally expressed as the number of fossil pollen grains found per
gram, or per cubic centimeter, of each sample. They provide an indication of the potential pollen preservation
for a sediment and reveal whether or not the resulting pollen data are representative of the original plant
assemblage. As noted by Bryant and Hall (1993:280), “pollen concentrations in soils collected from open
sites, or from rockshelter sediments, which do not contain at least 1,000 grains per g (dry weight of sample)…
generally characterize samples that have undergone severe pollen loss through post-depositional alteration.”
In other words, in most cases, pollen counts derived from a sample with a concentration value below 1,000
grains/g should not be trusted since such counts may constitute an inaccurate representation of past floral
contents.

228

The first step in processing soil samples was to add concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to each sample to
eliminate carbonates. Each sample was then sieved with distilled water through a 150µ mesh screen. This
procedure separates fossil pollen from the surrounding soil matrix. Silica, in the form of sand, was removed
using what is known as the ‘swirling method,’ which allows the heavier silica particles to settle quickly,
leaving the finer-grained particles and pollen in suspension (see Funkhouser and Evitt 1959). This liquid
portion was then poured off and concentrated by centrifugation.
After swirling, each sample was defloculated to break down the fine clays and silts. This was followed by
overnight immersion in 60 percent hydrofluoric acid to remove many of the remaining fine-grained silicates.
The samples were then rinsed with distilled water, centrifuged, decanted, and vortexed until all acidity was
neutralized. Then they were sonicated for 20 seconds to disaggregate any detritus from the fossil pollen
grains. Occasionally, sonication can be harmful to fossil pollen if done incorrectly. A Delta D-5 sonicator,
especially suitable for pollen analysis, was used.
After sonication, a 1 percent potassium-hydroxide solution was added to each sample to reduce excess
organic material other than pollen. The samples were then re-acidified using a 10 percent HCl solution to
prevent clumping. Each sample was again centrifuged, decanted, and vortexed, followed by an application of
zinc bromide (ZnBr2) with a specific gravity of 2.0. This heavy density-separation technique isolated any
remaining fine-grained silicates and inorganic traces. Pollen has a specific gravity of around 1.5 and thus will
rise to the top of the ZnBr2 solution where it can be removed from the unwanted heavier material (Funkhouser
and Evitt 1959).
Following the application of ZnBr2, each sample was rehydrated with glacial acetic acid, and the remaining
organic materials were removed using acetolysis (Erdtman 1960). Acetolysis includes an esterification
process that removes extraneous organic matter without injury to pollen. The remaining material in each
sample was washed, centrifuged, decanted, and vortexed, and placed in a 1-dram glass vial with glycerin as
the mounting media.
Microscope slides of each sample were prepared and counted. For statistical purposes, a minimum of 200
fossil pollen grains was counted for each sample, as recommended by Barkely (1934) and Godwin (1934).
Pollen was identified and counted using a Nikon Optiphot microscope at 400x and 1000x magnification.
Identification of pollen in this study was based upon comparisons with both pollen atlases and reference slides
in the modern pollen collection at Texas A&M University. During analysis, it was noted if the pollen grains
were whole or fragmentary. Pine pollen, for example, which has a body and two large external bladders,
frequently breaks, and its bladder often detaches during deposition. For this study, pollen from pine was
counted as one whole grain if it could be identified as such, had at least one-half or more of the grain still
visible, or if the body contained at least one bladder. Individual bladders were counted as one-half of a grain.
Pollen grains that could not be readily identified either as a result of breakage, degradation, or oxidation were
included in the count and assigned to an indeterminate category, as recommended by Cushing (1967). Pollen
grains that were whole and undamaged but not easily identifiable were included in the total pollen count as
unknowns. Pollen grain fragments smaller than one-half of the original grain were not counted.
Pollen in the family Asteraceae was divided into two categories: the sunflower type and the ragweed type.
Any Asteraceae pollen grains with spines less than or equal to 1.5µ were included in the ragweed category.
These grains are produced in very large numbers and most are easily dispersed by wind. The other
Asteraceae pollen type, which includes the sunflower types, has longer surface spines that are greater than
1.5µ in length. Most of the plants in this group produce the insect-pollinated type of pollen and thus are less
often recovered from fossil deposits than most other types of Asteraceae.

229

In 1963, Paul S. Martin was the first to propose the term ‘Cheno-Am’ for the combined groups of pollen in
the family Chenopodiaceae and the genus Amaranthus in the Amaranthaceae family (Martin 1963). Pollen
grains of both groups are nearly identical in appearance because both types are about the same size and both
are periporate (have many pores on the surface). These characteristics generally make them indistinguishable
to the genus level using a light microscope. The author followed this category recommendation for these
types. The author also divided the Cerealea (grains) pollen types into two groups. The first group includes
cereal plants brought from the Old World to the Americas after the onset of the age of exploration in 1492.
The second group includes maize, or corn. Unlike the other Cerealea types, maize is native to the New
World, and its pollen is considerably larger in size.
RESULTS
Soil samples analyzed were recovered from feature deposits located within the Project Area. Unless
otherwise indicated, each soil/pollen sample weighed 10 g. Although pollen analysis was possible for the
majority of the samples, any sample with a pollen concentration below 1,000 grains per gram of soil was not
included in these data because those samples probably would not reveal meaningful data. Pollen lot numbers
48, 50, 93, 492, 496, 500, 502, 504, 508, and 516 contained either too few or no pollen grains.
Throughout the following discussion, several references are made to ‘lots.’ Some refer to excavated
proveniences, or Pollen Lots, while others refer to residential lots. Each pollen sample has an assigned lot
number, as does each real estate lot. Real estate lots are located within numbered city blocks; when these lots
were combined, an arbitrary parcel number was used, such as 117-3, to refer to a block and series of lots.
When available, chronological date ranges based upon artifacts recovered from each feature were also
included in the following descriptions, with detailed data on features (Chapter 17), ceramics (Chapter 9), glass
(Chapter 10), metal (Chapter 11), and other materials (Chapter 12) presented elsewhere.
41HR812
Block 103, Feature 1048B: Pollen Lots 157, 163, 179, 183, 189, 191, and 193
Feature 1048B was a typical wooden barrel privy located on Block 103 in the northwest corner of Parcel 1031, in what appears to be Residential Lot 2 (Figure 15.1). Its vertical slats were bound on the exterior with
wooden bands fastened by small cut nails. Its volume was approximately 60 gallons (227 liters) (see Chapter
17). Seven soil samples from this feature were collected for pollen analysis. Dates for this feature, taken
from associated ceramics, glass bottles/tableware, and flat glass, extend from 1848-1880 (see Chapters 9, 10,
and 11). According to the location of the artifacts, mixing occurred in Levels 2, 3, 5, and 6.
The seven pollen lots analyzed from Feature 1048B yielded a total of 1,603 identified pollen grains, with an
average concentration value of 8,559 grains/g. Of these, 17.9 percent (n=287) of the identified fossil pollen
remains are derived from economic plant types, including cereal grains, cloves, mustards, maize, dewberries,
and grapes, with cereals and cloves the most frequent (see Appendix H, Table H.1). Figure 15.2 illustrates the
distribution of economic pollen types for all five privy features.
Block 103, Feature 1065: Pollen Lots 167, 169, 173, 175, and 177
The privy designated as Feature 1065 (Figure 15.3) was located on Residential Lot 8, in the area designated as
Block 103, slightly to the north of Parcel 103-3. A residence owned by Robert Brewster in 1847 was the first
known structure in this area. By 1860, this structure was no longer evident. The volume of the privy was
approximately 277 gallons (1,049 liters). Five pollen samples were taken from this feature at increments of
approximately 10 cm. Associated ceramics, bottle glass, and flat glass fragments date this feature from the
1840s to the 1870s. It appears that mixing occurred in Levels 6, 11, and 12.

231

In all, 1,333 pollen grains were identified in Feature 1065, with an average concentration value of 5,211
grains/g. Economic pollen types represent 6.5 percent (n=133) of the total identified fossil pollen, with pollen
grains from mustard plants and from cereal grains dominating the economic pollen assemblage. Other
economic types recovered include pollen grains from maize, grapes, and cloves (see Figure 15.2).
41HR816
Block 162, Feature 5014: Pollen Lots 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, and 93
Feature 5014 was encountered in the area designated as Block 162, just outside and southeast of Parcel 162-1.
This wood-lined privy with horizontal milled wood boards had an estimated volume of approximately 132
gallons (499 liters) (Figure 15.4). Six soil samples for pollen analysis were taken from this feature at
increments of approximately 10 cm. Pollen Lot 93 contained no 200-grain counts of pollen other than
Lycopodium, the marker pollen. Associated ceramics, glass bottle/tableware, and flat glass date this feature
from 1835 to1870 (see Chapters 9 and 10). Artifacts from Levels 3 and 4 could be cross-mended.

Figure 15.3. 41HR812, Feature 1065 (privy).

The five pollen lots from this feature yielded a total of 1,161 identified pollen grains, with an average
concentration value of 4,383 grains/g. Economic plant types are represented by 32 pollen grains (2.8
percent). Cereal grains predominate. Interestingly, this is the only feature within which the author found
some strawberry pollen. Other economic pollen types include mustards, maize, grape, dewberries, and cloves
(see Figure 15.2).
41HR820
Block 117, Feature 7001: Pollen Lots 500, 502, 504, 508, 510, and 516
Feature 7001 was a moderately sized, typical wooden barrel privy. It was located on Residential Lot 5, in the
southwestern corner of Parcel 117-4a. This parcel is located in the northeastern section of Block 117. The
barrel’s vertical slats were bound on the exterior with wooden bands fastened by small cut nails. The volume
of the privy was approximately 71 gallons (268 liters). Six pollen samples were collected at 10- and 20-cm

232

increments for analysis. Twenty grams of sediment from each lot were sampled and processed for pollen and
parasites. Cross mends of artifacts occurred in Levels 4 and 5.
The only pollen lot from this feature to yield significant pollen counts was Lot 510. In Pollen Lots 500, 502,
504, and 508, in Levels 1-4, respectively, negligible amounts of pollen grains were found. Similarly, Lot 516,
Level 6, revealed too few pollen grains to make an interpretation (see Appendix H).
Economic pollen types identified in Feature 7001 (n=17, or 7.8 percent) are the least diverse of any other
sample. Mustard and dewberry pollen were the most common types; cloves and maize were the only two
other economic plants identified (see Figure 15.2).

Figure 15.4. 41HR816, Feature 5014 (privy).

Block 117, Feature 7009: Pollen Lots 492, 496, 532, 538, 540, 544, 546, 548, and 562
Feature 7009, a privy made of horizontal milled boards of cypress wood, was found under a layer of shell fill.
It was located in the north central part of Parcel 117-6, on the west-central portion of Block 117. The volume
of the privy was approximately 530 gallons (2,007 liters) (see Chapter 17). Nine pollen samples were taken
from this feature at approximately 10-cm increments, with sufficient amounts of pollen available from all lots
except 492 and 496. Associated ceramics and glass bottle/tableware date this feature to between 1845 and
1858. Artifacts recovered from Levels 6, 7, 8, and 9 were cross-mended.
This feature yielded an average concentration value of 8,513 grains/g, with some 1,630 identified fossil pollen
grains. Economic pollen grains (n=85) represent 5.2 percent of the sample. Economic types, as revealed by
the presence of fossil pollen from this feature, listed in order of decreasing frequency include cereals, maize,
mustards, dewberry, and cloves (see Figure 15.2).

233

DISCUSSION
Table 15.1 presents family, genus, and common names for plants represented by pollen grains found in the
excavated privy features. Pollen data can provide useful information about the suspected diet of individuals
living in the downtown area of Houston during the late nineteenth century. However, not all pollen grains
found in privy deposits serve as a direct indication of diet, as discussed below.
Privy deposits have two distinct groups of pollen: economic and background pollen. Economic pollen
includes pollen from native plants and cultigens that pollen scientists (palynologists) believe or suspect
represent direct evidence that some part of the plant was ingested as part of the diet or taken as medicine.
These types of pollen are easily identified because they often come from insect-pollinated plants or known
cultigens. Pollen types such as those from plum and peach trees, strawberries, blackberries, yucca, cactus,
and mesquite are transported from flower to flower by insects. As noted above, these types of pollen grains
are rarely cast adrift into the atmosphere. When found in privy deposits, they usually signal that they
represent the direct intake of those foods as part of the diet. Nevertheless, some economic pollen types do
come from plants that release airborne pollen. Cereal plants, such as rye, wheat, barley, and maize, produce
wind-pollinated types of pollen found in privy deposits. Although some of those pollen grains may have
accidentally arrived on wind currents, it is assumed that most are a direct result of those cereal grains being
consumed as food. Therefore, when economic pollen types are present in privy deposits, they usually
represent the direct eating of those plants, or parts of those plants, as food.
Background pollen, on the other hand, does not reflect diet practices, since it represents atmospheric pollen,
which constantly settles to the ground and is part of the normal pollen rain. Any, or all, of the usual
background pollen types (i.e., wild grass, pine, oak, hackberry, ragweed, elm, juniper, and pecan, etc.) found
in human privy deposits could have arrived in these locations accidentally on wind currents or could have
been deposited as part of trash. Pollen found in privies can also have arrived via human feces, where they
became trapped as a result of an individual drinking pollen-laden water, or were accidentally inhaled, or they
could have settled on consumed foods.
Recovered economic pollen types include species from plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), various
imported types of cereals (Poaceae), cloves (Myrtaceae), dewberries (Rubus sp.), strawberries (Frageria sp.),
grapes (Vitis sp.), and maize (Zea mays). Some of the more prevalent noneconomic pollen types include pine
(Pinus sp.), wild grasses (Poaceae), sunflower-type composites (Asteraceae), ragweed-type composites
(Asteraeceae), myrtle (Myrica), oak (Quercus sp.), and Cheno-Am (Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthus). Several
types of pollen could not be identified definitively as representing economic types. For example, pollen from
an unknown genus in the carrot family (Apiaceae) was identified. That family of plants contains many genera
that are native to Texas and that also grow wild. The Apiaceae plant family also includes many domesticated
plant types, such as carrots, which produce pollen grains that are almost identical to some of the native Texas
pollen types. The same problem occurs with pollen from the rose family (Rosaceae). One of the important
economic genera in this family is Prunus. The genus Prunus includes many important domesticated fruits,
such as the plum, peach, and apricot. Nevertheless, there are also a number of wild plum species that are
native to Texas and produce pollen grains that are nearly identical to those of the domesticated varieties.
Economic Pollen Types
Grains(Cerealea)
Cereal grains are members of the grass family (Poaceae). Some of the more important types include sorghum
(Sorghum vulgare), millet (Pancum miliaceum), rye (Secale cereale), rice (Oryza sativa), barley, (Horedeum
sativum), oats (Avena sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), all of which currently grow in Texas. The
Spanish introduced barley, oats, and wheat into Texas during the seventeenth century, and sorghum was
introduced in the mid nineteenth century. Rice was introduced into Southeast Texas as early as 1853 and was
initially used to supplement other grains.

Milo is a strain of sorghum similar to millet that is early growing and typically drought resistant. In Texas,
millet is commonly called broomcorn millet; in North America, it is sometimes grown for human
consumption but is more often cultivated as animal forage (Gould 1975:450). Today, millet often grows as a
weed plant in disturbed soils. Rye, another grain grown in Harris County, is commonly used for “forage,
feed, planted for erosion control, fermented in the production of rye whiskey, and for making Dutch gin”
(Simpson and Orgorzaly 1995:177). It is also used to make bread.
Barley was grown in Texas by the first northern European settlers. It was used to make bread, since “mixed
oat and barley was a more reliable crop than an untested full-season corn crop that preferred high fertility”
(Stoskopf 1985:445). Indeed, barley and oats were the dominant crops in Texas from 1820 to 1870 (Stoskopf
1985:445). Barley is also used to brew beer and can be used in soup. Barley is rarely used for bread-making
today, since its “flour contains little or no gluten and will not make a light, porous bread” (Moore 1960:42).
Oats were first grown in the United States in 1602, and their production has increased ever since. Oats are
used in different ways by different cultural groups. The Scots, for example, still use oats as a cereal mainstay,
while in England, oats tend to be grown solely for livestock feed (Moore 1960:64). Today in Texas, oats are a
cool-season weed found on roadsides, field borders, vacant lots, and ditch banks.
As early as the 1830s, wheat was commercially grown in Texas. Acreage devoted to wheat cultivation
proliferated in North-Central and East Texas due to the expanding American frontier and to the introduction
of the Mediterranean strain of wheat after 1850 (Hartmann 1996). Wheat is most notably used to make flour,
which is, in turn, used to make bread and other baked goods.
Cereal pollen grains represent one-third to one-half of the total economic pollen types found in all privy
features, except Feature 7001, where no cereal pollen grains were found. It is difficult to compare this feature
with the other privy features, since only one sample (Pollen Lot 510) out of a total of five had any significant
amounts of fossil pollen. The presence of so many cereal pollen grains in the other privies suggests that flour
was a common staple at these sites, most likely associated with making bread for household consumption.
While it is possible that some of these cereals, such as barley and rice, were used in other ways, bread and
other baked goods no doubt were a dominant food item in Houston at the time. Contemporary cookbooks
substantiate this conclusion. As Root and de Rochemont (1976:136) note, one nineteenth-century cookbook
offered 134 recipes on how to make bread, while another “confined” the number to 124. Indeed, it seems to
be “impossible to look through old cookbooks without being struck by the quantity of dough which was being
crammed into the human system” (Root and de Rochemont 1976:136).
Maize
Maize is a cereal grain of the grass family (Poaceae); its pollen has the same general appearance as pollen
from other types of cereal discussed (i.e., a pollen grain that is morphologically smooth with one opening/pore
surrounded by a distinct ring). The primary difference between maize and the Old World cereals is that maize
pollen is much larger in size (100-150µ vs. 50-70µ).
Maize, a versatile plant, was fully used by some early settlers and was given the name ‘corn’ by early
Europeans for whom the term corn meant any type of cereal grain. Maize cobs were used as kindling for
fires, to replace wood for fuel, as torches, wicks in lamps, as corn shellers, mousehole and knothole plugs,
fishing corks, jug stoppers, as a substitute for baking powder, knife handles, pipes, and as “tubular toilet
tissue” (Hardenman 1981:171-174). Maize was also used to produce alcohol known as corn whiskey.
“Distilled corn liquor [was] the most universal medication of pioneer settlers [and] was used in so many
mixtures for so many illnesses as to defy description” (Hardenman 1981:177). Maize husks were also used:
“Shucks from the corn plant, when dry, had a resilient, cushiony, property which made them adaptable to a
wide range of [uses]” (Hardenman 1981:177).

236

Dietary uses of maize include corn meal for human consumption and grain for livestock feed. In East Texas
in the late nineteenth century, maize was the dominant grain crop. From 1866 to 1910, Texas produced an
average yield of 20.1 bushels of maize per acre (Bowman 1915:32).
Maize pollen was found in all of the privy features. It was lowest in Feature 1048B and highest in Feature
7009. The low levels of maize pollen in Features 1048B and 1065 are puzzling considering how frequently
maize and its products were being used in Houston during the mid to late 1800s. It may be that the owners of
these residential lots were not including maize in their diets. There are a variety of ways the small amount of
maize pollen in these features could have accumulated. Many Europeans did not use maize because it would
not grow in their native countries due to the short growing season or the inability of maize to grow in cooler
climates (Stoskopf 1985:352). Moreover, “the European prejudice against corn [maize] was so strong that the
Irish are said to have refused to eat it when dying of hunger after the decimation of the potato crop the 1840s”
(Simpson and Ozorgaly 1995:196). This bias was carried to America by Europeans, especially during the
nineteenth century, when the influx of European immigrants increased. In Feature 1048B, ethnic affiliations
were not noted in the documentary record (J. K. Wagner & Company, Inc. and Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. 1997:13). Ethnic affiliations in Feature 1065 can be made only with James Dumble, a native
of England, but maize pollen can be found in all of the features.
Dewberry, Grape, and Strawberry
Dewberries grow prolifically in the Houston area and are used to make jams, jellies, and pies. Tea can be
made from the leaves, baskets can be manufactured from the cane, and dyes can be obtained from the shoots
(Tveten and Tveten 1993:84).
Dewberry pollen was found in all features, except Feature 1065. Grape pollen was found in Features 1048B,
1065, and 5014, and probably represents plants grown in gardens. Strawberry pollen was found in only
Feature 5014, which is associated with the de Cordova residence. Grape, dewberry, and strawberry are all
insect-pollinated plants. The presence of these pollen types in the privy features more likely reflects diet
(such as jams, jellies, wine, juices, or eaten whole) than it does windborne pollen that accidentally fell into the
privies.
Mustard
Members of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) include rape, mustard (spice and table mustard), cabbage,
cauliflower, broccoli, turnips, rutabaga, and Virginia peppergrass. This family is insect pollinated, and pollen
types from this group are probably directly related to diet.
Brassicaceae pollen was found in all of the features. It was lowest in Feature 1048B and highest in Feature
1065. Vegetables in this family probably derived from cultivated garden plants in nineteenth-century
Houston, which may have been the source of these pollen grains.
Cloves
For centuries, cloves were a high-commodity trade good due to the monopoly on the spice trade from the Far
East. As shipping costs decreased, and as cloves became available from more than one place, their retail cost
subsequently decreased (North 1958:542). Regardless of price, however, cloves may have been purchased as
a necessary ingredient for some prepared foods. This was certainly the case with the Pennsylvania Dutch and
their purchase of saffron. The “market value of saffron was irrelevant; [they] got into the habit of using it”
(Root and de Rochemont 1976:216). While the Pennsylvania Dutch eventually grew saffron, the same is not
true for cloves.
The floret (flower) portion of the clove is the main plant part used as a spice. Cloves have many uses,
including their use as a spice, either whole or ground. Clove oil was also used as a breath freshener and as a

237

topical treatment to reduce toothache. In the nineteenth century, cloves were used as an additive to foods,
such as ham, or were sometimes baked in breads (Norman 1990:40).
Pollen from a genus in the Myteraceae family, which the author believes to be clove (Syzygium), based upon
the pollen’s morphological features, was found in varying amounts in all of the privies. It was the most
abundant in Feature 1048B, the privy associated with the Stansfield residence that was built in approximately
1856 (see Chapter 8). Cloves were expensive to purchase but were probably especially important for specific
occasions or during special times of the year (i.e., clove powder on applesauce was frequently an important
part of Halloween parties and Thanksgiving dinners or harvest celebrations). One popular Victorian-period
game began with many cloves stuck in an orange or apple, with a group of boys and girls forming a circle.
The clove-covered fruit would be passed around with each person removing one clove. The last person to
remove a clove gained permission to kiss any member of the opposite sex in the circle (Bombaugh 1876).
The popular use of cloves as spices or for games might explain the relative differences in the amounts of
clove pollen found in all of the privy features.
There is no clear association between possible ethnicity and food types represented by economic pollen in the
excavated privy features. For example, at one time, Jacob de Cordova, a prominent businessman with Jewish
heritage, owned the property in Parcel 162-1 together with its privy (Feature 5014). The percentages and/or
types of pollen found in this feature do not, however, substantially differ from pollen contents of other
features. At the very least, the Cordova privy did contain all of the economic pollen types found in the Project
Area, suggesting an economic status that allowed him to buy more or a possibly greater variety of foods than
his neighbors.
Noneconomic Pollen Types
Noneconomic pollen can aid in interpreting a particular environment at a particular time and/or place.
Percentages of noneconomic pollen analyzed for this study reflect some aspects about the suspected plant
associations in the Houston region during the 1800s.
Pine
Pine trees (Pinus sp.) produce wind-dispersed pollen and are among some of the most prolific pollen
producers of any plants. Because of the abundant production of pine pollen, however, high percentages do
not always correlate to a high percentage of pine trees in the environment at a specific time (cf. Davis 1963;
Janssen 1966; Mack and Bryant 1974). As Davis (1963:849) points out, “the total number of pollen grains
contributed by the entire vegetation will vary in proportion to the relative abundances of species of higher or
lower pollen productivity.” Although other factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, velocity, and relative
humidity, may affect pollen dispersion, general correlations between the distance from the source plant to the
deposited pollen have been established. For pine and many other wind-dispersed pollen types, an inverse
relationship exists between the distance that the pollen travels and the amount of pollen found (Janssen
1966:805).
Pine pollen is found in all of the privy samples. However, the highest percentage is only around 50 percent,
suggesting that much of that pollen may have accumulated when the privies were constructed or at times
when they were open. The author estimates that the closest pine tree may have been as distant as 3 miles (5
km), perhaps growing in some wooded region or a park. Had there been pine trees growing nearer, the author
suspects the percentages of pine pollen in these privy deposits would be greater than the maximum of 50
percent.
Oak
Oak (Quercus sp.) trees are common in East Texas and produces fairly large amounts of airborne pollen
(although not nearly as much as pine). Oak pollen was found in all of the excavated privy features in amounts
ranging from 3 to 5 percent. These percentages correlate well with the suspected urban vegetation at the time

238

of occupation. Yards probably had some oak trees to serve as shade. Those suspected trees, however, were
not plentiful. Had the whole urban area been covered with oak trees, more oak pollen would be present in the
privy samples (Marshall 1998).
Grasses
Grasses are wind pollinated; as such, their pollen is usually found in the atmosphere in areas where it is
growing (Moore et al. 1991:5). As expected, grass pollen was consistently found in all privy samples. Unlike
pine and oak, which are generally over represented in pollen analyses, percentages of grass pollen often
indicate the proximity of grass being grown. Unlike both pine and oak pollen, grass pollen rapidly sinks to
the surface once it is released from anthers. On average, approximately 15 percent grass pollen was found in
all the privy features. Most of these pollen grains likely came from grass growing in yards, and much of it
could have been inadvertently carried into the privy buildings on shoes or clothing. Once inside the privy, the
grass pollen could have been dislodged and finally deposited in the privy proper.
Weeds
Most of the remaining noneconomic pollen types come from herbaceous plants and weeds, with the exception
of myrtle. While many of these other pollen types may be classified as having derived from various types of
weeds, some pollen types, such as those from the sunflower group, may represent the pollen of garden (e.g.,
marigolds and zinnias) and ornamental plants. In urban regions and home gardens, disturbed soils are usually
indicated in fossil pollen records by a prevalence of pollen from weedy plants.
Possible Economics
As noted earlier, two pollen types cannot be definitively identified as economic types because they come from
two plant families that contain genera that can be either economic cultigens or noneconomic weedy varieties.
These two types are discussed below.
Carrot Family
Members of this family include economic plants such as parsley, carrot, and celery. Apiaceae also includes
poison hemlock, as well as ornamentals, such as blue lace flower and sea holly. Most of these plants are
insect pollinated. It is, therefor, likely that these carrot-family pollen remains from the privy features
represent consumed foods rather than pollen from wild plants.
Plums, Cherries, and Peaches
Within the Rosaceae family, the genus Prunus includes ornamentals, such as the flowering cherry, as well as
economics, such as peaches, plums, and apricots. Since these plants are insect pollinated, it is more likely that
this pollen in the privy samples represent foods that were consumed by inhabitants of the Project Area.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In summary, pollen grains recovered from the five privy features excavated during the Ball Park at Union
Station archeological project provide some insight into the world of nineteenth-century Houston. Bread and
baked goods were likely important foods. Maize, on the other hand, although a common cereal in Texas at
this time, may still have been used by some in nondietary ways only. Dewberries and grapes were eaten,
likely in the form of jellies and jams, while strawberries were perhaps slightly more expensive and thus not
available to everyone. Nineteenth-century Houstonians grew vegetables in their gardens, and some may have
owned houses that were fronted with lawns and shaded by oak and pine trees.
Previous pollen studies of privy samples and other forms of human fecal remains show that it is possible to
determine the health and diet, and sometimes even the cultural affinity and economic status, of
individuals/groups. For example, studies by Gish (1993) of privy remains from the Gold Road Mine site in
Arizona show a pattern of food use centered around Native American maize and a wide variety of
noncultivated native foods (i.e., agave and cacti) that would have been locally available. Other privy studies

239

reveal a pattern of dietary use that includes many plants ranging from European cereals to locally grown
maize and watermelons.
In conclusion, while analysis of the Ball Park pollen remains yielded few substantial insights regarding
cultural affinity or social status, it has provided a unique source of information regarding the possible lifeways
and food habits of some nineteenth-century Houstonians.

DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
David H. Jurney

During excavations at the Ball Park at Union Station, several architectural timbers were collected for
dendrochronological assessment on the advice of Mr. Mark Denton, Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission. Over 15 long boards and board fragments, as well as 12 shorter boards, were recovered below
an early nineteenth-century mortared brick house foundation (Feature 7005). A brick pier was recovered
intact, with the underlying boards in place. A large wooden box, probably originally an ice box and reused as
a privy pit, was also salvaged. All boards were wrapped in plastic upon excavation (the privy box was left
exposed). Timbers were sent to the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University, College
Station, where they were examined.
This chapter presents results of a dendrochronological analysis of a select number of the recovered boards.
Tree-ring samples were taken from the ends of six long boards and the ends of five short boards associated
with the foundation. Samples were also taken from two exposed ends of boards from the privy/ice box.
The discussion begins with an overview of the development of dendrochronology, or the dating of past events
through the study of tree-ring growth. This is followed by analyses and descriptions of each of the specimens
from the site. The results of the study are summarized in the contexts of dendrochronology and the early
logging history of Houston.
DENDROCHRONOLOGY
Technique and History of Development
Dendrochronology is the study of the chronological sequence of annual growth rings in trees (Douglass 1934,
1935, 1941; Ferguson 1970a; Fritts and Shatz 1975; Stokes and Smiley 1968). It is a scientific dating tool
that uses tree-ring counts, physiology, and sequencing to determine the exact year a tree was felled or killed
by a natural event.
Each year (growing season), a tree adds a layer of wood known as a growth ring to its trunk and branches.
This ring, which can be visualized as a living cone, covers the entire tree and consists of two parts: lightcolored early wood, formed in the early growing season (spring), and dark-colored late wood, formed during
the summer. It is the contrast between these parts that makes counting successive rings possible using optical
methods. Growth is halted for most tree species during the fall and winter.
If a tree temporarily suffers from climatic stress or disease, it may not produce a ring for one or more growing
seasons. Similarly, some tree species may produce double rings (two or more per year) as a response to
environmental stress. Pine, bald cypress, and red cedar sometimes exhibit such patterns. While problems
such as these can be occasionally resolved through cross-dating of ring-width patterns, generally only those
tree species that add a single ring per year are suitable for dating purposes.
Andrew Ellicott Douglass, an astronomer at the University of Arizona in the early decades of this century, is
known as the father of dendrochronology, since it was he who developed the science in the modern sense. At
the time, Douglass was researching sunspot cycles, and since trees respond well to solar input, he sought

241

archeological specimens from his colleagues at the university. They cooperated because they needed a more
accurate dating technique and had plenty of archeological wood. Douglass’ method consisted of matching
shorthand sketches (i.e., skeleton plots) of wide and narrow growth rings from local archeological sites.
As a result of Douglass’ ground-breaking work, tree-ring dating has been applied successfully to the late
historic-period in eastern North America and to the prehistoric period in the Southwest (Estes 1969, 1970;
Hawley 1941; Robbins 1921). Indeed, Dean’s (1969) work at the Navajo National Monument prehistoric
ruins in Arizona is probably the best example of a thoroughly dated architectural/archeological site in the
southwestern United States.
Tree-ring dating has also been employed to calibrate the radiocarbon time scale (Ferguson 1970b). This
resulted in a dramatic reorganization of European cultural history and considerable reevaluation of
radiocarbon dates in North America. Further, dendrochronology is the most accurate dating method available
to geochronology (Smiley 1955; Stahle 1978a, 1978b), since it allows the dating of geomorphic and tectonic
processes (Jacoby et al. 1988; LaMarche 1970).
Tree-ring chronologies are also proving to be particularly useful in the reconstruction of past precipitation
(Duvick and Blasing 1981), temperature (Hughes et al. 1984; Jacoby and D’Arrigo 1989), and streamflow
(Cleaveland 1989; Cleaveland and Stahle 1989; Cook and Jacoby 1983; Stahle et al. 1998; Stockton 1975).
Indeed, within the last 30 years, important advances have been made in the reconstruction of paleoclimate
based upon long tree-ring records (Cook et al. 1994; Fritts 1965, 1971, 1976; Stahle and Hehr 1984).
High-quality tree-ring chronologies now exist for much of the eastern United States, many of which extend
well into the seventeenth century (Dewitt and Ames 1978; Stahle 1979; Stahle et al. 1998) and some of which
extend to the third century A.D. (Stahle et al. 1988). These chronologies have been substantially augmented
by a Southern Plains and South Central United States regional network of 47 tree-ring chronologies (34 post
oak, five shortleaf pine, four bald cypress, three white oak, and one overcup oak), produced by David Stahle
of the University of Arkansas (Stahle 1990; Stahle, Cook et al. 1985). As noted below, this network has been
recently expanded in Texas.
Dendrochronology in Texas
In Texas, post oak (Quercus stellata), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), white oak (Q. alba), hickory and pecan
(Carya spp.), ash (Fraxinus sp.), pine (Pinus sp.), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), and bald cypress
(Taxodium distictum) are potentially datable. In fact, post oak and white oak trees, which can sometimes live
up to 300 years, produce well-defined annual growth rings that can be dated to the exact year of their
formation (Duvick and Blasing 1981; Stahle and Hehr 1984).
In Texas, an additional 13 living chronologies have been collected, and more than 50 post oak and white oak
chronologies are now available for the Southern Plains region (Stahle 1990:2; Stahle, Hehr et al. 1985). An
east-west transect through the Big Thicket of Southeast Texas has produced an additional 104 chronologies,
consisting of 16 species collected at 38 geographic sites (Cook et al. 1998). More specifically, a longleaf pine
chronology from Hemphill in Sabine County, collected by the University of Arizona in 1974, has been
statistically detrended and indexed for use on cultural resources management projects in East Texas (Jurney
1986b).
A large matrix of tree-ring samples has also been obtained from over 60 historic buildings, structures, and
artifacts in the state (Jurney 1984, 1986a, 1986b, 1987b, 1987c, 1987d, 1987e, 1988a, 1988b, 1988c, 1988d,
1992, 1993; Therrell 2000). Relative dates have been obtained for buildings made of red cedar and pine
lumber. Indeed, the wealth of potential climatic evidence, as well as chronological information on historic
buildings, has been greatly augmented in at least 26 Texas counties (Bell, Bexar, Brazos, Camp, Collin,

242

Coryell, Dallas, Delta, Ellis, Freestone, Gonzales, Grimes, Hopkins, Lamb, Leon, Limestone, Milam,
Navarro, Panola, Rusk, Sabine, Tarrant, Titus, Travis, Wood, and Williamson).
PROCEDURE AND DEFINITIONS
Dendrochronological specimens are collected with a view towards extracting a radial segment of the tree from
pith to bark. Increment borers, hollow corers, and saws are all used to take specimens, which are usually in
the form of small dowel cores or cross sections. Once the specimen is stabilized to prevent breakage or
shrinkage of old wood, it is sanded with progressively finer grits of sandpaper (60x to 600x). This process
produces a highly polished surface that allows the cellular structure of each ring to be examined under
magnification (10x to 100x). In order to examine tight clusters of rings, or eroded, rotten, or otherwise poorly
sanded areas, a new razor blade may be used to surface the problem areas.
Dendrochronology is based upon the technique of cross dating (Douglass 1934, 1935, 1941; Stokes and
Smiley 1968) whereby ring-width patterns are compared. These comparisons can be made either within a
single tree, between trees from a single provenience or between proveniences, between species, within age
classes of a single species, or between major geographical areas (Stahle 1978a:15).
The ‘skeleton plot,’ developed by Douglass (1934), is the basic method used for tree-ring dating. It is simply
a strip of graph paper (five squares per centimeter) that illustrates the relative ring-width patterns of trees.
Each vertical line on the paper corresponds to one ring on each specimen. Narrow and very wide rings are
marked in their correct sequence, with the vertical scale corresponding to the relative width of each ring in
comparison to its nearest neighbors. When such plots have been drawn for a number of specimens, the
patterns can be compared. If narrow and wide rings match in most patterns (i.e., cross date), a ‘composite
skeleton plot’ is drawn. It depicts the average ring-width patterns of the cross-dated specimens and
emphasizes similarities among trees responding to the same environmental factors (Stahle 1978a:16-17).
When a group of cross-dated specimens do not overlap or otherwise match a master or modern chronology, it
is called a ‘floating (or relative) chronology.’ The ‘modern chronology’ is a series of dated tree rings
showing relative ring-width patterns that have been derived from a group of living trees growing under
similar environmental conditions. Preferably, two opposite core samples per tree are extracted. The actual
year of each ring in the chronology is determined by counting and cross-dating backwards from the outermost
ring, the known date of extraction (Stahle 1978a:16). The modern chronology serves as the initial master
against which historic timbers can be dated.
Floating chronologies compiled from extant buildings or buried charcoal are known as historic and
archeological chronologies, respectively. Often, single radii from near the top of the tree, base, or any other
portion are all that can be collected from historic lumber. Cross-dating must be rigorous and often is more
difficult in historic wood than in living trees with known dates of extraction. Also, when dealing with historic
or archeological wood, all possible matches of all specimens must be considered to ensure accurate dating.
Historical and archeological chronologies receive absolute dates when they overlap in time and match the
ring-width patterns in the earlier portion of a dated master chronology from the same region (Stahle 1978a:1718). An overlap of 50 or more years is essential to establish accurate cross dates. If this overlap does not
exist, or if the historic and archeological chronologies do not cross-date, the master must be sufficiently
extended, or a new and closer master chronology must be compiled. When composite and component
specimens are dated, the decades, inner dates, and outer dates are marked on each specimen (see Stokes and
Smiley 1968). The historic and archeological chronologies then serve to extend the master regional
chronologies backward into time.

243

Once cross dates are established between a group of specimens and a master chronology, a wide range of
techniques are available to study the climatic information encoded in tree-ring growth. Measurements can be
made of all ring widths, and computer programs can be used to analyze the annular variation. ‘Sensitivity’
refers to a tree-ring series (assemblage of trees) that displays great variation in ring width from year to year
(Ferguson 1970a:183-200; Stahle 1978a:16). If there is little or no appreciable variation from year to year, a
tree-ring series is termed ‘complacent.’ Dating within such a series is difficult, requiring a much longer series
and temporal overlap. A ‘signature’ pattern describes wide and narrow rings in a sensitive series that crossdates among many trees in a site or region.
When collecting tree-ring samples from an historic or archeological wooden building, all surfaces of key
architectural elements must first be examined, and the selected specimen must be oriented as if it were in the
original tree. To adequately date the cutting of historical or archeological wood, it is crucial to identify the
radial position of the ring and to note if bark or indications of the outer surface of the tree are present.
Specimens can produce ‘cutting dates’ if the bark is present or if the outermost rings under the bark are
present. These dates are significant, since they record the final season and year of growth (Bannister 1962;
Dean 1969; Stahle 1978a). Clusters of dates may provide the most confident evidence of the
cutting/construction date when dealing with charcoal only, or with samples where bark is not present or from
which sapwood has been trimmed.
Since most historic log buildings were constructed with recently cut wood, or green wood, cutting dates
reflect the actual year of construction, with few exceptions (Hutslar 1972:65). Certain variables, such as
seasoning and stockpiling, may be indicated by clusters of cutting dates (Stahle 1978a:17-18). Moreover, due
to the taper of trees and the intersection of this taper during the sawing process, hewn or sawn dimension
lumber in frame buildings can also produce cutting dates.
A single tree may produce several beams or boards at a sawmill, thus increasing the chances of duplication.
Also, sawmills often mix several stands of trees, and when commercially sold, such lumber can be extremely
difficult to cross-date. In the case of local sawmills, or lot purchase of lumber, however, dates may still be
obtained. In addition to key architectural elements, dendrochronological dates may be obtained from piers,
shingles, repair or replacement timbers, and other ancillary structural elements.
METHODOLOGY
The author did not participate in the field investigation at the Ball Park site. Usually, field investigation is
essential to establish the potential for dating, selection of specimens suitable for dating, or selection of
specimens crucial to the architectural sequence. To ensure there was enough wood for dating, the excavators
removed all wood samples from the layer of boards underlying the foundation pier(s) of the house (Feature
7005).
All specimens were stored at the Conservation Research Laboratory. The author opened all containers and
examined all board surfaces and exposed ends. Only those specimens deemed potentially suitable for dating
(i.e., numerous rings, presence of bark or outside surface, or architecturally relevant) were selected for
sampling. Board ends were sampled using a table saw and skill saw. Each plastic-wrapped specimen was
saturated and then allowed to air dry before it could be further processed.
Thirteen samples were collected for dendrochronological analysis (Table 16.1). They were numbered
according to a sequence that reflected their association at the Conservation Laboratory. Three specimens (C1, C-2, C-3) were small sections taken in conjunction with the brick pier of the house (Feature 7005). Eight
specimens (H-4, H-7, H-8, H-10c, H-11a, H-11c, and H-12) were from the boards underlying the house
foundation. Five of these were short pieces, the remainder were longer original boards. Two specimens (B-1,
B-2) were collected from the privy/ice box (Feature 7009).

244

Transverse sections were cut from the ends of the boards. These were air dried, and then all were stabilized
using Elmer’s Glue-All. This adhesive was used to support the specimens while they were sanded. Six
specimens (B-1, C-1, C-2, H-10c, H-11a, and H-11c) were intact enough and contained a sufficient number of
rings to merit additional work. Each was sanded (980-400x) and examined with a binocular microscope.
Individual skeleton plots were drawn for each of the six specimens.

The ends of these boards were trimmed for tight fitting in the mortices of the end boards. The author could sample only two specimens
at a mortice corner overlap due to the angle of repose and the presence of broken machine-cut nails. The box may have been painted
with a reddish brown material.

RESULTS
The specimens exhibit growth variability, indicating that the living trees were responding to climatic or
environmental fluctuations. No specimens cross-date among themselves or against the regional chronologies
from Peachtree Bottoms near Beaumont (bald cypress), Big Slough near Shreveport (bald cypress), or Pine
Park near Hemphill (longleaf pine).
Table 16.1 lists the specimens and identifies the status of each at the time of sampling. Attributes include the
specimen number, the tree species, sawing attributes (size in inches and saw or froe marks), the preservation

245

or condition, and recommended specimens that could be useful to conserve. The English system of
measurement is used, since the boards were made and used in an architectural context according to this
system. Conservation was not part of this study and is not recommended for all specimens. If only those
specimens listed (C-1, C-2, C-3, H-8, H-10c, and H-11c) are preserved, this should provide useful exhibit
material.
The long boards exhibited vertical saw marks on all surfaces. These saw marks terminated about an inch (2.5
cm) from the end of the board, where apparently it was torn from the log during the sawing process. This
may indicate that the boards were handsawn in a pit, rather than using a steam or animal-powered sash or
band saw. A mechanized sash saw would have cleanly sawn through the log. The short boards were all
refinished by hand, using a froe.
DISCUSSION
Foundation Boards
The technological information exhibited on the surface of the lumber indicates that the foundation boards
were roughly sawn by hand in a vertical saw pit. Based upon historical data for the introduction of machinedriven pit saws or circular saws, it is likely that these boards were cut prior to the 1840s. The lumber was pit
sawn from immature and juvenile pine (longleaf) trees and large, old-growth bald cypress trees.
These boards were used as weight-dispersal mechanisms to minimize any sinking of the foundation.
Generally, they exhibit signs of fungal rot, termite infestation, and borer penetration, a result of the feature’s
depositional context. Additional invasion by fungus and differential drying has continued despite precautions
taken after excavation. Some of the specimens have deteriorated more than others.
Privy/Ice Box Boards
The privy/ice box is well made; the boards were hand trimmed to provide a tight, unforgiving fit. The box
was planed after sawing, thus removing any technological data.
The bald cypress tree-ring growth exhibited on the boards from the box did not resemble that of the bald
cypress boards from the house foundation. This may suggest a remote source for the box’s construction. It is
inferred that the long bald cypress and longleaf pine boards were cut from trees in the Houston vicinity.
General Observations
Architectural features sampled for dendrochronological dating are part of a complex history of activities
across the Ball Park Project Area. The evidence suggests that the features date to prior to the commerciallumbering industry. While no bald cypress or longleaf pine specimens cross-date either among themselves or
with established regional chronologies, several exhibit numerous rings and growth variability. These
specimens thus may be dateable in the future if additional archeological specimens are recovered or new local
chronologies are established.

PART V
THE FEATURES

17
FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS
Richard Mahoney

During the Ball Park at Union Station Archeological Project, 215 features were exposed. Of the 103 tested
features, 80 were fully excavated (mitigated). Many features were repetitive and thus did not provide
additional information.
This chapter highlights the various structural feature types encountered during the investigation and includes
brick house foundations, postholes, brick piers, cisterns and cistern gutters, wells, privies, refuse deposits,
trash pits, and landscape (garden) features. The features are ordered by structural type and block location.
The English system of measurement is used (with metric measurements in parentheses), since the structures
were made and used according to this system.
BRICK FOUNDATIONS
Block 117
Feature 7005 represents the partially destroyed remnant of a brick structural foundation (Figure 17.1). It was
encountered in the extreme northeastern corner of Parcel 117-6 (41HR820). The surface expression of this
feature, found at 45.5 ft (14 m) above mean sea level (amsl), consisted of an alignment of lain mortared bricks
that formed a discontinuous rectangular shape. Interior dimensions of this alignment measured approximately
38 ft long x 18 ft. wide (13 x 6 m). The long axis of the structure was oriented east-west.
The ‘spreader-type’ foundation had an upward stepped construction underlain with cut timbers. Railroad-era
construction partially destroyed the northern portions of the foundation’s east and west walls; only the basal
planking remained intact. Each step in the brick patterning measured approximately 2 in (5 cm) in height.
For excavation purposes, the courses of lain brick were numbered 1 through 5, with Course 1 being the lowest
level. Excluding the destroyed northern portions, Courses 1 through 4 were generally extant throughout the
structure. Course 5 was encountered only along part of the southern wall, immediately east of the
southwestern corner of the foundation (Figure 17.2).
Across the central portion of Block 117, the original ground surface is estimated to have been 45.5 ft amsl (14
m), the average elevation of the remaining portions of the foundation. Specifically, the southeastern corner of
the foundation exhibited this elevation atop brick Course 4. In short, Course 4 was probably the final
subsurface course of bricks.
That Course 5 was encountered only along the southern wall adjacent to an associated well, Feature 7024, is
due to localized subsidence, specifically attributed to water seepage from the well. It is presumed that the
well predates construction of the foundation, since a horizontal notch carved into the well brick allows for
continuation of the foundation basal planking. The foundation experienced subsidence subsequent to the
alteration, as evidenced by later repair efforts. Apparently to abate further foundation subsidence, a layer of
plaster was added to the exterior of the impacted portion of the well and underneath portions of the adjacent
basal planking. In addition, dense plastic clay was used as backfill to aid in the abatement of water seepage
under the house foundation.

247

248

Figure 17.2. Plan of Features 7005, 7015, 7024, and 7045.

Portions of Course 5 revealed mortar on the superior surface, suggesting that at least one more course of
bricks were lain on top. Course 5 consisted of two rows of brick oriented lengthwise, separated by a single
interior row oriented perpendicularly. The interior row and perpendicular row exhibited mortar on their
superior surface, but the exterior row lacked evidence of mortar.
The spreader-type house foundation was underlain by an approximately 35-in (90 cm) wide rough-hewn
timber planking base (Figure 17.3). Individual planks averaged 2.5 in (6 cm) thick, 12 in (30 cm) wide, and
16 ft (5 m) long. Shorter (ca. 35 in [90 cm]) cross planks, spaced at approximately 31.5-in (80 cm) intervals,
were placed underneath these planks. The short cross planks presumably served as leveling devices for the
original construction of the foundation planking base. Between 0.5 and 1 in (1-3 cm) of coarse-grained pure
sand underlay all of the planking.
A single course of lain brick extended inward along the interior portion of the eastern wall of the foundation
(Figure 17.4). Apparently disturbed by railroad-era construction, this pad, which was broken in places,
continued to at least 14 ft (4 m) along the wall. Although the extant width of the pad measured approximately
6 ft (2 m), its northern portion may have been destroyed along with the northern foundation portions. The pad
was underlain with approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) of coarse-grained pure sand. The superior portions of some
of the bricks exhibited mortar, suggesting at least one more course of brick was originally lain on top.

When the foundation was discovered during the survey phase of the project, the interior ground surface
displayed a relatively homogenous layer of reddish yellow clay. Over the next two months, prior to the start
of excavations, the ground surface suffered numerous rain showers, further scraping to define the feature
boundaries, and constant crew activity. Combined, these actions effectively removed and/or disturbed the
upper stratum. As a result, it cannot be stated whether a layer of clay had been laid for an interior floor
surface. It is likely, however, since the original elevation of foundation brick Course 5 suggests that the
structure once supported a wooden floor anchored to the frame with floor joists.

251

In all, 14 units were excavated to investigate foundation construction. Eight excavation units focused upon
the interior and exterior wall construction; three units focused upon the interior brick pad; two units were
placed within the interior floor of the foundation; and one unit revealed a cross section of the western
foundation wall. In excavation units where there existed a builder’s trench, it was separately excavated. All
units were excavated into the sterile clay substrate.
POSTHOLES
Block 117
Due to their locations relative to each other and the brick foundation (Feature 7005), postholes recorded on
Block 117 provide a vague chronology of the use of the lot. Through superposition of the types of postholes,
brick piers, and the house foundation, a relative chronology was established that answered numerous
questions about the order of construction of the different structures within this area.
The clay-filled postholes found on Block 117 (Features 7042, 7043, 7048, and 7049) probably predate the
construction of Feature 7005. The absence of brick fill in these postholes, especially Feature 7049, may be an
indication that they were dug early in the site’s history.
In contrast, the brick-filled postholes (Features 7012, 7014, 7046, and 7047) are probably either
contemporaneous with, or postdate, the house, since the bricks in this fill were similar to those of the house
foundation (Feature 7005). This suggests that the fill from these postholes is either construction remnants
(contemporaneous) or demolition remnants (post date).
Feature 7005 is disturbed by a brick-filled posthole (Feature 7047) along its west wall. The damage to the
brick and underlying board of the foundation indicates that the hole was excavated after the foundation’s
construction. That the fill bricks of the postholes are similar to those of the house foundation is further
evidence to support their later date. Additionally, three brick-filled postholes (Features 7053, 7054, and
7055) were located within the northern portion of the interior of Feature 7005. Their location close to the
house foundation makes it unlikely that they are contemporaneous with the foundation itself; a later, postdemolition aspect seems more probable.
BRICK PIERS
Block 117
Two brick piers (Features 7010 and 7016) were located west of Feature 7005 and possibly postdate its
construction. Each of the piers had a single course of lain brick on top of approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) of
coarse-grained construction sand. Both had mortar on top of the extant courses, suggesting at least one more
course of brick was lain. Each pier consisted of six fragmented bricks arranged in a rectangular shape,
measuring approximately 14 x 18 in (35 x 45 cm), with the long axes oriented north-south.
The piers were constructed of a higher grade brick than Feature 7005, suggesting later construction. Further,
Feature 7010 intruded upon Feature 7046 (brick-filled posthole). As noted above, the series of brick-filled
postholes on Block 117 have been proven to be of more recent age than the house foundation; therefore, the
brick piers must postdate the brick-filled postholes as well as the house foundation.
Various postholes and brick piers were found within each block investigated during the course of this project.
However, none lent themselves to as much interpretation as did the series of postholes and brick piers
encountered on Block 117.

252

Block 118
Excavations at Block 118 revealed three brick features. Feature 2007 was identified as a two-course brick
pier. Feature 2008 was a three-course brick pier, and Feature 2009 was identified as a seven-course portion of
a brick foundation wall.
Block 162
Investigation of Block 162 revealed two linear alignments of brick piers within the southern portion of Parcel
162-1. Both alignments were close to the southern portion of the pre-1870s location of the de Cordova house
(see Chapter 18). The southern alignment consisted of six brick piers (Features 5002, 5003, 5005, 5007,
5008, and 5009) oriented east-west. The linear arrangement was approximately 50 ft (15 m) long, with
intervals averaging 15 ft (4.5 m). Although the piers varied in their respective degrees of disturbance,
generally this alignment exhibited far less disturbance than did the northern grouping.
Piers along the southern alignment were originally constructed of 45 bricks each, forming four stepped
courses. Individual bricks averaged 9 in (22 cm) in length and were approximately 4 in (10 cm) wide and 2.5
in (6 cm) thick. Mortar adhering the bricks to one another was approximately 0.5 in (1 cm) thick.
The northern alignment consisted of three brick piers (Features 5004, 5006, and 5019) oriented east-west.
The linear arrangement was approximately 29.5 in (9 m) long, with intervals averaging 13 ft (4 m). All piers
exhibited a heavy degree of disturbance.
The northern aligned piers generally exhibited only a single course of brick underlain with approximately 0.5
in (1 cm) of coarse-grained sand. Due to disturbance of the piers, it is difficult to determine the original
orientation of the individual bricks. Remnants of each pier consisted of approximately four fragmented bricks
displaced from their original position. Mortar was evident on the top surfaces of the remaining bricks,
suggesting that at least one more course had been laid on top.
Block 206
Block 206 revealed over 20 brick piers of varied construction and degrees of disturbance. None of the piers
from either this block or Block 118 above was associated with pre-1870s structures.
CISTERNS
During the course of the investigation, 13 cisterns were discovered, seven of which were excavated. The
diversity of cistern volumes indicates a disparity of use. While the majority of these facilities averaged
volumes of 1,976 gallons (7,655 liters), those located at the corner of extant blocks averaged a much higher
capacity, suggesting a separate function. Due to their easily accessible location, it is likely that these latter
cisterns were communal and were used as fire hydrants prior to the availability of public water utilities. This
difference is expressed by the two examples discussed below.
Feature 1001
Feature 1001 was encountered within the central portion of Parcel 103-3 (41HR812), close to a pre-1870s
house location. No archeological remains of the structure were revealed during excavations. Feature 1001
was a typical brick-lined cistern encased in mortar. The uppermost expression of the feature was encountered
at 44 ft (13.5 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of a circular alignment of lain mortared brick
discovered within Testing Area 1005. As determined during the investigation of Block 117, approximately 012 in (0-30 cm) of subsurface disturbance occurred in the area as a result of railroad development. Using 45.5
ft (14 m) amsl as a baseline for the original ground surface across the entire Project Area, approximately 18 in
(45 cm) of the upper portion of this cistern was destroyed during railroad-era construction.

253

As the total depth of all of these cisterns proved impractical to manually excavate, Feature 1001 was
ultimately bisected by a trackhoe to reveal its depth and morphology. Cistern walls were constructed of a
single row of horizontally lain brick. An intact, flat-bottomed floor was located and was constructed of
similarly oriented brick. The interior diameter of the cistern was approximately 75 in (190 cm), and with a
surmised depth of approximately 106 in (270 cm), its original volume would have been about 1,976 gallons
(7,655 liters). Due to its interior location within the block, combined with volume capacity, this cistern is
considered to have been a personal-use structure.
Feature 4002
Feature 4002 was found in the southwestern portion of Parcel 103-3 (41HR812). It was a typical brick-lined
cistern encased in mortar. The uppermost expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface
expression consisted of a circular alignment of lain mortared brick found within Testing Area 4001. Again
using 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl as a baseline for the original ground surface across the entire Project Area,
approximately 9 in (23 cm) of the upper portion of this cistern was destroyed during railroad-era construction.
As with Feature 1001, this cistern’s walls were constructed of a single row of horizontally lain brick (Figure
17.5). Its intact, flat-bottomed floor was constructed of similarly oriented brick. The interior diameter of the
cistern measured 106 in (270 cm), and with a surmised depth of approximately 130 in (330 cm), its original
volume would have been about 4,992 gallons (18,894 liters). Due to its corner location within the block,
combined with volume capacity, this cistern is considered to have been a communal-use structure.
Feature 11001
While most cisterns found throughout the Project Area exhibited a cylindrical form regardless of their
capacity, a single cistern (Feature 11001) exhibited a bee-hive shape. Its base was similar in construction to
the other cisterns, but its walls gradually sloped inward towards its destroyed neck. Further, the exterior walls
were not mortared as were the other cisterns. Similar to the other cisterns, the exterior was lined with
approximately 6 in (15 cm) of mottled Beaumont clay, presumably to enhance water retention.
Since Feature 11001 is associated with a much later structure (post 1870), it may be taken as a chronological
indicator of a style that superseded the traditional cylinder shape. It is equally possible that this cistern was
simply constructed by a different company using different building techniques.
CISTERN GUTTERS
Block 117
Feature 7021 was found within the eastern central portion of Parcel 117-1 (41HR820), within the vicinity of
another unidentified and undiscovered pre-1870s house location. This feature, a mortar-encased, brick-lined,
covered sluice gutter, connects the unidentified structure and Feature 7020, the associated house cistern. The
uppermost expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of a linear
alignment of lain mortar-encased brick that terminated along the northeastern edge of the associated cistern
(Feature 7020).
Upon further excavation of Feature 7021, it was clear that a second mortar-encased sluice existed to its
immediate north (Figure 17.6). This second feature was similarly constructed but with a considerably
narrower downspout opening. It is presumed that this northern sluice was constructed first, and upon
subsequent constrictions caused by the relatively narrow opening, was ultimately abandoned, its cistern
opening sealed, and a modified gutter constructed to the south. The newer gutter had a more substantial
downspout opening, a more functional downward connect angle, and an inline charcoal filtration system. The
last was determined by the large amount of charcoal exhibited within the portion of the gutter adjacent to the
cistern opening.
254

Bisection of the associated cistern revealed the opening for the gutter-to-cistern sluice. This opening was as
wide as the interior width of the sluice; however, a mortar ‘lip,’ limiting the vertical clearance to
approximately 1 in (2.5 cm), was also evident. It is presumed that this lip was constructed to facilitate the
operation of the charcoal filtration system and to limit the amount of debris entering the cistern contents.

Figure 17.5. North profile of Feature 4002 (cistern).

255

Figure 17.6. Plan of Feature 7021 (cistern gutter).

256

Feature 7045 was discovered within the northern central portion of Parcel 117-6 (41HR820), immediately
adjacent to Feature 7005, the brick foundation. This feature, a brick-lined gutter, connects Features 7005 and
7018, the associated house cistern. The uppermost expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its
surface expression consisted of a linear alignment of lain mortared brick (Figure 17.7) that terminated along
the northeastern edge of the associated cistern (Feature 7018).

Figure 17.7. South profile of Feature 7045 (cistern gutter).

The alignment consisted of only one extant course of lain brick. However, the probable original construction,
as suggested by the mortar present atop this course, indicates that there was at least one more course of brick,
thus forming a covered sluice. Unfortunately, the point of entrance from the sluice into the cistern was
destroyed prior to the field investigation. Additionally, the upper portion of the associated cistern was
destroyed, leaving no intact entrance for intrasite comparative purposes.

It is presumed, by the proximity of the northeastern terminus of the gutter to the western wall of Feature 7005,
that the structure, gutter, and cistern were associated and all contemporaneous with one another. It was noted
257

that the northeastern terminus of the gutter was disturbed by a later, intrusive brick-filled posthole. As such, it
cannot be determined whether there existed a gutter downspout in this location.
WELLS
Block 117
Feature 7024 was discovered within the northeastern quadrant of Parcel 117-6 (41HR820), immediately
adjacent to Feature 7005, the house foundation. The uppermost expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14
m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of a circular alignment of lain mortared bricks surrounded by
mottled clays. The outside diameter at the surface measured approximately 45 in (114 cm), and its interior
diameter was approximately 36 in (92 cm). The walls of the well measured approximately 5 in (12 cm) thick
and were mantled on the exterior with approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) of mortar.
That this well was so close to the house foundation did not initially raise questions, since other structures
contemporaneous with Feature 7005 also had a well, either near a window or enclosed within an addition to
the structure. However, as excavation of the area between the two features commenced, it became apparent
that their construction was neither contemporaneous nor complementary.
A number of clues revealed that the well predated construction of Feature 7005. For example, it was
completely encircled by red (2.5YR 4/8) Beaumont clay, presumably to make it waterproof. A patch/repair
evident on the well’s northern side, adjacent to Feature 7005, was backfilled with light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4)
Beaumont clay. Associated with this patch was a notch that had been carved out to allow for the basal
planking of the house foundation. It is unlikely that the well would have been constructed in such a manner
subsequent to the foundation construction. Additionally, the subsequent clay cap was underlain by mortar
that was hand driven beneath the basal planking for water seepage abatement. This was determined by the
presence of mortar reliefs that had been set in the form of fist-shaped indentations under the planking. These
later attempts at rectifying the intrusive foundation construction can only corroborate the assertion that the
well predates Feature 7005.
As the total depth of this well proved impractical to manually excavate, it was bisected by a trackhoe to
expose its depth and morphology. An attempt was made to excavate in 50-cm (20 in) increments in order to
maintain relative provenience of any recovered artifacts.
The well walls were constructed of a single row of horizontally lain brick in a circular stretcher orientation
(Figure 17.8). Beneath the repair noted above, none of the lain bricks was mortared. While the well bricks
appeared similar in composition to those of the foundation (Feature 7005), they were generally lighter in
color.
Block 118
A brick-lined well (Feature 2002; Figure 17.9) and associated drainage gutter (Feature 2003; Figure 17.10)
were encountered within the northwestern quadrant of Parcel 118-4 (41HR815). The uppermost expression of
these features was encountered at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl and they exhibited virtually no subsurface disturbance.
The surface expression of these features consisted of a circular alignment of lain mortared bricks with an
attached drainage gutter of lain unmortared bricks. The exterior diameter of the well at the surface measured
48 in (123 cm), with an interior diameter of approximately 40 in (102 cm). The walls of the well measured
approximately 4 in (10.5 cm) thick and were mantled on the exterior with approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) of
mortar.
The well was excavated to a depth of 33 ft (10 m) amsl, the mechanical limits of the trackhoe, where it was
observed that its walls sloped gradually inward throughout the entire length of the shaft. The outside diameter

258

at the base measured 39 in (98 cm), with an inside diameter of 31 in (79 cm). With the exception of the
extreme upper portion of the well, none of the bricks was mortared together.
The associated brick drainage gutter was approximately 10 in (25 cm) wide. It extended north from the
northwestern lip of the well for 11 ft (3 m), then west for 130 ft (40 m). This western extension probably
continued to the eastern curb line of Jackson Street, where it emptied. The drainage gutter consisted of a
single course of lain brick, three rows in width. The outer rows were slightly canted inward to channel the
overflow drainage. The length of the drainage gutter was underlain with approximately 2 to 3 in (4-7 cm) of
coarse-grained sand.

Figure 17.10. South profile of Feature 2003 (drainage gutter).

It is presumed that the drainage gutter system was used to divert overflow from the associated well. At the
contact point between the well and drainage gutter, a single brick was removed from the lip of the well. The
brick drainage gutter would have allowed for overflow to be diverted to Jackson Street rather than saturating
the lawn of the residence.
PRIVIES
Block 103
Feature 1048B was discovered in the extreme northwestern corner of Parcel 103-1 (41HR812), approximately
72 ft (22 m) northwest of the northern portion of an unidentified pre-1870s house location. The uppermost
expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of an amorphous soil
anomaly with an artifact concentration of cut nail, bone, brick, glass, and ceramic.
The privy was a moderately sized, typical wooden barrel. Its vertical slats were bound on the exterior with
approximately 1-in (2.5 cm) thick wooden bands fastened by small cut nails. The interior diameter of the
barrel measured 33 in (83 cm), and with a surmised depth of 17 in (43 cm), the volume of the privy was
approximately 60 gallons (233 liters). The wooden bands used to bind the slats were actually thick, woody
vines. Due to the disturbed nature of the topmost portion of the barrel, it remains unclear whether this is an
artifact of railroad-era construction or whether it was the original state of the barrel prior to its subterranean
placement. Most likely, the barrel was halved before installation, and the deteriorated condition of the
topmost portion is due to natural decay.
261

Due to the relatively narrow confines presented by the privy walls, no attempt was made to maintain an
interior balk during excavation. Though the excavation was primarily focused inside the privy walls, the
surrounding matrix was also excavated in an attempt to locate evidence of a builder’s trench, but none was
found.
Tar residue was found on the barrel’s interior surface, concentrated around its mid portion. Interior banding,
similar to the exterior banding described above, located at the bottom rim of the barrel had all but been
destroyed. While there were no unique abrasions on the barrel floor, it is likely that some repetitive activity,
such as privy cleaning, had worn away any remnants of tar and interior banding within its lower portion.
Feature 1063 was found along the central portion of the northern lot line of Parcel 103-3a, 74 ft (22.5 m)
north of the closest pre-1870s structure located within Parcel 103-3. The uppermost expression of the feature
began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of a sandy rectangular deposit, with an artifact
concentration of brick and brick fragments, metal fragments, charcoal flecks, and a button.
Excavation of this feature revealed a downward continuation of the sandy deposit gradating into disturbed
silty clays; no extant walls or evidence of former walls was documented. The privy was a simple excavated
shaft within the surrounding clay. With dimensions of approximately 59 in long x 28 in wide x 16 in deep
(150 x 70 x 40 cm), the volume of the privy was estimated at 111 gallons (420 liters).
The upper stratum of the feature consisted of 3 in (7 cm) of light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand. The remainder of
the feature was a relatively homogenous deposit of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay. Soils
encountered inside the privy indicated a single fill episode following its abandonment.
Feature 1063 was located approximately 5 ft (1.5 m) south of Feature 1065 and was probably associated with
the same residence. As Feature 1063 had no frame, it is possible that this was used as a temporary privy;
Feature 1065, with its relatively substantial box frame, seems to indicate a more permanent structure.
Feature 1065 was found along the central portion of the southern lot line of Parcel 103-4 (41HR812), 78 ft
(24 m) north of the closest pre-1870s structure located within Block 103, Parcel 103-3. The uppermost
expression of the feature began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of a sandy rectangular
deposit with an artifact concentration of cut nail, bone, brick, glass, and ceramic (Figure 17.11).
Privy walls were constructed of vertical wooden boards, averaging 36 in long x 18 in wide x 6 in thick (92 x
46 x 1.5 cm). An intact floor, constructed of similar material, was also found. The span of each wall
measured 36 in (92 cm), and with a surmised depth of 49 in (124 cm), the volume of the privy was estimated
at 277 gallons (1,050 liters). No interior support posts or fasteners were found during excavation of the
feature. Additionally, no builder’s trench was evident on the exterior of the structure. It is likely, then, that
the privy was constructed in situ by simply laying the boards in place against the surrounding clay matrix.
Due to the relatively narrow confines of the privy, the feature was bisected in order to maintain an interior
balk for a wall profile (Figure 17.12). While excavation focused primarily inside the privy , the surrounding
matrix was also excavated in an attempt to locate evidence of a builder’s trench, but none was found.
The overall integrity of the structure was relatively sound, with the basic form of the original construction still
intact. That the walls were convex was due to the dynamics of the vertisol clays of the surrounding matrix
(see Figure 17.12). Of the three quadrangular wood-lined privies found during the project, this feature
exhibited the greatest amount of distortion due to the shrink and swell properties of the surrounding clay. The
relatively thin walls, lack of internal supports, and long horizontal wall span contributed to the distortion.

Block 117
Feature 7001 (Figure 17.13) was discovered in the west-central portion of Parcel 117-4a (41HR820),
approximately 66 ft (20 m) west of the southern portion of an unidentified pre-1870s house location. The
uppermost expression of the feature began at 44 ft (13.5 m) amsl. Its surface expression exhibited a 35-in (90
cm) diameter circular, wooden outline that encased light brown (10YR 7/2) sand. No artifacts were evident at
surface elevation.

Figure 17.13. Northwest profile of Feature 7001 (privy).

The privy was a moderately sized, typical wooden barrel. Its vertical slats were bound on the exterior with
0.5-in (1 cm) thick wooden bands fastened by small cut nails. The interior diameter of the barrel measured
35.5 in (90 cm), and with a surmised depth of 17 in (43 cm), the volume of the privy was approximately 71
gallons (274 liters). It was apparent that the barrel was halved in the placement of the privy since the
maximum diameter measurement was at the ground surface. There appeared to be no substantial subsurface
disturbance within this portion of the Project Area.

265

Due to the relatively narrow confines presented by the privy walls, no attempt was made to maintain an
interior balk during excavation. Soils found inside the privy indicated a single fill episode following
abandonment. All but the bottom 4 in (10 cm) of feature fill consisted of sterile sand ‘cap’ material. While
excavation was primarily focused inside the privy walls, the surrounding matrix was also excavated in an
attempt to locate evidence of a builder’s trench, but none was found.
The bottom of the barrel was mostly destroyed. Fragments of floor remains were found during excavation
beneath the privy, suggesting that the privy had been cleaned at least once, but more than likely on numerous
occasions. As the strata within the privy extended well beneath the bottom of the barrel, it is postulated that
the abundant wood fragments beneath the barrel are evidence of the privy having been cleaned more than
once. Because of its small size, the privy may have required more frequent cleaning. This would also
account for the worn condition of the floor.
Feature 7009 was discovered along the central northern lot line of Parcel 117-6 (41HR820), 13 ft (4 m) west
of Feature 7005, the house foundation. These features were presumed to be contemporaneous and associated.
The uppermost expression of Feature 7009 began at 45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression exhibited the
topmost aspect of the entire southern wall and the southern portions of the eastern and western walls.
Associated surface artifacts recovered include large brick fragments, ceramic sherds, and a relatively large
metal rod.
While the initial survey recorded the feature as a possible wood-lined privy, the surface expression did not
reveal the overall dimensions of the actual structure. It was obvious that this feature’s northern portion had
been disturbed by railroad-era construction, since its eastern and western walls were fragmented. A wide
trough of oyster shell, likely associated with rail-bed construction, traversed the Project Area east to west,
obscuring the feature’s northern portion. The shell fill material was extremely compact and could not be
excavated by hand, so a small backhoe was used to remove an additional 20 cm (8 in) of this fill to expose the
topmost aspect of the remaining walls.
Removal of the overlying shell fill revealed an intact, four-walled, rectangular wooden structure situated
within a surrounding matrix of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay. Soils within the feature at this level consisted
primarily of sand, mottled with various clays and silty clays. The privy consisted of a rectangular wooden
frame with interior dimensions of 84 x 54 in (214 x 137 cm). It was oriented north-south, parallel with
Feature 7005.
During excavation, a 20-cm (8 in) balk was maintained along the southern wall of the feature in order to
provide a representative view of the stratigraphy of feature fill (Figure 17.14). Unfortunately, this portion of
the feature proved unrepresentative of the various fill episodes revealed during excavation. Nevertheless, the
figure does show the typical sand cap placed atop privies for odor abatement. The lower strata shown in
Figure 17.14 are representative of the majority of strata encountered at various depths throughout the
remainder of the privy.
The privy walls were constructed of horizontal milled boards of cypress, averaging between 54 and 89 in long
x 8 in wide x 1.5 in thick (135-225 x 20 cm x 3.5 cm). With a surmised depth of 28 in (72 cm), the volume of
the privy was approximately 531 gallons (2,009 liters). Stratigraphic and structural evidence indicate that this
feature was prefabricated prior to its burial and subsequent use as a privy vault. An obvious disturbed zone of
mottled clays surrounded the privy and marked the extent of the shaft excavated for the placement of the
vault.
Construction details of the substantial wooden container indicate that it was originally built as a shipping
crate. The walls were fastened with large metal spikes, approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter. Lead or zinc
266

strips, underlain by a type of mortar or caulk material, sealed each of the corners and the seams between each
of the basal planks. These metal strips were attached to the planks by small brads spaced at approximately 1in (2.5 cm) intervals. The effort to seal joints suggests that the original function of the structure was as a
watertight container or thermal container. The latter seems more plausible, since no waterproofing material
was evident on any surfaces of the planks. Whichever the function, neither of these qualities is necessarily
desirable in a privy.

Figure 17.14. South profile of Feature 7009 (privy).

Other peculiarities also suggested that the original function of this structure was not as a privy vault. The
basal planking had a series of Roman numerals (I through VII) engraved onto the surfaces (Figure 17.15).
These markings probably specify the location of the boards as a guide to the prefabricated construction of the
feature. In addition, several cut holes with wooden plugs were found along the lower walls of the structure.
One plug was noted along the east wall in the southern corner; another was found in a similar location in the
northern corner. The centers of each plug measured approximately 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter and were
positioned 7 in (18 cm) above the basal planking. Plugs were also found in the central portions of both the
east and west walls in line with one another. Again, with central diameters of approximately 1 in (2.5 cm),
they were located 2.5 in (6 cm) above the basal planking. Along the west wall, only one plug with a 1 in (2.5
cm) diameter was found in the northern corner. It was located approximately 9.5 in (24 cm) above the basal
planking. The northern wall exhibited two plugs, one in the eastern corner and another in the western corner.
267

The eastern corner plug (2 in [5 cm] in central diameter) was located 10 in (26 cm) above the basal planking.
The plug in the western corner (1-in central diameter) was located 8 in (20 cm) above the basal planking. A
single plug was found in the floor of the feature. Its central diameter measured 1.5 in (4 cm), and it was
located 8 in (21 cm) from the southern wall, approximately central to the eastern and western walls.

Figure 17.15. Plan of Feature 7009.

268

The absence of metal stripping and caulk in some areas may suggest that this structure could no longer serve
its intended purpose and was subsequently converted into a privy. Additionally, there were numerous
abrasions, some relatively deep, along the surface of the floor. These could be remnants of the original use of
the structure, or they may have resulted from successive cleaning of the structure as a privy. Regardless, it is
presumed that the metal strips originally covered all of the floor seams, and the activities that caused the
numerous abrasions removed portions of the lead strips in the process.
The square hole observed in the eastern portion of the structure’s floor was caused by intrusion of a railroad
construction-era post. This post was one of a linear alignment of retaining wall posts originally containing
oyster fill used as bed surface for one of the tracks. It was construction of this bed that damaged both the
northern portion of the feature and the brick courses of the northern portion of Feature 7005. Only after the
initial excavation of this feature was underway was it determined that the lower portion of the northern half of
Feature 7009 was intact. Similar expansion of the excavation area disclosed that the basal planking of Feature
7005 was likewise intact.
When excavation of the interior of the feature was completed, the entire structure was slated for removal and
conservation. The wooden structure was pedestaled, manually undercut, and reinforced prior to removal. A
front-end loader equipped with a forklift apparatus lifted the privy vault into the back of a flatbed trailer. The
structure was then taken to the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University, College Station.
Block 162
Feature 5014 was discovered in the northwestern portion of Block 162 (41HR816), 30.5 ft (10 m) east of an
alignment of brick piers that probably represented the rear structural support of the de Cordova residence.
The uppermost expression of the feature began at 44 ft (13.5 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted only of
a faint charcoal stain associated with a relatively sparse artifact concentration. Excavation of the feature
exposed the topmost undisturbed aspect of a privy, a portion of its northern wall, at 44 ft. (13.5 m) amsl.
Due to the relatively narrow confines presented by the privy walls, no attempt was made to maintain an
interior balk during excavation. While excavation was focused primarily inside the privy walls, the
surrounding matrix was also excavated in an attempt to locate evidence of a builder’s trench, but none was
found.
Privy walls were constructed of horizontal milled wood boards, averaging 29.5 in long x 9.5 in wide x 0.5 in
thick (75 x 24 x 1.5 cm). Vertical interior support posts, approximately 1.5 x 3 in (4 x 8 cm), were fastened at
all corners except the southwest, where a similarly cut 1.5-x-4-in (4 x 10 cm) support post was fastened
instead. With a surmised depth of 31 in (78 cm), the volume of the privy was approximately 132 gallons (499
liters).
The privy must have been constructed in situ since all of the wallboards were fastened to the surrounding clay
with numerous cut nails driven from the interior of the privy outward. The lack of any discernible builder’s
trench on the exterior of the privy walls further corroborates this assertion. In addition, the interior corner
supports exhibited similar interior fastening to the wallboards. No floor was encountered, nor was there any
indication of a floor ever being present.
The overall integrity of the structure was relatively sound, with corners still exhibiting a near 90˚ angle
(Figure 17.16). That the walls were slightly convex was due to the dynamics of the vertisol clays of the
surrounding matrix. However, of the three quadrangular wood-lined privies found during the project, this
feature exhibited the least amount of distortion from the shrink-swell properties of the surrounding clay. This
was due primarily to the structural integrity afforded by the vertical corner supports and the relatively short
horizontal wall span.

REFUSE DEPOSITS
Block 103
Feature 1025 was found in the northwestern portion of the southeastern quadrant of Parcel 103-3 (41HR812),
82 ft (25 m) south of an undiscovered pre-1870s house location in Parcel 103-2, and 82 ft (25 m) north of an
undiscovered pre-1870s house location in Parcel 103-1. The uppermost expression of the feature began at
45.5 ft (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression was a concentration of large brick fragments, glass bottle
fragments, cut bone, and charcoal fragments.
Excavation of the feature revealed a 20-cm-thick lens (8 in) of abundant cultural remains and disturbed soil.
Artifacts recovered from this lens included burned bone, cut bone, various glass shards and bottle fragments,
charcoal, cut nails, ceramic sherds, and metal fragments. The location of the feature at the back of a lot and
the high number of bottles suggest that it was a bottle dump.
Feature 1048A was discovered in the extreme northwestern corner of Parcel 103-1 (41HR812), approximately
69 ft (21 m) northwest of the northern portion of an unidentified pre-1870s house location. The uppermost
expression of the feature began at 50 ft. (14.5 m) amsl. Its surface expression consisted of an amorphous soil
anomaly with an artifact concentration of cut bone, glass shards, and ceramic sherds.
Excavation of the feature revealed a 15-cm-thick lens (6 in) of cultural remains and disturbed soil. Moderate
amounts of cut bone, glass shards, seeds, and wood fragments were recovered from this lens. The artifacts
from this feature, in combination with its close proximity to Feature 1048B, a privy, strongly suggest that it
was used as a refuse deposit.
Block 117
Feature 7013 was found in the southeastern portion of the northwestern quadrant of Parcel 117-6 (41HR820),
25 ft (7.5 m) west of Feature 7005, the house foundation. The uppermost expression of the feature began at
45.5 ft. (14 m) amsl. Its surface expression exhibited abundant charcoal covering an area approximately 4 x 4
ft (1.4 x 1.4 m). Associated metal fragments, ceramic sherds, brick fragments, and glass shards were exposed
on the surface.
Excavation of the feature revealed a relatively shallow lens consisting of charcoal staining and artifacts 2 to 9
cm (0.5-3.5 in) thick. Glass shards, metal fragments, brick fragments, cut nails, and a sparse to moderate
amount of historic ceramic sherds were recovered from this lens. Due to the large amount of charcoal present
and the associated artifacts recovered, the evidence strongly suggests that this refuse deposit is associated with
either a kitchen or a hearth feature.
TRASH PITS
Block 173
Only two examples of trash pits (Features 6001 and 6002) were found in the Project Area in Block 173
(41HR818), along the southern lot line of Parcel 173-4. The features were located within 10 ft (3 m) of one
another and approximately 16 ft (5 m) west of an undiscovered pre-1870s house location. For purposes of
this discussion, a trash pit is defined as a hole intentionally excavated for the purpose of trash disposal. A
refuse deposit, in contrast, consists of refuse that is merely thrown on top of the natural ground surface.
The uppermost expression of Feature 6001 began at 44 ft (13.5 m) amsl, approximately 3 in (7 cm) below the
original ground surface prior to railroad construction. Its surface expression consisted of various disturbed
and mottled soils with an artifact concentration of glass, metal, bone, and brick fragments.

271

Excavation of the feature revealed a downward continuation of the disturbed soils and an increase in the
artifact density. Approximately 40 in long x 40 in wide x 20 in deep (100 x 100 x 50 cm), the volume of the
trash pit was 1.5 ft3 (0.5 m3).
The uppermost expression of Feature 6002 began at 44 ft (13.5 m) amsl, approximately 5.5 in (14 cm) below
the original ground surface prior to railroad construction. The surface expression of the feature consisted of a
disturbed silty clay matrix with abundant charcoal inclusions and an artifact concentration of metal, bone,
charcoal fragments, and brick fragments.
Excavation of the feature revealed a downward continuation of the disturbed soil and an increase in the
artifact density. As the feature was located along the northern portion of Testing Area 6001 and actually
extended outside of the testing area, it was not possible to obtain its dimensions. The artifact density of this
feature was not as great as Feature 6001 and only extended approximately 20 cm (8 in) deep.
LANDSCAPE FEATURES
Block 117
Feature 7036 was found in the northeastern portion of Parcel 117-3 (41HR820) in the vicinity of an
unidentified pre-1870s structure. Virtually no cultural fill associated with original railroad-era construction
was removed during the survey phase in order to expose the uppermost expression of the feature at 45.5 ft (14
m) amsl. The feature’s surface expression consisted of numerous ceramic bottle fragments, one large metal
fragment, and several brick fragments.
Originally identified as a possible refuse deposit, the feature first appeared as two parallel alignments of
inverted ceramic gin bottles (Figure 17.17). Soils found between the alignments were typical of those of a
garden: various lenses of sand and both silty and ash-laden soils. An adjacent feature, 7034, also originally
identified as a refuse deposit, was further revealed to be an alignment of inverted glass bottles. These were
uncovered during excavation of Units 7029 and 7031. Due to time constraints placed upon the investigation
by D. H. Griffin Demolition Contractors, no further excavation units were placed within Testing Area 7005.
In lieu of these time constraints, aggressive troweling was implemented to further expose the bottle
alignments. A total of 59 inverted bottles were recovered. They formed a symmetrical barbell-shaped
pattern, with the ceramic alignment intersecting the pattern in the center of the bar. This would probably be
interpreted as a decorative garden boundary due to the soils encountered within Unit 7026. It is interesting to
note that this feature exhibited virtually no subsurface disturbance as opposed to other features within the
Project Area.
CONCLUSIONS
Investigation and analysis of 49 excavated structural features provides evidence that the Project Area was
disturbed to about a foot (30 cm) beneath the original ground surface due to railroad-era construction. The
variation in disturbance was relative to the ground use of the specific area. While some areas received
intensive disturbance due to rail-bed or pad construction, other areas received little to no disturbance, as they
were not in the construction right-of-way.

DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE AND THE ARCHEOLOGICAL RECORD
Shawn Bonath Carlson

AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON HOUSTON ARCHITECTURE
In the early 1830s, when Houston was beginning to show its first vestiges of development, American
architecture was undergoing a major shift from the Federal style to the Greek Revival style. First affecting
metropolitan areas along the eastern seaboard and then diffusing westward, these styles were available to
virtually anyone who had access to a builder’s guide. At the same time, frontiersmen, who were penetrating
the wild interior of America, were making do with log cabins. These cabins were later abandoned in favor of
more stylish frame houses, or they were modified to give the appearance of being frame houses.
During Houston’s formative years, the log-cabin tradition existed side by side with classic architectural styles
introduced from Europe. As the Federal style waned, the Greek Revival style, which first emerged in the
United States in 1798, became “wildly popular” in Texas from 1820 to 1860 (Poppeliers et al. 1983:36;
Robinson 1974:23). Although this style was at first limited to public buildings and affluent homes, it was a
visible sign of the transition from log homes and frontier society to more traditional homes and civilized
society. Archeological remains uncovered during the current project provide fleeting glimpses of this
transitional period in Houston’s history.
This chapter discusses the origin and spread of log construction to Texas and the development of classic
architecture in North America. While documentary sources indicate that during the first half of the nineteenth
century, these traditions existed concurrently in Houston, the only archeological evidence of these housing
styles comes from foundation remains. One massive brick spreader foundation and a multitude of brick piers
were uncovered during the Ball Park investigation. These are assessed here in the context of known
architectural trends.
THE FIRST LOG BUILDINGS
As Robinson (1974:14) notes, “In 1836, among the enticements to settle in Houston were . . . inexhaustible
quantities of pine, ash, cedar, and oak for buildings.” It is not surprising that the city’s earliest settlers took
advantage of the abundant timber along Buffalo Bayou to build their first homes. These structures were
assembled from logs because wood was both plentiful and convenient. An absence of efficient transportation
and communication systems during the early years of the Republic also made it difficult to import building
materials and forced landowners to depend upon what was locally available (Abernethy 1979:3-19; Robinson
1974:3; Scardino 1991:60).
The technique of building log structures came to America from Europe via the Atlantic coast (Robinson
1974:20). Its origin has been pinpointed to northern Europe during the Mesolithic period, when most of
Europe was covered with dense forests (Jordan 1978:21). This building technique diffused southward and
eastward, reaching its peak around A.D. 1300-1400, as agricultural lands steadily depleted the forests. The
technique survived best in the forested mountains and untillable lands of central and southeastern Europe.
From these regions come the precursors of North American and Texas log structures.

274

While scattered examples of log construction from the seventeenth century can be found throughout the
eastern seaboard, the primary construction techniques used in Texas log buildings can be traced to a group of
Pennsylvania Germans, ca. 1710-1740 (Jordan 1978:24). As these Middle Atlantic settlers continued
westward and southward, so too did their techniques of log construction. Reaching Texas by the nineteenth
century, the earliest log structures have been documented from the period 1812-1825 (Jordan 1978:27).
Constructing a sturdy log house required tall, straight trees, preferably oak or pine, which were hewed with a
foot adze. Tree size generally determined room size, which averaged about 12-20 ft in length (Williamson
1973:7). The warm, humid climate of the South was such that foundations typically required brick or wooden
piers that elevated the house 2-3 ft (0.6-2 m) above ground to prevent termite infestation (Jordan 1978:32).
Massive log sills were laid horizontally across these piers “on the eave sides of the structure” and would bear
the entire weight of the building (Jordan 1978:39). As the walls were erected, corners were notched to
prevent the logs from slipping. The top logs, known as plates, were similar in size to the sills and functioned
in much the same manner by supporting the rafters of the house. Sills and plates in excess of 30-40 ft were
uncommon due to the lack of tall timber throughout most of Texas; houses requiring these longer lengths thus
usually relied upon lap-jointing and pinning. The difficulty of raising such timbers, which weighed several
hundred pounds, also had to be considered.
The typical log-cabin roof in Texas was end-gabled and constructed without a ridge pole or logs (Jordan
1978:84-87). Instead, rafters at 2-ft (0.6 m) intervals were angled at about 45˚ from the plates and morticed at
the roof ridge. Vertical studs at the gable ends provided further support. Roofing materials ranged from
boards to shingles to shakes. To finish the house, the hewn logs were chinked with a mixture of clay and
straw to fill the intervening spaces (Williamson 1973:7). The floor was finished in a variety of ways. The
quickest and least expensive method was the packed earthen floor. The puncheon floor, made of split logs
laid in the ground with the round side down, was slightly more expensive. The most finished floor had planks
laid across the floor joists, and these were both lap-jointed and pinned to the sleepers beneath to prevent them
from slipping out of place (Jordan 1978:83).
There were two popular house forms: the single pen (room) and the double pen. While the single-pen house
originated in Europe, the double pen evolved as a response to the extreme southern heat. Two pens were
separated by a breezeway and were oriented, usually north to south, to catch the prevailing winds, cooling the
house. Typically called a ‘dogtrot,’ these cabins could be further adapted with a porch along the length of the
structure that provided a shaded reprieve from outdoor activities (Heimsath 1968:30, 46; Jordan 1978:31).
Although rural homeowners could take advantage of the environment and position their homes accordingly,
town dwellers had less flexibility. Typical town plans focused upon a public square with a grid-iron street
plan oriented in one of the cardinal directions. In Houston, however, this was not possible. Its grid was
skewed 30-45˚ to parallel Buffalo Bayou (Robinson 1974:19). Early homes within the town plat were more
likely to parallel the street they faced than face a cardinal direction.
In May 1837, Congress moved to Houston after selecting it as a temporary capital for the Republic of Texas:

An examination of the landscape disclosed ‘a few tents’ and a ‘saloon.’ When President Houston
arrived in April, two taverns, ‘several’ log cabins and ‘a few’ saloons had been added. Timbers were
being hauled for the new capitol building and ‘all was hustle and animation. Hammers and axes
sounding . . . trees falling.’ Sam Houston beamed with unblushing pride upon the busy scene.
The new place flourished. ‘Persons came pouring in until . . . a floating population had collected of
some four or five hundred people. Houses could not be built as fast as required,’ and town lots sold
for five thousand dollars apiece [Williamson 1973:2].

275

There were a number of public buildings in Houston by 1840. These included “a market house, an arsenal,
court house, jail, two small theatres, the president’s house, and the capitol” (Robinson 1974:19). There were
also a dozen mercantile establishments, six mechanic shops, and 47 saloons, probably all constructed from
logs or rough planks.
Most of the Republic was characterized by log buildings at this time (Jordan 1978:149-160; Scardino
1991:63). In Austin, government facilities were primarily one-story double-pen structures, and the town was
described as a “village of rude log and rough plank buildings” (Williamson 1973:1). By 1846, Austin had
100 to 150 white frame houses and only a few log buildings (Williamson 1973:11-13). In Galveston, where
the population exceeded that of Houston, Austin, or San Antonio in 1850, Grecian-style architecture was
already evident in 1840 (Robinson 1974:15). The main hotel in Brazoria during the 1830s was a dog-trot
cabin with shuttered windows (no glass), a hearth, and a simple hole in the roof to allow the smoke to escape
(Robinson 1974:20). Houston’s jail, in 1837, was a single-pen log structure, measuring 24 x 24 ft (7 x 7 m),
made from hewn timbers that were 12 x 12 in (30 x 30 cm) (Robinson 1974:21). Clearly, log buildings were
common throughout Texas during the period of Houston’s development.
A MORE CIVILIZED SOCIETY
During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, when settlers began dribbling into the Houston area,
American architecture was characterized by the ‘Federal style,’ so named because it coincided with the
emergence of a new nation (Poppeliers et al. 1983:30-31). The earliest of these structures were built along the
eastern seaboard, and many were constructed with the aid of a builder’s guide. Carpenters’ manuals and
building guides, supplied from Europe up until about 1800, reflected the classic architecture of England.
These guides were directed at European workmen and their materials and were frequently of little practical
use to Americans (Benjamin 1972b:v [1806]).
Then in 1797, Asher Benjamin, a Massachusetts native, published The Country Builder’s Assistant (Benjamin
1972a:viii [1797]). He sought to capture the attention of Americans inhabiting the frontier by adapting
building guides to the unique conditions of the frontier setting. The result was a diffusion of Federal-style
elements throughout the interior of North America. Although an array of builder’s guides surfaced during
this period, Benjamin’s book was among the most popular, with four editions printed between 1797 and 1805.
It was the first architectural book written by an American and published in America.
Benjamin’s second book, The American Builder’s Companion, was equally successful and progressed through
six editions between 1806 and 1827 (Benjamin 1972b:ix [1806]). It contrasted the building materials in
England to those in America, noting the use of massive stone vs. lighter wood frames. Building designs were
adapted to the materials at hand, making it possible for builders in the most remote parts of North America to

Benjamin’s The Rudiments of Architecture, released in 1814 and again in 1820, was more specialized and
thus less in demand (see Benjamin 1972a:x [1797]). It introduced Americans to elements of the Greek
Revival style that came into vogue during the 1820s and continued in popularity until 1860. Scardino
(1991:60-264) cites and illustrates a number of early Houston homes that were constructed in the Greek
Revival style. Some of these were situated in Quality Hill, just outside the Project Area. Quality Hill,
“located along Franklin and Congress avenues between Caroline and Chenevert streets, was the first elite
residential area removed from the daily workings of the city” (Scardino 1991:70).
Benjamin’s most popular book, The Practical House Carpenter, was released 17 times between 1830 and
1856 (see Benjamin 1972a:x [1797]). It completely abandoned the Federal style in favor of Greek and Greek
Revival styles, contributing to the widespread diffusion of Greek architecture in the United States. Benjamin
276

wrote many other architectural books, but the ones mentioned here were the most influential in directing
American architectural trends. After his death in 1845, Benjamin’s books continued to be popular and many
were published posthumously.
BUILDING A HOUSE
Certain considerations had to be taken into account when building a house:

The first thing to be done in planning a house, is to know the wants of the person who is to occupy it;
the next, to know the situation of the ground it is to cover; then to take into consideration the number,
size, and height of the rooms wanted; also, proper and convenient stairs, entries, passages, &c. Let the
kitchen be situated, so as to have as easy a communication with the dining and breakfast rooms as
possible; let the pantry or china closet communicate with the dining room by a door, and with the
passage from the kitchen by a door or window. Place the doors in such a manner as to make the
distance from one part of the house to the other, as short as possible; still keep uniformity in view, as it
is one of the greatest beauties in architecture; yet convenience ought not to make too great a sacrifice
to it. The eye ought to see, at the same time, every part of the building, and be sure that no one part of
it interferes with another; also, to see that the rooms are properly lighted, and at the same time, that
there are a sufficient number of windows, and of a size suitable for the external part of the building
[Benjamin 1972b:67 (1806)].

George Woodward (1865:18) felt that the first consideration in building should be adaptation; i.e., selecting
the appropriate material, style, and arrangement to fit the site, the climate, and its function. Woodward
emphasized the choice of materials, and although wood was abundant nearly everywhere and would last
several generations, he considered the costs and annoyances of maintaining a wooden house to be undesirable.
Woodward especially disliked the propensity to paint these houses an “intense” white with “bright” green
shutters, and favored the trend for neutral colors with darker trim (Vaux 1968:17, 95 [1857]). Stone or brick
was considered by Woodward to be more cost efficient. The initial costs may be greater, but repairs were
considerably fewer and the structures had a longer life.
A moderately sized home in the nineteenth century typically included a dining room, drawing room, library,
and kitchen on the first floor, as well as hallways, stairways, storage areas, etc. (Downing 1969:272 [1850]).
In the South, the kitchen was “always a detached building, at some distance from the house” (Downing
1969:272 [1850]). In fact, the kitchen could be 60-90 ft (ca. 20-30 m) or more from the main dwelling and
was large enough to accommodate sleeping quarters for the servants (Downing 1969:313-314 [1850]).
Bedchambers were located on the upper floor of the main dwelling. Ceiling heights were no less than 12 ft
(3.5 m) for the first story and 9-12 ft (3-3.5 m) for the second story.
Ventilation and drainage were also important considerations (Vaux 1968:41-46 [1857]). A southern exposure
was preferred, as the more frequent breezes helped to cool a house, and the brightness of the sun’s rays did
not penetrate as easily (Wheeler 1972:359 [1855]). Fresh air could be circulated throughout a house
regardless of whether the windows were open. The minimum requirements for room ventilation were “two
holes, one for the entrance of air at or near the floor on one side of the room, and another for the exit of air at
or near the ceiling on a different side of the room” (Vaux 1968:45 [1857]). Chimneys were generally not
placed opposite a door because of the draft that would be created. The best location for a chimney was further
inside the house, its back to the door.
Drainage was of grave concern to most builders because of the potential for saturated soils to taint drinking
water. To prevent this, cesspools or manure tanks were built at least 100 ft (30 m) from the well, this being the
minimum distance necessary to prevent “evil consequences” (Vaux 1968:46 [1857]). If this was not possible,
the cesspool was plastered with cement to make it watertight and it was emptied periodically.
277

Downing (1969:273 [1850]) recommended that “all sewerage of the water-closets and kitchen wash, [will] be
immediately carried away by a substantial and capacious drain, built of brick and cement.”
In addition to kitchens, wells/cisterns, and privies, other structures related to a household might include a
smokehouse, ice house, wash house, chicken coop, or carriage house. Modern facilities, such as plumbing
and electricity, were not accessible to Houstonians until the 1880s (Scardino 1991:118). Yards of nineteenthcentury Houston homes thus tended to be more spacious than those in other cities such as New York or
Boston. This maintained a sense of ruralness to the city that continued throughout the century (Scardino
1991:70-71). A white picket fence added the final touch to these city lots.
APPLICATION TO THE BALL PARK FINDINGS
Architectural remains uncovered during the Ball Park project were limited to foundations, brick piers, and
postholes. Assuming that original structures were abandoned, fell into disrepair over a period of years, and
then collapsed, the remains of these structures have long since disappeared. This is mainly due to blading that
took place during the early part of the century. Evidence of blading comes from documentary accounts, fill
that was removed from some of the cisterns, and disparate stratigraphy. Although some debris was found
associated with the foundations, piers, and postholes, it was very limited and probably represents sheet refuse
rather than feature material. Nonetheless, some interpretations can be made based upon what is known about
the architecture of Houston during the early to mid nineteenth century.
House Foundation (Block 117)
Feature 7005, a continuous brick spreader foundation uncovered on Block 117, more than likely represents a
Greek Revival style house (Figure 18.1). The rectangular shape of the foundation is more characteristic of the
traditional Federal and Greek Revival periods than the following Victorian period (Scardino 1991:77).
Furthermore, continuous brick, rather than brick piers, suggests the need to support more weight; i.e., a twostory structure. Although piers were commonly used on both one- and two-story houses throughout Houston,
including log homes, continuous brick could bear more weight. As one 1868 description of a spreader
foundation (for a two-story brick schoolhouse) states: “The foundations are to be laid two feet below the level
of the ground, on a bed of hard yellow pine plank four feet wide and four inches thick, firmly bedded and
leveled, laid close joints across the trench in the best manner to receive the brick walls” (Chase 1868:53)
(Figures 18.2 and 18.3). The similarity of this description to Feature 7005 suggests that the house that it
supported may have been made of brick. This is unlikely, however, since brick, although readily used for
businesses in Houston, never became popular for homes presumably because of its expense. It is more likely
that Feature 7005 supported a frame house with the bright white siding that Vaux (1968 [1857]) despised.
Columns and pilasters, bold simple moldings, pedimented gables, heavy cornices, undecorated friezes, and
transoms, all on white frame structures, are characteristics of Greek architecture (Poppeliers et al. 1983:36).
In Houston,

The center-hall floor plans of Greek Revival houses . . . were standard residential plans that had been
in use since Colonial times. They were essentially an elaboration of the double-log houses (or dog­
trots). Front porches were often inset beneath a side-gabled roof, particularly on one-story houses.
Front-facing dormer windows, when not part of the initial structure, were often added. Two-story
houses were generally three bays wide with a portico across the front; many had a low-pitched, hipped
roof rising to a flat, balustraded deck or widow’s walk [Scardino 1991:69].

Note the partial cross plank under the linear
planking at bottom left (see Figure 18.3).

279

Figure 18.3. Feature 7005, showing cross planks
below linear planking.

Although none of these elements was extant for Feature 7005, the remaining foundations are similar to those
in Benjamin (1972a:Plates 25, 26 [1797]), which are shown supporting two rectangular dwellings that
measure 38.5 x 24.5 ft (ca. 12 x 7.5 m) and 54 x 40 ft (ca. 16.5 x 12 m). Feature 7005’s interior dimensions
were 38 x 18 ft (ca. 11.5 x 5 m) (see Chapter 17). These examples are of the earlier Federal style, but the
structural basis for later Greek Revival style homes would be the same. Both provide viable interpretations
for the kind of structure that Feature 7005 represents.
Documentary records suggest that Feature 7005 was constructed in 1848, just before the death of its owner,
James Wells, by a brick mason named Henry Witt (see Chapter 8). It is unclear, however, if the house was
ever completed. James’ widow Jane apparently never lived in the house. In 1855, she inadvertently sold the
property to an adjacent landowner, Martin Floeck, who recanted the property a year later when Mrs. Wells
discovered her mistake. Floeck, who probably had other motives, only owned the property legally between
1855 and 1856, but paid taxes on it throughout the 1850s. In 1865, two years after Jane Wells’ death, Floeck
sold the property to the Dunlops.
Artifacts recovered around and under the house foundation suggest that it first saw activity during the 1860s.
Flat glass recovered from excavation units date from 1864.52±7 years. Likewise, ceramics indicate a date of
1855-1860, while bottle glass and tableware date from1860-1870. Bricks used in the construction of Feature
7005 were characteristically soft mud with evidence of lipping, and hardware was notably lacking, with the
exception of cut nails (see Chapter 11). The gap between 1848, when the structure is believed to have been
built, and archeological deposits dating from the late 1850s and 1860s could indicate that the structure was

280

never completed. Whereas structures of lesser magnitude are routinely shown on Sanborn Fire Insurance
maps, this structure never appeared, suggesting that it was not completed. There is evidence, too, that Jane
Wells did not reside in the house during her later years, and the house may simply have been empty.
Postholes and Brick Piers (Block 117)
Two series of postholes were found during the investigation of Block 117. One series was clay filled
(Features 7042, 7043, 7048, and 7049), the other was brick filled (Features 7012, 7014, 7046, and 7047).
Their contents suggest that the clay-filled postholes predate the use of brick on the site, while the brick-filled
postholes probably represent either construction or demolition debris of a later date (see Chapter 17). Feature
7005, the house foundation, was constructed of similar bricks.
Locations of postholes do not lend themselves to easy interpretation. Both series are along the same line,
suggesting a fence line with posts set at different times. Few artifacts recovered from the postholes are
diagnostic and probably represent sheet refuse that fell in when the holes were dug. Most puzzling is the
location of this fence line. At least one posthole cuts into the bricks of Feature 7005, indicating that the
structure was no longer in use by the time the fence was built. But the posthole line also bisects the location
of the Dunlop house on Lot 8. The best explanation may be that these series of postholes represent a
backyard fence line. One series predates the Dunlop house; the other postdates the house.
The brick piers, Features 7010 and 7016, are believed to postdate both the brick-filled postholes and Feature
7005. Feature 7010 cuts through Feature 7046, one of the brick-filled postholes. Furthermore, the brick piers
are constructed of hard red brick, while the posthole debris and the bricks used in construction of Feature
7005 are soft and orange in color. After 1869, local maps show a significant increase in the number of
structures in the Project Area, suggesting that the piers were constructed during the later nineteenth century.
Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. (1997) recovered similar brick piers during excavation of Houston’s Block
71.
Brick Piers (Blocks 162, 118, 206)
Investigation of Block 162 focused upon the home of Jacob de Cordova, a wealthy land entrepreneur. Two
lines of brick piers were uncovered during excavations, and one was attributed to a structure depicted on the
1895 Sanborn Fire Insurance map. The other alignment consisted of three brick piers (Features 5004, 5006,
and 5019) that may represent the house that de Cordova and his family occupied from about 1839-1842, and
then rented until 1860 (see Chapters 8 and 17). These piers, which appear to be constructed from older brick
and exhibited some disturbance, probably represent the southern perimeter, or back side, of a structure facing
northward to Prairie Avenue. The few artifacts recovered during profiling of the piers probably represent
sheet refuse that accumulated around the base of the piers. A privy (Feature 5014), also attributed to de
Cordova’s ownership of the site, was revealed about 40 ft (12 m) from the southwest corner of the structure.
Brick piers and foundations were also found on Blocks 118 and 206 (see Chapter 17). None was associated
with pre-1870s structures.
SUMMARY
The most significant architectural features uncovered during the Ball Park at Union Station investigation were
found on Block 117, especially in Parcel 117-6. Feature 7005, a massive brick foundation, and a series of
postholes were compared to documentary data (see Chapter 8) to determine the sequence of events that took
place on this parcel of land. The first activities can be traced to the 1830s; the earliest significant occupation
was that of the James Wells family, beginning in 1838. The Wells probably resided in a log cabin that left no
archeological signature in the ground; a well (Feature 7024), a privy (Feature 7009), and a midden (Feature
7013) were most likely associated with this first family. A series of clay-filled postholes that run east-west
between the privy and midden may represent a fence line constructed during their tenure.

281

If Feature 7005 were constructed in 1848 and then left unoccupied by Wells’ widow, the earliest occupation
might have been during 1855-1856, when Martin Floeck had legal ownership of Lot 8 where Wells’
homestead was reportedly situated (see Chapter 8). That Floeck sold this tract to the Dunlops in 1865 further
suggests that he may have been using the lot during the intervening years. If, on the other hand, Feature 7005
was never completed, the reference to Jane Wells’ inadvertent sale of her homestead lot (Lot 8) may actually
refer to an earlier structure. Feature 7005 straddles Lots 8 and 11 near the center of the block, which, along
with Lot 12, comprised the homestead tract.
Martin Floeck sold Lot 8 in 1865 to Andrew and Ellen Dunlop for $400, twice the price he paid in 1855. This
price indicates that the structure supported by the brick foundation (Feature 7005) was not complete. The
Dunlops, who resided there for many years, sold the parcel to James Monroe in 1882 for $800. Neither of
these prices – $400 or $800 – would cover the cost of a two-story frame or brick structure. Since the structure
does not appear on any of the Sanborn maps, it is entirely possible that the house was never completed. The
brick-filled line of postholes, which cut into Feature 7005, postdate construction of the brick foundation, as do
the brick piers. After 1869, the number of structures built on Lot 8 increased significantly and probably
accounts for the brick piers.
In Block 162, a series of two brick pier alignments was found. One of these alignments may represent the
Jacob de Cordova house, ca. 1839-1860. The other alignment, constructed of hard red bricks, may be a house
depicted on an 1895 Sanborn Fire Insurance map. Both of these structures would have been wood frame
houses, although it is slightly possible, given the early date, that Cordova’s house was made of logs.
Many other postholes, piers, and foundation fragments were found throughout the Project Area, but those
found in Blocks 117 and 162 lent themselves most easily to interpretation. The absence of sheet refuse
throughout most of the area eliminated any opportunities to discover shallow features or interpret yard
activities.

WATER RESOURCE FEATURES
Shawn Bonath Carlson

Wells, cisterns, and natural springs or creeks were the water sources available to Houston settlers in the
1830s. Early accounts of well construction in nearby San Felipe indicate that in 1832, a 30-ft (9 m) deep well
required about 10,000 bricks and cost $300 to build (Barker 1924-1928:2:829). It is likely that Houston’s
first residents were purchasing ready-made cisterns of cypress wood to serve their needs (see, for example,
Beasley 1996:39, Figure 39; Scardino 1991:125, Figure 38). In 1837, the Telegraph and Texas Register
(TTR) advertised “an assortment of various sizes [of cisterns] made of best cypress lumber, with first rate iron
hoops” (TTR, 7 October 1837:3a). No doubt these were less expensive than the underground brick cisterns
that ranged in size from about 10,000 gallons to 75,000 gallons for a hotel (Morning Star [MS], 11 November
1841g). Despite the lower cost of above-ground cisterns, some residents still relied upon water hauled from
Buffalo Bayou for their gardens, or they bought it from peddlers or owners of wells or cisterns with surplus
water (MS 24 March 1840, 12 August 1841h; Scardino 1991:125). Public wells were also available (Harris
County Courthouse [HCC], Houston City Council Minutes, 6 March 1843:A:209; MS, 9 March 1843), but it
was not until 1888 that artesian wells were drilled and a regular public water supply introduced (Scardino
1991:125).
This chapter discusses standard nineteenth-century construction techniques for wells and cisterns and
describes characteristics of the two wells and 13 cisterns found during the Ball Park at Union Station
Archeological Project. Two additional water-related features, a spring house and an icehouse, are also
examined.
THE CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF WELLS
Wells were generally dug when surface water was not available or not accessible. Construction methods
varied depending upon the types of soils present and the height of the water table. Most of these methods are
documented in two classic sources by Noël Hume (1969) and Wigginton (1977) and are summarized below.
The approximate diameter of a well was from 3-5 ft (1-1.5 m), and was often based upon the shape of a
wagon wheel (Wigginton 1977:368). Size was likely related to the volume of dirt excavated and also to the
size of the excavator and his tools. A mattock and shovel were the tools of choice for a well digger, with the
handles cut off to fit the confined space of the well shaft (Wigginton 1977:373).
Digging the shaft was a dangerous undertaking, often hampered by soil types. Rocky soils, although harder to
dig, were probably safer for the well digger since the threat of wall collapse was smaller. In addition, there
was no need to line the well (Noël Hume 1969:28; Wigginton 1977:374). Digging with a chisel, however,
was tedious, and dynamiting was hazardous (Wigginton 1977:370-372). An overhead rock fall could be fatal
to the well digger, as could unpredictable noxious gases (Noël Hume 1969:13; Wigginton 1977:378-380).
The threat of collapse was greatest in sandy soils, but this could be overcome by using a wooden curb (Noël
Hume 1969:19-23). This flat, circular ring was used to line the well shaft from the top down during the
course of excavation (i.e., bricks were laid on the ring as dirt was removed from below the ring, the weight of
the bricks forcing the ring downward). Clay, like that in Houston, was considered to be stable especially when

283

dry, and a well could be lined after it was dug (Noël Hume 1969:13-17). It was also common to partially line
a well by extending the bricks or stones to within 4-6 ft (ca. 1.5 m) of the water level (i.e., leaving its bottom
unlined) (Wigginton 1977:372, 376).
Various accounts of well digging suggest that the depth of a well could be as little as 7 or 8 ft (ca. 2 m) (Noël
Hume 1969:12), or as much as 90 ft (27 m) (Wigginton 1977:380). Due to the confined space, only one
person could dig a well, but he generally had two companions to empty buckets and keep the surface around
the opening clear of debris (Wigginton 1977:367, 373). Sometimes, a shift of men would rotate the digging
to increase speed.
One of the biggest concerns of well diggers was the fear of objects falling from above (Wigginton 1977:376­
381). Even a small heavy object, such as a coin, could kill a well digger. It is thus not surprising that great
care was taken in selecting trustworthy helpers. Another fear was the threat of collapse. Once a shaft
collapsed, there was virtually no way to rescue the man trapped inside. Soft soils or cracks in clayey soils
gave rise to immediate concern and precautions were taken to brace the walls.
Noxious gases could incapacitate or even kill a man. A lighted lantern or torch could be lowered into a shaft
to check for gases, but more often than not a speedy retreat was the only solution until the gases dissipated.
Broken ropes had to be guarded against. A rope around the waist was a necessity for a hasty exit, but many a
well digger reached the top of the shaft only to tumble back in when his rope broke.
Wells in the Project Area
Only two wells were discovered during the Ball Park excavations: one in Block 117 (Feature 7024) and one in
Block 118 (Feature 2002) (see Chapter 17). Feature 7024, constructed of brick with a clay mantle, had an
interior diameter of approximately 36 in (91 cm). The upper courses consisted of partial pieces of mortared
brick, while the lower courses were whole and unmortared (Figure 19.1). This well showed evidence of
repair, which could be attributed to its proximity to Feature 7005, a brick spreader foundation. Buckling had
occurred in the foundation, probably from water seepage, and clay had been packed between it and the well.
Additionally, mortar had been hand-driven beneath the foundation’s basal planking.
The nature and extent of repairs on Feature 7024 suggests that it predated the foundation. First, the brick,
although similar to that in the foundation, was of somewhat lighter composition. Second, a notch had been
carved from the side of Feature 7024 to accommodate the foundation’s basal planking. These repairs also
suggest that the builders of the house foundation were unfamiliar with the plasticity of the Beaumont clays
that underlie the City of Houston. The small number of artifacts recovered from the well suggests that it may
have been filled during the period 1870-1915.
The second well, Feature 2002, similarly constructed of mortared bricks at the top and unmortared bricks
below, had an interior diameter of approximately 3 ft (1 m). It also had an exterior mantle of clay. This well
was bisected with a trackhoe and excavated to a depth of 33 ft (10 m). At its base, the diameter had narrowed
to 31 in (79 cm). The few artifacts recovered from the bottom section suggest that the well may have been
filled between 1870 and 1915.
Associated with Feature 2002 was a ground surface drain, Feature 2003, constructed of unmortared brick
(Figure 19.2) (see Chapter 17). The drain started at the curb of the well, where a single brick had been
removed, and extended 11 ft (ca. 3.5 m) to the north and then 13 ft (4 m) to the west. Overflow from the well
was likely being diverted to nearby Jackson Street. Excavations at the Reynolds House along the Savannah
River in Augusta, Georgia, exposed three similar drains associated with a well/cistern (Joseph 1993:245).

284

Features 7024 and 2002 were filled with nearly sterile dirt, likely brought in from elsewhere. Relatively few
artifacts were recovered, and it is doubtful that they were associated in any way with the use and
abandonment of the wells. As Noël Hume (1969:31) comments: “Most wells were cleaned out once a year
and were fitted with covers or roofed heads which prevented trash from falling into them. In most instances,
therefore, the filling was not deposited until the wells ceased to serve their original purpose, at which time
they became convenient repositories for trash.”

Figure 19.1. Well (Feature 7024) adjacent to
brick spreader foundation (Feature 7005).

It seems that the paucity of wells in the Project Area, compared to an abundance of cisterns, is not unusual in
urban settings. None was found during the investigation of Block 71 in Houston (Louis Berger and
Associates, Inc. 1997:IV-63), and only a few were found at the site of the Brown Convention Center in
Houston (Brown et al. 1985). Excavations in Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh have likewise yielded few
wells (Abell and Halsall 1996; Drozdin et al. 1989).
CISTERNS
An alternative to wells was the cistern. Cisterns were designed to collect rainwater and could be used alone or
as a supplement to a well. As the demand for water increased, due to population growth, environmental
conditions, or increased distances from water sources, etc., it became important to employ water storage
facilities. Typically, rainwater captured by cisterns was used for laundry, bathing, or gardening (Beasley
1996:81). The soft water was especially attractive to housewives, since it helped to make their laundry whiter
(Schroeder 1991:106-108). Its availability close at hand made washing clothes easier. Rainwater from a
cistern was also given to livestock (Allen 1858:312; Carlson 1984:24; Schroeder 1991:108). It was fit for
drinking if a filtering system was used.

285

Cisterns ranged in size and shape from simple oak barrels to elaborate brick structures partitioned for filters,
which could be constructed either above or below ground (Allen 1858:312). The simplest cistern, if not the
cheapest, was dug into the ground with plastered earthen walls (Jacques 1859:172-173). To enable the mortar
to adhere, the walls had to be sloped, producing a wide-mouthed structure with a narrow bottom. The wide
top was planked over and covered with about a foot of dirt. A curbed opening admitted water and was big
enough to allow cleaning of the interior. In cold weather, the opening was covered to prevent frost that could
cause cracks.

Figure 19.2. Ground-surface drain (Feature 2003)
constructed of unmortared brick and associated
with a well (Feature 2002).

A more durable cistern could be dug in the form of a cylinder, lined with lime-mortared brick or stone and
plastered with a half-inch of cement on the interior. In wet soils, the “whole wall should be laid in water
lime” (Jacques 1859:173). The upper portion of this type of cistern was arched toward the center to create a
smaller opening. A layer of gravel or paving stones, cemented over, lined the base. Two to three layers of
cement were necessary to prevent the cistern from leaking.
A cistern could have a filtering system added. The filter was partitioned down the center of the cistern cavity
and had openings at the bottom to allow water to flow between the two sides (Jacques 1859:173). A shallow
wall was placed on either side of the partition. Between the wall and the partition were placed alternating
layers of charcoal, sand, and gravel. When water was introduced on one side of the cistern, it would flow
through the filter to emerge, pure and clean, on the other side.

286

Other systems required an above-ground filter to purify the water before it entered the cistern (Jacques
1859:173). This could be done by means of an intermediate tank, containing the filter, which caught the
rainwater and transferred it to the below-ground cistern through a pipe. Or, as in the case of Feature 7021, a
filter box was attached to the exterior of a cistern (see Chapter 17).
By the mid nineteenth century, there was awareness of the health benefits of drinking cistern water rather than
well water (Schroeder 1991:111-113). Indeed, distinctions between the benefits of hard water from wells and
springs and soft water from cisterns were recognized. While the contamination of water from cracks had
always been recognized, the cleaning of silt from the bottom of the cistern and the introduction of filtering
systems became more and more of a requirement.
Simple plastered cisterns predating 1855 have frequently been found on archeological sites in Illinois
(Schroeder 1991:111). Documentary sources indicate that this method was declining by mid century,
primarily because of its fragile nature and propensity for contamination. Between 1855 and 1900, most
historic references to cisterns indicate that they were constructed of brick or stone, and it is these that are most
commonly found on archeological sites. After 1900, poured concrete cisterns were preferred. In Galveston,
cisterns were already disappearing by the late nineteenth century (Beasley 1996:91).
In Bell County, Texas, a bell-shaped brick cistern built ca. 1915-1918 was excavated by Carlson (1984), who
notes:
A hole was initially dug for the mouth of the cistern using picks and shovels. The bell-shaped cavity
of the cistern was finished off by hand and the dirt removed using a winch. A thin 3/4 inch layer of
mortar covered the base of the cistern. The bricks were then laid from the bottom up and also covered
with 3/4 inch of cement. A small wooden cover protected the cistern and a rope and pulley were used
to haul water up in a bucket [Carlson 1984:23].

At the same site, a poured concrete cistern constructed in 1930 was dug in a similar manner, except that
dynamite was used to blast out the interior cavity (Carlson (1984:23-24). This cistern’s interior was covered
with a thin layer of plaster. A wooden form was used for its neck, which was topped with a concrete cap
supporting a cast-iron pump. The fill in both of these cisterns represented post-abandonment fill with 1940s
material occurring midway through the deposits (Carlson 1984:76, Table 12). In fact, post-abandonment
filling of deep shaft features is not uncommon on archeological sites (Noël Hume 1969:31).
Cisterns in the Project Area
Cisterns were more common than wells in the Project Area. Thirteen below-ground brick cisterns were
recorded during the course of the project, and it is likely that many more above-ground cisterns were present
in the past. Of the 13 cisterns, only seven were excavated; because of their depth, they were bisected with a
trackhoe (see Chapter 17). The cisterns were primarily excavated to record the size and extent of the features
rather than to recover artifacts.
Comparing the excavated cisterns, it was evident that there were two sizes and two shapes represented in the
Project Area. Feature 1001, which represents one size and shape (Figure 19.3), consisted of a cylindrical,
flat-floored, brick-lined cistern with 1 in (2.5 cm) of mortar plastered on its interior and exterior walls. The
interior diameter of this cistern measured approximately 75 in (190 cm). With a surmised depth of 9 ft (3 m),
it had a volume capacity of 1,976 gallons (7,469 liters).
Feature 4002 represents the second size of cylindrical cistern found in the Project Area. Although constructed
in a manner similar to Feature 1001, this cistern had an approximate interior diameter of 106 in (269 cm), a
surmised depth of 11 ft (ca. 3.5 m), and a volume of 4,992 gallons (18,870 liters). The difference in size is

287

attributed to the location of the cisterns. Whereas Feature 1001 was located on the interior of a block, Feature
4002 was located on a corner. This suggests that the smaller size served a single household and that the larger
may have been a communal cistern.

Figure 19.3. Cylindrical, flat-floored, brick-lined
cistern (Feature 1001).

Feature 11001 represents a second shape of cistern, referred to as a beehive (Figure 19.4) (see Chapter 17). It
had a flat base like the other cisterns, but its walls gradually sloped inward. Moreover, it was plastered on the
exterior with 6 in (15 cm) of clay; the other cisterns were mortared on both the interior and exterior. This
difference in shape has been attributed either to its age (post 1870) or to a different builder.
Cisterns in the Project Area were sometimes associated with gutters and filter boxes. Feature 7045 (Figure
19.5) was one such gutter that connected the house represented by Feature 7005 (a brick spreader foundation)
to Feature 7018 (a cistern). The single layer of mortared brick showed evidence of other brick layers,
indicating that this gutter may represent a covered filter box. As a result of damage to the cistern, there was
no evidence to show the manner in which it was connected to the gutter.
Feature 7021, another filter box, was mortared on the exterior and connected to Feature 7020, a cistern. A
second covered gutter was found adjacent to the first, with evidence to show that the first had been abandoned
due to its narrow opening. The second gutter had a larger opening, a better angle, and a charcoal filter.

Three drains and four cisterns of similar type to those at the site were recovered while excavating Houston’s
Block 71 (Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. 1997:IV-3, 4, 64). Although public water lines ran along one
side of Block 71 in 1885 and along three sides of it by 1896, the cisterns apparently continued to be used until

289

they were filled around the turn of the century. The only notable difference between the Block 71 cisterns
and the Ball Park cisterns was the presence of a builder’s trench around one of the cisterns.
Rain-catchment studies in Hawaii have identified four variables necessary for a successful roof-catchment
cistern system: weekly rainfall (input), catchment area (roof area), storage (cistern), and consumption (Fok et
al. 1980:33). All variables except weekly rainfall can be controlled. Fok et al. (1980:20-21) estimate that if
the average roof area for a residence is 2,150 ft2 and the collection of effective rainfall is one inch, this will
produce 1,320 gallons of water. This would give a family 13.4 days of water supply at 100 gallons a day.
The researchers further estimate that the minimum water consumption for a family of four would be 20
gallons for cooking and dishwashing, 35 gallons for laundry, 65 gallons for bathing, and 80 gallons for waste,
or 50 gallons per person per day (Fok et al. 1980). In Houston, the average annual rainfall is 48 in (Stephens
and Holmes 1989:5). Using the same-sized catchment area, this would produce 63,360 gallons of water
annually, providing 174 gallons per day consumption. Although water consumption in the nineteenth century
was certainly different from that of the present century, these figures give an estimate of how much water was
needed to keep cisterns full.
ICEHOUSES, MILK COOLERS, AND REFRIGERATORS
Prior to the widespread use of electricity in the 1930s, when the Rural Electrification Association was
established, food storage for perishable items was dependent upon the use of ice. While various methods
were employed, all relied upon some type of lined box with either ice or water as the cooling agent.
Excavations in the Project Area revealed two features (7003 and 7009), which are believed to have been used
for cooling purposes.
As a frozen commodity, ice requires an airtight storage area to maintain its cooling properties. Although
typically called an icehouse, these storage units frequently fell short of being any kind of house. Built either
above or below ground, typical icehouses were approximately 3 x 3 ft (1 x 1 m), the objective being to isolate
the ice and create around it a barrier of non-conducting materials (Allen 1858:316; Jacques 1859:174). The
most effective houses had double or triple walls set 6-18 in (15-46 cm) apart, with the intervening spaces
filled with sawdust, straw, or ‘tan bark.’ Insulation was also required on the top and bottom, and drains were
needed to carry off water. Packing the ice in large, closely wedged blocks during the coldest weather would
often help ensure a longer life span.
With a supply of ice available, small quantities could be regularly removed to cool food stored in an icebox or
a refrigerator. As one early description notes:
No refrigerator or ice-box will prevent, or even retard the melting of the ice, which does not combine
the following conditions: It must have double sides, bottom, and lid, with the space between the two
casings filled with some non-conducting substance, in order to exclude the external temperature; and
the inner lid or cover should be practically, if not hermetically, air tight, in furtherance of the same
result. If external air enters, it will bring its own temperature with it. There should be also a drainage
pipe at the bottom to carry off, instantaneously, every drop of water formed by the melting of the ice,
and this pipe should either be fitted with a trap or curved in such a manner as to prevent the cold air
from escaping. It is even more indispensable to carry off every drop of the water than it is to exclude
the air – a view not generally entertained by consumers of the article, but which, according to
experiments made, seems to be fully demonstrated. Thus, on exposing a piece of ice weighing, say 25
pounds to the air, at a temperature of 75 degrees, but so placed that it is perfectly drained, it will be
found to have scarcely disappeared at the end of 24 hours. Wrap the same piece in 3 or 4 thicknesses
of blanket or flannel, and place it in a small tub exposed to the same temperature, and as the water
filters through the blanket, the ice will stand in its own water, and will be all dissolved in 5 or 6 hours.
Wrap the same piece of ice carefully in a blanket, and place it on a grating, or on four crossed sticks,
so that no water can accumulate underneath, and at the end of 3 or even 4 days it will not have entirely
melted [Dick 1972:173 (1872)].

290

According to manufacturing reports for Philadelphia in 1857, zinc was used “principally for the lining of
Refrigerators, Filters, Bath Tubs, Cisterns, &c., . . . ” (Freedley 1858:418-419). Zinc was also used for lining
milk dishes and fixed milk coolers. Alternatively, these were lined with block-tin, tin, or lead, despite
warnings that chemical reactions with the milk could result in poisoning (Stephens 1853:271). In the 1870s,
Catherine Beecher (1873:348) recommended that refrigerators be stored in a cellar. Specifically, she
described the refrigerator, “or a large wooden box,” as being “on feet, with a lining of tin or zinc, and a space
between the tin and wood filled with powdered charcoal, having at the bottom a place for ice, a drain to carry
off the water, and also movable shelves and partitions.”
As early as 1805, refrigerated rail cars packed with ice were transporting meat carcasses across the country
(Brockett 1871:229). By the 1830s, carcasses were transported by ship to distant ports, such as the East
Indies. Exportation of refrigerated meats was so successful that by the 1870s, efforts were being made to
import beef from South America and mutton from Australia. At the same time, live fish were also
transported. An 1874 description of an ‘aquarium car’ suggests that the wooden box that lined Feature 7009
may have originated as some type of refrigerated shipping crate (Stone 1874:231). An aquarium car was
designed to carry live fish by rail from the East Coast to California. Within the car, a tank was constructed of
2-in (5 cm) planks lined with zinc and bound on the exterior with iron rods. Extending across the width of the
car and measuring 8 ft (2 m) long, the tank could hold as much as 10,000 pounds of water that drained
through the bottom when fresh water was added. Smaller, portable tanks were also used, and all were kept
cool by massive quantities of ice stored in an icebox at one end of the car. The ice melted so rapidly that over
a ton and a half per day was consumed, and every available space in the car was filled with ice.
Spring houses were also used for cooling perishable foods, particularly milk, butter, and cheese (Wigginton
1977:347-361). They relied upon cool spring water flowing through a house constructed over the spring and
did not require the use of ice. The usual manner of construction involved excavation of a basin lined with
rocks. This allowed a reservoir of water to accumulate where buckets could be dipped for drinking water.
Shelves were attached to the rock walls of this basin for storage of food and a roof was attached over all.
Sometimes a spring house lay beneath the dwelling house. Eli Bowen (1855:202) describes the lower portion
of an abandoned log house near Berryville in Clarke County, Virginia, where “a beautiful fount of water
gushed from the rocks in one corner of it.” The spring house could also be as simple as a few flagstones
propped over the spring to serve as a storage shelf (Bonath 1978). A poem written in 1862 by Mary E. Nealy
describes the spring house as follows:
And below a spreading beech-tree, at the bottom of the hill,
Are the remnants of the ‘spring-house’ and the moisture of a rill,
Where the gushing spring once bubbled, and across the rude logs lay,
And the milk was kept so cool and sweet it never turned to whey.

Icehouses and Milk Coolers in the Project Area
Feature 7009 in Block 117 is believed to have had multiple uses. The wooden box removed from this feature
was probably a shipping crate recycled as a milk cooler and later used as a privy. Built of cypress, the box
had interior dimensions of 7 ft x 4.5 ft (ca. 2 x 1.5 m) with a volume of about 531 gallons (2,007 liters) (see
Chapter 17).
The presence of exterior bolts, zinc strips, and white caulk-like material beneath the zinc in Feature 7009 is
consistent with historic descriptions of coolers. Efforts to seal the joints demonstrate that this was a
watertight container prior to its use as a privy. Obvious patching and irregular-sized pieces of zinc also show
that this box was reused. Engraved Roman numerals along the basal planks suggest that it was assembled
elsewhere.

291

The absence of metal stripping and caulk in some areas may argue that this structure could no longer serve its
original purpose and was converted to another use, such as a milk cooler. Documentary evidence indicates
that Jane Wells ran a dairy at this location during the mid nineteenth century (see Chapter 8). The shipping
crate would have made an ideal milk cooler. As the zinc lining deteriorated over the years, or as her dairy
operation ceased, conversion to a privy is a possibility. Numerous abrasions, some relatively deep, were
found on the floor surface. Although these could have occurred at any time, they may have resulted from
successive cleaning when the structure was used as a privy. It is presumed that metal strips originally covered
all of the floor seams, and that the activities that caused the numerous abrasions removed portions of the lead
strips.
A second cooler, Feature 7003, was rectangular, constructed of brick, and exhibited interior plaster (Figure
19.6). Although first taken for a privy due to its small size (4 x 3 ft [ca. 1 x 1 m]) , this feature was redefined
as a spring house or milk cooler on the basis of its plaster lining, a clear indication that it was meant to hold
water. Alternatively, the plaster may have been intended to keep water out. If so, the feature may have been a
root cellar or other underground storage facility.

Figure 19.6. Plaster-lined brick cooler (Feature 7003).

SUMMARY
Thirteen cisterns, two wells, and two coolers were found during the course of the investigation. Cisterns were
clearly preferred over wells, although this may be a reflection of water quality, water availability, or the
difficult clay soils in the area. There is also some indication that wells predate cisterns, although this may not
hold true with a larger sample. The coolers are evidence that food preservation was a concern in the hot,
humid climate of Houston.
The cisterns represent two different shapes, oblong and beehive, and have capacities ranging from about
2,000 to about 5,000 gallons (7,560-18,900 liters). Their similarity in construction suggests that they were
built by a local craftsman. The large number of cisterns is perhaps a reflection of the “‘miasma’ theory of
disease [which] was seen as justification for private home owners to maintain a private water supply or
292

storage system, as either a supplement to or in place of public systems” (Louis Berger and Associates, Inc.
1997:IV-64).
Limited artifacts recovered from the cisterns indicate that they were filled between the 1860s and the 1930s,
confirming the hypothesis that they continued to be used after the introduction of piped water.

PART VI
THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

20
RESULTS OF THE BALL PARK AT UNION STATION
ARCHEOLOGICAL PROJECT
Shawn Bonath Carlson

The archeological investigation of the Ball Park at Union Station Project Area has documented significant
remnants of Houston’s past. Massive brick cisterns, decaying wood, shattered pottery, and pieces of bone
and seeds are but a few of the items recovered through excavation. The presence of relatively expensive
decorated ceramics and glassware suggests that residents had easy access to manufactured products and
were financially capable of purchasing them. An absence of agricultural items shows that they were not
dependent upon the land but were most likely of a merchant class. Whereas preceding chapters describe
the historical environment, the excavations, and the artifacts, this chapter strives to pull together these
various bodies of data to understand Houston’s past in a broader context.
Eleven city blocks were examined during this project, but only those lots with documentary evidence of
pre-1870 structures were considered for investigation (see Chapter 2). For this reason, far fewer features
were excavated on some blocks than on others. Block 117, for example, revealed pre-1870 features on
nearly every lot, but Block 194 yielded no artifacts and Block 195 had an abundance of late-dating
material and so were not examined beyond the testing phase. Block 206 had a high number of features
and artifacts that appeared to predate 1870. Further examination, however, revealed the entire block was
a redeposited midden (i.e., nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts were mixed across the site).
Samples from the interiors of the cisterns on this block dated well into the twentieth century. After each
feature had been mapped, and the matrix closely examined, it was decided not to excavate the features on
Block 206.
SITE STRUCTURE
In the early stages of the investigation, it was apparent that shaft features were not as deep as expected.
Comparing elevations of similar features from block to block, it became clear that most of the Project
Area had probably been bladed around 1908, when the Houston, Belt and Terminal Railway was
constructed. It was estimated that the upper 16 in (40 cm) of the original surface was destroyed, based
mostly upon the presence or absence of cistern necks across the site. This, of course, affected the testing
strategy.
The investigation began with exploratory backhoe trenches, but that strategy was abandoned during the
first week, since it provided no evidence of subsurface features. More success was achieved with
backhoe blading, but the number of features uncovered was fewer than expected; shallow features, in
particular, were not apparent. With 16 in (40 cm) of cultural material missing, the undisturbed part of the
site was well into Houston’s greasy black gumbo clay thus eliminating any stratigraphic interpretation
other than within features.
The investigation thus focused on shaft features. The sampling strategy, which had been developed in
advance of excavation, concentrated on lots with documentary evidence of pre-1870 structures. As those
lots were bladed, the exposed features were examined for artifacts, and a determination was made as to
whether they dated prior to or post 1870. Pre-1870 features were tested, but post-1870 features were not.

294

When this distinction could not be made, testing was implemented. Testing was defined by the sectioning
of each feature, mapping its profile, and screening that section. If the feature was considered significant,
the remainder of it was excavated during the mitigation phase of the project.
In all, 215 features were recorded on 11 blocks within the 17-block Project Area. Almost 40 percent of
these (n=80) on six blocks were determined to predate 1870 and were completely excavated. Some
27,685 artifacts were recovered from these excavated features. Brick structures, cisterns and wells,
postholes, privies, and refuse deposits comprised the major feature categories.
ARTIFACTS
Ceramic vessel sherds (n=2,708) are the fourth most commonly occurring artifact type in the analyzed
assemblage. Taken together, these sherds represent some 867 vessels from 62 features (see Chapter 9).
Broken ceramics were more likely to be discarded in sheet refuse rather than in existing pits or privies,
based upon the presence of recaptured sheet refuse and the absence of vessels that could be reconstructed.
Overall, the assemblage was representative of middle-class households as described in Appendix G.
The glass assemblage accounts for 7,244 artifacts and 573 identifiable vessels, including 386 containers,
155 pieces of tableware, and 32 items classified as ‘other.’ Glass is the second most commonly occurring
artifact in the assemblage and was recovered from foundations, brick piers, postholes, wells, cisterns,
privies, and refuse deposits and trash pits. The bottle and tableware collections span a period during
which manufacturing techniques changed rapidly, and evidence of these techniques has been documented
(see Chapter 10 and Appendix E). Various pressed-glass patterns and proprietary medicines and toiletries
support the argument for the presence of middle-class households (see Chapter 9).
An array of architectural materials, hardware, and furnishing goods was available to Houstonians in the
1830s but were not supplied locally until the 1850s (see Chapter 11). Bricks and nails manufactured in
Houston predominate in the assemblage, but weapons and ammunition and agricultural and transportation
artifacts were also found. The detailed analysis of recovered bricks reveals that those used to construct
the James Wells house (Feature 7005) are somewhat smaller and more consistently made than other
handmade bricks across the site. A single tabby brick was found.
Clothing accessories, personal items, and recreational items were found in small quantities across the site,
and some of those with diagnostic qualities are described in Chapter 12. These include buttons (china,
shell, metal, bone, glass, rubber), fasteners and eyelets, beads (drawn, wound, molded, blown), footwear,
toothbrushes, combs, razors, pocket knives, fans, eyewear, marbles (stone, glass, ceramic), dolls, tea sets,
pipes (white clay, stub-stemmed), musical instruments, slate, and sewing materials.
Vertebrate remains from 22 features on four blocks suggest a reliance on commercially butchered meat,
especially beef (see Chapter 13). Evidence of handsaw use and the lack of discarded elements (heads,
feet) indicate these animals were not butchered on site. Meat cuts range from the most to least expensive
and occurred together, suggesting culinary trends or ease of preparation rather than economic
significance. Other taxa recovered include pig, sheep/goat, chicken, turkey, and duck.
Plant remains were examined from 48 flotation samples and 199 macroplant samples (see Chapter 14).
From these, 37 taxa were identified from 17,000 seeds and 3,000 wood fragments. These analyses
revealed the nineteenth-century project environment supported an undergrowth of weeds, grass, and
sunflowers, with an overstory of elm, chinaberry, basswood, pine, and oak trees. Plum, peach, pecan,
hickory, and walnut trees were also present. Dietary plants included imported rice and coffee and locally
grown watermelon, beans, squash, corn, and other melons. Orchard plants, such as apples, apricots,
plums, peaches, and fig, were also evident.

295

A pollen study of features from three blocks included five privies and three refuse deposits (see Chapter
15). Pine, wild grasses, sunflower, ragweed, myrtle, oak, and Cheno-Am comprise the pollen types
associated with the project environment. Those associated with diet consist of mustards, cereals, cloves,
dewberries, strawberries, grapes, and maize.
Dendrochronology samples were examined from two features, the foundation boards from the James
Wells house (Feature 7005) and the boards used in construction of the Wells’ privy (Feature 7009) (see
Chapter 16). The foundation boards were sawn in a vertical saw pit, possibly prior to the 1840s, from
juvenile pine and old-growth bald cypress trees. The privy box, also constructed from bald cypress, had
been planed, removing any technological data; the tree rings do not resemble those of the house
foundation.

FEATURES
Table 20.1 presents a block-by-block summary of the features tested/mitigated in the Project Area. Each
feature has been defined and a date range established, based upon the artifacts found within the feature.
The artifact category used for dating is listed, as is the name of any family associated with the site during
that time range.
The features recorded were those that survived the 1908 construction of the Houston, Belt and Terminal
Railway, when the area was leveled and bladed. Hence, those features that were excavated were missing
approximately the top 40 cm of (possible) cultural material. Nonetheless, the most significant feature
identified during the project was a massive brick spreader (stepped) foundation identified as the home of
James Wells and constructed around 1848 (see Chapters 17 and 18). Interior dimensions of the
foundation measured 38 ft long x 18 ft wide (12 x 6 m). When initially constructed, a shallow trench was
filled with coarse sand, and a series of short (35 in [90 cm]) planks was laid perpendicular to the trench.
These planks were then overlain with longer (16 ft [5 m]) planks positioned parallel to the trench to help
level the bricks. Five courses of bricks were intact when the foundation was uncovered.
Several series of postholes were also found on the Wells property, representing different phases of the
lot’s use. One posthole was excavated through the brick foundation of the house. Brick piers, too, were
identified. Thirteen cisterns were found, seven of which were excavated. The size range of these cisterns
suggests that some were used by the community while others were for household use. A few had
associated gutters and filters. Of the two wells identified, one had a gutter that allowed overflow to run
out into the street. The six excavated privies represented different types of construction techniques, i.e.,
some were lined (using various methods) and some were not. Refuse deposits (shallow depressions) were
distinguished from trash pits (deep, intentionally dug pits). A single landscaping feature, a ceramic bottle
garden border, was constructed of stoneware water bottles.
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
The Project Area in the nineteenth century was a relatively well-to-do residential neighborhood known as
Quality Hill, which was also home to a number of foreign immigrants. Chapter 3 posed several research
questions related to the variables of wealth, ethnicity, and function. While it was not possible to find
indicators of function, new information regarding the socioeconomic position and cultural heritage of the
residents was brought to light.
The criteria used in determining the wealth of the Quality Hill residents included information on their real
and personal property, their occupations, and the types of artifacts recovered. Census records provided
data on their ethnicity, which was reflected, in some instances, in the archeological record.

The initial 17-block Project Area lies adjacent to the original 62 blocks of Houston that were platted
parallel to Buffalo Bayou in 1836 (McComb 1981:13, Figure 2). By early 1837, Houston had become a
bustling hub of nearly 1,500 people. Only two years later, the Project Area was absorbed and platted as
part of the town. In 1850, Houston was one of the four largest cities in Texas, yet its population had
reached only about 2,500. Unlike contemporary New York, New Orleans, or San Francisco, Houston had
a distinctly rural nature but still functioned as an urban center and a port city. Documented data for
Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Galveston in 1850 are examined in the following discussion to
provide a comparative framework within which to study the archeological data.
Wealth of the Quality Hill Residents
Information on real property was available for only 18 of the 49 family heads affiliated with excavated
features in the Project Area (Table 20.2). Only 15 of these 18 had their real property values recorded in
the federal census reports. Of the remaining three, two were slave owners but had no other real property
recorded; the third was a land agent known to have ‘over a million acres in his personal possession,’
although his real property was not recorded in the censuses (see Chapter 8). Five of the 18 people were
slave owners, owning four or fewer slaves.

Of the 15 family heads whose real property values were recorded, eight had holdings in the range of
$1,000-$4,999 (see Table 20.2). Only one person was in the $500-$999 range, two were in the $20,000$49,999 range. Campbell and Lowe’s (1977:94-95) study of real property holdings in Texas in 1850
found that the average holdings statewide was $1,461. In towns, it was $1,857. Town holdings tended to
be higher because of unequal distribution of the property (i.e., a small percentage of families controlled
most of the wealth). In this small sample of 15 families, two family heads controlled 59 percent of the

303

wealth. In fact, the average of real property value for these 15 families was $7,860, which is considerably
higher than the statewide average of $1,857.
Historical records for slaveholding indicate that only 16 percent of town families owned slaves in 1850
compared to 30 percent statewide. This sample was closer to the statewide sample, with 28 percent of
families owning slaves. The number of slaves owned per family is on target: Town families owned fewer
slaves, averaging four per family, than families statewide (7.2 per family) (Campbell and Lowe 1977:94).
In 1850, 62 percent of Texas’ urban wealth was controlled by 4.7 percent of the family. Sixty-two
percent controlled less than 1 percent; over half owned no real property at all. Town dwelling family
heads with holdings of 10 or more bondsmen accounted for 1.4 percent of town populations, while 84
percent had no slaves. Real property was controlled by a small number of town dwellers in 1850.
Occupation has also been associated with wealth, and varies between rural and urban populations
(Campbell and Lowe 1977:92-94, 104-105). For instance, in 1850, 2.5 percent of urban Texans were
farmers. Compare this with 71 percent statewide. Skilled tradespeople (37 percent) represented the
largest occupational group in urban Texas, while manufacturers (0.7 percent) represented the smallest. In
the Project Area, 34 of the 49 heads of households linked to archeological features had identified
occupations, while the remaining 15 had none listed (Table 20.3). Skilled tradespeople were the most
numerous heads of household (33 percent) in the Project Area, although manufacturers were not
represented. According to Campbell and Lowe (1977:95), “compared with the typical Texas family head,
the urban dweller was less likely to be . . . American [born], less likely to be a farmer, less likely to own
slaves, less likely to be a large slave owner if he did own bondsmen, but more likely to own more real or
personal property.”
Ethnicity in the Project Area
The influx of foreign-born immigrants to Texas during the nineteenth century compels this researcher to
consider ethnicity as a viable research objective. With millions of acres of public lands becoming
available in 1836, when Texas became an independent republic, settlers rushed to take advantage of the
opportunity to own large tracts of land (Miller 1972:xi). The 1840s thus were not only an intense period
of land speculation but also were one of entrepreneurship, as people like the Allen brothers sought to
increase their financial holdings through the development of towns. In 1850, the populations of Houston
(population 2,500), San Antonio (population 3,500), and Galveston (population 4,117) consisted of onethird to one-half foreign-born residents (Campbell and Lowe 1977:90-93). Austin, a crossroads of only
629 people, was mostly Anglo at this time.
In 1850, 71 percent of Houston’s 598 foreign-born residents were German (Campbell and Lowe 1977:9293). English, Irish, and French residents each accounted for about 8 percent of the remainder.
Galveston’s foreign-born population was similar to that of Houston, as was Austin’s, but much smaller in
number. In San Antonio, Mexicans represented 45 percent of the foreign-born residents, while Germans
represented 33 percent; the remaining foreign-born came from various other countries.
The number of foreign-born people residing in urban areas was much higher than the statewide average of
14 percent (Campbell and Lowe 1977:9), and while ethnicity in the archeological record has been widely
argued, Farnsworth (1993) demonstrates that clear markers can be attributed to people of different
cultural backgrounds. These same markers can be applied to the Ball Park data.
Throughout the Project Area, archeological remains were linked to landowners whose place of birth was
known from documentary records. Little activity could be discerned for 1800-1824 (Table 20.4). The
exception was Block 117, where two features were identified to the first quarter of the nineteenth century.
Both were linked to previous landowners who had migrated to Texas from elsewhere in the United States.

Between 1825 and 1849, a considerable influx of immigrants into the Project Area occurred, and was
perhaps a response to the Allen brothers’ advertisements promoting their new town (Campbell and Lowe
1977:91). In addition to the minor activity on Block 117, Blocks 103 and 162 reflected an increasing
number of occupants. Block 103’s features were linked to an Irish landowner, while those on Block 162
were linked to an Hispanic landowner. Block 117’s features were mostly associated with the activities of
an American landowner, but a few of the lots were sold to French and German families.
During the period 1850-1874, the remaining blocks of the Project Area were sold, and lots began to
exchange hands quickly. Block 103 was predominantly owned by an English family with slaves; there

307

was some turnover to German and American owners. Block 118, whose residents were American and
German, boasted the wealthiest landowner, who also happened to be a slave owner. Block 162 remained
in the hands of an Hispanic landowner until 1860, when the property was sold to a German family. The
single lot investigated on Block 173 was associated with an American landowner. Lastly, Block 117
showed the greatest diversity with an influx not only of French, German, and Irish immigrants as on the
other blocks, but also of Italians, Scots, Mexicans, and Canadians.
The period 1875-1899 was outside our purview, but a few features were represented because they were
either used over a period of time or were difficult to place chronologically. Regardless, the pattern of
ethnic diversity continued until the end of the century. Foreign-born residents were clearly a significant
factor in the development of Houston.
A hierarchical cluster analysis using the Ward method (Anderberg 1973; SPSS, Inc. 1997) suggests that
ethnicity may indeed be a significant factor in the interpretation of feature data. Eight out of 10 features
(1048B, 5008, 7001, 7003, 7005, 7008, 7009, 7031) in one cluster had the common variable of German
ancestry. Features 7005, 7008, and 7009 were attributed to Martin Floeck, a brewer from Prussia whose
wife was also Prussian. Feature 5008 was traced to another Prussian couple, William and Teresa Cohen.
Features 7003 and 7031 were attributed to Louis Harde, a grocer who migrated from Oldenburg with his
Sicilian wife. Lastly, Features 1048B and 7001 were tied to the Troutvetter [Trautvetter] family. Emma
Trautvetter Stansfield and her family, including her sister, Anna, were linked to Feature 1048B, while
Otto Troutvetter, possibly Emma and Anna’s brother, is linked to Feature 7001.
These features include three privies, four brick foundations, and a single refuse deposit. Overall, the
variability of artifacts between features is limited, although privies and brick foundations do seem to veer
from this trend. This suggests the possibility that ethnicity may account for the variation.
The Archeological Data
Four landowners were selected for study based upon (1) known occupations, (2) known real property
values, and (3) affiliation with features containing undisturbed contexts from their occupation of the site.
These individuals are James Dumble, Henry Sampson, James Wells, and Martin Floeck, and the
assemblages from features associated with them were assessed for items that might be indications of
wealth. Using the same four residents, the ceramic and glass assemblages were examined for indications
of heritage. Sampson, Wells, and their wives, although probably of Euroamerican descent, were all born
in America. Dumble and his wife were from England, and Floeck and his wife were German.
James F. Dumble, who resided at the corner of Prairie and Crawford streets for over 40 years, was a
partner with the company of Peel and Dumble on Commerce Street in 1866 (see Appendix B). His
household consisted of himself and his wife, Mary, both natives of England, as well as their five children
and three slaves. In the 1860 Census, Dumble valued his real property at $2,000 and his personal
property at $500. Three features (1025, 1063, and 1065) were associated solely with his ownership of the
property. Ceramics, glass, and faunal remains recovered from those features are representative of a wellto-do middle-class family (see Table 20.4). In particular, an ironstone tureen, a pitcher, platter fragments,
and matching ironstone vessels were found. In the nineteenth century, large vessels were quite expensive
and prohibitive in cost to many, even by today’s standards. Matching vessels were considered luxury
items (see Chapter 9). Some of the other ceramics recovered from these features are decorated (e.g., blue
shell edging, hand painted, molded), indicative of more costly wares, although the porcelain samples are
all undecorated. Ironstone/whitewares were imported from various English potteries, including Charles
Meigh & Sons (Hanley), J. W. Pankhurst (Hanley), Thomas, John, and Joseph Mayer (Longport), and
James Edwards & Son. A recovered ironstone colander is especially noteworthy, as is a British brown
salt-glazed ink bottle and an imported stoneware vessel.

308

The glass assemblage from Dumble’s lot includes an assortment of tableware. Fluted and patterned
tumblers and stemmed Ashburton were especially common. (Patent) medicine bottles (e.g., a bottle with
a pouring beak, a vial, and an apothecary jar) and a toiletry bottle were also found. While these items
represent purchases readily available to the urban dweller of the nineteenth century, they also represent
more than basic needs.
Faunal remains include chicken, pig, goat, and cow, with at least one shank ham and one short loin
represented. Meat cuts range from inexpensive to expensive. In Chapter 13, Shaffer notes that cow
predominated; cuts were consistent across the Project Area.
Pollen studies revealed traces of mustards and cereal grains, along with corn, grapes, and cloves in
Feature 1065, a privy dating from the 1840s to the 1870s (see Chapter 15). Cereal grains reflect a typical
diet filled with bread and baked goods, whereas corn, a dominant grain crop, was shunned by most
Europeans. Grapes and mustard represent cultivated garden plants, but cloves were a high-commodity
trade item.
In the Dumble assemblage, nearly all of the ceramics were of British origin. This is not surprising, given
that American refined earthenwares were not widely available until later in the century. However, the
presence of British brown salt-glazed stoneware and Bristol glazed stoneware is significant, particularly
since few others were found. The recovered glass tableware is also of little diagnostic value, as is some
of the bottle glass. Wine, beer, and champagne certainly must have originated in Europe during this
period, but because of their abundance on all archeological sites, coupled with the absence of
distinguishing marks, it is impossible to attribute these to ethnic preferences. One bottle in the
assemblage, however, was manufactured by Thomas Wood in Portobello, Scotland. Manufactures of
Portobello, located near Edinburgh along the Firth of Forth, would have been easily accessible and known
to residents of England. Only one other bottle from Portobello was recovered, and it was associated with
Louis Harde, a native of Oldenburg, across the North Sea. Finally, three canning jars from Dumble’s lot
were distinguished by embossed crowns on the bases. Toulouse (1969:17-19) illustrates several similar
embossed crowns and attributes them to Canadian manufacture.
Catherine Gray Sampson, wife of Henry Sampson and daughter of William Fairfax Gray, had real
property valued at $40,000 and personal property valued at $25,000 in 1860 (see Appendix B). Peter,
Catherine’s brother, owned all of Block 118 in 1850 and gradually sold or deeded various lots to family
members over the years. Catherine may have resided on the northeast corner of Block 118 from 18581869 (see Chapter 8). Her other brothers, A. C. and Edwin, lived on the northwest and southwest corners,
respectively. Feature 2001 may be associated with her ownership of the site. Unfortunately, with the
exception of a single pontil-scarred perfume bottle, most artifacts postdate her occupation of the site
(Table 20.5).
James Wells, whose real property was valued at $1,380 in 1846, initially owned all of Block 117 (see
Chapter 8 and Appendix B). Over the years, he sold off most of the tracts while retaining his homestead
lot. Three features (7008, 7013, and 7026) are associated with his ownership, and the artifacts recovered
are a reflection of his social standing. Moir (Chapter 9) identifies the ceramic assemblages from these
features as ‘middle class.’ Most pieces are decorated with shell edging, transfer printing, hand painting,
finger painting, sponging, spattering, and molding. The glass assemblage (see Chapter 10) includes
several items of tableware, such as fluted, faceted, and ribbed tumblers; a wine goblet; contact-molded
hollowware; and a champagne bottle. The presence of medium-sized mammals and pig are evidenced by
faunal remains.
Martin Floeck, a Prussian brewer, was the subsequent owner of James Wells’ homestead lot. In 1860, his
real property was valued at $10,000 and his personal property at $5,000. Floeck’s occupation of the site

309

has been associated with Feature 7009, a privy. The ceramics recovered include shell-edged wares, flow
blue wares, molded and paneled wares, and molded porcelain. German and English stoneware was also
found. The glassware is not unlike that in the Wells assemblage and includes fluted, faceted, and ribbed
tumblers; stemware; a pressed-glass bowl; a contact-molded bowl; ribbed hollowware; and a toiletry
bottle manufactured by Pinaud’s of Paris, France. Faunal remains are more diverse, representing chicken,
goat, pig, cow, and sheep. Cuts represent short loin, sirloin, round steak, chuck roast, arm roast, and
hindshank. Pollen remains include cereal grains, corn, mustards, dewberry, and cloves.
Fifty-eight of the 69 ceramic vessels recovered from Floeck’s privy are whiteware and were probably
manufactured in England. Several of the remaining vessels are stoneware. Some of it is American, some
is British, and two have a German salt glaze. These stoneware vessels may be a tenuous connection to
Floeck’s German ancestry, but similar bottles were recovered from Feature 7036 and have been linked to
Louis Harde, a native of Oldenburg. In Feature 7036, 21 German mineral water bottles were recovered
from what appeared to be a landscaping feature (they were upended and used as a border for a garden or
other yard feature).
Several research questions regarding wealth were posed in Chapter 3:
1. How do archeological remains reflect the documented wealth of the residents of the Project Area?
Of the 18 residents whose wealth was documented in the census records, the four examined in detail
ranked numbers 1, 4, 9, and 11 (see Table 20.2). Catherine Gray Sampson and her husband, with $40,000
in real property and four slaves, are ranked number 1. However, since there was only a single artifact that
could be linked to their occupation of the site, they were discarded from this analysis. Martin Floeck,
whose real property was valued at $10,000, is ranked number 4; James Dumble, whose real property was
valued at $2,000 and had three slaves, is ranked number 9; and James Wells, whose real property was
valued at $1,380 and had no slaves, is ranked number 11.
Recovered ceramics, glass, and fauna were analyzed for evidence of wealth. Using only closed-context
features that the researchers felt confident were tied to each of the landowners, the assemblage was
examined for large ceramic vessels, matching vessels, or unique vessels. The glassware was examined
for stemware, pressed-glass hollowware, perfume bottles, etc.; and the fauna was examined for cuts of
meat that were considered expensive, i.e., short loins and sirloins.
From the assemblages associated with Martin Floeck, only 1.4 percent of his ceramic remains were
considered costly. Compare this to those of James Dumble (10.8 percent) and James Wells (34.5
percent). In the glassware assemblages, 14.3 percent of Martin Floecks’s assemblage was considered
more costly than that belonging to Dumble (11.7 percent) or Wells (10 percent). Meat cuts, specifically
cattle, are less abundant than ceramics or glass. However, of the two cuts identified in Dumble’s
assemblage, both are short loins. Of the 22 cuts identified in Floeck’s assemblage, two are short loins and
10 are sirloins.
Based upon the documented real property value of these men, the ceramic results are obviously in reverse
order, the glassware is compatible, and the faunal results are inconclusive, although it does seem
significant that Floeck’s assemblage has 11 times more cuts than the Dumble assemblage.
2. Do the proportions of costly items vs. inexpensive items reflect wealth?
Real property holdings are generally considered, even today, to represent the primary wealth of an
individual. Assuming this to be true, archeological results may not always be an accurate indicator of that
wealth, as demonstrated by the ceramics comparison in the first question above. On the other hand, a
larger sample size may prove otherwise.

3. How do construction materials or styles of homes reflect wealth?
The substantial brick foundation of the Wells house (Feature 7005) certainly suggests a wealthier lifestyle
than that of a log cabin. No structural remains were found for Dumble. Floeck purchased Wells’
property after his death, so Feature 7005 is also associated with him. Other structural remains found
during the investigation were limited to brick piers. Based upon housing styles of the time, brick piers
generally support either a one-story structure or a two-story frame structure. The brick foundation
supporting the Wells/Floeck house probably supported a two-story brick home.
4. Is wealth reflected in the cuts of meat or diversity of foods eaten?
From the sample of four households, meat cuts were frequently present only in the Dumble and Floeck
assemblages. Dumble’s assemblage contains the remains of two short loins (cow) and one shank ham.
Floeck’s contains 1 short loin, 10 sirloins, 3 round steaks/roasts, 5 chuck roasts, 1 arm roast, 2
hindshanks, and 1 shank ham. No wild taxa were found in either assemblage. Both the Dumbles and
Floecks were also eating sheep/goat and chicken; a single pig was found in the Wells assemblage. These
figures seem to indicate only that there was a preference for beef, with no major differences between the
types of meat being eaten.
Two additional questions about wealth were posed in Chapter 3 (the role of luxury items and the size of
homes). These could not be answered from either the documentary data or the archeological data.
Several questions regarding ethnicity were also posed in Chapter 3:
1. Can specific artifacts be identified as clear markers of particular ethnic groups, e.g., trademarks
representing country of origin, excessive quantities of certain artifact types, or other distinguishing
characteristics?
There was some indication that ‘markers’ could be identified in the assemblages, i.e., English wares from
Dumble’s lot and German stoneware from Floeck’s lot, but the quantities are so negligible as to not be
definitive.
2. Do dietary remains differ from those of Anglo assemblages? If so, in what respects do they differ?
Mammalian faunal remains were found across the site. The differences between the assemblages were
attributed to culinary practices or ease of preparation (see Chapter 13). Plant and pollen remains from
Dumble’s assemblage indicate wheat, corn, mustard, cloves, dewberries, grapes, and peach pits;
dewberries are the most prolific. Cereals, corn, mustard, cloves, dewberries, and peach pits are present in
Floeck’s assemblage. Dumble was English and Floeck was German, but their respective assemblages do
not suggest any difference based upon ethnicity.

313

3. Within the individual parcels of land, how is space utilized? For example, are there notable
differences in the location of structures, such as houses, outbuildings, cisterns, or privies, in areas known
to have been occupied by Anglos vs. areas known to have been occupied by Germans or Italians?
The only parcel of land that had any spatial elements was the James Wells lot. The house, well, cistern,
privy, and possible kitchen were documented and mapped and were oriented towards the center of the
block. As the first resident in the Project Area, Wells was not restricted to smaller parcels of land. Other
structures were oriented facing the street, including the brick piers found on Block 162.
In sum, Houston was essentially a port city during the nineteenth century. Its residents had access to
every commodity possible from all reaches of the world. Most were merchants or skilled tradespeople
from Europe, and some owned slaves. Their homes were comfortable and their diets well-rounded. In
the concluding chapter (Chapter 21), the reader is presented with a picture of life in nineteenth-century
Houston.

21
A VIEW FROM THE HILL
Shawn Bonath Carlson

During the first decade of Houston’s settlement, economic crises in the United States sent debtors clamoring
to the Texas frontier where they could conduct their business with IOUs, deeds, and barter. Money was not
necessary. This influx of people helped develop the fledgling town of Houston along Buffalo Bayou (Figure
21.1). The location seemed ideal, permitting shallow-draft steamboats to navigate the bayou between
Houston and Galveston Harbor. Easy accessibility made it possible to ship material goods from virtually
anywhere in the world. These attributes did not go unnoticed, especially by Augustus and John Allen, who
were among the dozens of speculators competing to establish towns during the Republic period.
The Allens were determined men. They wanted their town to be the capital of the Republic of Texas. To
succeed in this venture, they had to have some knowledge of what it takes to make a town thrive. As New
Yorkers, they understood the importance of water traffic and how it would contribute to the development of a
commercial center. Lacking for nothing, Houston soon became a popular destination. An increasing
population made the services of craftsmen such as carpenters and brick masons in demand. Their handiwork
remains throughout Houston today, and some of it was recorded during the current project.
BALL PARK AT UNION STATION ARCHEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The Ball Park Project officially began in January 1997 when J. K Wagner & Company, Inc. of Houston
conducted an extensive archival search of the17-block Project Area proposed for the new Houston Astros
stadium. Dr. Roger Moore of Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. used the lot-by-lot data that were
produced to determine the archeological significance of each lot and rank them accordingly. From a pool of
72 parcels, 34 were selected for investigation.
People who occupied these parcels were in some ways a microcosm of Houston in the 1840s, 1850s, and
1860s. As with the city as a whole, the earliest residents came from the United States. They were followed
by an influx of foreign-born, with the result that foreign-born men represented the majority of adult males by
1860. Only a small percentage of residents owned a few slaves, mostly as household help, and most slave
owners were native-born.
The inhabitants also reflected the substantial, stable, and family-oriented residential character of the Third
Ward in which they resided. This ward, in contrast to the city’s other three divisions, boasted only three
boarding houses and consisted almost entirely of family residences. The scarcity of young bachelor
immigrants in the Third Ward gave it a higher women-to-men ratio than elsewhere in the city. It shared the
largest proportion of children among the wards, and exhibited the greatest mean value of real wealth. The
overall character of the district is reflected in detail in the results of the excavations.
Over a period of eight months, from August 1997 to March 1998, archeological survey, testing, and data
recovery were undertaken through the sponsorship of the Houston Sports Authority. Ten backhoe trenches
and 21 mechanically stripped areas were initially used to expose cultural deposits. As deposits dating to the
target period of 1830-1870 were identified, 90 1-x-1-m excavation units were employed to expose cultural
features.

Some 215 features consisting of building remains, wells, cisterns, privies, postholes, and refuse deposits were
recorded. Almost 40 percent of these (n=80) were excavated, yielding over 29,000 artifacts. The following
narrative, based upon preceding chapters, combines the documented history of the Project Area with the
material evidence recovered during the investigation to provide a picture of Houston’s earliest residents.
NINETEENTH-CENTURY HOUSTON
Selecting a Site
Selecting a site to build a home in 1830 could not have been easy. Common sense tells us to build on high
ground and near water. But how familiar could early settlers have been with the vast frontier landscape?
Considering the manual labor that went into establishing a homestead, how could they be certain that the
place they chose to build was the best possible location? As with anything, there are no guarantees. James
Moore, a New York merchant, discovered this early on. Moore traveled to Texas in late 1830 and applied for
one league and one labor of land in Austin’s colony. Situated in the salt grass prairie, Moore’s league was
bordered on one side by Brays Bayou and on another by the San Felipe to Harrisburg trail. He tried to
establish himself as a farmer, but after only two years, realized that the land was not suitable for farming and
forfeited his title in 1834. Isaac Batterson, a former neighbor in New York City, claimed Moore’s league but
was unable to secure title before his death in 1838.
In the meantime, James Wells of St. Louis, Missouri, had traveled to Harrisburg via New Orleans with his
sister’s family and assisted them on their rented land both there and near Richmond. In March 1836, Wells
responded to William B. Travis’ call for volunteers at the Alamo. Although he enrolled a week after the
Alamo fell, he continued to serve until he had earned the 640 acres in bounty land for his military service.
Approval for his one-third league did not come until January 1838. Two weeks later, he married Jane Earle,
and in February he applied for his increased allotment of land as a married man. Seeking to be near Jane’s
father, who had a headright on Buffalo Bayou, Wells secured title to a strip of land bordering the southern
edge of Houston. This land lay in the eastern third of the league previously claimed by Moore and Batterson.
In October 1838, Wells contracted with a mapmaker to plat some of his land as part of the City of Houston.
Building a House
James Wells and his wife Jane built their homestead on what was to become Block 117 in the City of
Houston, bounded by Prairie, Chenevert, Preston, and Jackson streets. In 1838, it had a substantial overstory
of trees, including pine, oak, walnut, ash, and bald cypress. There may have also been a small peach orchard.
Weeds, such as dock, knotweed, and chickweed, were scattered about the site. The Wells’ first home was
probably a log cabin and perhaps 12 to 20 ft (3-6 m) in length. They may have purchased some of their
building supplies from the firm of Doswell & Adams, who furnished early Houstonians with pre-cut timber,
kegs of nails, brick, and white lead paint. Because of the warm, humid climate, the Wells cabin would have
been elevated 2 to 3 ft (ca. 1 m) above ground to prevent termite infestation. The hewn log walls were
probably chinked with a mixture of clay and straw, and the plank floor was laid across floor joists. A typical
roof was end-gabled and covered with boards, shingles, or shakes. There was little or no hardware except for
a lock on the door. Shingles were held in place with 4-penny nails, and 8-penny nails were used for the
flooring.
Not far from the cabin they dug a well. It was a little over 3 ft (1 m) in diameter and about 15-20 ft (4-6 m)
deep. It probably took several days to dig through the hard, sticky clay, but the walls were sturdy, and there
was little chance of them caving in. The bricks lining the clay shaft were pale orange and very soft. These
were probably purchased from one of two brickyards reported to be operating in Houston by the summer of
1837. In later years, a cistern was dug to supplement the well water.
Within this urban farmyard was space for three horses, requiring at least a barn and corral. Wells, who was a
cattleman, ran his herd on other property outside the city. Mrs. Wells ran a dairy, keeping just a few cows on

317

their semi-rural lot. She salvaged a shipping crate and converted it into a make-shift icehouse, where she
stored the milk. It was a sturdy box reinforced with long bolts on the exterior and zinc lining and insulation
on the interior. Placed in a hole in the ground, it was perfect for keeping milk cool. All that needed to be
done was to drill some holes in the floor to let the water out. After several years, the zinc lining became
damaged, and the box was eventually converted to a privy.
Making a Home
Near the house was a detached kitchen where Mrs. Wells prepared the family meals. Their meals were
cooked over a hearth and overwhelmingly consisted of beef, usually sirloin steaks, chuck roasts, or round
steak. Occasionally they would have pork, mutton, or chicken. As urban folks, they had little time for
hunting wild game and relied upon purchasing their meat from a commercial butcher. These meals were
accompanied by bread and rice, as well as some type of vegetable, typically beans, broccoli, cauliflower,
corn, mustard greens, squash, or turnips. Fruits, such as apples, apricots, dewberries, figs, grapes, peaches,
plums, strawberries, and watermelon, were eaten whole or prepared as jams, jellies, wines, or juices. Some of
their dishes, most likely hams and baked goods, were seasoned with cloves. Pickled fruits and vegetables and
various condiments enhanced the meal. Mr. Wells may have had a pinch of snuff or a smoke after dinner.
These meals were formally served from platters and bowls and eaten from plates displaying blue shell-edged
rims or transfer-printed designs. A cup of coffee served in a red spatterware cup resting on a green transferprinted saucer would not have been unusual. Cold or room-temperature beverages, such as milk, juice, or
mineral water, were drunk from assorted tumblers, while wine and champagne were drunk from pressed-glass
goblets. Beer and soft drinks were consumed straight from the bottle. Forks, spoons, and bone-handled
cutlery completed the table setting.
Cabin furnishings were sparse. Aside from the kitchenwares, table and chairs, and a few kerosene lamps or
candles, there were probably a couple of beds and a chest or two. Everything else was likely the family’s
personal belongings. The Wells were relatively well dressed, with Mrs. Wells sporting silver-plated buckles
and calico buttons on her dresses, and Mr. Wells having a preference for vests. His pocket knives were bone
handled, and he was never without his pipe. The children were fond of marbles and dolls.
The Wells’ first child, Joseph, was born in 1845, followed by Cornelius in 1847 and Anne in 1848. Three
children in a small cabin would have stretched everyone’s patience, so in 1848, Wells began to build a bigger
house. Unfortunately, he died within the year, leaving his wife with a newborn and two toddlers. The house
was probably a stylish two-story Greek Revival structure. The massive brick foundation would have
supported either a frame or brick structure. Mrs. Wells eventually moved to another house down the street,
and the property was sold after her death in 1863.
The Neighbors
From 1839 to 1860, Jacob de Cordova owned a house located diagonally across the street from the Wells.
Cordova was a Spanish Jew born in Kingston, Jamaica, who migrated to Texas to become a land entrepreneur.
He eventually owned millions of acres in Texas. Although he and his family lived in the house on Prairie
Avenue from 1839 to 1842, it was probably rental property until 1860, when another Jewish family, the
Cohens, purchased the lot.
De Cordova’s house rested on brick piers and, because of his wealth, it is likely that it was a frame structure
rather than log. Privy contents suggest that after 1842, the renters may have been well-to-do as well. Large
platters and glass serving dishes, along with silver-plated vessels and gilded tableware, attest to an elegant
household. The lady of the house was fond of cameos, jeweled brooches, and perfume. Multiple pocket
knives, marbles, and doll parts suggest the presence of children.

318

To the west of the Wells property was the Dumble home. James Dumble, an Englishman, was a merchant and
part owner of the firm Peel & Dumble, which specialized in cotton and wool. One of his sons became a clerk
at the firm. Dumble’s brother, George, was a hardware merchant and lived on an adjacent lot with his family.
In later years, James Dumble became a Queensware dealer. James lived with his wife, Mary, and their five
children in a large house at the corner of Prairie and Crawford streets, beginning about 1853. It was a large
two-story, L-shaped structure with a brick-lined cistern built inside the well. A narrow drive meandered
across the back of the lot towards the carriage house where the horses and wagons were housed. Over the
years, a number of privies were dug along the fence lines at the back and sides of the yard to accommodate
the large Dumble family. Trash was dumped in a low spot at the back of the yard where trees clustered along
the fence line. Vegetation was much the same as across the street at the Wells house, except that the Dumbles
had oleanders.
The Dumbles were a well-to-do family, but unlike the Wells family or the de Cordova renters, they had three
slaves to tend to their various needs. In this household, it was likely that a female servant prepared the meals
and who also tended to the children. The children may have been sickly, as they used a lot of medicine. Mrs.
Dumble, of course, was free to entertain her lady friends with afternoon tea. She might even have used her set
of Ashburton glasses. Two male slaves, who probably slept in the carriage house, handled the outdoor chores.
Because the Dumbles had so much help, their lot was tidier than their neighbors’. In fact, when they rebuilt
the outhouses and cleaned up the yard in 1860, they dumped all of the trash down the privies. Their concern
for outward appearances extended to their personal appearance as well. Someone in the household was using
a popular hair dye to hide their gray hair.
SUMMARY
The Wells and their neighbors built their homes on the rural outskirts of the young City of Houston in a
neighborhood that came to be known as Quality Hill. As the city matured and the population expanded
outward, Houston eventually encompassed these homes. The name reflects the wealth of these people, who
probably qualified as upper middle-class by today’s standards. As merchants and businessmen, they were
able to afford nice houses on large semi-rural lots to accommodate their large families. They owned livestock
and in some cases slaves. Their material possessions were not extravagant, but they all owned land and
personal items that reflected some degree of wealth. Each of them traveled great distances and gave up more
civilized lives to start anew in Houston. As the turn of the century neared, all of these homes were sacrificed
to the Houston, Belt and Terminal Railway. And now, with the turn of the millennium, the last traces of these
homes are gone.

APPENDIX G
CERAMIC ARTIFACTS BY SITE, BLOCK, AND FEATURE
Randall W. Moir

G.1

SITE 41HR812, BLOCK 103
Seven of the excavated features on this block yielded ceramic vessel sherds (Features [F] 1025, 1048A,
1048B, 1049, 1063, 1065, 1066). Four were among the top 20 features that yielded the most ceramic
vessels from the Ball Park at Union Station excavations (F1025, F1048B, F1049, and F1065). In fact,
F1048B yielded the second largest number of ceramic vessels, with a total of 77 enumerated vessels.
Apparently, some of the activities responsible for leaving ceramic sherds on this block were more
extensive than other blocks, although it cannot be determined if all other factors were equal (in fact, this
may simply mean that excavation coverage was greater). The following is a review of the ceramics
recovered from features on Block 103. The level of detail devoted to each feature varies depending upon
the number of ceramic vessels recovered and the stratigraphic complexity of various contexts.
Feature 1001 (Cistern)
This cistern was located on the boundary line between Lots 7 and 8. Lot 8 had improvements on it from
ca. 1847 to 1850 and then from 1873 and the 1890s. The cistern yielded no ceramic vessel sherds,
although the laboratory count indicated one ceramic sherd in the preliminary sort. It must have been from
a brick or sewer pipe or some other nonvessel form, since the sherd was not in the material removed for
ceramic vessel analyses. The cistern was apparently associated with the later occupation of the house in
the southeastern quarter block of Block 103 (see Chapter 17). It was probably filled in after 1880.
Details on its abandonment are covered elsewhere in this report.
Feature 1002 (Cistern)
This cistern was located near the middle of Lot 2, which had a major structure standing on it after ca.
1870 and several more by the 1890s. The cistern yielded no ceramic vessel sherds, although the
laboratory count indicated two ceramic sherds in the preliminary sort. These ceramics must have been
from bricks or sewer pipes or some other nonvessel artifact item, since no F1002 sherds were in the
material removed for ceramic vessel studies. The cistern was apparently associated with the later
occupation of one of the houses on Lot 2 of Block 103 dating from the post-1880 period.
Feature 1025 (Refuse Deposit)
This lens-shaped feature was located near the middle of Lot 3 and was sampled by two 1-x-1-m units
(Units 1001 and 1001a). Also, a grab sample of nine sherds was taken from the same general location
about three weeks prior to removal of the two excavation units (Artifact Lots 1 and 36). The grab sample
produced some of the more diagnostic vessels and makers’ marks recovered from this area. A brown
stoneware sherd recovered from Level 1 of Unit 1001 cross-mended with a grab sample sherd, directly
linking the two contexts. Consequently, it is assumed here that all the material came from F1025, even
though the buried section removed by the two units did not produce the same kind of large sherds as seen
in the grab sample. Still, the inventory below is only a minimum vessel estimate (MVE) and is divided
into the grab sample rather than excavated groupings. A total of 22 ceramic vessels was identified by the
MVE. Only three excavated vessels were obviously from non-sheet-refuse sources (i.e., true feature
discards).
Grab Sample
Three imported, hand-thrown stoneware vessels (V) were recovered from general contexts; two of them
were about 40 percent and 90 percent complete (V12, V13, and V14). One was a cylindrical British
brown salt-glazed ink bottle, approximately 7.5 in tall x 3.25 in wide (20 x 8 cm)with a cone-shaped top
(V12, n=9 sherds, three from the grab sample and five from Levels 1-3). As noted above, one of the
excavated sherds from Level 1 cross-mended to a grab sample sherd. The bottle is very much like that
shown in Switzer (1968:68, Figure 94). The interior of the F1025 example is dry (unglazed), and the lip
is finished with a simple flaring collar unlike the straight inside sides of the Switzer example. Also, the
F1025 example becomes much thinner towards its top section, since the walls are about one-half as thick
at the shoulder as they are midway down the body (the base is about four times as thick as the shoulder).

G.2

Further, the interior of the F1025 bottle shows a small firing bubble in the wall. This particular stoneware
bottle was probably made between 1840 and 1880.
Two Bristol two-toned, wide-mouthed stoneware bottles designated V13 and V14 are also represented in
the grab sample. They are both from the same general production time period, based upon their single
cordoned lower neck section. They differ in their interior glaze qualities of their upper necks. They both
have mustard-yellow-colored upper exterior sections over a clear Bristol glazed lower exterior section,
based upon the nearly complete specimen. Powell\Bristol is impressed in a flattened oval on the more
complete example. This firm operated ca. 1830 to 1906 (Godden 1964:509). This example has a 3.6mm-wide band of well-defined beading in relief about 4 mm below its shoulder-to-body joint that
contains nine beads per linear inch. This particular type of beading motif may be more common on
examples from ca. 1860–1880 and may be used to signify a particular brand or commodity. A more
decorative nineteenth-century example with multiple beaded banding is shown in Lewis (1992:66). The
F1025 bottle is more akin to a jar by form, since it has a 1.5-in-wide (4 cm) mouth with a rounded beadstyle finish or lip similar to pickle jars. The shoulder and neck/rim are 2 in (5 cm). The entire bottle is
5.7 in tall x 3 in wide (14.5 x 8 cm). It projects a squat appearance, also making it more like a jar than a
typical bottle by shape.
Several very datable, bluish tint British ironstone sherds were in the grab sample. These include two
makers’ marks and a recognizable plain white molded ironstone pattern. A rim section of the full-ribbed
molded white pattern (Cat. No. 1-25, V15) is attributable to J. W. Pankhurst, Hanley, England (Wetherbee
1985:120-121). The pattern dates post 1859. In fact, the black transfer-printed Pankhurst Royal Arms
back stamp found on this particular pattern is also represented in the grab sample material (41HR812, Cat.
No. 1-24), which also dates from 1859+ to late 1860s. Finally, a thinner blue-tinted ironstone sherd from
a tureen or other specialty vessel with a black transfer-printed back stamp was also in the grab sample
(41HR812, Cat. No. 1-27). It was assigned V16 and has a registry mark for July 27, 1847, which can be
traced to Thomas, John, and Joseph Mayer, Longport, England, Patent No. 44398 (Cushion 1983:293).
Godden (1964:424) places this particular joint venture in two potteries in Burslem rather than in
Longport, where Thomas Mayer had previously plied his trade from 1836-1838 (Godden 1964:423). This
particular sherd may be from a considerably older deposit and seems to predate most of the in situ
material removed from Units 1001 and 1001a. The vessel was probably manufactured in the 1847-1865
period.
One other black transfer-printed ironstone Royal Arms maker’s mark, designated V5, was retrieved from
the backdirt near F1025 (41HR812, Cat. No. 36-1). It is from a thick ironstone plate/platter. The mark is
probably from James Edwards & Son (Godden [1964:230-231] and dates from 1851-1865, although the
pottery continued until 1882.
Excavated Units
The excavated portion of this feature yielded a small assemblage of 57 ceramic sherds dating mainly after
1860 to 1875, but it also included a few older sherds, as well as several possibly post-1880 sherds. These
anomalous sherds were apparently from captured sheet refuse due to their small sizes. The vessels
identified are listed below by their assigned designations using ‘V’ numbers. Most of the
ironstone/whiteware vessels are either plain white or blue-tinted wares with no decoration. Two
exceptions, however, are worth noting in greater detail. These include a molded- and relief-decorated
saucer (i.e., pattern-molded ironstone noted below as V6) and a molded and paneled jug. In addition,
most of the ironstone/whiteware vessels are from the very thick-bodied tradition generally prevalent in the
late 1860s and 1870s. Finally, only two ironstone/whiteware vessels are more than about 8 percent
complete (V6 and V11).

G.3

Small sherds from two brown-glazed yellowware vessels were also recovered. One is a brown flint
enamel vessel with a molded scene that includes a partial possible human figure (Rebecca-at-the-well
motif?) (V8). The other is a brown-glazed yellowware vessel (V9). Evidence of two porcelain vessels
are also among the small sherd fragments. These include a late porcelain teacup sherd (V7, post 1870 to
1900 and possibly intrusive?) and a piece of a porcelain vessel that may be from a plate (V17).
Table G.1. lists minimum vessel estimates for F1025 separated into either sheet-refuse or non-sheetrefuse associations (i.e., vessels more than 8 percent complete). The non-sheet-refuse associations may
represent parts of vessels discarded directly into the feature or may indicate that the feature was disturbed
or incompletely represented (i.e., truncated when the original Union Station was constructed).

G.4

Some 16 additional ironstone/whiteware sherds, very small in size, are represented in the sheet refuse.
None could be attributed to any of the V-numbered vessels due to their small sizes or lack of unaltered
attributes (and time constraints). Some are burned. These also appear to date most likely from the 1860s
and 1870s, with only a couple of intrusive older sherds apparently mixed in.
Summary and Interpretation
Feature 1025 appears to contain ceramic sherds from both directly discarded refuse and older captured
sheet-refuse debris. The directly discarded ceramic vessels date to the late 1860s and 1870s; the sheet
refuse generally dates to the 1850s-1870s, with a few older sherds also present. Sherds from several
different vessels exhibit heat fractures and burning. One sherd is covered with glassy coal slag drippings.
Consequently, some of the refuse may have been tossed into a coal burning stove, which would be more
common after 1875.
The original function of F1025 is difficult to determine using only ceramic vessel sherds. It contained a
small amount of directly discarded ceramic refuse along with a larger sample of captured sheet refuse
spanning mostly 1850 to 1875. The sherds reveal both utilitarian ceramic vessels as well as middle-class
examples. Lot 3, which contains the feature, was owned by James Dumble during this period; according
to maps, however, nothing is known to have stood on the lot until the 1870s. Dumble's house was located
on Lot 6, at some distance from F1025. Consequently, how and why the ceramics were discarded in
F1025 is not known. It is possible that the few larger ceramic sherds in this feature might have belonged
to vessels owned by James Dumble if he was the one responsible for filling the feature. If Dumble was
not the source of the material, the owner of the non-sheet-refuse sherds is unknown, while the older sheetrefuse sherds may be from occupants living on nearby lots (Lots 2 or 4).
Feature 1048A (Refuse Deposit)
This feature provided one of the better examples of a trash deposit where broken ceramic vessels were
directly discarded into it and then subsequently sealed. That is, eight of the 11 vessels are more than 10
percent complete, and five vessels have sherds so large that the sherds alone constitute from 30 to 55
percent of each vessel. Still, three sheet-refuse sherds were also present in the feature and were identified
by their older ages and smaller sizes. Finally, the feature produced one sherd assigned to V6 that
unmistakably seems to be from a vessel discarded in F1048B. It has a very recognizable portion of the
Tyrian pattern in a brown transfer-printed design, and is from the same pitcher or chamber pot recovered
from F1048B. The vessel was made by the Davenport pottery (Staffordshire, England) in 1864 and is
high fired (semivitrified) with high quality glazing and thin walls. The only other explanation would be
that there was a set of these vessels, but this seems unlikely given its size and overall uniqueness.
The average mid-date for the ironstone/whitewares in F1048A is 1858, placing the assemblage within a
broader period that is split by the Civil War. As noted previously, little European and British pottery or
porcelain would have made it through the Northern marine blockade against Texas, and of course this
includes Houston residents. Only the richest families in Texas might have been able to acquire some
smuggled imports during this time; ceramic vessels were probably not the most sought after items carried
by smugglers. In fact, if we currently consider that ceramic imports during the blockade period spanning
from early 1861 to mid 1865 were nearly absent to Houston, the few ceramics in this feature were
acquired either before 1861 or after 1865. The feature does not seem to have been used for very long and
certainly does not span the entire war period.
German porcelain recovered from F1048A also seems to hold the best clue, based upon household
ethnicities, since it probably corresponds better with the 1865 to 1873 period, at which time Lot 3 of
Block 103 was occupied by several German families after 1865 (i.e., Dissen between 1865-1866,
followed by Schwiekart 1866-1872). The vessels from this feature are listed in Table G.2.

Vessel

Description

Non Sheet Refuse
V1

small blue-tinted ironstone plate with illegible impressed maker’s mark; 40% complete; ca. 1858-1868 (n=1,
PP#6, Level 1)

V2

small 10-cm diameter European porcelain finger bowl (?) with KPM in blue on underside; 55% complete;
possibly from the Krister Porcelain Manufactory (Germany in the nineteenth century, but now in Poland);
factory mark is supposed to be post 1885 by Kovel and Kovel (1986:183), but the company was in
production since 1831; age assigned here is ca. 1850-1885 since the mark is not identical to the later dated
style; see V9 for F1048B for identical example (n=1, PP#1, Levels 1-2)

V4

lead-glazed buff-bodied colander with a finely thrown rim similar to an antique example noted as French and
dated to 1840-1870; 15% complete; too finely thrown to be Mexican redware and is not like any known
British or German examples; cross-mends with V26 (n=2, PP#5, Level 2, grab sample)

V5

large, heavily gilded and overglazed enameled ornate porcelain teacup (handled) with fluted rim and relief
designs and scrolls; 30% complete; 11 cm diameter x 8.3 cm tall, with a 5.3 cm footring and a double-curve
body; German/continental European; one of the most ornate teacups recovered from any Ball Park feature,
and is among the largest excavated cups this author has seen (large examples are more frequent in the
antique record than in excavated assemblages). The cup’’ size and decoration are probably indicative of a
special family commemorative cup, such as a wedding cup for a German family; ca. 1840-1870 (n=1, PP#4,
Levels 2-3)

V7

paneled and pattern-molded (arches, motif is unnamed) octagonal blue-tinted ironstone teacup that matches
the saucer in V9; 40% complete; 9.5 cm rim diameter x 8.3 cm tall with thick Q-shape handle; ca. 1850-1861
(n=2, grab sample)

V8

high-quality European white porcelain (French/German?) covered (sugar?) bowl with a female cameo
(possibly Liberty goddess) in relief on its side; 30% complete; 8 cm rim diameter; cross-mends to PP#2; ca.
1840-1870? (n=4, grab sample, Lot 2-7)

V9

pattern-molded (arches, unnamed motif) blue-tinted ironstone saucer that matches the pattern of V7 cup;
55% complete; 15 cm rim diameter x 3.4 cm tall with 8 looping arches; impressed maker’s mark: J
CLEMENTSON\SHELTON attributed by Godden (1964:150) to the period of 1834 to 1864, but this date can
be narrowed based upon the saucer blank to post 1850 to 1861 based upon the blockade; ca. 1850–1861
(n=1, grab sample)

V10

base section from a transitional, purple tinted whiteware chamber pot with cross-mending; 75% complete
(15% of entire vessel); thin walled, with accent line along base; ca. 1840-1854 (n=15, Level 2)

V3

hand-painted, sprig-decorated, transitional late purple-tinted whiteware saucer probably from captured sheet
refuse as the feature was filled; 5% complete; made ca. 1842–1852, but its likely period of use/discard is
later (n=1, Level 3)

V6

brown transfer-printed Tyrian pattern, cream-colored-ware ironstone (noncrazed) pitcher/ chamber pot
identical to a more complete example (probably same example) from F1048B made by Davenport and
impressed with a date cipher for 1864; 3% complete; probably captured by this feature as sheet refuse at the
time of its sealing; ca. 1864-1874 (n=1, grab sample)

V11

SVGTI bowl/chamberpot ; 1% complete; ca. 1860-1885: (n=1, Level 2)

includes very large sherds and vessels more than 8 percent complete
includes small sherds

Summary and Interpretation
The fine ceramic tablewares (ironstone/whitewares and porcelains) from this lens-shaped feature indicate
several rather important associations. First, all but three of the vessels were probably directly deposited in
this feature as household refuse in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Occupants of this lot for that period
were German or German-American, and the ceramic vessels seem to illustrate these European ties. A few
vessels may have been acquired before the Civil War, but most seem compatible with the ca. 1865-1870
acquisition period. The buff-bodied, lead-glazed colander may have been used for medicinal purposes or

G.6

for processing special teas or foods. It was probably purchased locally from a French merchant. Sherds
from this colander were also recovered from F1048B (see V26). No domestic or imported stoneware
sherds were among the F1048A sample, and the quality of the porcelains suggests well-above-average
household wealth. The matching ironstone cup and saucer are also indicative of well-to-do means.
The range of wares by paste/glaze categories is extremely broad. It includes true lead-glazed, buffcolored coarse earthenware strainer/small colander (a redware variant of probably a French vessel), early
transitional ironstone (hand-painted saucer, ca. 1842–1852), common British ironstone and molded
ironstones (matching cup and saucer), and three high quality European porcelain vessels (German or
continental European). At least four of the 11 vessels reveal molded designs that appear to be from the
1840s to 1861 period. Also, six of the vessels are more than 25 percent complete (includes mended and
nonmended sherds). Important datable ceramic types/makers’ marks include: Krister Porcelain
Manufactory (German Company; see Kovel and Kovel 1986:183; suggested as post 1885, but the firm
was established in 1831 and the mark variant considered here may be from 1850 to 1885), an impressed
mark from J. (Joseph?) Clementson (1834 to 1864), but saucer’s shape and paste/glaze is representative of
the ca. 1850–1861 period, and an illegible impressed mark (V1). An oversized, gilded and polychrome
enameled porcelain teacup (special commemorative cup?) that dates to 1840-1870 was also identified.
Finally, if one was to choose the narrowest discard context for this feature based upon ceramic vessels
only, one would place it in the ca. 1865 to 1868/1872 period. Then, the two older vessels in the deposit
(V3 and V10) would represent contamination from older sheet refuse. The Tyrian-patterned sherd (V6)
and the redware colander (V4) also illustrate that some material entered this deposit from nearby activities
associated with F1048B. Thus the age of this small assemblage spans a wide period and is most
compatible with a household operating between ca. 1865 and 1872 if one disregards possible captured
older sheet-refuse sherds. The bottle glass dates seem to indicate an even older discard context for trash
in this feature. Consequently, a final period for this deposit will require synthesizing all data from the
feature before deciding on a final date.
Sherds Probably Associated with Feature 1048A
Three sherds were assigned to this tentative association. These were excavated from Unit 1004 on Lot 3
(Block 103) next to F1048B. The ceramic vessel sherds represent a Bristol/Bristol-glazed bottle
(imported British bottle, Lot 39-1, Level 4, nineteenth century), a small sherd of porcelain vessel (Lot 383, Level 4, nondiagnostic), and a common ironstone plate sherd (Lot 37-1, Level 3, pre-1880?). The
items suggest a date of ca. 1850-1880, although the plate sherd is not easily datable.
Feature 1048B (Barrel Privy)
This feature was located in the extreme northwestern corner of Lot 2 on Block 103 and represented a
barrel privy. It produced true feature-sized ceramic sherds in stratified contexts, as well as some possible
captured older sheet refuse. The ceramic material seems to come from two different traditions: an older
decorative, transitional late whiteware/early ironstone tradition (ca. 1835 to 1850) and a newer, molded
and plain white ironstone tradition (ca. 1850/1855-1870). Datable pottery marks or vessel patterns
included the ‘Potomac Shape’ (1862 to ca. 1872), ‘Rolling Star’ pattern by James Edwards and Son (post
1851 to ca. 1860), ‘Tyrian’ pattern by Davenport (dated 1864), ‘Pearl’ pattern by John Wedge Wood
(registered 1847 to ca. 1852), and the ‘framed leaf’ pattern by Pankhurst (ca. 1852/1857 to 1867). Other
stylistic and paste/glaze attributes indicate ceramic vessels manufactured between ca. 1845 and 1870,
including a possibly intrusive sherd from E. Clarke (Longport) dating from 1878-1880 (Godden 1964).
The range of wares by paste/glaze categories in this feature covers the entire spectrum. It includes true
lead-glazed coarse earthenware (a buff-colored strainer/small colander), early transitional ironstone
(hand-painted, shell-edged, transfer-printed and banded wares), common early ironstone/whitewares,
molded and transfer-decorated ironstone/whitewares, oriental stoneware (ginger jar), yellowwares, and

G.7

quality porcelains. The vessels were probably acquired between about 1842 and 1867-1873 if one
assumes that the most recent items are simply post-feature intrusions. Otherwise, the ceramic vessels
would indicate an unusually long discard span continuing up to 1885.
Overview of Recovered Ceramic Sherds
Feature 1048B yielded 228 ceramic vessel sherds that after enumeration indicate 77 vessels. Only F5017
produced more ceramic vessels, containing only recaptured ceramic sheet refuse rather than household
waste discarded in situ. In terms of sherd volume, F1048B is one of the top two features that produced
the greatest ceramic sherd volume. The other is F7036, which was also unique, since it was made up of
intentionally buried stoneware bottles rather than discarded household refuse. Consequently, when
viewed in this light, F1048B produced the largest ceramic vessel assemblage from directly discarded
refuse of any feature in the Ball Park Project Area.
Feature Description
Feature 1048B was located in the extreme northwestern corner of Lot 2 on Block 103 (41HR812) about
72 ft (22 m) from the location of a pre-1870 house. It was first recognized in a cut at 45 ft (14 m) above
mean sea level (amsl) and consisted of a poorly defined soil anomaly containing cut nails, animal bones,
brick pieces, and glass and ceramic vessel sherds. Shortly afterwards, it was identified as a probable
privy constructed from a 33-in-diameter (83 cm) wooden barrel placed below grade. All that remained in
the ground was about 17 in (43 cm) of the bottom portion of the barrel, making the volume of privy fill
removed from this intact section about 0.2 m3. Five drainage holes cut through the bottom of the barrel.
Since most of the upper section of the barrel was missing, the total volume and full depth of the privy is
unknown. Excavation around the privy did not reveal any recognizable evidence of a builder’s trench,
although some sandy fill was noticed after the barrel was removed. No abrasions were observed on the
floor of the barrel, leaving some doubt as to how long it had been used and whether or not it had been
repetitively cleaned. A more complete description of the barrel and privy stratigraphy and contents is
given in Chapter 17.
Excavation of the barrel proceeded in 10-cm levels with two exceptions. The first level and last or eighth
level were only 4 cm deep. Also, the excavation unit was initially 1.7 x 1.3 m, until Level 4 when the
barrel’s walls were encountered. Then, from Level 5 onward, artifacts recovered inside the barrel were
bagged separately from anything found outside of it. As a result, Levels 1-4 contained material found in
the larger soil anomaly surrounding the barrel and located above its intact section. The area excavated
was 2.3 m2 for each of the upper four levels, and only 0.5 m2 for the lowest three levels (6-8).
These differences are also reflected in the kinds of ceramic data gathered from each level. For example,
ceramic data indicate that soil above Level 5 contained both captured sheet-refuse debris along with
intentionally discarded and reworked ceramic sherds. The following sections focus on the kinds of
information gleaned from the ceramic vessel assemblage enumerated from F1048B.
Overview of Ceramic Vessel Assemblage
On first impression, this feature yielded one of the better reconstructable ceramic assemblages indicative
of vessels intentionally discarded into a refuse pit. Upon closer examination, the ceramic sherds indicate
a much more complicated history, suggesting several contributing sources in addition to primary refuse.
The distribution of ceramic sherds by level from F1048B is shown in Figure G.1. Level 3, followed by
Levels 2 and 4, is the densest for ceramics, all of which were above the rim of the preserved section of the
barrel. Level 3 produced nearly one-third of all the ceramic vessel sherds recovered from F1048B. When
Levels 2 and 4 are added, nearly two-thirds of the assemblage came from the larger unit located above the
intact portion of the barrel. The number of sherds from inside the preserved section was fewer and
account for about 30 percent of the assemblage. All vessels from Feature 1048B are listed in Table G.3.

Figure G.1. Relative frequency histogram of the distribution of ceramic sherds by level from Feature 1048B
(barrel privy). A total of 228 ceramic vessel sherds was recovered from this feature (V75 came from general
context). Sherds from Levels 1-4 are mainly captured sheet refuse, although some feature-size sherds were
intermixed. The barrel interior was well defined by Level 5, and all material was recovered from inside it
below that level. Above Level 5, artifacts were recovered from a much larger unit that included the barrel
privy proper and a larger slumped area.

Unassigned small sherds: 23 ironstone/whiteware and 4 porcelain sherds

M1 to M8 refer to maker’s marks (see text)
double inflection (referring to marly and well profile)

A total of 77 ceramic vessels was identified in F1048B. These include 45 ironstone/whiteware vessels, a
small lead-glazed redware colander (crossmends with sherds from F1048A, see V4), two yellowware
vessels, a domestic stoneware crock/jar, an oriental stoneware jar, 11 imported stoneware bottles, and 16
porcelain vessels. V19 (a small gilded porcelain [possible] soap dish) is illustrated in Figure G.2. V38 (a
gilded porcelain toy basket) is illustrated in Figure G.3. An additional 27 sherds were not assigned to any
specific vessels due to their small sizes and lack of distinguishing characteristics.

The distribution of vessels in the feature is shown in Figure G.4, with one added condition. Vessels with
sherds recovered from more than one level have been tallied according to their lowest occurrence, with
the understanding that sherds can be discarded any time after an event but not before it. Only disturbances
move sherds deeper; evidence of intrusive events were not recognized in the field.

Figure G.4. Distribution of ceramic vessels by level from Feature 1048B (barrel privy) (n=76 because
V75 is excluded, since it lacks level provenience.) Vessels from Levels 1-4 are mainly from recaptured
or redeposited sheet refuse and are not ceramic material discarded directly into the pit (see text for
more information).

G.13

A breakdown of the ceramic vessels by general ware groups (paste/glaze categories) is shown in Figure
G.5. Ironstone/whiteware varieties are the most prevalent ceramics in the feature and account for nearly
60 percent of the entire ceramic vessel assemblage. Porcelain vessels are the second most frequent
paste/glaze grouping recovered, followed by imported stonewares. Together, these three paste categories
account for nearly 94 percent of all the vessels enumerated in F1048B. Yellowware, domestic stoneware,
redware, and imported oriental stonewares account for the remaining 6 percent.

Figure G.5. Frequency histogram of general ceramic wares from Feature 1048B using vessel counts
(n=77). The assemblage contains a mixture of vessels from captured sheet refuse, partly reworked
feature material, and directly discarded refuse. The material was deposited between ca. 1857 and ca.
1875. The captured sheet refuse sherds broaden the age of the deposit by including some ceramic
vessels probably discarded between ca. 1847 and ca. 1857. This point is discussed further in the main
text.

Direct ties between F1048A and F1048B as seen through cross-mending sherds, are of notable
importance. As mentioned earlier, V4 in F1048A is a lead-glazed buff-bodied redware colander with
sherds that cross-mend with two sherds from V26 in F1048B. The colander sherds from F1048A show
more weathering and discoloration than those from F1048B. Also, identical vessels are seen in two small
10-cm-diameter European porcelain finger bowls (?) with KPM in blue on their undersides, possibly
indicating the Krister Porcelain Manufactory in Germany in nineteenth century (now part of Poland).
Vessel 2 from F1048A has the full KPM mark, whereas V9 from F1048B has only the M of the mark.
The mark is supposed to be post 1885 (Kovel and Kovel 1986:183), but the company was actually in
operation as early as 1831. Age assignment given here is ca. 1850 to 1870 but also possibly extends to
1885 (n=1.5 percent, Level 1/2, PP#1). Finally, a sherd from a Davenport pitcher or chamberpot from
F1048A that is noted as V6 is undoubtedly from the same Tyrian-pattern vessel as V2 in F1048B. These
three examples are strong evidence of a direct shared connection between Features 1048A and 1048B.
Undoubtedly other connections might be recognizable if the two assemblages were laid out side by side.
Figure G.6 shows the general ceramic vessel forms enumerated from F1048B. Three major differences
are evident that underscore the urban aspect of this feature. First, the high number of specialty vessels
indicates either highly specialized functions responsible for the refuse going into the feature, or represents
byproducts of a well-above-average socioeconomic household whose broken vessels ended up in this
G.14

feature. The nearly absent domestic stoneware “crocks and jugs” at only 1.3 percent of all vessels further
emphasizes the urban nature of this feature and may even indicate a household aversion to use of these
cruder ceramic forms. Finally, imported stoneware bottles were comparatively frequent and indicated
that household patrons were strong consumers of above-average goods in the realm of imported ales and
beverages from the United Kingdom. This, of course, assumes that the entire assemblage has some
consistency and that there are no major stratigraphic or temporal differences.

Figure G.6. Frequency histogram of general ceramic vessel forms from Feature 1048B. Assemblage
has a mixture of ceramic vessels from captured sheet refuse, partly reworked feature material, and
directly discarded refuse. The material was deposited between ca. 1857 and ca. 1875 and also includes
older material captured by fill as the feature was sealed (see main text).

If F1048B was filled with the ceramic discards of only one or two households over a three-to seven-year
period, the value of interpreting Figures G.5 and G.6 would be quite high. Unfortunately, the feature’s
history involves two distinct phases captured in the fill that eventually sealed it. The ceramic vessel
assemblage from F1048B has to be understood within both finer temporal contexts and finer stratigraphic
units that correlate with certain contributing sources. In fact, it was necessary to distinguish reworked
older sheet refuse from primary ceramic discards in order to assign subassemblages in F1048B to possible
households. Several plausible interpretations are suggested using tightly dated specimens along with
stratigraphic data and vessel reconstructions. Cross-mending occurrences also provided an important key
to unlocking the structural characteristics of this feature.
Overview of Ceramics by Strata
Feature 1048B’s fill was roughly stratified and revealed the following insights: Cross-mended
occurrences rarely extended beyond adjacent levels. Ceramic vessels indicate that the fill below Level 5
was not mixed or reworked prior to its deposition and subsequent final sealing. Above Level 5, the
feature exhibited a mixed ceramic assemblage that also consisted of reworked sheet refuse, partially
reworked feature refuse, and even some trampled feature material. This is recognizable since the feature
yielded even fewer reconstructable ceramic vessels from the sherds recovered above the preserved section
of the barrel than from within it. A board or plank was noted during excavation, resting flat on top of the

G.15

barrel near the bottom of Level 4. The difference between the ceramic assemblages from above Level 5
vs. below Level 5 is illustrated quite clearly in vessel reconstruction data.
Figure G.7 clearly demonstrates the difference between Levels 1-4 and Levels 5-8. It shows the average
percent of recovery for ceramic vessels by level. Percent recovery is a measure of how much of each
vessel was retrieved in each level. Since each vessel is assigned to its lowest level of occurrence (when
found in multiple levels), Figure G.7 is not affected by dispersion and uses all of the excavated sherds to
account for vessel recovery fractions. Furthermore, since 66 percent of all vessels were from a single
level and 86 percent were within two adjacent levels, the trend in Figure G.7 indicates a dramatic
difference for ceramic vessels below vs. above Level 5. The percent recovery for vessels inside the
preserved section of the barrel is indicative of a comparatively intact deposit, whereas the ceramic vessels
for Levels 1-3 and most of Level 4 represent mixed contexts with a considerable amount of secondary and
reworked sherds.

Figure G.7. The average recovery percent for ceramic vessel enumerated by level from Feature 1048B
(barrel privy). A total of 77 vessels was identified, and each vessel is counted only once. The placement
of vessels with sherds from more than one level uses their lowest level for computing the average
recovery percentages. Sample size by level starting at Level 1 and working downward is 2, 8, 21, 22, 5,
4, 10, and 5 vessels, respectively (77 total vessels). Level 5 was a natural boundary between two very
different subassemblages from this feature: mainly captured sheet refuse above Level 5 and directly
discarded broken vessels below that stratum (Levels 6- 8).

Cross-Mended Sherds, Enumerated Vessels, and Stratigraphy
Cross-mended ceramic sherds provide one observable measure of the interrelatedness of excavated levels.
Two kinds of cross mends are worthy of distinguishing. A total of 19.5 percent of the 77 vessels (n=15)
reveal cross-mended occurrences after a moderate amount of effort was expended (cross-mending efforts
were not fully exhausted but still adequate). Eight vessels cross-mend within levels (V2 in Level 1; V3,
V4, and V5 in Level 3; V26, V27, and V74 in Level 7; and V36 in Level 8), whereas seven vessels crossmend across adjacent levels. Of these seven vessels, only three produced cross-mending beyond adjacent
levels. These include V1 (sherds mended from Levels 1 to 4/5), V21 (Levels 2-5), and V24 (Levels 4 , 6,
and 7). The four that mended within adjacent levels are V19 (Levels 5-6), V30 (Levels 7-8), V35 (Levels
7-8), and V56 (Levels 2-3).

G.16

As the above cross-mending data reveal, the internal structure of F1048B divides into two major subsets:
Levels 1-4 (Group I) and Levels 6-8 (Group II). Only one vessel, V25, produced sherds that crossed the
dividing line between these two groups and spanned Levels 4-7. All other vessels clustered either above
Level 5 or below it. As mentioned earlier, excavators encountered a wooden board resting across the top
of the barrel feature apparently at Level 4 or 5. This board signifies a major shift in the filling of the
privy from an open pit in active use to a sealed pit covered by redeposited yard fill containing a mixture
of ceramic sheet refuse along with a few larger pieces of newly broken ceramics buried along with the
soil.
This scenario is also backed up by other vessel sherds that do not cross-mend but are easily repatriatable
(i.e., in addition to cross-mended sherds, the enumeration of vessels produce another 15 vessels that
possess sherds from multiple levels). Seven vessels yield sherds scattered from more than two adjacent
levels. These are V2 (Levels 1-4), V5 (Levels 2, 3, and 5), V39 (Levels 1-3), V44 (Levels 2-4), V46
(Levels 1-3), V48 (Levels 1-4), and V55 (Levels 2-4). Finally, eight vessels yield sherds from adjacent
levels, including V8 (Levels 3-4), V20 (Levels 5-6), V51 (Levels 2-3), V52 (Levels 2-3), V57 (Levels 23), V59 (Levels 3-4), V63 (Levels 2-3), and V71 (Levels 3-4).
When all of these examples are considered together, along with cross-mended occurrences, 39 percent of
the ceramic vessels in F1048B were scattered among two or more levels. Despite this number, only one
ceramic vessel, V25 as noted above, was distributed across both sides of the dividing line in Level 5 that
separated the upper and lower ceramic assemblages according to different site formation factors. That is,
V25 yielded cross-mended sherds from Levels 4-7. Consequently, these data reinforce the view that the
upper four levels share more internal similarities than the lowest three levels (Levels 6-8). Furthermore,
Level 5 seems to straddle the fence and shares some characteristics with each division. This aspect of the
feature is further discussed, following the additional results presented below.
Ceramic Chronology of Feature 1048B
The age of ceramic vessels in F1048B generally points to the 1850s and 1860s but also includes sherds
from older and newer vessels as well. The most temporally diagnostic vessels include V1, a ‘Potomac
Shape’ molded platter (1862 to ca.1872); V 5, a ‘Rolling Star’ pattern plate by James Edwards and Son
(post 1851 to ca. 1860; V2, a ‘Tyrian’ pattern chamberpot or bowl/pitcher by Davenport (made in 1864,
based upon year stamp); V27, a ‘Fluted Pearl’ pattern molded saucer by John Wedge Wood (registered in
1847 and probably produced up to ca. 1852); V36, a ‘Framed Leaf’ pattern molded plate by Pankhurst
(ca. 1857 to 1867); and an intrusive sherd, V16, from possibly the E. Clarke pottery (Longport 1878–
1880).
The stratigraphic position of these well-dated individual vessels indicate that from oldest to youngest, the
levels can be dated to the following years: Level 8 is post 1857 (V36), Level 7 is post 1847-1852 (V27),
and Level 5 is post 1851 (V5). Combining all of these data, Levels 5-8 postdate 1856. Moving higher,
Level 4/5 is post ca. 1862 (V1), and Level 4 is likely post 1864 to 1865 (V2). Vessel 16 is also from
Level 4, and if correctly identified as E. Clarke is ca. 1878 to 1880, therefore postdating nearly all other
vessels from Level 4 by 15 to 25 years (see Table G.3). All that was visible of the mark is: E. CL . . . . .
.\L . . . . . . Consequently, V16 may indicate a limited but real disturbance through Levels 1-3, and into
Level 4 that may have also extended into some lower levels. Since the barrel outline was fully exposed in
Level 5 and the excavation unit reduced from 1.7 x 1.3 m to the barrel, possible contamination outside the
privy may account for more recent items like V16.
Figure G.8 displays the mean ceramic mid date using only ironstone/whiteware for each level, based upon
the same ‘lowest level’ assignments used for placing vessels. Levels 1, 2, 6, and 8 all had three or fewer
ironstone/whiteware vessels. The dates suggest an 1850s association for the ironstone/whiteware vessels.
When one reviews the vessels that contribute to these dates, it is apparent that Levels 1-3 contain both

G.17

contemporaneous vessels discarded as they were broken, older recaptured sheet refuse, and possibly a few
intrusive sherds discarded well after the lowest four levels of the feature were sealed.

Figure G.8. Mean ceramic mid dates of ironstone/whiteware vessels by level (n=44) for Feature 1048B
(barrel privy). Although some vessels were recovered from adjacent levels, their mid-date values were
used only once and assigned to their deepest occurrence (highest numbered level). Sample size for all
eight levels starting at Level 1 was 2, 3, 12, 14, 4, 2, 5 and 2 vessels, respectively. Level 8 was probably
deposited between 1857 and 1859 and Level 5 after 1866 (see main text for more details).

In summary, the age of various levels using both the marked ceramic vessels noted above and a review of
all other temporally sensitive ceramics is as follows, starting with Level 8 at the bottom. The barrel privy
was probably constructed around 1857, based upon the vessels at the very bottom, and, in particular, the
complete molded ironstone plate with the ‘framed leaf’ pattern by J. W. Pankhurst & Co. (V36). This
pattern’s precise age is approximate and appears to be from the late 1850s or 1860s. Some ironstone
collectors place this pattern in the 1860s, but given the naval blockade, this would place the plate after
mid 1865 and its discard date even later. The plate has very little wear suggesting that it was not in
possession very long before it was broken and discarded. The Pankhurst pottery was in production from
ca. 1852-1882 (Godden 1964:481), and consequently, its backstamp does not help narrow the plate’s
production date. Level 7 contained a ‘Fluted Pearl’ pattern saucer by John Wedgewood registered in
1847 and probably produced to about the early to mid 1850s. A different paneled and molded saucer,
V24, which also dates from the 1850s, was recovered from Level 7. It is broken into six fragments and is
nearly 100-percent reconstructable.
The vessels noted above and others listed in Table G.3 make a post 1860-1861 date for the construction of
the privy, which the author suggests is too late. The ages of the levels may be as follows: Level 8 is
probably about 1857, Level 6 was probably deposited about by 1861, and Level 5, with the Potomac
pattern, is after 1861, thus spanning the beginning of the Civil War. It suggests the feature may have been
temporarily abandoned. Level 4 was deposited soon after 1865. The Rolling Star pattern plate was
recovered from Levels 2 and 5. It was produced around 1851 to 1855, as noted above, and therefore was
probably broken and discarded by 1861, before the Civil War started. Levels 4 and 3 were likely
deposited in the late 1860s and received some actively discarded ceramic fragments, along with a
considerable amount of captured older sheet-refuse material. The older sheet-refuse material artificially
G.18

deflates the average ceramic mid dates, and even includes ceramic traditions not represented in the lowest
four levels of the feature (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8). Examples include two different shell-edged platters,
dipped and banded wares, and transfer-printed vessels of the thin whiteware tradition. Finally, Level 2
was probably deposited by ca. 1870-1875 and the feature sealed below that level soon afterwards.
This temporal scenario spans the Civil War, but it appears that any strata related to the 1861-1865
timeframe are not evident. One would expect a noticeable lack of imported wares and goods from
England and Europe during this period due to the naval blockade by the North. Goods such as imported
British stoneware bottles and new molded ironstone patterns, as well as the frequency of bottle glass,
should decrease in occurrence as the South lost access to certain industrial materials and imported
commodities. Figure G.9 indicates that imported stoneware bottles were recovered from all but the upper
level. Also, porcelain vessels in this feature were imported from Europe or the Orient and were recovered
from nearly all levels, except Levels 1 and 5 (Figure G.10). Referring to Figure G.1, Levels 5 and 6 also
contained few ironstone/whiteware sherds. The reduced number of ironstone/whitewares in Level 6,
however, is also worth mentioning further.

Figure G.9. Frequency of imported stoneware bottles by assigned lowest level in Feature 1048B (barrel
privy), based upon all stoneware bottles recovered (n=11). Sample size starting at Level 1 was 0, 2, 3, 1,
1, 1, 2, and 1 bottle(s), respectively. Bottles in Levels 6 (n=1) and 7 (n=2) are 100% intact. All except one
are imported Bristol stoneware bottles with mustard iron wash upper sections; exception is a sheet-refuse
sherd from a German salt-glazed stoneware mineral water bottle recovered from Level 8.

After the Civil War, major changes occurred that apparently affected the use of F1048B. The larger pit
surrounding the barrel privy apparently slumped and brought with it both sheet refuse and some larger
ceramic sherds into the feature’s soil matrix. This slumping continued into the early 1870s and possibly
later when even fewer ceramic sherds were being discarded in the yard. The feature was sealed in the
1870s with little further contamination. The earliest it could have been sealed is about 1867-1870, and
the very latest about 1875-1880. If it did stay open until 1880, then it received only sheet-refuse kinds of
ceramic sherds with very few exceptions. Other artifact groups may show different discard activities.
Household Associations
The household(s) responsible for ceramics in F1048B can be identified if the above interpretations hold
true for the ages of the strata and their sealing. If the barrel privy was constructed about 1857 and was
filled up to Level 6 by ca. 1861, it would have belonged to John Stansfield, who owned the lot from 1856
to 1865. While Stansfield was from England, his young wife was born in northwestern Germany, near
Saxony (maiden name Emma Trautvetter). Above Level 5, a new owner, William Dissen, had purchased

G.19

the property, as indicated by deeds in 1865. Dissen was also from northwestern Germany, near Hanover.
He had only owned the lot for about a year when he sold it to Frederick Schwiekart, apparently an
American-German grocer from the East Coast. Schwiekart and his family lived on the premises until
1872, at which time they appear to have sold it to another German family, Charles Saigling.

Figure G.10. Frequency of porcelain vessels (n=16) by assigned lowest level in Feature 1048B (barrel
privy) as a fraction of all porcelain vessels recovered. Sample size starting at Level 1 was 0, 2, 4, 5, 0,
1, 2, and 2 vessels, respectively. As such, twice as many porcelain vessels are in the captured sheet
refuse above Level 5 than below it.

The post-1865 ceramic vessels in the upper three levels (Levels 2-4), included more porcelain vessels
(68.7 percent) and imported stoneware bottles (54.6 percent) than the rest of the levels combined. These
same three upper levels contained 75.7 percent of all enumerated ceramic vessels and 62.6 percent of all
ceramic sherds. At the same time, the upper levels above Level 5 contained a larger proportion of sheet
refuse, while the lowest four levels (Levels 5, 6, 7, and 8) contained directly discarded ceramic vessels.
This is evident in Figure G.7, where the percent recovery of the vessels below Level 4 is two to four times
the percent recovery evident from Levels 3 and 4.
The household source of the sheet-refuse sherds in Levels 1-4 is not easy to assign, since the ceramics
include redeposited material. After Stansfield sold the premises and the new buyer cleaned up the
property in 1865 and probably filled in the remaining privy pit, the privy location was abandoned, and the
feature began to compact and slump. The depression created as the strata compacted subsequently
captured older sheet refuse as well as some newer refuse as it filled back in naturally over time. The
upper four levels also captured much older sheet refuse that may have been discarded by the very first
occupant of the Block, Robert Brewster. Brewster was born in Ireland and owned all of Block 103 from
1847 to 1853. A few vessels from the captured sheet refuse in F1048B may be from Brewster’s period of
ownership (see V6, V7, V17, V35, V48, V49, and V70), or they are simply some older vessels brought to
this site by the Stansfields when they moved onto the premises in 1856.
The increase in porcelain in the upper four levels, particularly Levels 3-4 (see Figure G.10), suggests that
post-1865 occupants may have discarded more of these vessels than earlier occupants. Eleven of the 16
porcelain vessels were recovered from post-1865 strata above Level 6. If the manufacture of each
porcelain vessel could be accurately dated, they could be better associated with their possible owners.
Unfortunately, porcelain vessels are much harder to date and sometimes are curated for much longer
periods because of their assigned values. The most useful ceramic vessels to attribute to specific
households from F1048B are the ironstone/whitewares due to their narrow dating.
G.20

Interpretive Summary
Feature 1048B has a complicated history and certainly seems to be a barrel privy, based upon field notes
and related ceramic observations. It was probably constructed by the Stansfield family, based upon
ceramic vessel data, unless other artifact groups provide a clearer age for the deposit. The preponderance
of highly reconstructable or fairly complete vessels in Levels 6-8 suggest that the privy was not cleaned
out during its final filling episode. In fact, only a few sheet-refuse sherds were recognizable in the lower
strata of the feature below Level 5. For example, a small piece of a German stoneware mineral-water
bottle was recovered from Level 8 that apparently represents sheet refuse captured by the feature very
early in its final filling. Seven other sherds are also probably sheet-refuse sherds captured below Level 4,
as the privy was used between 1857 and 1865 (e.g., sherds from V18, V20, V24, V29, and V74). If we
remove these sheet-refuse sherds, 14 vessels can be directly linked to the household using the privy to
1865. These include five ironstone/whiteware vessels (plate V36, molded cup V31, molded saucers V25
and V27, and child’s chamberpot V35), two porcelain tablewares (molded cup V30 and a saucer V28),
one lead-glazed redware colander (V26), three special non-tableware vessels (ointment jar V32, small toy
basket V38, and soap dish V19), and three imported British stoneware beverage containers (V22, V33,
and V34).
Some of the sheet-refuse sherds can also be repatriated back to the Stansfield’s household, based upon the
following deductions. First, an ironstone/whiteware cup sherd pattern seen on V24 (Level 6) matches the
saucer pattern of V25 from Level 7. Also, two chamberpot fragments are like the child’s chamber pot
sherds from Levels 7-8 (see Table G.3 [V35]). As mentioned above, the items in Levels 7-8 were
discarded after 1857 but before 1865 when the Stansfield’s owned the property. These vessels can be
added to the list of probable Stansfield possessions to make seven ironstone/whiteware tableware vessels
(V24, V25, V27, V31, V35, V36, and V74), three porcelain tablewares (V28, V29, and V30), one
redware kitchenware (V26), three special non-tableware vessels (two porcelain vessels V19 and V38 and
ironstone/whiteware V32), and four stoneware beverage containers (V22, V37, V33, and V34) – items
they discarded starting in 1857. Altogether, there are 18 vessels that were probably discarded by the
Stansfield household before 1865, and it is quite possible that all were discarded before 1861 depending
on sealing date for Level 5.
The ceramic vessels evident from the sherds in Levels 1-5 cannot be as easily repatriated. They reveal
mixed depositional associations indicating several household affiliations. These levels contain examples
of much older ceramic vessel sherds than those recovered from the lower section of the barrel privy below
Level 5. For example, sherds from hand-painted whiteware (V13), two blue shell-edged platters (V40
and V3), a banded and annular bowl (V7), and a transfer-printed vessel (V6) appear to be from an
occupation dating before 1857. These sherds were captured in the fill used to seal the privy after it was
abandoned and were primarily deposited in Levels 2 and 3. As mentioned, the Brewster household
owned the property before 1853, and some of these ceramic vessels may well be from their occupation.
The late date of several vessels likely from the 1870s also found in the uppermost levels reinforces this
interpretation (e.g., V75, V76, V58, V46, V51, V56, and V16). That is, consolidation and settling of the
strata in the feature compacted the material over time and caused slumping of its upper level debris to
extend into the upper section of the barrel. Soil around the privy crept into the feature and brought
captured older sheet-refuse sherds along with it.
Consequently, the 58 vessels (ironstone/whitewares, stonewares and porcelains) in Levels 1-5 are from a
variety of sources, since they include redeposited sheet refuse, as well as some contemporary discards
when the upper section of the privy pit was filled and eventually sealed. The contemporary material
might come from the Dissen (1865-1866), Schwiekart (1866-1872), or Saigling (1872-1873) households.
Any material from after 1873 would belong to the Thomas Williamson family (1873+). Thomas was
listed as a railroad contractor and was born in England, while his wife was born in Georgia. The much

G.21

older redeposited sheet-refuse material may be from the Stansfield (1856-1865) or Brewster (1847-1853)
households. The occupant, if any, of the lot containing F1048B for the 1854-1855 period is not known.
The known families for this property and F1048B represent three primary ethnic and cultural
backgrounds: Anglo-European (British or Irish), German and German-American, and American. Such
backgrounds may reveal some differences in the kinds of material culture deposited on the property (Lots
1 and 2 of Block 103). Mr. Brewster was born in Ireland, Mr. Stansfield and Mr. Williamson in England,
and Mrs. Stansfield in northwestern Germany (Saxony). Frederick Schwiekart was born in New York but
probably retained much of his German heritage. Mrs. Williamson was born in the southeastern United
States (Georgia), Mrs. Schwiekart in Texas (née Antoinette Kuhule), and Mrs. Dissen in Texas (née Ann
Feitler). As their maiden names reveal, two of them were of strong German-American decent.
The lower strata in F1048B are probably from the Stansfield household, which is ethnically mixed
between English and German. The small redware colander (V26), porcelain trinkets (small porcelain
basket as V38, soap dish as V19), and British stoneware bottles (V33 and V34) are likely from their
household. They also had two young girls that were eight and five years old when they sold the premises
in 1865, and the nearly complete child’s chamber pot in Level 8 (V35) was likely from training the oldest
one. If so, the chamber pot would have been most useful by mid 1858 to 1859.
If the Stansfield’s association with Levels 6-8 is correct, and it continues to be supported by the many
other material remains recovered from F1048B, the following additional comments may be offered. First,
the household responsible for the material in Levels 6-8 was participating in the fashionable plain white,
molded ironstone tradition; their tablewares show a strong preference for these molded wares. This
decorative ironstone tradition emerged among middle-class urban consumers in Texas by the early to mid
1850s and seemed to last into the late 1860s. Even the three porcelain vessels (V28, V29, and V30)
participated in this kind of decorative tradition. The molded designs of ironstone vessels changed over
time and often provide a good indicator of when a household may have purchased certain patterns. The
‘framed leaf’ molded white ironstone plate in Level 8, for example, was made in 1857 or 1858 and
provides a nice temporal indicator of the age of the lowest level of F1048B. This molded pattern was
protected from being pirated (i.e., unauthorized copying) by other pottery firms for a period of three
years, after which any firm could reproduce it (Godden 1964:526). Consequently, many molded
ironstone patterns were only marketed for a year or two before newer designs and changing fashions
replaced them. Only the most popular patterns were eventually produced for five or 10 years by many
potteries after the protection period expired. The ‘framed leaf’ pattern was not popular or mainstream.
The lack of older ceramic traditions, such as hand-painted and transfer-printed tablewares, in the bottom
three levels (Levels 6-8) is also temporally important. It suggests that the household responsible for the
ceramics was not associated with an older, established family. Mrs. Stansfield was probably married in
1855 or 1856 when she was 18 or 19 years old (her first child was born in 1857). These dates are
important, since they indicate that Mrs. Stansfield would have established her household in the mid 1850s
at a time when the plain white molded ironstone fashion was at its initial peak in popularity. The ‘framed
leaf’ pattern, V36, may indicate that she acquired a larger table setting in the ca. 1857-1858 period and
one plate was immediately broken since it showed no evidence of wear (Wetherbee 1985:86-95).
Also, the kinds of ceramic vessels discarded in Levels 6-8 show above-average socioeconomic status,
since they include the fashionable molded ironstones, gilded porcelains, and imported British and
European ceramic bottled beverages. These ceramic vessel insights must be incorporated with all other
artifact data recovered from Levels 6-8 to be verified and fully understood. Interpretation of the ceramic
vessel data from Levels 5 and higher present greater problems, since the ceramic sherds indicate several
sources spanning the entire 1847-1870 period due to mixed depositional factors and recaptured sheet
refuse.

G.22

In conclusion, F1048B provides an excellent example of the intricacies of interpreting a small barrel privy
that has recaptured older material in its upper levels. The age of its lower levels appears to be assignable
to a single, well-to-do household in the years just prior to the American Civil War. The significance of
these ceramic insights must be checked against all other data before a final conclusion can be drawn. For
now, F1048B reveals one of the few features where multiple broken ceramic vessels were discarded
directly by a household as the feature was used until it was entirely filled by different methods, including
the deposition of older sherds as recaptured sheet refuse.
Feature 1049 (Privy)
Feature 1049 consisted of a circular, sandy stain tentatively identified as the possible remains of a privy.
It produced evidence of 12 ceramic vessels identified from 36 sherds recovered. Five of the six excavated
levels yielded ceramic sherds. Although it certainly did not produce a very large number of ceramic
sherds, F1049’s ceramic assemblage ranks in the upper 20 percentile of all Ball Park features. The
following is a review of the information derived from its ceramic vessels.
Overview of Ceramic Vessel Assemblage
Sherds from this feature were separated using minimum vessel estimates. Twelve distinct vessels are
recognizable. Only three sherds were not assigned to any specific vessels (Cat. Nos. US1, US2, and
US3). If the one likely recaptured older sheet-refuse sherd is removed, the total number of vessels
deposited at about the time the feature was formed is 11.
It is apparent that the ceramic vessel material displays evidence of mixed depositional contexts (i.e., it
contains both sherds from broken ceramics discarded firsthand, as well as captured sheet refuse from
vessels tossed elsewhere). Table G.4 lists the ceramic vessels identified from this feature. The style,
paste, and shape of most vessels are highly indicative of a post-1880 discard context. In fact, one vessel
was accurately assigned to a manufacture date of March 1878. This was possible because it has a
manufacturer’s date as a part of its pottery mark (see V7 below). Select examples are presented in
Figures G.11-G.12.
Interpretive Summary
Ceramic sherds in this feature include some vessels discarded at the time the pit was open as well as some
sherds captured from contemporaneous sheet refuse. These include four ironstone/whiteware tablewares
(plate, two cups, a small specialty dish), a transfer-decorated pitcher, two porcelain tablewares (cup and
soup plate), a domestic stoneware crock, an imported European stoneware mineral water bottle, and a
unidentifiable earthenware vessel (V12). In addition, a sherd from a much older hand-painted vessel was
captured by the feature as it filled. The sherds most indicative of a directly discarded refuse are from V3,
V6, V7, V8, and V9, average 63 percent in their recovery fractions, and range from 50 to 99 percent
reconstructable. They were intentionally tossed into the feature as it filled. The remaining seven vessels
average 8 percent vessel recovery fractions. If V5 is removed, the remaining six vessels average 5
percent complete, which also makes them fall well within the size range for captured sheet-refuse debris.
The age of this feature, if estimated solely on its ceramic vessels, appears to fall in the early to mid 1880s.
A broader period would be created if one considered that the entire group of vessels, excluding V10, was
probably acquired between ca. 1874 and 1885, if not over a longer span. Furthermore, the ceramic
vessels, if representative of the deposit as a whole, reveal a mixture of both very common acquisitions
(e.g., V1, V3, V11) and a few more expensive items (V4, V6, V7). Without reviewing the kinds of other
items recovered from the feature, the ceramic sample is too small to be able to take a definitive stand.

In summary, ceramic vessels from F1049 may have been discarded in the early to mid 1880s if one
selects the narrowest period. If so, they may be from Mary Williamson’s period of ownership (1874).
Ms. Williamson’s household included herself and her two young children. She was born in Georgia and
married an English-born railroad contractor in the mid 1860s. Compared with other features, F1049 was
one of the two youngest that yielded more than nine ceramic vessels. F7019 yielded sherds from more
than 20 ceramic vessels discarded in the early 1890s. The lack of many post-1880 refuse contexts seems
to indicate that off-site refuse disposal was the predominant mode in the late nineteenth century.
Feature 1050 (Posthole)
No ceramic sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 1063 (Possible Privy)
This feature consisted of a rectangular stain measuring roughly 4 x 5 ft (1.2 x 1.4 m) and extending to 12
in (30 cm) deep. Three levels were excavated and 14 ceramic sherds were recovered, three from
mechanical work (no levels noted) and 11 from Levels 1 and 2. If the collected material in Lot 136 also
came directly from the feature matrix, F1063 can be dated more accurately than if it only contained
smaller sherds typical of captured sheet refuse. Captured sheet refuse, by definition, can date from any
period of occupation of a lot up to the day a feature is finally sealed.
Overview of Ceramic Vessel Assemblage
Feature 1063 yielded evidence of nine ceramic vessels from sheet-refuse-sized sherds captured in the
feature matrix. In addition, the feature also appears to have contained two complete vessels, a cup, and
plate, which belong to a matching set of 12-sided molded and paneled blue-tinted ironstone tablewares
(V10 and V11). The plate’s form (marly divides with rim edge molded lines) dates generally from the
1845 and 1854 and has a maker’s mark for Meigh’s that incorporates the Royal Arms motif. The black
printed mark is similar to Godden’s (1964:429) Mark No. 2622, except that it is impressed with:
Ironstone on the lower banner rather than the French ‘Dieu et Mon Droit.’ Also, the quartered shield is
round on the F1063 example, rather than oval like Godden’s example.
This plate mark is from Charles Meigh & Son, who operated a pottery in Hanley, Staffordshire, between
1851 and 1861. The plate was probably made between 1851 or 1854 and was likely discarded by the mid
to late 1850s, when the other items in the feature are considered. The plate shows considerable wear on
its interior well, revealing that it was extensively used before it was discarded. If it is indeed from the
same feature matrix as the excavated sherds, it may have been discarded sometime before 1861.
The Meigh’s marked plate consists of a large intact section (a single sherd) that makes up about 88
percent of the complete vessel. The 12-sided molded and paneled cup is unmarked but matches the plate
in paste, style, and pattern. It has fresh breaks on all faces of both sherds. The two cup sherds account for
about 45 percent of the entire cup. The fresh breaks indicate that this cup may have been more than 80 or
90 percent complete before it was damaged prior to retrieval.
In contrast, all of the excavated sherds from this feature were much smaller in size, belonging instead to
sheet-refuse associations rather than intentionally discarded refuse. They account for nine other vessels
and include three porcelain vessels, one imported stoneware bottle, and five ironstone/whiteware vessels.
If these ceramic vessels are representative of the deposit as a whole, they are indicative of middle-class
acquisitions along with a few decorated vessels and some more expensive porcelain wares (i.e., more
expensive than common plain ironstone/whitewares). None of the porcelain was decorated unless the
decoration was poorly adhered and has washed off. All of the vessels from F1063 are listed in Table G.5.

G.26

Interpretive Summary
The ironstone/whiteware vessels represented by sheet-refuse-sized sherds in F1063 were probably
acquired in the late 1840s or 1850s, based upon common manufacture/popularity dates. These same
vessels were likely discarded by the late 1850s and early 1860s. The three porcelain vessels and one
imported British stoneware bottle may possibly be from this same time period but may also be from
subsequent activities because they, too, are sheet-refuse-sized sherds. Such material can be captured by
F1063 at a later date as soil was used to seal it. The best datable and most intact vessels are V10 and
V11, a matching molded and paneled cup and plate. Both vessels, unfortunately were recovered from
contexts lacking specific provenience. Again, other artifacts in this feature’s assemblage may provide
better clues for dating. The lack of definite post-1865 ceramic sherds, however, does provide some
suggestion that the feature was sealed before that date.

Feature 1063 is located on a lot owned by James and Mary Dumble from 1853 to the 1880s. James and
Mary were both born in England and lived in Indiana before migrating to Texas. They had one infant
child when they moved on the premises in Houston in 1853, and then had four additional children by
1863. Mr. Dumble worked as a commercial merchant in the 1850s and was a partner in Peel and Dumble
in 1866. The age of the molded ironstone plate and cup indicate that these vessels might have been either

G.27

acquired by the Dumble household when they married in ca. 1852, or may have been purchased just after
they arrived in Houston in ca. 1853. The other sherds in the feature matrix were captured as the feature
was filled and all the ceramics seem compatible with a filling date probably around 1858-1865. Given the
size of the feature (4 x 5 ft [1.2 x 1.4 m]), the amount of ceramic material is not particularly dense for
captured sheet refuse, adding further support to the position that this feature was sealed at a comparatively
early date before any extensive sheet refuse had accumulated in this part of Block 103.
Finally, the two matching ironstone vessels indicate that their owner’s household was moderately well to
do and exercised fashionable taste in ceramic acquisitions. If this feature was a privy, it was not used for
discarding ceramic vessels; instead, it simply captured sheet-refuse-sized ceramic sherds along with other
artifacts as it was filled and abandoned. The Dumbles had three adult African-American slaves listed for
their household in 1860. Ceramic material in this feature does not appear to indicate any special AfricanAmerican associations unless one uses the lack of intentionally discarded ceramic vessel remains in the
feature and the nearly whole aspect of the two matching ironstone vessels. Of course, other artifacts may
provide better insight regarding this matter. The exact provenience of the two matching ironstone vessels
could also make a difference, especially if they came from the very bottom of the feature.
In conclusion, the function of F1063 cannot be determined directly from recovered ceramic vessel sherds.
Indirectly, however, the sherds suggest that the pit was not open for a period longer than four to eight
years and was not a depository for discarding broken ceramic vessels. Instead, the ceramic sherds
indicate that contemporary sheet refuse was captured in the fill entering the feature and was responsible
for the majority of the ceramic remains except for two larger ironstone/whiteware vessels that were
recovered without specific provenience.
Feature 1065 (Privy)
Of more than 60 features with ceramics, this feature produced the third largest amount of ceramic sherds
by volume in the Ball Park project excavations (pre-1870 features). The other two features were the
F1048B privy and the less applicable landscaping feature using stoneware bottles, designated as F7036.
Also, in terms of reconstructable intactness of recovered ceramic vessels, F1065 ranks at the top of
features containing more than one or two ceramic vessel specimens.
Feature Description
Feature 1065 was a matrix-filled wood-lined privy pit measuring about 35 x 35 in (90 x 90 cm). It was
partly excavated in 12 levels using two units (Units 1006 and 1006a). The bottom of the privy was also
wood lined and was encountered at 1.24 m below the exposed surface. Ceramic vessel sherds were
recovered from all levels except Level 6. Fourteen ceramic vessels, including one complete chamberpot,
were retrieved.
Overview of Ceramic Vessel Assemblage
Fourteen ceramic vessels were enumerated from the 76 sherds recovered from this feature. Eight of them
were represented by large enough proportions to indicate that they were intentionally discarded in the
privy (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V8, V9, and V14) and were not the product of redeposited sheet refuse
captured by the feature as it filled. The total list of vessels is presented in Table G.6.
The distribution of ceramic vessels by level in F1065 is summarized below. They reveal a quite
interesting trend that suggests a well-stratified deposit with little mixing. Seventy-two percent of the
vessels were recovered from only one level (V1, V2, V3, V6, V7, V10, V11, V12, and V13) or two
adjacent levels (V8). The remaining four vessels were more scattered. Two vessels (V4 and V9) were
spread across two nonadjacent levels, one vessel (V14) across three adjacent levels, and one vessel across
five levels (V5). These data provide some insight when the percentage of each vessel’s completeness is
also taken into consideration. The percentages are shown in parentheses in Table G.7.

vessels recovered from more than one level are indicated using the total recovery fraction overall and are not broken down into
proportion recovery per level.

Based upon percentages, the uppermost part of F1065 contains mostly sheet refuse that either slumped
into the privy after it was abandoned and its sediment consolidated (Levels 1-3) or was in the fill used to
seal it (Levels 4-6). This is plainly evident in the percent completeness of each vessel from Levels 1-3.
Similarly, Levels 4-6 probably represent fill containing one broken vessel that was used to seal the feature
initially.
This scenario is evident in the data. For example, the two uppermost levels average 5 percent vessel
recovery (n=4), which is typical for sheet refuse, while the lowest two levels average an estimated 90
percent recovery (n=3), which is indicative of intentionally discarded ceramic vessels. Finally, there is a
real break in vessel completeness at Level 6 with greater recovery below and much less recovery above,
supporting the view of a well-stratified deposit.
Overall, the data seem to support short-term use of F1065, probably by a single family, given the
similarity of some vessel forms and styles and the closeness in age profiles of the ceramics. Final
verification for this feature, however, requires looking at all artifacts recovered from all levels and not just
ceramic sherds.
Interpretive Summary
Feature 1065 yielded ansortment of ceramic vessel sherds with some vessels possibly acquired as early as
the late 1830s, and others as late as about 1850, given the date spans suggested. The ceramics include
paneled and molded ironstones, hand-painted and undecorated whitewares, shell-edged wares, and an
imported stoneware jar. Robert Brewster was the first on record to have owned this land. He bought it in
1847 and held it until 1853. He built a house on this block in 1847 and may have lived in it for only a
year or two based upon available records (see Chapter 8). Brewster was born in Ireland in about 1813 and
was married in 1845. He was listed as a merchant on the 1850 Houston census and apparently lived
elsewhere in Houston by the end of 1853 (presumably the Fourth Ward area).

G.30

The average beginning date of manufacture of the ceramic vessels from F1065 (excluding porcelain and
stoneware) is 1838.5; their mean ceramic mid date is 1843.5. If James Brewster only occupied the block
for about a year or so, his ceramic wares might look comparable to the F1065 assemblage so long as he
still had access to some ceramic specimens acquired when he was 25 to 30 years of age. This would
explain the older items found along with the post-1848 well-dated vessels.
The small number of ceramic vessels, coupled with many fairly complete or reconstructable specimens,
may be compatible with a privy that was used only for a year or two. If this is accurate, and Brewster
moved off the premises in 1853, then the following scenario would have had to occur to retain an
association with his household. Specifically, the 1848 Davenport plate had to be discarded before he
moved off the premises, also making all of the other vessels below Level 7 from activities prior to that
point in time. In addition, all of the material above about Level 7 had to be discarded in the yard near the
privy before he moved off the premises in 1853, and subsequently captured in the soil that eventually
filled the feature and permanently sealed it.
The lack of any definitively post-1853 ceramics seems to support this view quite well, but the glass vessel
data seem to reject this scenario based upon two particular specimens. In fact, glass bottles suggest that
the deposit was sealed by about 1860 (see Chapter 10). If this is true and not a result of any intrusive
material, the ceramic vessels still appear to relate best to Robert Brewster and a pre-1854 discard date,
while the bottles may better relate to a different source and set of events if they are not intrusive. That
there are really no ceramics made exclusively after 1853 makes it hard to place them with a household
other than the Brewsters. The Dumbles purchased the property in 1853; they were a much younger
married couple who would have stocked their household with ceramics made after 1850. Older wares
would have been quite anomalous and would not fit their age profile nearly as well as they would the
Brewsters.
The most informative vessel in F1065 is the 1848 Davenport plate. This plate exhibits considerable knife
scratches and wear from extensive use, indicating that it was probably four or five years old when it was
discarded. Also, many of its sherds are covered with a petroleum-like black residue that extends over
broken edges. One center sherd, however, lacks the black staining, indicating that the residue occurred
after the plate had been broken and scattered. Since this vessel was recovered from the major fill layers
immediately covering Levels 7 to 12, it supports the scenario that Brewster or Dumble filled the privy in
1853 and sealed it with soil and the remains of a recently discarded plate, designated as V5. The 1860
sealing date seems too late, based upon the ceramic sherds. It would only be possible if the yard area
containing the privy was abandoned after Brewster moved off the premises, and only if bottle glass
happened to be discarded in the area after 1853 and until the final sealing of the feature in the early 1860s.
Another interesting aspect of F1065 is the extent of its intact ceramic vessels. In particular, F1065 has the
highest ceramic vessel reconstruction index of any feature with the remains of more than one or two
ceramic vessels total. Finally, a paneled and molded blue-tinted ironstone cup represented by a single,
large sherd with an attached handle actually cross-mends with two other sherds from Feature F1063 (Cat.
Nos. 136-11, 136-12). This occurrence may be explainable in this case, since the F1063 sherds were
recovered by machine excavation and lacked specific level contexts. Features F1063 and 1065 are
located within 6 ft (2 m) of each other, and machine-disturbed contexts can be hard to precisely pin down.
A similar style plate was also recovered from F1063; its period of manufacture could be dated after 1850
but prior to 1854. These plates may suggest that the household responsible for the ceramic material in
Features 1063 and 1065 is represented by the same family.
Given these data and their related assumptions, the ceramic vessels recovered from F1065, if
representative of the deposit as a whole, may be indicative of household acquisitions made between ca.
1838 and 1850. The ceramics are average to just slightly above average in their socioeconomic

G.31

associations if they were acquired during this time. Finally, if one were to model the narrowest discard
context for this feature, based solely u[on ceramics, it might be ca. 1842-1853 and seems to best fit the
Brewster household.
Feature 1066 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature yielded only one ceramic sherd. It is from a cup probably made ca. 1870-1885. It may be
possible that when all of this feature’s contents are studied together, a finer date and socioeconomic
household profile can be determined.
41HR815, BLOCK 118
Ceramic vessel sherds were analyzed from six of the ten major features found on Block 118. The ages of
ceramic vessels from four of the features post date 1880, while the other two range from 1850-1882. The
results of all the ceramic analyses for Block 118 are given below in order by feature number.
Feature 2001 (Refuse Deposit)
Feature 2001 was identified by as a possible refuse deposit, although it yielded a comparatively small
sample of ceramic vessels covering a broad time span. It contained 22 ceramic vessel sherds from mixed
contexts. Captured sheet-refuse sherds were most frequent, along with a few larger sherds probably
coming from directly discarded items. The laboratory noted 37 ceramic sherds before fresh breaks were
rejoined and other nonvessel ceramic sherds removed. Sherd Cat. No. 34-1 (Level 3), for example, is
from a green-glazed ceramic tile (early twentieth century?) rather than a ceramic vessel.
The 22 vessel sherds identified 11 ceramic vessels ranging from the 1880s to 1915, with a couple of older
or younger sherds also present. Eight vessels were retrieved from exposed surface contexts (Lot 32 and
assigned ‘Level 1’) in Unit 2005, and only three vessels (six sherds) were excavated from below the
surface.
The recent age of some ceramic material is verified by several makers’ marks. Vessel 7 (Level 1, Cat.
Nos. 32-16 and 32-20) is a thin tradition, single-inflection plate with an International Pottery Company’s
Trenton, New Jersey backstamp in the Burgess & Co. style for the ca. 1903-1910+ period (see Debolt
1988:38). It is 35 percent complete. Vessel 8 (Level 1, Cat. No. 32-21), another plate, looks to be from
the same set, but differs in the number of jigger-mold lines. Vessel 10 is from the Greenwood Pottery.
Its mark is: GREENWOOD CHINA\TRENTON, N J and is considered to be from the ca. 1886 to ca.
1900 period by Debolt (1988:35-36). It is possibly much later in age. Finally, several diagnostic late
vessel forms and decorative styles (e.g., late flow-blue plate, many vessels with jigger-mold lines, thinbodied plates with broad marlys and single inflection shoulders, etc.) underscore the post-1895
component for this feature. Due to its very late age, no further comments are offered.
Feature 2002 (Sealed Well)
This feature was identified as a well. It yielded only three ceramic sherds representing two vessels: a
body sherd (Cat. No. 43-20) from a lightly relief-molded very light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware
bowl/pitcher (?) and two sherds (Cat. Nos. 43-23, 43-24) from a two-toned-exterior stoneware baking
bowl with molded base. This vessel has a Bristol slip over a dark brown clay slip exterior with a dark
brown clay slip interior. A partial inscription reads: . . OUT . . , probably denoting the pottery (Southern
pottery?). Both vessels probably date from ca. 1890-1910, when the well was likely replaced by a public
water system and was no longer needed.
Feature 2003 (Gutter)
This feature yielded only two sheet-refuse-sized ceramic sherds representing two vessels. One is a base
sherd (Cat. No. 33-17) from a gilded, white porcelain, single-inflection plate/dish (has jigger-line molds,
ca. 1895-1925). The other is an interior sherd (Cat. No. 33-16) from a light gray tinted thick ironstone

G.32

plate (ca. 1870-1885?) with a considerable amount of knife wear. These few ceramic sherds make it hard
to say much more about this feature except that they date to the late nineteenth century.
Feature 2004 (Posthole)
This feature yielded only a small porcelain rim sherd from a saucer (Cat. No. 39-5). It appears to predate
the twentieth century, although vessels like it are hard to accurately pin down. It is possibly from the
1890s. The bottle glass from this feature gave no temporal data. Little more can be said about this
feature based solely upon the ceramic vessel data.
Feature 2005 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature yielded evidence of only three ceramic vessels: an unglazed redware flower pot scattered
among Levels 1 and 2 (n=8 sherds), a large, bluish tinted ironstone washbasin (n=2 sherds), and a
molded, light bluish tinted porcelain vessel of unknown age and function. About 50 percent of the 32-cm
diameter basin (12.5 cm tall) was recovered from the exposed surface and from Level 1 of the feature.
Old breaks cross-mended, and a few minor new breaks are also evident. The basin has an illegible
diamond registry mark on its base that appears to be an example of the pre-1883 style mark. If so, this
would make the feature date sometime after ca. 1875-1882, based upon the style and age of the basin.
Feature 2006 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature yielded evidence of only five ceramic vessels represented by 22 sherds. Of this number, only
one vessel (V3) is more than 10 percent complete. It is a hexagonal/octagonal molded and paneled large
bowl or chamberpot reminiscent in style to the ‘prize nodding’ pattern of the ca. 1842-1855 period but
slightly later (see Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:103). About 35 percent of the vessel was recovered with
many cross-mending sherds. Its fragments were scattered among two levels (six from Level 1, two from
Level 2, and seven from a special surface collection). The vessel may have been acquired in the 1850 to
1855.
About 2 percent of a molded and paneled porcelain cup sherd (V1, Cat. No. 1-14, ca. 1845-1860?) was
also recovered from a special surface collection of the exposed feature and may be contemporaneous with
the hexagonal/octagonal large bowl/chamberpot. The other three vessels were not as easily datable.
Vessel 2 was identified from four surface-collected sherds (Cat. Nos. 1-7, 1-12, 1-13, 1-17) and is
possibly a ca. 1865-1885 bowl or basin. Only about 8 percent of the vessel was recovered.
The remaining two vessels, a saucer (V4, Level 6) and an unspecifiable form (V5, Level 2), are both hardpaste porcelains. They were represented by sheet-refuse-sized sherds and each is estimated to be less than
2 percent of their original vessel forms. Little more can be said about these two vessels.
Altogether, the ceramic sample from F2006 was not large enough to provide a firm date unless greater
emphasis is placed on the single reconstructable vessel (V3). If the smaller sherds are simply intrusive
sheet refuse, the hexagonal vessel might indicate the proper age for the sealing of the feature, placing this
event in the late 1850s or early 1860s. Bottle glass, however, suggests a post-1900 age, making it
necessary to look at all the data available from the feature beyond the information noted here.

41HR819, BLOCK 163
This block was included within the 4000 series of feature numbers. Only two important features were
identified in the stripped and evaluated area: F4001, a posthole, and F4002, a filled cistern. Ceramic
vessel fragments were recovered from the cistern; they suggest a post-1880 date when the Houston public
water system was becoming a reliable alternative to well and cisterns. Results from the ceramic analyses
are described below.
Feature 4001 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 4002 (Filled Cistern)
This feature yielded 10 ceramic vessel sherds from eight vessels, and one ceramic tile sherd. Three
ceramic vessels are imported mineral water bottles and are more than 10 percent complete (one is 99
percent complete, another about 40 percent complete, and another about 15 percent complete). There are
also sherds from two porcelain vessels (a candle holder and a gilded rim spiral fluted teacup), two
ironstone/whiteware vessels (a mulberry-purple late transfer-printed plate, ca. 1880-1895, and an older
sheet-refuse sherd from a blue-tinted molded and paneled ironstone cup from the 1850-1865 period), and
a hand-thrown/wiped unglazed pre-1900 flower pot. The tile sherd is decorated with majolica-like
mottled light colored glazes (green, yellow, blue) and was probably manufactured about 1870-1890.
This small sample of vessels, when lumped together, suggests a general date of 1870-1895. However, it
is not known how representative these ceramics are of the feature in general. If they are, the cistern may
have been abandoned and sealed by about 1890-1900, which is compatible with the period when the
Houston public water system was permanently established, replacing older wells and cisterns.
41HR816, BLOCK 162
This block falls within the 5000 series for assigned feature numbers. Ten features were identified and
ceramic vessel fragments were recovered from seven (F5005, F5006, F5008, F5009, F5014, F5017, and
F5019).
Feature 5003 (Brick Pier)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 5004 (Brick Concentration)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 5005 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded only a small body sherd (Cat. No. 37-10, Level 2) from a common gray-tinted
ironstone cup (ca. 1865-1880?). The sherd exhibits defective glazing and looks like sheet refuse captured
in the feature matrix. Bottle glass from this feature gave no temporal data, thus little more can be said
about its age.
Feature 5006 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded only three ceramic sherds from two vessels: a small body sherd from a wavy bluebanded and blue slip-washed late transitional cream-colored ware bowl/pitcher (ca. 1840-1855) and two
sherds from a cream-colored ware or very light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware teacup, about 35 percent
complete (Cat. Nos. 24-8, 30-9). The small cup is possibly from 1840-1855, but because the form was
not common it may also be from the later 1870-1895 period. The cup is unusually narrow in body shape
and has an early example of a footrim. The vessel might better be described as a demitasse-sized cup.
The banded sherd looks like sheet-refuse material captured by feature matrix, whereas the two cup sherds

G.34

cross-mend and are large enough to be directly discarded material. The bottle glass from this feature
suggest a late nineteenth-century date, and little more can be said about its age using only these two
ceramic vessels.
Feature 5007 (Brick Pier)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 5008 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded five sherds from three ceramic vessels all in Level 1: a blue-tinted ironstone plate
(two cross-mended sherds, Cat. Nos. 11-28 and 11-29, show part of an Adams impressed maker’s mark,
ca. 1845-1864; date modified from Godden 1964:21, No. 25), a burned thinner blue-tinted (?)
ironstone/whiteware plate center (two sherds cross-mend, Cat. Nos. 11-26 and 11-27, probably ca. 18421856?), and a small body sherd (Cat. No. 11-16), probably from a solid brown Bennington-type glazed
(interior and exterior) hollowware vessel (coffeepot or pitcher? probably ca. 1845-1870?). All five sherds
probably represent sheet refuse captured in the fill matrix around the brick pier. Bottle glass from this
feature was not assigned any useful temporal data. If the ceramic sherds are temporally representative of
when the pier was constructed, then it appears to postdate ca. 1855 on part of a previously occupied lot.
Feature 5009 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded only one ceramic vessel sherd: a small piece of a heavily trampled and weathered
light bluish tinted ironstone plate (ca. 1848-1868, Cat. No. 10-4). It also contains a small chip from a
thick brown salt-glazed sewer pipe (Cat. No. 9-2), probably made after 1885. Little more can be said
about this feature based upon only on these two ceramic sherds.
Feature 5014 (Wood-Lined Privy)
This feature produced a moderate number of ceramic vessel sherds, ranking among the top 10 largest
ceramic assemblages, based upon the raw laboratory inventory. A total of 65 sherds was counted after
nonvessel sherds and fresh breaks were removed from the assemblage (brick, porcelain doll, marbles,
etc.). The remaining sherds revealed evidence of 36 ceramic vessels, listed in Table G.8. Only three
ironstone/whiteware sherds (Cat. Nos. 52-5, 53-6, 70-11) could not be assigned to any specific vessels as
the enumeration analysis was completed.
Overview of Ceramic Vessel Data
Twenty-eight of the 36 vessels from this feature are either ironstone/whiteware tablewares or related
vessels forms in the plain white or simple molded white traditions. The remainder include sherds from
five American stoneware vessels, one imported stoneware bottle, one Bennington-type mottled brown
vessel (a yellowware variant), and one hard-paste porcelain specialty vessel (soap dish inset or colander).
Many of the tightly dated ceramic vessels were probably acquired between ca. 1855 and 1868. In fact,
only three vessels fall on the outer fringe of this time period: two ironstone/whiteware vessels (V11 from
ca. 1865-1880 and V17 from ca. 1848-1854) and a stoneware jar (V36 from ca. 1830-1855). Only eight
vessels were unable to be tightly dated using less than 17-year popularity intervals (V29 to V36; see
Table G.8). All of the others were assigned to their most common periods of acquisition and use.
Many of the ironstone/whitewares are plain vessel forms with either no decoration or minimal relief
designs. The ironstone/whitewares vessels showing any evidence of decoration are Vessels V1, V2, V3,
and V4, which have a distinctive molded inner marly raised ridge (these appear to be from a set, all
minimally decorated), Plate V9 with a Sydenham-type molded pattern, Saucer V17 with a pre-Sydenhamlike molded pattern, Saucer V20 with a rounded dodecagonally shaped molded pattern, and a chamberpot
with standard molded and rounded panels below the rim (V26). The only other remaining decorated
vessel is an octagonal brown mottled yellowware pitcher or coffeepot (V29). All nine decorated vessels

Acquisition Dates for the Ceramic Vessels
The most probable acquisition period for the ceramic vessels from this feature spans from about 1858 to
about 1868. In fact, only three of the vessels (V17, V21, V36) appear to have probable acquisition spans
that predate 1858, and only one vessel (V11) may postdate 1868. Consequently, the ironstone/whiteware
vessels in this feature may be the discards of a single household that moved onto the premises in 1861 and
brought with them a few older ceramic vessels from their previous home. This actual scenario is
plausible for the Cohen family, a large family with five children, who moved onto the premises
containing this feature in 1861.
The Cohens were an older household that certainly may have brought a few pre-1861 ceramic vessels
with them. William and Teresa Cohen were married by at least 1852, based upon the age of their oldest
child, Isaac. They had three more children after coming to Texas in either 1860 or 1861 from Mississippi.
Prior to moving to Texas, they had lived in Mississippi (1859-1860), Missouri (ca. 1854-1858), and
Louisiana (ca. 1852-1854). This information is based upon the places of birth noted in censuses for their
children.
The Cohens, both born in Prussia, probably came to New Orleans by boat and attempted to establish
homes in major river towns before heading to Houston to make it their permanent residence for 38 years.
G.37

Mr. Cohen was a tailor by occupation in the 1860 and 1870 censuses. Apparently, these services made
the Cohens very mobile and they did not settle down until they apparently found a community they
preferred, Houston. It is possible that their religious beliefs also played a role in this decision, as the
Cohens were apparently Jewish Orthodox.
Before the Cohens settled on Lot 10 of Block 162, the de Cordova family owned the property from about
1839-1860, living on the lot for the first three years of their ownership. Between 1842 and 1860, the lot
was probably rented. None of the ironstone/whiteware vessels forms/styles is older than about 1848 in
terms of plausible acquisition dates. In fact, only one ironstone/whiteware vessel (V17) and one
stoneware vessel (V36) may have been acquired before 1855. Six other ironstone/whiteware vessels (V9,
V20, V21, V22, V25, and V28) could have been acquired before 1855, but they also could have been
acquired anytime up to ca. 1858/1861 or even 1868 (i.e., V22). Consequently, the final interpretation of
the ceramic assemblage from F5014 cannot be made on the basis of ceramic vessels alone. Other
temporal and functional artifacts should be reviewed and integrated to construct a realistic appraisal of the
age of this feature.
Finally, it is possible that some of the ceramic vessels in this feature were purchased and discarded by
other residents on this lot between ca. 1854 and 1860. Seven vessels are old enough to be possibly
discarded before 1861 (V9, V17, V20, V21, V25, V28, and V36). If this was true, all six
ironstone/whiteware vessels discarded possibly before 1861 were not particularly expensive or decorative.
Four of them are undecorated wares (66 percent), whereas only two are simply molded plain white
vessels (V9 and V17). Alternatively, all of the ceramic material could have been discarded by the Cohens
as long as one assumes that they also brought a few older vessels with them or acquired these older
vessels once they arrived in Houston. More will be said about this in the summary section of this
discussion. Interestingly, the ceramic wares from F5014 do not suggest any non-American ethnic
affiliations, even though the Cohens were Prussian-born emigrants and presumably practicing Orthodox
Jews.
Stratigraphic Information
Most sherds from F5014 were recovered from Levels 2-5, which account for 80 percent of the ceramics.
Another 15 percent of the sherds were recovered from Levels 6 and 7, while Level 8 produced no ceramic
sherds.
Several additional observations are worth noting. First, the lack of completeness of the ceramic vessels
represented by sherds from F5014 suggest that the feature was either periodically cleaned (fill removed)
or received only single sherds, not entire broken vessels, from cleanup activities. Only four vessels are
more than 8 percent complete (V1, V7, V9, and V32), and noneis more than 60 percent complete. The
lack of vessel completeness and the near absence of any vessels scattered beyond two adjacent vessels
(only sherds from two vessels, V1 and V2, were distributed beyond two adjacent levels) seems to
discredit the cleaning out of the privy. Instead, the stratigraphic closeness of sherds from the same
vessels suggests that the feature was continuously forming and was not altered after its last phase of use.
If it was ever cleaned prior to this last filling episode, the cleaning was complete, and all older fill matrix
had been fully removed. There is no evidence that a greater preponderance of older sherds is lower, near
the bottom of the feature, vs. near its top (i.e., Levels 1-3 vs. Levels 5-7).
The average mean mid dates for each level were compiled using the more tightly datable 28
ironstone/whiteware vessels. Level 8 had no vessels in it and thus cannot be used. The remaining seven
levels produced the following dates in order from Level 1 to Level 7: 1853 (n=1), 1862.9 (n=10), 1863.5
(n=5), 1865.2 (n=3), 1858.6 (n=5), 1864 (n=2), and 1857.5 (n=2). When all sample sizes of three vessels
or less are removed, the remaining three are all within a 4.3 year period of each other and are from late
1858 to mid 1863. Once again, these kinds of data suggest that this feature was used for less than 10

G.38

years, most likely from ca. 1861 to ca. 1868. If, however, it was actually used by more than one family
over a much longer period, its contents are entirely atypical. Few broken but reconstructable vessels were
thrown into it, yet it retains good stratigraphic attributes since sherds from individual vessels are not
widely scattered vertically. Therefore, it probably was not cleaned from top to bottom before it was
finally sealed, and probably accumulated refuse over a five- or 10-year period ending about 1868 to 1870.
The final interpretation of the most plausible period of use for this feature requires looking at all other
artifact data also recovered from it.
Interpretive Summary
Under any interpretive scenario, this feature appears to span the American Civil War. Therefore, it is of
great interest to study its entire contents, since there was a naval blockade by the North along the entire
Texas coast.
The blockade prevented importation of British wares and other goods into
Galveston/Houston/New Orleans and other Confederate ports. Consequently, it is extremely unlikely that
any of the F5014 imported British ceramic wares were acquired between late 1861 and mid 1865.
Instead, the ironstone/whiteware vessels and other imported wares either predate or postdate the war.
This would mean some of the vessels were acquired in the 1850s, while others were acquired between
1865 and ca. 1868/1870. The question is whether the pre-1861 ceramic sherds recovered from this
feature were from vessels brought to this site by the Cohen family or by other families occupying the lot
before 1861. The ceramic vessel data do not conclusively answer this for us.
Chronology of both F5014 and all of its artifacts holds the key to unlocking this kind of detailed
information. Ceramic makers’ marks and other highly datable sherds provide some limited help. The
highly datable ceramic items from F5014 include a backstamp from Thomas Hughes (Burslem) on V1,
ca. 1860-1876 (form is more like ca. 1860-1868 period); a Sydenham (round variant) pattern-molded
ironstone plate,V9, ca. 1854-1861; a Wedgewood & Co. semivitrified blue-tinted ironstone plate, V12,
made between 1860 and 1873 (based upon plate blank, marker’s mark, and pattern); a J. W. Pankhurst
ironstone plate, V4, which dates from about 1850-1882 (Godden 1964:481, No. 2953 [although this mark
does not have the: & Co.]), with a ca. 1860-1870 style; and a saucer, V17, exhibiting an early precursor of
the molded Sydenham pattern that was probably fired in kilns also used for flow mulberry decorated
wares typically made during the ca. 1848-1854 period.
These five well-dated vessels reveal the dual acquisition period evident for this feature when the Civil
War blockade is taken into consideration. Two vessels were definitely acquired before 1861, whereas the
three other vessels were most likely acquired after 1865 but before 1870. Altogether, 17 ceramic vessels
support two periods of acquisition: (1) ca. pre 1861 (Vessels V9, V17, V20, V21, V25, V28, V36), and
(2) ca. 1865-1870 (Vessels V1, V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, V11, V12, V26, V27). Those not listed fall in both
periods and cannot be separated into one or the other. Ten vessels are definitely Cohen family discards,
four vessels are most probably Cohen family discards (V13, V14, V18, V23), seven vessels might be
either late acquisitions from a renter or older acquisitions of the Cohen family brought to the premises in
1861, and 15 cannot be assigned to either since they span the entire period of interest.
Finally, if one were to assume the narrowest possible discard context for this feature based upon only
ceramic vessels, it might be ca. 1861-1868/1870. But this would also assume that the older, out-offashion ceramic vessels were either discarded during the war years as the naval blockade took its toll on
Texas or were acquired as used vessels during the blockade to replace broken dishes. Civil War
households would have had to resort to using whatever ceramic tablewares they could scrounge up by
whatever means possible. If this is true, the privy could have been used solely by the Cohen family.
Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed from the ceramic vessel data alone.
An alternative scenario could involve two households being responsible for the assemblage: (1) the De
Cordova renters discarding broken ceramics between ca. 1858 and 1861, and (2) the Cohen family

G.39

discarding the refuse between 1861 to ca. 1870. In either case, ceramic vessels from this feature are
indicative of household acquisitions and ceramics in common use between 1854 at the earliest and 1870
at the latest. Ceramic vessels in the feature represent an average socioeconomic status for this period and,
therefore, are probably indicative of strongly middle-class preferences.
Feature 5017 (Brick Concentration)
Feature 5017 yielded sheet-refuse-sized ceramic sherds indicative of broken pieces of ceramic vessels
discarded in yard areas and then reworked for years and even decades, as various activities and foot traffic
trampled and reduced them into smaller fragments. For some vessels, this process may have extended for
two decades or more, depending upon how long ago the sherds had been thrown into the yard. For
fragments from other vessels, this process may have lasted only several years or even just a few months
before they were sealed in F5017’s deposit. By 1880 at the latest, all of the sherds, along with a few more
recently discarded broken vessels, were buried and the feature was completely covered.
Initially, the laboratory inventory noted 331 ceramic sherds from F5017, but this raw count was
subsequently reduced by 11 sherds after removing fresh breaks and nonceramic vessel items, ending up
with 320 sherds. The analysis produced an inventory of 126 ceramic vessels, the greatest number of
vessels recovered from a single Ball Park feature. The vessels were represented mostly by captured older
sheet-refuse sherds that had been sealed in the feature as soil filled its depression. Also, sherds from a
few contemporaneous ceramic vessels were also captured in the fill as the depression was covered.
Most of the ceramic vessels enumerated from F5017 are ironstone/whitewares (n=101) probably acquired
in the mid to late 1840s to the late 1860s. In addition to ironstone/whitewares, the following other
ceramic wares are also present: yellowwares (n=7), domestic stonewares (n=2), imported stonewares
(n=3), imitation majolica variant (n=3), hard-paste porcelain (n=8), and soft-paste porcelain (n=2).
Altogether, the sherds revealed a broad cross section of household ceramics indicative of vessels
discarded over several decades and captured by the soil that filled the feature.
There are also a few later ironstone/whiteware vessels acquired between ca. 1870 and 1880 that were
apparently buried in the feature as it filled. This dual source of ceramic vessels, with both older captured
sheet refuse and newer contemporary discards, makes interpretation of the ceramic assemblage from
F5017 complicated. This dual source of sherds is also evident in the time span represented by the
material. It accumulated over a 28- to 32-year period mostly as sheet refuse and then was subsequently
incorporated in F5017 as fill. Much of the fill matrix probably came from the adjacent yard around the
feature and also from soil eroding and slumping into the depression.
Feature 5017 appears to have been sealed by 1880, based upon ceramic data. The socioeconomic
associations for most of the ceramic vessels are average, along with a few slightly above (simple molded
ironstone/whitewares) and some slightly below average (common undecorated utilitarian
ironstone/whitewares) wares also present. There are several very expensive wares present, such as gilded
porcelains and large imitation majolica jardinieres that are not easily assignable to a narrow age range.
Analysis and interpretation of the entire ceramic vessel assemblage from this feature required repatriating
them with two possible property owners, based upon the following division of time. All pre-1861 vessels
were placed with the Jacob De Cordova ownership period, even though very late ones (post-1855 vessels)
could also be older vessels brought to this site by the Cohen family. All post-1861 vessels were assigned
to the William Cohen household.
Still, some vessels could not be assigned to either ownership period, based upon their temporal
associations and these vessels were, instead, placed in a third neutral grouping. The breakdown of vessels
by these three associations suggests an average household association for most pre-1861 wares and a

G.40

slightly below average household association for the ca. 1861 to ca. 1875/1880 period. These evaluations
are, of course, based solely upon ceramic vessels and exclude all other artifact data.
Feature Description
Feature 5017 was identified as a concentration of brick fragments with artifacts. The feature was located
near the middle of the northwestern quarter of Block 162 (41HR816). It was south of Parcel 162-1 and
about 40 ft (12 m) south of a pre-1870s house location. The closest other major features were two series
of multiple brick pier bases beginning about 13-20 ft (4-6 m) to the north, and a wood-lined privy about
33 ft (10 m) to the east.
Excavation of F5017 followed 10-cm levels. Two 1-x-1-m units were excavated through the feature,
probably sampling about 70 percent of the feature by area using an estimate of its plan view. A total of
five levels was removed from each 1-x-1-m unit, and 97 percent of the ceramic vessel sherds were
recovered from Levels 2-4 (Figure G.13). Within those three levels, Level 3 contained the greatest
frequency of sherds and accounted for 42 percent of the ceramic assemblage. The actual distribution of
sherds by level from both units combined is: 2.5 percent from Level 1, 25.3 percent from Level 2, 42.2
percent from Level 3, 29.7 percent from Level 4, and only one sherd or 0.3 percent from Level 5 (n=320
sherds; see Figure G.13). As this reveals, the paucity of ceramic sherds in Level 1 indicates that the
feature was ultimately sealed with clean fill so long as Level 1 was also 10 cm thick.

Figure G.13. Relative frequency histogram of the distribution of ceramic sherds by level from
Feature 5017 (brick concentration with other artifacts). A total of 320 ceramic sherds was
recovered from proveniences assigned to this feature and 126 vessels were enumerated. This
particular feature was one of the few that had captured sheet refuse material accumulated over a
28- to 32-year period (see main text for details).

Ceramic differences between provenience units were not considered important in the analyses since
sherds were identified that cross-mended across the two units, verifying that they shared a common
source. This characteristic would be expected for the deposit since it almost exclusively contained
captured sheet-refuse debris and very little directly discarded ceramic material. As for other kinds of
artifacts from F5017, the reader is referred to other chapters to understand the full range of material
recovered from this feature. The following subsections focus on the kinds of information gleaned solely
from the ceramic vessel assemblage enumerated from F5017.

G.41

Ceramic Assemblage Overview
Although the sherd count from F5017 was the second highest and its vessel count the highest of any
excavated Ball Park features, it still yielded only an estimated 0.5 gallons (1.9 liters) of ceramic sherds,
which ranks comparatively far down the list, at about 15th among all others (i.e., between 11th and 20th
when rounded to nearest 0.5 liters). This is quite low, given the extremely high vessel count, definitely
placing F5017 in the range of sheet refuse when the volume of soil matrix is also taken into account.
These statistics, however, are not exact since enumeration was not fully possible due to the small size of
some sherds. In fact, 18.7 percent of the sherds from this feature were not assigned to vessels because
they were too small to distinguish important attributes in the time available. An adjustment may be
appropriate to account for these small sherds.
One can add the remaining sherds in the following way. If 126 ceramic vessels were identified from 260
sherds and another 60 ceramic sherds were not assigned to any vessels due to their small size and lack of
distinguishing characteristics, the remaining sherds may account for another 29 additional vessels,
assuming all other factors were the same. Of course, this is not necessarily true, but we will treat it as
plausible given our understanding of the assumptions. The result is that the sherd assemblage from F5017
may contain up to 155 vessels when the statistical index is 2.06 sherds per vessel. This produces an
average volume of 0.012 liters of sherds per vessel. These adjusted indices are still very representative of
reduced sheet refuse and not consistent with directly discarded ceramic refuse, especially given the
volume of soil excavated.
The ceramic vessel assemblage enumerated from F5017 consisted of 80.1 percent ironstone/whiteware
vessels (n=101 of n=126), 7.9 percent porcelain vessels (n=10), 3.2 percent yellowware vessels (n=4), 2.4
percent Bennington-type mottled yellowwares (n=3), 2.4 percent imitation majolica (n=3), 2.4 percent
imported stoneware bottles (n=3), and 1.6 percent domestic stoneware crocks/jugs (n=2). This
information is depicted in Figure G.14. Ironstone/whiteware vessel varieties are overwhelmingly the
most common vessels in the assemblage, followed by a small number of porcelain vessels and
yellowwares, both plain and mottled varieties. Altogether, these three wares account for about 94 percent
of all vessels enumerated from F5017. Imitation majolica, domestic stoneware, and imported stonewares
account for the remaining 6 percent of the vessels.

Figure G.14. Histogram of general paste/glaze categories for ceramic vessels from Feature 5017
concentration of brick fragments and other artifacts). A total of 126 vessels was recognized from 320
sherds. The sherds were deposited as sheet refuse between ca. 1850 and 1880 when the lot was owned
serially by two families.

G.42

Figure G.15 shows the general vessel forms enumerated from F5017 without any regard for age. It
underscores the urban aspect of this feature. First, the large number of specialty vessels is more common
for urban assemblages and for above average socioeconomic households. Second, the nearly absent
domestic stoneware ‘crocks and jugs’ further emphasizes the urban nature of this feature. Finally,
imported ceramic bottles were also not very frequent, suggesting household(s) that were not strong
consumers of imported (i.e., European) beverages, such as ales from Great Britain or imported mineral
waters from Europe.

(concentration of brick fragments and other artifacts). A total of 126 vessels was recognized from 320
sherds. The sherds were deposited as sheet refuse between ca. 1850 and 1880 by two households.

Internal Stratigraphy
The vertical distribution of vessels in F5017 below Level 1 is not considered meaningful for several
reasons. First, the ceramic sherds come from recaptured sheet refuse deposited in the feature as it was
filled and sealed. Vessels with sherds recovered from more than one level account for 34 examples, or 27
percent, of the entire enumerated assemblage (n=126). Twelve vessels (3.5 percent) were spread across
more than two consecutive levels (V5, V9, V8, V11, V12, V15, V16, V23, V34, V41, V42, V57). Only
V12 was spread across more than three levels (a majolica vase, or jardiniere). The trend of 1, 11, 22, 92
(subtracting for exclusivity) is partly logarithmic and suggests that the distribution of vessels across levels
is the result of natural processes rather than stratigraphic differences in the deposition of the sherds in the
feature. This would be compatible with the sherds brought to the feature in the dirt used to level the
ground and fill the depression.
Age of Ceramic Vessels
Seven makers’ marks appear on the ceramic vessel sherds from F5017, and all but one are on
ironstone/whitewares. The exception is an impressed incomplete mark that reads: . . LROO . . on a pre1880 yellowware pan/dish (V63). The maker’s identity is unknown. The other six marks include three

G.43

that cannot be identified due to their small sizes and incompleteness. The recognizable marks include a
black transfer-printed J. Clementson mark from ca. 1850-1864 (shape with age data from Wetherbee
1980:63 and Godden 1964:150), a transfer-printed T&R Boote mark (Greyhound in garland motif) from
ca. 1875-1880 (mark continues until 1891 [Godden 1964]), and a probable Burgess and Goddard mark
from ca. 1870 (Wetherbee 1980:27).
The ironstone/whiteware vessels dating from the 1850s could have been discarded either before or after
1861. Only those vessels manufactured before 1852 or after 1860 can be assigned to a specific ownership
period with reasonable probability. Table G.9 lists 45 ironstone/whiteware vessels that were probably
discarded during the De Cordova ownership period (1847-1860). Table G.10 lists 21 ironstone/whiteware
vessels that were probably discarded by the Cohen household. Table G.11 lists 35 ironstone/whiteware
vessels that cannot be assigned to either household due to their estimated period of
manufacture/popularity. They could be late acquisitions in the De Cordova period or older possessions
brought to Houston by the Cohen family when they moved onto the premises.
Figure G.16 is a relative frequency histogram of the age of ironstone/whitewares from F5017. It is
compiled by using the midpoints of each ceramic vessel’s age bracket and then categorizing them within
eight-year intervals. The dates shown on the histogram are the midpoint of each eight-year interval. Thus
the 1844 category includes all vessels with mid dates ranging from January 1, 1841, to December 31,
1848. Figure G.16 shows that 12.9 percent of all ironstone/whiteware vessels in F5017 have mid dates
that range from 1841-1848, whereas 31.7 percent have mid dates that span between 1849 and 1856. The
largest is the 1860 grouping that contains 35.6 percent of all the ironstone/whitewares recovered from
F5017. As such, over two-thirds of all ironstone/whiteware vessels retain mid dates between 1849 and
1864. In fact, this material likely predates 1861 when the Civil War naval blockade is taken into account.
Of course, some of the ca. 1852-1861 vessels could have been brought to this block by the Cohens in
1861 rather than by any earlier occupants.

Figure G.16. Relative frequency histogram of mean ceramic mid-dates for all ironstone-/whiteware
ceramic vessels (n=101) from Feature 5017 (brick fragment concentration). The dates are the mid
points of intervals of 8 years (e.g., the 1844 label covers all ceramic mid dates from the period of
January 1, 1841, through December 31, 1848). The ironstone/whiteware fragments were redeposited
in Feature 5017 along with other fill and brick debris sealing a depression in the late 1870s, most
likely around 1878 or 1880. The shape of this histogram is considered to be indicative of the source
of the sheet refuse and the occupation span of the lot up to the time the feature was sealed (given
certain assumptions). That is, this particular part of the lot was occupied by 1850 and possibly as
early as 1848. The post-1865 occupation of the premises correspond to a change in sheet refuse
practices resulting in less ceramic debris being scattered in the vicinity of this feature and the source
of the fill used to seal it (see text for further details).

G.48

Historical information about the lot containing F5017 shows that Figure G.16 is a composite histogram of
discarded ironstone/whiteware sherds from two households occupying the lot after about 1847 to when
the feature was sealed. If one drops the two outermost grouped frequencies on both ends of the
histogram, Figure G.16 gives an acceptable approximate start and end date for the ceramics (i.e., the
material was probably discarded sometime after 1844 but before 1852, making 1848 a plausible
beginning date for the ceramic sheet-refuse debris). The feature stopped receiving ceramic refuse soon
after 1876 and well before 1884, hence an 1880 sealing date seems quite acceptable. Therefore, the dates
for the ceramic refuse derived from the histogram start about 1848 and stop by 1880.
The De Cordova family owned the premises with F5017 from ca. 1839-1860, residing on it for the first
three years and then renting. Consequently, the oldest material generally can be assigned to their period
of ownership. It furthermore seems to support a post-1848 occupation on this particular lot. Since the
Cohen family owned the lot from 1861 to well beyond 1880, all post-1860 manufactured ceramic vessels
must be from their occupation. What is not clear is the precise ownership of the ceramic vessels
manufactured between ca. 1852 and 1860. This includes some of the vessels from both the 1852
midpoint group, as well as the 1860 midpoint group (see Figure G.16). Ceramic vessels manufactured
between ca. 1852 and 1860 could have been owned by the de Cordova renters or the Cohens if they
brought older ceramic vessels with them when they moved onto the premises in 1861.
The study and dating of hundreds of house sites in Texas has demonstrated that families often bring
ceramics to their new homestead sites that are eight to 12 years old, along with newer items purchased
around the time of their move (Moir 1987a, 1988b, 1997a). Furthermore, the repetitive nature of ceramic
vessel suites from well-dated sites supports the view that many vessels seldom last beyond about 10 to 15
years. Research on rural house sites of short duration by this author has illustrated this phenomenon, as
has Stanley South (1962, 1977a), who over 30 years ago developed the mean ceramic dating technique.
Although this topic is not often explicitly addressed, the lifespan of refined earthenware tablewares,
including ironstones, seems to average around eight to 12 years, with the outermost quartile being around
15 to 18 years after manufacture date. These numbers are based upon general impressions after looking at
assemblages from hundreds of sites. A detailed archeological study of a household’s ceramic inventory
from 1872-1910 (Moir 1997a:473-482), for example, was able to estimate statistically the maximum life
expectancy of 186 ironstone/whiteware vessels. The estimates for four general vessel forms ranged from
19.5 years (saucers) to 29.5 years (plates), with the average being 23.3 years (cups, saucer, plates and
specialty vessels) (Moir 1997a:502). The work also yielded estimates on the half-life of these same
ironstone/whiteware vessels. The half-life refers to the average number of years that it takes for 50
percent of the vessels in common use to be broken. Curated and highly decorated wares are not included
under this group of commonly used vessels. The figures were 4.9 years for saucers, 5.2 years for
specialty vessels (pitchers, basins, bowls, platters, etc.), 5.8 years for cups, and 7.4 years for plates.
These half-life values, if applied in reverse to the Block 162 households responsible for F5017, would
mean that the number of ceramic vessels predating 1848 would be about 40 percent of the entire
ironstone/whiteware assemblage if F5017 had been abandoned in 1860 and the sheet refuse accumulated
over the full 1848-1860 period. Since Figure G.16 shows only 12.9 percent, proportions in the frequency
distribution have been apparently altered by post-1860 vessels contributed by the Cohen family.
Consequently, the distribution is more compatible with sheet refuse actively discarded over a 22-year
period extending from about 1848 up to about 1870 with a few stray post-1870 vessel sherds included as
the feature was sealed by 1880.
Porcelain Indices and Comparative Studies
The comparative interpretation of ceramic sheet-refuse assemblages is further developed than
comparative studies of ceramic feature assemblages (e.g., Moir 1987a, 1988b). For example, the

G.49

percentage of porcelain as a ratio of porcelain to porcelain plus ironstone/whitewares has been found to be
patterned over time and by socioeconomic classes. The porcelain index, or the P-index, is computed by
dividing the porcelain sherd count (P) by the combined porcelain and ironstone/whiteware sherd counts
(P+I) together [P-index =P/(P+I)]. The P-index for F5017 is 9.9 percent (90.1 percent of the porcelain
and ironstone/whitewares material combined consisted of ironstone/whitewares).
The P-index provides a general measure of the amount of fine tablewares in an assemblage using two
very different cost-groupings that may reflect certain socioeconomic or ethnic associations when
sampling parameters are equivalent. For example, F5017’s 9.9 percent P-index is within the range
observed for 31 rural house sites in north-central Texas and another 18 house sites in northern Texas
when temporal factors are not considered (Moir 1987a, 1988b). But since most of these rural house sites
were occupied longer than the 25 to 30 years represented in the F5017 material, the closest pre-1890 sites
for making temporal comparisons were two tenant sites that produced 4.4 percent and 0 percent P-indices,
respectively, using the same porcelain divided by porcelain plus ironstone/whiteware calculations.
Owner-occupied sites with much longer time spans and predating 1910 yielded P-indices of 5.4 percent
(41NV235, upper-class white household on a plantation), 2.2 percent (41NV145, mixed long occupation
of owner followed by poorer tenant serial occupations), 10.2 percent (41NV267 freed black landowner’s
homestead), 3.4 percent (41NV305 freed black tenant site), and 1.9 percent (41NV316 freed black
laborers rental house). Even longer occupations produced even higher P-indices for occupations
extending well beyond 1900. For example, 41TR39 had 13.1 percent P-index for a white landowner’s
homestead (ca. 1859 to 1976), and 41DL192 had 9.7 percent P-index for a white landowner’s homestead
with later tenant components (ca. 1859-1940s).
As these comparative examples indicate, the porcelain ratio for F5017 is within the expected range for
some post-1890 sites but is well above average for pre-1880 rural contexts. A porcelain ratio of about 3
to 6 percent is more typical for pre-1880 rural sites, based upon available data. However, not enough
examples of ceramic assemblages from shorter urban occupations have been collected to verify this
position.
Several urban assemblages do offer additional insight on nineteenth-century P-indices. Earls et al.
(1996:155-214) discussed the recovery of 1,718 sherds from features predating 1840 at Old Velasco
(41BO125). It yielded a combined total of only 11 porcelain sherds or 0.6 percent for coastal urban
contexts considerably older than F5017. The Velasco example suggests that in Texas, very early periods
before 1840 may contain very little porcelain. Later urban examples, however, show an increase in
porcelain frequencies.
The excavated material from portions of several urban lots in Dallas provides insight on a similar time
period as F5017. The excavated Dallas urban lots produced material mainly from 1853-1876 (Jurney and
Andrews 1994). The excavation of parts of four yards produced 1,004 combined ironstone/whiteware and
porcelain sherds, of which 13.3 percent were porcelain. The yard areas sampled included three middleclass households and a laundress’ work area. The three middle-class yards produced samples of 16.2
percent porcelain (Yard Areas A and F, ca. 1853-1876, n=74 combined porcelain and
ironstone/whiteware sherds), 16.9 percent porcelain (Yard Areas B, C, D and E, ca. 1853-1872, n=136
combined porcelain and ironstone/whiteware sherds), and 3.9 percent porcelain for a more peripheral
back yard area (Areas I and J, ca. 1856-1872, n=76 combined porcelain and ironstone/whiteware sherds).
A well-defined ash midden and dark-stained soil linked to a black laundress’ work area (based upon a
street directory) yielded the highest porcelain index of 19.5 percent (Area G, ca. 1868-1876, with possibly
older sheet refuse from ca. 1853-1868, n=74 combined porcelain and ironstone/whiteware sherds). In
comparison, a well filled by 1880 on the same house lot yielded 2.9 percent porcelain index, illustrating
the complexity of comparing features to sheet refuse. The well was filled after the houses were torn down
to allow construction of a railroad spur across the block.

G.50

Returning to F5017, we are now in a little better position to evaluate its porcelain index of 9.9 percent.
Unless a family was exceedingly wealthy, the porcelain indices for pre-1840 Texas suggest that porcelain
vessels were not in common use and, therefore, were not frequently broken. The 1850s and 1860s data
from Dallas suggest that porcelain was much more frequently used and broken, based upon the yard
samples presented above. The Houston project data seem to indicate that the 1845-1860 period had about
one-half the porcelain index values as the post-1860 to 1880 period. Seven of 10 porcelain vessels from
F5017 cannot be assigned to either period with any confidence. The three exceptions are probably vessels
discarded during the De Cordova ownership period, revealing a minimum porcelain index of 8.7 percent
(eight of a combined 92 sherds).
The production of hard-paste and soft-paste porcelains in Great Britain and Continental Europe escalated
in the 1830s and 1840s, probably in response to Oriental export porcelains. As a result, European
porcelains were more available and were purchased by more middle- and lower-class households as the
mid nineteenth century approached. This rise in porcelain availability and demand was soon eclipsed by
the much heavier and expensive molded white ironstone-bodied wares coming into fashion after
1840/1845. In fact, the more durable ironstone wares probably replaced the more fragile porcelains in
middle-class households and relegated porcelain vessels to more peripheral uses as decorative items and
teawares rather than common tablewares.
Household Affiliation and Socioeconomic Profiling
Another way to examine the socioeconomic status of ceramics from F5017 is to look at the vessels in
terms of matching sets. Tables G.9 and G.10 above give the frequency of matching vessels, which are
indicative of sets of matching patterned tablewares generally only available to the wealthier households.
Nine of the 45 ironstone/whiteware vessels from the De Cordova ownership period show evidence of
matching sets (see V73 and V2; V16 and V42; V87, V75 and V107; and V40/V87 and V50). Another
three vessels show a possible common preference for dipped (dipt) and banded bowls (V101, V115,
V54), and three porcelain vessels show a possible preference for molded and paneled forms also in some
ironstone/whiteware vessels. In fact, these patterned matches were identified before any vessels were
assigned to specific ownership periods and represent independent observation.
Patterned and molded matching sets are not evident in the Cohen ceramic groupings. This does not mean
that the Cohen household did not own any patterned ceramic table settings, but rather that after 1866, the
occupants of the lot were not discarding these kinds of vessels in the captured sheet-refuse material or
used to fill F5017.
As for the De Cordova assemblage, it does not convey excessive wealth with regard to
ironstone/whiteware vessels. When all non-ironstone/whiteware vessels are also included in the
assessment of status vessels, there still is not any striking level of expensive or above-average wares
evident. The particular added wares referred to here include common yellowware, molded and mottled
yellowwares (Bennington-type molded and brown mottled wares), three imported stoneware bottles (two
Bristol/Bristol and one brown salt-glazed imported bottle), two domestic stonewares, and 10 porcelain
vessels.
The number of porcelain vessels in F5017 also does not convey any obvious evidence of upper-class
status. Only 10 porcelain vessels and at least 116 other vessels are represented. This proportion is by no
means exorbitant. The porcelain vessels include two soft-paste vessels (V82 and V83) among the three
molded and paneled porcelain (V81 is a paneled hard-paste example) that are similar to the style of some
of the molded and paneled ironstone vessels (e.g., V21, V52, V67, V74, V73). Molded and paneled
vessels were quite fashionable in the 1850s. The precise age of the F5017 porcelain vessels cannot be
accurately assigned since they are unmarked and represent less diagnostic forms, except for their paneled
motifs. However, if the three molded and paneled forms noted above are from the De Cordova period of

G.51

ownership, they provide just a hint of upper-class affiliation. This would be especially true if they were
purchased in large sets with matching specialty pieces (tureens, covered serving dishes, etc.).
Among the least common wares from Ball Park features are imitation majolicas. Sherds from possibly
three imitation majolica vases, or jardinières, were recovered mainly from Levels 2 and 3, but also from
Level 5. The range of decoration found on some of imitation majolica vessels could also account for the
differences observed in the F5017 majolica sherds. That is, the F5017 majolica sherds may be from a
single very large and highly decorated jardiniere that exhibited great variation in its designs and motifs.
The F5017 majolica sherds are more like the later softer types of common initiation majolica, and unlike
the earlier pre-1861 high-fired majolica wares. Consequently, the jardinieres were probably owned by the
Cohens. In all, 40 sherds were recovered, indicating that the vessels were quite large, ornately molded,
and very colorful. It is also possible that the sherds represent only two or maybe just one imitation
majolica jardiniere as noted above. But, the wide range of colors and motifs, as well as differences in
interior glazes among the small sherds, suggest three vessels rather than just two vessels or one. The lack
of many cross mends among the 40 sherds also seems to support multiple vessels rather than a single one.
Finally, what is most striking about the entire ceramic assemblage from F5017 is the very small amount
of domestic stonewares present. Many contemporary rural house sites in Texas yield from 20 to 48
percent of their ceramic assemblage dominated by domestic stonewares (see Lebo 1987, 1988; Moir
1987c:100). Only the very earliest rural Texas homestead sites from the late 1830s-1850 appear to
contain merely 1 to 3 percent domestic stoneware sherds in their ceramic sheet-refuse assemblages. But
the evidence from many post-1860 rural house site excavations by the author makes it appear that
domestic stoneware sherds were quite common in post-1865 to 1880 period sheet-refuse assemblages.
This fact makes the ceramic assemblage from F5017 unusual, since it produced almost no domestic
stonewares. The feature yielded only four domestic stoneware sherds out of a total of 320 sherds. The
four sherds represent only two vessels out of a total of 126 ceramic vessels. In terms of percentages, the
ceramic assemblage contains only 1.25 percent domestic stoneware sherds, or 1.59 percent stoneware
vessels (two of 126 vessels), making these figures fall far below the expected. This pattern of belowaverage stonewares in urban assemblages from Houston’s Ball Park features was repeated across many
blocks and is discussed in greater length in the concluding section of this appendix.
Interpretive Summary
Feature 5017 offers a rare glimpse into the kinds of ceramic sherds that were apparently discarded in open
yard areas and then subsequently reworked as sheet refuse. Sheet refuse has shown to be highly patterned
in its ceramic components when an entire house site is systematically sampled. That is, the proportion of
ironstone/whitewares to stonewares to porcelains sherds have been found to be roughly predictable by
time period and relative frequencies for rural homesteads (e.g., Lebo 1987, 1988; Moir 1987a, 1987d:171174, 1988a) and some urban excavations (e.g., Jurney and Andrews 1994). These patterns do not fit
F5017, raising the question of why. The answer will not be addressed here but instead is covered in
greater detail using other features and comparative data in the concluding section of this chapter.
Figure G.17 summarizes the important points derived from analysis of F5017’s ironstone/whiteware
vessels. It shows the suggested association of these vessels by household affiliation, based upon temporal
criteria. The differences between the Cohen and De Cordova ownership periods are considered important
in the following ways. First, the ironstone/whiteware profile of the de Cordova renters is unlike any
expected, since the number of broken plates is much smaller than anticipated. This may be the result of
having other types of plates in use (possibly porcelain, silver, and/or pewter) and relegating
ironstone/whiteware plates to far fewer uses. Porcelain, if extensively used, may not have been discarded
in the area that captured the sheet refuse before it was redeposited in F5017. If this position is accurate,
the pre-1861 ceramic sherds in F5017 may have come from more peripheral sources than a lessee’s dinner

G.52

table. They may, in fact, be from household staff and attendants or simply the utilitarian wares used by
the occupants when they were not entertaining guests or hosting special functions. Because other kitchen
wares are also not well represented, the ceramic vessels are not simply from preparing meals and
attendants/slaves (?) working in a detached kitchen.

Figure G.17. Distribution of ironstone/whiteware vessels (n=101) enumerated from reworked sheet refuse
captured by Feature 5017 on a lot owned by only two families between ca. 1839 and 1900. The ceramic
sherds indicate that ceramic sheet refuse did not begin to accumulate until after ca. 1848 or 1850 and the
feature was sealed by 1880. The ironstone/whiteware vessels are placed by probable household association
using their general popularity dates. Series 1 is the effective DeCordova Ownership Period spanning from ca.
1848-1860 and Series 2 is the Cohen Ownership Period from 1861 up to the sealing of the feature. Vessels
spanning both periods are placed in a separate category (Series 3). Series 1 contains 45 pre-1861
ironstone/whiteware vessels probably acquired during the DeCordova Ownership Period. Series 2 contains
21 probable post-1861 ironstone/whiteware vessels discarded by the Cohen household, and Series 3 contains
35 vessels that span ca. 1850-1870 and cannot be reasonably placed with either period. The above data
suggest that Feature 5017 was filled in the late 1870s with soil that contained ca. 1848 to ca. 1875 sheet refuse
(see text for discussion).

Ceramic sherds from F5017 also demonstrate that broken vessel fragments were indeed discarded in some
yard areas, as well as in pits and other intrusive features. If occupation had been by a single household
for the time frame captured by this feature, even more might be said about the family’s preference for
styles and ceramic replacements. But since 35 percent of the ironstone/whiteware vessels cannot be
assigned to a specific ownership period, we are not able to draw upon all the vessel patterning and data
encoded in the ceramic assemblage.
As for the division of the ceramic vessels into two ownership periods, the following can be derived from
the data. First, evidence of pre-1848 ceramic refuse disposal does not appear in the ceramic material from
the feature. In fact, the obvious lack of any pre-1841 ceramic mid dates suggests that the vessels were not
discarded until the very late 1840s and possibly not before even the early 1850s. This time frame is based
upon several assumptions and the prevalence of molded and plain thick-bodied ironstone wares as the

G.53

oldest ceramic vessels traditions in F5017. Finally, the oldest ceramic wares should be evaluated in terms
of a rental household. Although we cannot be sure of the ownership of materials dating between 1842
and 1861, we can still evaluate the assemblage.
We can surmise that this particular lot was not occupied until after about 1848, and the occupants did not
bring with them very many ceramic vessels older than five to eight years of age. The oldest ceramics
from F5017 are modest wares and do not represent upper middle-class preferences if we assume that the
wares did not have any gilding (gilded overglaze decoration often does not remain on buried sherds). The
only hint of above middle-class wares are the traces of matching sets and the preference for examples that
display similar molded and paneled motifs in both porcelain and ironstone/whitewares.
Ceramics from F5017 convey nothing extraordinarily different from southern Anglo-affiliated households
of modest means and wealth. No particularly regional wares or regional vessels forms are identified.
This may be due to the source of the refuse not fully capturing the pre-1861 household preferences, to the
number of vessels not attributable to either household, or to some other unrecognized factor. The pre1861 ceramics appear to reflect mainstream Texas ceramic assemblages. Apparently, their ceramic
preferences were already well influenced by the local trends in this region.
The Cohen family assemblage is also not particularly different from typical 1860-1870 ceramic
assemblages for American-born households in Texas. The Cohens were born in Prussia and were married
in 1851 in Louisiana. They left Louisiana in 1854 and lived in Missouri and Mississippi before coming to
Texas in 1860. Apparently, they, too, were accustomed to southern living. Their ceramic assemblage
from F5017 indicates that they were fairly well acculturated into southern ceramic preferences by 1865.
If any ethnic-European signatures were evident in the ceramics from F5017, it is not readily apparent
from the analyses conducted here. In fact, census data indicate that the Cohens had other European
emigrants living with them on this block. Again, F5017 does not seem to reveal any special ceramic
evidence of these Prussian and Russian co-occupants.
Feature 5019 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded 12 sherds from six ceramic vessels: a semivitrified blue-tinted ironstone saucer (V3;
ca. 1858-1878; Cat. No. 26-15), three light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware vessels (V4 is a bowl ca.
1860 to ca. 1880, Cat. No. 26-14; V6 is a saucer with cup ring ca. 1870-1885, Cat. No. 27-39; and V5 is a
saucer, ca. 1878-1890, Cat. No. 27-37), a small piece of a cobalt decorated salt-glazed domestic
stoneware crock/jug (ca. 1850-1875; interior has brown clay slip, V1, Cat. No. 26-12), and about 20
percent of a soft-paste porcelain 23 cm diameter transfer-printed plate (V2, English bone china from
Levels 1 and 2 with cross mends, Cat. Nos. 26-16, 26-17, and 26-18, and 27-34, 27-35, 27-36, and 2738). The porcelain plate has a molded style of rim notches and a thinness that is suggestive of ca. 1830 to
ca. 1845 manufacture date.
Only the porcelain plate sherds are indicative of directly discarded/captured feature material, while the
sherds from the five other vessels are typical of sheet-refuse debris (small size) captured in the fill placed
around the pier. The porcelain plate may be more indicative of the age of this feature if it was discarded
at the time the brick pier was dug. The other material may be later sheet refuse that has contaminated it.
Alternately, the porcelain plate may be an anomaly, and the pit for the pier may have been dug through
older sheet refuse, thus dating after ca. 1885. Little more can be gleaned from the ceramic vessel data
alone.
41HR818, BLOCK 173
Ceramic fragments from two excavated features, F6001 and F6002, on Block 173 were analyzed and
produced evidence of 29 vessels. The age of the ceramic vessels from F6001 (a trash pit) date from the
mid 1860s-1880 and appear to be from a single household. The few ceramic vessels from F6002, a small

G.54

artifact cluster, probably date from the late 1860s, although there are too few to be certain. Results of
analyses of both features are presented below.
Feature 6001
This feature contained both true feature-sized ceramic material (e.g., V1, V2, V4, etc.) and possibly some
sheet refuse that had been captured as the feature was filled and sealed (e.g., V3). A moderately sized
assemblage of 43 sherds after fresh breaks were discounted was recovered from the two excavation units
(Units 6001 and 6001a). In all, 25 vessels were identified. When F6001 was sealed in the late 1870s or
very early 1880s, it also trapped a few older sheet-refuse sherds dating from occupation in the 1840s and
1850s. The larger feature-like ceramic sherds, however, are from vessels made in the 1865 to 1882
period. This age is based upon dated makers’ marks (Pinder Bourne & Co., ca. 1862-1882; Edward
Clarke, ca. 1865-1877) and an assessment of the other common vessel forms present.
The enumerated vessels include 21 ironstone/whiteware vessels, three porcelain vessels, and one
stoneware bottle. The particular ironstone/whiteware vessel forms include 10 plates (V1, V2, V3, V5,
V8, V11, V19, V20, V22, V23), one saucer (V7), one teacup (V15), four bowls (V6, V10, V14, and
V16), one tureen (V4), a possible chamber pot (or pitcher base sherd, V21), and three unknown vessel
forms (V12, V13, and V24). The three porcelain vessels include sherds from a large bowl (V17), a
molded and paneled cup (V18), and a toilet/soap dish inset tray (V25). Only one stoneware sherd was
recovered; it is from an imported British bottle neck and rim with a large bead ring over two smaller bead
rings (V9). The sherd has a caramel/mustard-colored exterior iron-oxide slip typical of the nineteenth
century.
Among the other more interesting vessels is a captured sheet-refuse sherd from a blue-tinted ironstone
noncockled late incised (trident motif) blue shell-edged plate (V3). This edge ware is common for the
1848 to 1858 period (Cat. No. 1-15). Another interesting vessel is represented by a feature-sized sherd
from a rectangular drain or toiletry holder inset for a late nineteenth century (?) light bluish tinted
porcelain toilet/soap dish. The whole dish would have measured ca. 3 x 2.5 in (8.5 x 6.5 cm) (V25, Cat.
No. 40-27). The sherd was recovered from Level 4 and has 16 small drain holes and one large center hole
either for holding items (shaving items) or helping one pick them up. Other vessel shapes/motifs
common for the 1860s and 1870s period include late double inflection plates and late molded and paneled
plates and cups. One blue-tinted ironstone plate is nearly complete and displays the Pinder Bourne & Co.
maker’s mark (ca. 1862-1882, see Godden 1964:495, No. 3041 variant). This vessel’s four sherds were
piece plotted (Cat. Nos. 11-1 to 11-4), and its shape suggests that it was manufactured in the 1862 to 1870
period but possibly acquired locally in the ca. 1865 to 1870 period due to the naval blockade.
Another large sherd recovered from F6001 representes about 15 percent of a blue-tinted ironstone oval
tureen made by Edward Clarke. The tureen was designated V4 and is thinly potted with an oval footring
measuring 5 x 7 in (13 x 19 cm). The large base sherd was piece plotted (Cat. No. 25-1) and crossmended with another sherd from Level 4 (Cat. No. 40-34). One other tureen sherd was recovered from
Level 3 (Cat. No. 16-16). The Clarke pottery was in operation from ca. 1865-1877 (see Godden
1964:147), but the tureen’s rounded shape suggests the ca. 1865-1873 period.
The 25 ceramic vessels from F6001 provide a glimpse at a small assemblage of items probably thrown
away in the 1870s and possibly even the early 1880s. If the age of the ceramics is representative of the
other items in F6001, it appears that the feature may have been open and used for only a short period
spanning about one to three years, certainly less than five years when excluding older captured sheet
refuse. The ceramic vessels, however, were acquired over a much longer period, mainly covering the
1865 to 1880 time frame, while their disposal in F6001 probably occurred over a fairly brief period.

The first structure on Lot 9 (Block 173) was apparently constructed after 1867 by the Pannell family (see
Chapter 8). The lot was owned by the younger Pannell (Reid Pannell), who apparently sold it to his
father and mother (Hugh and Sarah A. Pannell) in 1868 after owning Lot 9 for only about a year. The
earlier owners of Lot 9 are not discussed individually. While the first structure on Block 173 apparently
begins with A. Girard, who sold it to F. Morey in 1839, nothing was constructed on Lot 9 until much
later.
The very first structure on the block was standing on Lot 8 by 1839 and it was located on adjacent Lot 9.
It was gone by 1860, and the sheet-refuse sherds from F6001 are too young, except for V3, to be from any
earlier occupants other than the Pannell family. Vessel 3 is probably from the Hugh Pannell household
and is an older item acquired in the 1850s or late 1840s when Mr. Pannell was in his 30s or early 40s.
Hugh Pannell was born in Virginia in 1812 and his wife, Sarah, was born in Texas 1828. He is listed as a
farmer in the 1850 census, a cabinet maker in 1860, Houston City Sexton in 1866, undertaker in 1870,
and deceased by 1880.
Ceramic vessels from F6001 appear to be entirely from the Hugh Pannell household, which in 1868 had
six children ranging in age from one year to 22 years. The ceramics show a modest taste in wares,
including some late molded ironstone wares common for the post-1865 period. The agrarian roots of the
household may be evident in the plainer aspect of the assemblage. The preponderance of plates over cups
and saucers in the assemblage is unusual. F6001 may have some special functions related to Hugh’s post1870 occupation that affected the ceramic assemblage. A review of all other artifacts may help determine
the origin of the feature.
Feature 6002
This feature yielded only five ceramic sherds representing four vessels. Two of the vessels are porcelain
and two are ironstone/whitewares. Only one of the vessels, a porcelain cup, consists of two large featurelike cross-mended sherds (Cat. Nos 21-1, 21-2). They constitute about 30 percent of a molded and
paneled cup, which also probably dates from 1855-1875. The second porcelain vessel is a small, white
dish probably made before 1870. Many porcelain vessels, however, are hard to pin down accurately. The
sherd is small and typical of sheet-refuse remains.
The remaining two sherds fit the expected size of typical sheet refuse captured as the feature filled. These
include a blue-tinted ironstone plate (center sherd, Cat. No. 14-107) from ca. 1850-1870, and an
undecorated sharply waisted large ironstone/whiteware teabowl/bowl dating ca. 1845-1855 (Cat. No. 1358). Only the two porcelain vessels (a cup and a small dish) may be indicative of above-average
economic status, but this would require keeping them in a pre-1860 context. Unfortunately, a pre-1860
context is not fully supportable for F6002. The vessels are compatible with a post-1867 discard date,
when vessels in F6001 are taken into account. But it is also possible that F6002 predates F6001 and was
used for a shorter period in the late 1860s before F6001 was created. Of course a check of all other
diagnostic items in F6002 may help resolve its interpretation.
41HR820, BLOCK 117
Over 1,690 ceramic fragments from 41 excavated features, as well as a number of special provenience
samples, on Block 117 were analyzed and produced evidence of over 480 vessels. The features were
numbered from F7001 up to F7057, with some features lacking ceramic vessel sherds. Five of the top
10largest ceramic feature assemblages were present in the Feature 7000 series from Block 117 (F7036,
F7005, F7009, F7032, and F7019). Six of the top 10 largest vessels counts were from the Feature 7000
series (F7009, F7036, F7019, F7021, F7024, and F7008). Many of the oldest assemblages were also from
the Feature 7000 series (e.g., F7013). The following sections summarize data derived from the analyses
performed on the ceramic vessels from these features.

G.56

Feature 7001 (Barrel Privy)
This feature yielded five well-preserved ceramic vessels that are indicative of true feature material. The
sherds were retrieved from Levels 4 and 5. Three are between 80 and 98 percent complete and include a
nearly complete double inflection transitional blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate (Jacob Furnival, ca.
1845-1870, n=7 sherds), a nearly complete blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 1860-1880, oyster
bowl from Levels 4 and 5, Cat. Nos. 101-11, 106-24 to 106-34), and 80 percent of a rectangular
yellowware baking dish/pan (ca. 1850-1880, n=8 sherds). The rim sherd of an older hand-painted
ironstone/whiteware chamber pot (ca. 1842-1852; Cat. No. 106-8 from Level 5) was also recovered and
appears to be sheet refuse captured by the feature. The remaining vessel is a lid/cover from an oval
bowl/dish with a dark blue-green transfer-printed design and border (ca. 1865-1880; Cat. Nos. 101-10 and
101-12). The vessels suggest that this feature was sealed in the 1870s or early 1880s. Other than the
cover, the three non-sheet-refuse vessels are not particularly noteworthy.
Feature 7002 (Posthole)
A single ceramic sherd was recovered from this feature. It is very lightweight and has a pearlware-like
hue to its glaze. It is from an uncommon vessel form and appears to be a fragment of a ceramic lid from a
shallow jar. It is undecorated and seems to be early, possibly manufactured ca. 1820-1830. It may even
be French. The paste is extremely porous and the glaze rippled and bumpy.
Feature 7003 (Brick-Lined Storage Pit)
Feature 7003 was identified as a brick lined ‘cooler,’ or small storage cellar, that was subsequently used
to discard other refuse. It yielded 37 sherds indicating at least 12 vessels. Complete enumeration was not
attempted, and nine sherds were unassigned to specific vessels, although some possible parent vessel were
inferred (Cat. Nos. 9-2, 15-17, 27-156, 27-157, 27-158, 27-160, 34-6, 34-7, 37-1). Five of the ceramic
vessels are complete enough to infer that they were discarded directly into this feature (V4, V7, V8, V9,
V12). Three vessels are seemingly represented by sheet-refuse-sized sherds captured by the feature’s
matrix as it filled the brick lined pit (V1, V2, V3). The remaining four vessels are less complete but still
yield larger sherds than typical sheet-refuse material.
Ceramic sherds were recovered from all eight excavated levels. Vessels represented by probable sheetrefuse sherds includ a burned (blue-tinted ironstone?) ironstone/whiteware double inflection plate (V1, ca.
1845-1860?), and from Level 1 a light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware double inflection plate (V2, ca.
1850-1870), and a molded and paneled early transitional light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer
(V3, ca. 1848-1860) from Level 2. As they indicate, the uppermost portion of the feature was probably
filled with soil containing sheet-refuse debris.
Level 3 contained only a small chip from a blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl that was not able to be
assigned a vessel number (Cat. No. 9-2, also probably sheet refuse). Level 4 ceramic material suggests
that the feature contents were changing. It yielded a piece of a small ironstone/whiteware jar (V4,
possibly 2 in tall x 2 in diameter [5 x 5 cm], ca. 1840-1850), a sherd from a thick-bodied blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware bowl (V5, ca. 1850-1870), part of a crude porcelain molded toy dish (V6, 1.5 in [4.2
cm] diameter, ca. 1845-1860?), and a sheet-refuse-sized fragment from a 6-in (16 cm) diameter bluetinted ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 1850-1870) that also was not able to be assigned a vessel number
(Cat. No. 15-17).
Level 5 yielded only one sherd, a fragment from the same German mineral water bottle found in Level 6.
Level 6, on the other hand, produced the largest cluster of ceramic sherds of any level from F7003. It
contained the remains of at least six vessels: 14 sherds from a hand-thrown German salt-glazed mineral
water bottle with brown iron-oxide wash (V7, nineteenth century), two sherds from a second German saltglazed mineral water bottle with a reddish iron-oxide wash (V11, ca. 1840-1885?), sherds from at least

G.57

three different British Bristol/Bristol glazed cone-top stoneware bottles with mustard-yellow washes on
their upper (V8, V9, V10), and a large section of a burned 6-in (16 cm) diameter bowl (V12, ca. 18501858) with relief design variant similar to the Sydenham or President’s patterns (see Wetherbee 1980,
1985). The German mineral water bottle (V7) is impressed with: SELT(ERS)\HERZOGTH(UM
NASSAU). The mineral water bottle has a simple blob-type finish, a bifurcated handle attachment with
NUM 43 impressed next to the handle. The finish of this mineral water bottle is similar to the example
shown in Schultz et al. (1980:116).
Vessel 8 was also from Level 6 and is also one of the Bristol/Bristol glazed cone-top stoneware bottles. It
is impressed with: PORT DUNDAS\GLASGOW\POTTERY COY . . and dates from the mid nineteenth
century (Godden 1964:504, No. 3093). Two other bottle necks (Cat. Nos. 27-156, 27-157, 27-158), also
from British stoneware bottles, have shortened version of brandy-type finishes (see Berge 1980:56). This
style of stoneware bottle finish was not among the finish types for stoneware bottles from the Bertrand
wreck that sank in 1865 (see Switzer 1974:9-14). Thus F7003’s stoneware bottles may be somewhat
older than the Bertrand examples, suggesting a shift in finishing styles, or they simply may indicate a
different manufacturing source, such as Scotland.
Level 7 produced a sherd from V12 (burned bowl), a sherd from a Bristol/Bristol glazed cone-top
stoneware bottle (probably from V8, V9, or V10), and a sherd from a German mineral water bottle
(probably V11). Level 8 yielded only one ceramic sherd from one of the Bristol/Bristol glazed cone-top
stoneware bottles (either V8, V9, or V10).
The ceramic assemblage below Level 3 seems to contain mostly directly discarded broken vessels when
captured sheet-refuse sherds were excluded. It includes five European ceramic bottles (three British
bottles and two German mineral water bottles), a small ceramic jar (V4), a porcelain toy dish (V6), and
two ironstone/whiteware vessels (V5 and V12). The greater number of ceramic bottles compared to
ironstone/whiteware vessels may be important in determining a source of the refuse. The age of the
vessels is compatible with ceramics purchased in the 1845 to 1861 period. If a single discard period was
selected, the most probable dates would be 1855 to 1861, based upon an assumption that the feature was
used continuously and the ceramic vessels are equally representative of other discard activities associated
with this feature. Little more can be said about F7003 based uponly on its ceramic vessel contents.
Feature 7004
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7005
Feature 7005 is unlike any other feature context in the Ball Park excavations. It represents an entire
house foundation measuring about 38 x 18 ft (11.6 x 5.6 m). The foundation was sampled by 14
excavation units. Units recovered material from the foundation’s trenches, interior areas, and adjacent
exterior locations. The following is a list by unit number of all the excavation units assigned to F7005.
The age of the foundation seems to be from the mid 1850s, since most of the larger ceramics sherds were
likely discarded between ca. 1850 to ca. 1856. The ceramic assemblages also include some much older
sheet-refuse sherds that were captured as various trenches and pits were dug to construct the foundation.
Ownership of the lot was as follows: James Wells from ca. 1838-1848, Henry Witt from ca. 1848-1856,
Martin Floeck from 1856-1865, and Andrew Dunlap from 1865-1882. Neither Henry Witt nor Martin
Floeck resided on Lot 8. During their ownership, F7005 either sat empty or was rented.
Unit Summaries for Foundation
Unit 7002 (F7005). This excavation unit yielded nine sherds from at least seven ceramic vessels. Level 1
produced sherds from a molded octagonal blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl/pitcher (V1, Cat. No.
306-5, ca. 1845-1858) and an undecorated transitional light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer (V2,

G.58

Cat. No. 306-6, ca. 1845-1860). Level 2 had fragments from an undecorated late creamware/creamcolored ware/transitional whiteware thin-bodied soup plate (V3, Cat. Nos. 312-15 and 312-18, ca. 18301845), an undecorated thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate? (V4, Cat. No. 312-16, ca. 1850-1868),
an undecorated thin transitional blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware cup? (V5, Cat. No. 312-17, ca. 18401855?), a blue transfer-printed (interior and exterior designs) thin teacup (V6, Cat. No. 312-20, ca. 18301845), and a salt-glazed German mineral water bottle/jug (V7, Cat. Nos. 312-5 and 312-6, ca. 18401885).
The age of this small sample of vessels is compatible with ceramics purchased in the ca. 1835/1840 to
ca.1855 period. It spans ceramic items probably acquired by a lessee’s household (ca. 1838-1848) and
the Witt household (ca. 1848-1856). If a single discard period was selected, the most probable date would
be prior to 1858/1860, based upon an assumption that the feature/context received both older sheet refuse
and some newer material added at the time. This scenario places the non-sheet-refuse items and post1848 vessels with the discards of the lessee’s household (e.g., V4 and probably V1 and V2) and the older
sheet-refuse sherds predating 1848 with the Wells household (e.g., V3 and V6). Finally, this scenario
assumes that the ceramic vessels are equally representative of all other discarded remains recovered in
this unit.
Unit 7003 (F7005). This unit yielded nine sherds from two ceramic vessels. The vessels were purchased
between 1835 and 1855 and were likely not purchased at the same time. The oldest vessel is an
undecorated transitional whiteware/early light bluish tinted ironstone thin-bodied plate with a curved
marly (V1, Cat. Nos. 41-11, 41-12, and 49-11, ca. 1832-1842) recovered from Levels 1 and 2. It was
probably acquired by the James Wells household in the late 1830s. The second vessel consists of six
sherds from a large blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl with pedestaled footrim that was probably
molded and paneled. The bowl was popular between ca. 1848 and 1858 and thus was likely purchased by
the lessees. The material in this unit is consistent with a ca. mid 1850s burial date, and hence it was
sealed by the Floecks soon after their purchase of the property.
Unit 7004 (F7005). This unit yielded 23 sherds from 18 ceramic vessels. The age of the vessels is
compatible with ceramics purchased mostly between 1845 and 1855. There are also some older vessels
represented in the assemblage that were probably purchased ca. 1835-1842.
The older items were probably acquired by the Wells household before 1848 and include a black transferprinted saucer (ca. 1830-1842, Level 1), a green transfer-printed exotic Chinese-scene thin-bodied curved
marly plate (ca. 1830-1845, Level 2), a 3-in (10 cm) diameter engine-turned banded cup/bowl (ca. 18351845, Level 3) and a light olive-green transfer-whiteware molded cup with panels (ca. 1838-1848?, Level
4).
Five vessels are probably from the lessee’s household that occupied Lot 8 from about 1848-1856. These
include a paneled and molded thin-bodied blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 1845-1855, Level 1),
a rounded paneled and molded blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware base sherd from a tureen or compote (ca.
1845-1855, Level 1), a molded blue-tinted 6-in (16 cm) diameter ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 18451855, Level 2), a pedestaled base bowl (ca. 1845-1860, Level 2), and a molded blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware pitcher with fluted rim (ca. 1845-1855, Level 2). Another three vessels are also
possibly from the lessee’s household. These include a paneled and molded (possibly Boote’s rounded
octagon?) blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 1845-1855, Level 1), a large dark blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware bowl with a 6-in (16 cm) diameter footring (ca. 1845-1860, Level 3) and a dark bluetinted paneled and molded ironstone/whiteware bowl/tureen/specialty vessel (ca. 1845-1858, Level 4).
Finally, five vessels could not be assigned to either household with any certainty. These include a thickbodied semivitrified light bluish tinted saucer (ca. 1850-1870, Level 1), an ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca.

G.59

1850-1870, Level 2), a child’s porcelain teacup (ca. 1842-1855, Level 2), a blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware child’s toy teapot with molded rounded primary-type design (ca. 1842-1855, Level
2), a CC-ware/ironstone plate (ca. 1840-1855, Level 2), and a small British brown stoneware bottle/ink
well? (ca. 1842-1855, Level 3).
In summary, the 18 ceramic vessels in this unit are compatible with the general age of ceramic material
found elsewhere in F7005. If a single discard period was selected, the most probable period would be
after ca. 1840/1845 to ca. 1858/1860, based upon the assumption that older ceramic material represents
sheet refuse.
Unit 7005 (F7005). This unit yielded 12 sherds from at least nine ceramic vessels. The more notable
items are a beaded rim light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware pan/basin (ca. 184-1855?, Level 1), a bluetinted ironstone/whiteware bowl/baking dish (ca. 1850-1870?, Level 2), a blue transfer-printed
ironstone/whiteware platter with distinctive wire-cut base ‘thumb-print’ markings (like some export
Canton wares, ca. 1835-1850, Level 2), a wavy cockled-edge pinkish red transfer-printed late transitional
pearlware/whiteware vessel (ca. 1832-1842, Level 2), a child's blue-tinted porcelain toy teacup (ca. 18481860?, Level 2), and a mottled brown Bennington-type yellowware spittoon (ca. 1845-1870, Level 2).
The other three vessels are a CC-ware plate, a late transitional whiteware thin teacup, and a blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware vessel with a maker’s mark. The mark is incomplete but may be from (JAS)
EDWARDS (& SON)\DALEH(ALL) which operated from 1851-1882 (Godden 1964:230-231). This
fragment may have been discarded after 1860. Finally, 16 sherds from a redware/stoneware sewer pipe
were recovered from Level 2, probably indicating that a pipe trench had cut through this same area. It
would probably be from the 1880s and thus could have captured some later material, too.
When the two later items are excluded, the ages of most vessels in this unit are compatible with ceramics
purchased in the 1835 to 1855 period. If a single discard period was selected, it would be from ca. 18421861, based upon the assumption that the unit contains older sheet refuse captured as the foundation was
constructed. This also assumes that these ceramic vessels are equally representative of other discarded
materials in this unit.
Unit 7006 (F7005). This unit yielded a single ceramic sherd from a thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware
plate. The age of the vessel is compatible with plates commonly used in the 1855 to 1870 period.
Unit 7028 (F7005). This unit yielded eight ceramic sherd representing eight vessels. No ceramics were
identified in Level 1. Five vessels/sherds were found in Level 2. Two vessels/sherds were found in Level
3, and one vessel/sherd was found Level 4. Vessels from Level 2 include a light bluish tinted
ironstone/whiteware cup (ca. 1840-1870?, Cat. No. 352-23), a greenish gray hard-paste porcelain tureen
or speciality vessel (ca. 1840-1870?, Cat. No. 352-24), a grayish hard-paste porcelain thin-bodied cup
(probably Chinese porcelain, ca. 1840-1860?, Cat. No. 352-25), a pedestal foot CC-ware/transitional
whiteware cup or egg cup (ca. 1835-1845, Cat. No. 352-26), and a rim sherd from a thick domestic gray
salt-glazed storage crock with natural clay slipped interior (ca. 1850-1875, Cat. No. 352-36). Level 3
yielded a sherd from a blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware molded octagonal pan or basin (ca. 1845-1860,
Cat. No. 363-1) and a sherd from a second domestic gray salt-glazed storage crock with natural clay
slipped interior (ca. 1850-1880, Cat. No. 365-3). The lowest level, Level 4, yielded a single sherd from a
single inflection thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate from ca. 1870-1885. The plate is up to 3.5 in
(9 cm) thick and would have measured 10 in (24 cm) in diameter (Cat. No. 368-1). Vessels from this unit
appear to have been sealed by the 1870s or 1880 at the latest. A couple of older sheet-refuse sherds from
the 1840s and 1850s were also captured in the fill. Sherds from two domestic-made stoneware crocks are
from a ceramic class not commonly recovered from Ball Park features. Consequently, this unit seems to
sample sheet refuse containing ceramic sherds discarded from the 1840s to the 1870s. The age and
diversity of other artifacts in Unit 7028 should also be considered before making a final interpretation.

G.60

Unit 7036 (F7005). This unit yielded 11 sherds from eight ceramic vessels. The age of the vessels by
level suggests a reversed stratigraphic relationship where soil containing older sheet refuse had been
discarded over the top of a current surface. This kind of situation occurs when a larger pit or depression
is excavated through stratified sheet refuse and the soil is thrown on top of an existing surface. Specific
field notes on Unit 7036 were not available and thus this is only conjecture. The ceramic vessels by level
are listed in Table G.12.

Sherds in this unit suggest a possible instance of reversed stratigraphy where older fill containing sheet
refuse from the 1840s was dumped on top of a surface with newer items discarded in the 1850s. The
oldest vessels, V2, V3, V4, and V5, are probably from the James Wells household. Post-1848 vessels
from the lessee’s household are V7. Vessels 1 and 6 cannot be assigned to a specific household; however,
V1 may also be from the Wells’ occupation if it dates prior to 1848.
Unit 7037 (F7005). This unit yielded seven sherds representing seven ceramic vessels. Several of the
vessels are possibly from post-1865 intrusions (e.g., V4). Levels 1 and 4 yielded no ceramic sherds.
Level 2 yielded sheet-refuse-sized sherds from five vessels ranging in age from the 1830s (V2 is a light
blue transfer-printed saucer, ca. 1830-1845) to the 1840s-1850s (V3 is a blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware
bowl, ca. 1845-1855; V5 is a blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware possible octagonal plate, ca. 1845-1860)
and even later (V1 is a ironstone/whiteware plate with unidentifiable portion of a black transfer-printed
British Royal Arms maker’s mark; V4, a late wavy rim ironstone/whiteware vessel, probably post 1885?).
Level 3 yielded only one very small chip from a CC-ware/transitional ironstone plate (V6). Level 5
produced a sherd from a thin-bodied double curved late transitional ironstone/whiteware saucer with a
green band and two pink finer lines, ca. 1840-1850.

G.61

Ceramic sherds in this unit cover a broad period of occupation and sheet-refuse formation. They also
suggest some post-1865 intrusions into the area sampled by Unit 7037. Little more can be said and the
ceramic data should be integrated with all other data from this unit.
Remaining Units Sampling Feature 7005. Another six units sampled deposits around F7005, including
Units 7040, 7041, 7042, 7043, 7044, and 7045. Unit 7040 yielded four sherds from two vessels most
likely dating from the 1850s. Unit 7041 yielded 17 sherds suggesting at least 10 vessels. Seven of these
sherds are either too small or burned/too altered to be able to assign an unique vessel number. The
identified vessels date from the 1840s and 1850s and are mainly from sheet-refuse material. Six vessels
were probably discarded in the 1850s, the other four were likely discarded in the mid to late 1840s.
Consequently, most of the vessels were probably acquired by the lessee’s household, although a few may
have been acquired by the preceding Wells household occupying the block before 1848.
Unit 7042 yielded 42 sherds that account for at least 16 vessels that date most likely from the 1850s or
late 1840s. Two vessels may be from the early to mid 1840s. One of the more notable vessels consists of
about 55 percent of a child’s molded blue-tinted ironstone plate. It is a 12-sided, molded miniature soup
plate in a variant of the Sydenham or ‘wrapped corn’ patterns from 1851-1855 (Wetherbee 1985). It has a
Royal Arms black printed maker’s mark on its base for Thomas Goodfellow, whose pottery was in
operation from ca. 1828-1859 (Godden 1964:280). It also has an impressed oval mark with an anchor
naming his pottery. The plate is assigned a date of ca. 1851-1859 (Cat. Nos. 378-5, 378-6).
Other notable vessels from Unit 7042 include a molded and paneled 10- or 12-sided blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware plate with a highly curved marly and a raised rim edge (ca. 1844-1850, Cat. Nos.
378-4 and 378-14; another example was recovered from Lot 441, Cat. No. 441-114), a platter with the
same pattern, a possible molded Pearl Sydenham pattern cup or close variant (ca. 1850-1858, Cat. No.
378-15), two sherds from a late blue willow pattern thick-bodied transitional ironstone platter with wirecut ring marks (thumb-print pattern) on the base (ca. 1838-1850, Cat. Nos. 390-32, 409-2), a black band
with hand-painted large green leaves late whiteware saucer (ca. 1838-1848, Cat. Nos. 390-39), and a bluebanded, thick, blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl (ca. 1848-1860, Cat. No. 409-1). These and the
other vessels from Unit 7042 indicate that redeposited sheet-refuse deposits are possibly present and date
mainly from the late 1840s and 1850s. The deposit in Unit 7042 was sealed by about 1860, based upon
ceramic evidence. Other remains may support or help revise these dates.
Unit 7043 yielded two sherds from two ceramic vessels. One appears to be from a post-1890 light bluish
tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer (Cat. No. 395-1), the other is not large enough to be able to identify
with any certainty.
Unit 7044 produced two sherds from two vessels. One is a light blue transfer-printed pattern with a
border design like the ‘Beauties’ pattern assigned to John Ridgway (Coysh and Henrywood 1982:302;
Pollin et al. 1996:20). The Ridgway pattern dates to about 1830-1841, while the sherd may have been
discarded up to about 1848 by the Wells household. The second vessel is a late transitional
ironstone/whiteware hollowware form from the 1840s or 1850s.
Unit 7045 yielded five sherds from four vessels. One vessel is a comparatively unique-looking lead
glazed redware bowl/pan with a very thin white slip trailed line on the inside and an orange wash-like dry
exterior. The paste shows differential oxidation/firing conditions with the inside half a pinkish hue (5YR
7/6) and the outside a buff-colored hue (5YR 8/2 to 7/2). It has quartz inclusions and pinkish orange
small brick-like inclusions. The glaze is 2.5YR 4/8 to 5/8. The ware may be French or Mexican in
manufacture and probably predates 1850 (quite possibly 1835-1845, Cat. No. 406-24). Unit 7045 also
yielded a thin-bodied red transfer-printed floral saucer (ca. 1834-1842. Cat. Nos. 406-18, 406-19), a
mulberry transfer-printed cup (ca. 1835-1845), and a ironstone/whiteware soup plate with highly curved

G.62

marly (ca. 1840-1854). This unit appears to contain some very early sheet refuse possibly from
occupation during the late 1830s and early 1840s. It may indicate an older section of sheet refuse, either
sealed intact or redeposited at an early date, based solely upon ceramic sherds.
Special Collection Contexts from Feature 7005
The following lot numbers belong to other special collection contexts implemented as F7005 was
examined and various parts of its foundation dismantled. Each is separately discussed, since detailed data
on provenience lots was not available, and time did not permit a comparative check of sherds across units
or collection lots to isolate individual vessels scattered across multiple areas.
Lot 441 (General Surface Collection). This collection group yielded 71 sherds representing at least 21
vessels. Only the most notable vessels will be mentioned, including a rim sherd of the ‘Triple Border’ or
‘Memnon Shape’ platter from ca. 1850-1860 (Wetherbee 1985:75; Cat. Nos. 441-85, 441-106), pieces of
a blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate made by John Maddock and dating from ca. 1850-1855 (crowned
garter mark from 1842-1855 [Godden 1964:405], Cat. Nos. 441-138, 441-139, 441-140, 441-141), eight
sherds from a common round double-inflection blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate with a low well and
black printed Royal Arms maker’s mark with an impressed circular mark from James Edwards & Sons.
Edwards’ pottery was in operation from ca. 1851-1882, while this plate blank is from the 1851 to 1865
period rather than the entire span (Cat. Nos. 441-126 to 441-133). Other notable vessels include a sherd
from a sandy orange-paste 8-in (20 cm) diameter redware jar with a clear interior lead glaze and a whitish
yellow lead glazed exterior (thin slip wash?). The exterior glaze surface has a very fine sandy texture,
and the paste has very fine quartz grain inclusions (Cat No. 441-67). The vessel is either Mexican or
French in manufacture, and other sherds from it were apparently recovered elsewhere (e.g., see Lot 4507). The age of the redware jar seems to predate 1850.
Other vessels in Lot 441 include a molded cup (Cat. Nos. 441-120, 441-123) and a lid (Cat. No. 441-112)
from a molded dish or tureen. Both vessels are variants of the Sydenham pattern popular ca. 1850-1858
(see Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:114-120; Wetherbee 1980, 1985). A fragment from a Bennington-type
mottled (dripping runny pattern) brown large hollowware vessel was also recovered and dates from ca.
1842-1870. A sherd from a red transfer-printed ornate molded handle section (molded abutting reversed
C-scrolls) from a burned blue-tinted ironstone pitcher with a red floral design was also recovered (Cat.
No. 441-97). It dates from ca. 1842-1850. Another piece (Cat. No. 441-95) of the late blue willow
transfer-printed platter was also recovered, like the sherd from Unit 7042 (see Cat. No. 390-32). The
platter dates from ca. 1838-1850.
A fragment from a negative transfer-printed medium blue plate with a border pattern like the ‘Grecian
Border’ was also recovered (Cat. No. 441-105). The plate dates from ca. 1835-1845 (Pollan et al.
1996:44), although another closely similar variant shown in Pollan et al. (1996:41) was made by a pottery
for only two years, 1834-1836. Five sherds from a molded barrel-shaped engine-turned banded
undecorated CC-ware/whiteware pitcher were recovered and constitute about 10 percent of the vessel.
Another large sherd probably from this same pitcher was also noted in Lot 462 (Cat. No. 462-5). The
pitcher was probably used ca. 1835-1848. Finally, a sherd from a molded and paneled 10- or 12-sided
blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware 8-in (19 cm) diameter plate with a highly curved marly and a raised rim
edge was recovered (ca. 1844-1850, Cat. No. 441-114). It is similar to two sherds from Unit 7042 (Cat.
Nos. 378-4, 378-14) and even may be from the same plate.
The other vessels in this collection group assigned Lot 441 were also mainly from the 1845 to 1858
period of occupation, but a few were likely discarded before 1845, while some were probably purchased
in the late 1830s or early 1840s. The ceramic sherds suggest that the construction of the brick foundation
designated F7005 occurred in the mid 1850s, and that the foundation trenches captured contemporary
sherds as well as redeposited older sheet-refuse sherds as they were excavated and then backfilled. In a

G.63

few areas, post-1865 to 1880 intrusions have also occurred and have added some later material into older
contexts. It is also evident that some vessels had their sherds scattered across large areas captured by
F7005 and its many different sampling units. A few recognizable vessels were identified, indicating that
other repatriatable sherds may be found if additional time was invested to check for cross mends and
likenesses. Due to limits upon time and effort, as well as the large size of the F7005 assemblage, only a
few obvious examples were identified as the analyses progressed unit by unit and collection lot by
collection lot.
Lot 450 (Surface Collection). This group contains five sherds from five ceramic vessels that were in
common use in the 1840 to 1850 period, except for a Bristol/Bristol stoneware bottle with an oval
impressed GROSVENOR maker’s mark. This mark dates from ca. 1869-1899 period (Godden
1964:295), and is, therefore, later than most ceramic material from F7005. Its specific provenience is not
known, and it may actually come from a later disturbance. A sherd from a sandy orange-paste redware jar
with a clear interior lead glaze and a whitish yellow lead-glazed exterior (thin slip wash?) was also found.
The glaze surface has a very fine sand-like texture to its exterior glaze and may be Mexican or French in
manufacture. Other sherds from this jar were recovered in Lot 441.
Lot 462 (Collection from Foundation Removal). This group yielded two ceramic sherds representing two
vessels. One is a late residual blue shell-edged plate sherd with bud motif on a late transitional pearlware
dating ca. 1830-1840 (Cat. No. 462-4). The second is a large sherd from a thin-bodied barrel-shaped
pitcher with broad engine-turned/banded design (lacking any coloring) on a CC-ware/late whiteware (ca.
1835-1848, Cat. No. 462-5). Other fragments possibly from this same pitcher seem to be scattered across
the foundation area (see Collection Lot 441). These ceramic sherds indicate that pre-1850 sheet refuse
was captured under the foundation.
Lot 465 (Collection from Removal of Boards No. 13 and No. 14). This collection group consists of a
single ceramic sherd from a transitional whiteware saucer with thin double-curved sides and a light
powder-blue transfer-print design and panels and C-scrolls. The saucer dates from ca. 1832/1835 to ca.
1845. It is probably from older sheet refuse captured under the boards when the foundation was
constructed sometime after 1840 or 1845. Since there is only one sherd in this lot, one cannot rule out an
1850s construction date, especially when all other contexts with larger samples suggest later dates (e.g.,
see Lot 470 below).
Lot 468 (Collection from South Wall). This collection has a single large sherd from a double-inflection 9in (23 cm) diameter ironstone/whiteware plate with a tall, thick footring and no decoration. About 20
percent of the plate was recovered, and it dates from the 1840s or 1850s (Cat. No. 468-1).
Lot 470 (Under South and East Wall Planks). This collection group contains 11 sherds from seven
ceramic vessels. The sherds were recovered from beneath planks buried along the south and east wall
lines. The vessels are described in Table G.13 and provide an important key to dating construction of the
brick foundation. Many vessels in Lot 470 were probably discarded around the time the foundation was
constructed, while the older ones may represent sheet refuse captured from earlier occupation of this part
of Block 117. The pre-1848 vessels may have been discarded by the James Wells household, while the
post-1848 vessels were probably discarded by the lessee’s household prior to 1856.
Lot 476 (North Wall, Section G). This group consists of two cross-mending sherds from a blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware saucer with a molded design (Cat. Nos. 476-1 and 476-2). The saucer probably dates
from the 1848-1858 period.
Lot 478 (North Wall, Section I). This lot produced only a single ceramic sherd from a very thick light
bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware bowl dating from 1850-1870 (Cat. No. 478-5).

Lot 481 (West Wall, Section L). This collection has two sherds representing two vessels. One is a very
thick-bodied blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate center with a dark blue transfer-printed inner border
dating from 1830-1850 (Cat. No. 481-7). The second is a pink transfer-printed, very thin-bodied, late
transitional whiteware dish with part of an unidentifiable printed maker’s mark (Cat. No. 481-8). It also
has four impressed dots and probably was acquired and used ca. 1835-1845.
Interpretive Summary for Feature 7005
Ceramic vessel sherds recovered from many different collection groups and excavation units associated
with F7005 indicated occupation from at least the mid 1840s to the late 1850s. They also include some
older sherds from an occupation before 1845, as well as a few intrusive sherds from after 1865. Most of
the ceramic vessels were either purchased by the James Wells household, who occupied this lot from
1838 to 1848, or by a lessee up to about 1856 after the Wells family sold the lot. A few vessels are also
from the early part of the Floeck ownership of the lot.
Finally, in a couple of areas in F7005, post-1865 to 1880 intrusions have occurred, mixing very small
number of post-1865 ceramic sherds with older material. It is also evident from analyses of the many
different sampling units that some vessels had their sherds scattered across large areas. That is, some
broken vessels were subsequently captured by F7005’s footings and trenches and then were sealed when
the trenches were backfilled. A few of these recognizable vessels were identified in the discussion of
each provenience on a case-by-case basis. They indicate that other repatriatable sherds may also be found
if additional effort was invested to check for cross mends among all similar sherds and vessels. Due to
obvious limits on effort and the large size of the F7005 assemblage, only a few clear examples could be
identified as the analyses progressed. These include sherds from a barrel-shaped broad enginebanded/molded pitcher, a late blue willow platter, a redware jar and several other distinctive vessels as
noted in the above discussions. Of course, more examples are predicted, but such labor-intensive work
was not able to be implemented. In sum, the ceramic evidence suggests that construction of the brick
foundation designated as F7005 occurred in the mid 1850s, and that the foundation trenches captured
contemporary sherds as the construction progressed, as well as redeposited older sheet-refuse sherds as
the footings were excavated and then backfilled.

G.65

Feature 7006
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7007
This feature yielded seven sherds from six vessels, four of which are undecorated (three plain
ironstone/whiteware vessels and a plain porcelain bowl). Fragments are from one plate, three bowls
(including a porcelain bowl), one saucer, and a domestic stoneware crock. Except for the saucer (which
probably represents captured older sheet refuse), the age of the vessels is compatible with ceramics
purchased between 1842 and 1852. The very small saucer sherd is from a green transfer-printed saucer
common during ca. 1836-1844 (Cat. No. 286-5). It has a similar pattern to that on sherds in Features
7011, 7012, and 7013. The three plain ironstone/whiteware vessels and white porcelain bowl hint at a
preference for undecorated wares, but the sample is small. The stoneware sherd is very small and burned,
and also probably represents reworked sheet refuse captured by the feature when it was sealed. If the
ceramic vessels are also representative of other items associated with this feature, it could be suggested
that its material was discarded after about 1845 and sealed by 1855, or possibly even up to five years
earlier, by 1850. Other than that, the ceramic assemblage is too small to say much more.
Feature 7008
This feature yielded 27 sherds from at least 15 ceramic vessels. Seven vessels (n=9 sherds) were
recovered from Level 1, six vessels (n=16 sherds) were recovered from Level 2, and two vessels (n=2
sherds) were recovered from Level 3. The fragments are from two plates, two bowls, three cups, four
saucers, a chamber pot, and three unspecified vessels (two medium hollowware forms and one small
cockled specialty flatware vessel). The ages of the vessels are compatible with ceramics purchased
between 1840 and 1855. Two-thirds of the vessels were probably purchased before 1850, and three may
have been acquired before 1840 (a saucer, a pitcher or bowl, and a unrecognizable vessel form). The
remaining items, a molded ironstone teacup and possibly two others (a plate and a saucer), were probably
purchased between 1850 and 1855.
The youngest tightly dated vessel is a very thick-bodied molded blue-tinted ironstone tea cup with a
Sydenham-variant pattern that was popular between ca. 1850-1856 (the Sydenham pattern itself was
registered in 1853 [Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:114-120; Wetherbee 1980]). Only two vessels are more
than 30 percent complete, and both are among the youngest vessels in the assemblage. Some of the oldest
sherds seem to be from sheet refuse captured by the feature before it was sealed. The entire ceramic
vessel assemblage in F7008 appears to represent the discarded remains of a modest, middle-class
household with a slightly lower middle-class emphasis for ceramic vessels dating before 1848, followed
by slightly more progressive tastes after 1848 and a shift to many nicely molded ironstones. If a single
discard period was selected, the most probable dates would be from about 1840 to about 1856, based
upon the assumption that the ceramic vessels are equally representative of other discard activities
associated with this context.
Feature 7009 (Privy)
Feature 7009 was identified as a filled privy pit. It produced the fifth largest ceramic sherd assemblage
and the third largest vessels count among the more than 100 Ball Park features. The privy portion of the
feature was probably filled during the 1850 to 1856 period, suggesting that it may have been used
primarily by the lessee. Its fill, however, captured older sheet refuse, and thus its ceramic contents are
complicated and also include redeposited ceramic material from the Wells household. The reader should
keep in mind that the term ironstone/whitewares is also used in the discussion of this feature to
encompass all post-1825 refined earthenware paste glaze types, including late transitional pearlwares and
CC-ware, etc., depending upon the context under consideration, and not just post-1840 wares. The
following sections review the results of the ceramic vessel analyses on F7009 and reveal its nature and
unique characteristics.

G.66

Feature Description
This privy was one of the best demarcated features uncovered in the Project Area. It consisted of a woodlined pit roughly 7.5 x 5 ft (2.3 x 1.5 m) that contained lenses of fill and artifacts. The privy extended
about 2 ft (0.72 m) below the cut construction ground surface. While the uppermost section of the feature
had been removed when the railroad graded this area about 100 years ago, the excavated portion probably
represented more than 60 percent of the original deposit. The estimated volume of the removed privy fill
was approximately 531 gallons (2 m3), and it contained a wide assortment of artifacts. The wooden box
used to construct the privy appeared to be a recycled metal-lined shipping crate.
Ceramic Assemblage Overview
Originally, this feature produced 161 ceramic vessel sherds, but this number was subsequently reduced to
153 sherds after freshly broken sherds were repatriated. Of the 153, 82 percent were assignable to
specific vessels (125 of 153 sherds). The remaining 28 sherds could not be assigned to any specific
vessels mainly because they were too small and lacked diagnostic features. Also, a few sherds were not
assigned because they were attributable to more than one vessel, and time was not available for complete
differentiation.
In all, 69 ceramic vessels are recognizable from the feature (Table G.14). Most vessels are less than 5
percent complete, and many are represented by only one sherd. In fact, only four vessels are more than
10 percent complete after examining all fragments. This situation would not have changed significantly
even if all the unassigned sherds were assignable to specific vessels.
The lack of reconstructable ceramic vessels is an important finding from the ceramic analyses. It
indicates that F7009 underwent some special formation and transformation processes that included
redeposited sheet refuse. Notably, 62 percent of the identified vessels are represented by a single sherd,
and this rather dramatically indicates that the intentional disposal of broken ceramic vessels in F7009 was
not a primary activity by the household using the privy.
Ironstone/whitewares and older transitional refined earthenware paste variants (CC-wares, late
pearlwares, etc.) account for 84.1 percent of the ceramic vessel types recovered from F7009 (58 of 69
vessels, see Table G.14). The 11 remaining vessels include four porcelain vessels, or 5.7 percent of
F7009’s vessels (cup, saucer, plate, and doll-sized toy saucer); four imported European stoneware vessels,
or 5.7 percent of the ceramic assemblage (German salt-glazed mug, German salt-glazed mineral water
bottle, and two British Bristol glazed stoneware bottle); a brown stoneware cover for a crock/jar at 1.5
percent (possibly imported); a redware crock/jar at 1.5 percent (imported French or Mexican?); and an
American salt-glazed stoneware jug/jar at 1.5 percent. Consequently, the ceramic assemblage is
overwhelmingly dominated by ironstone/whitewares and older refined earthenwares paste variants (see
Table G.14), followed by a small number of imported stonewares from Germany (V7, V48, V49) and
Great Britain (V8, V69), a few imported porcelain vessels (V21, V22, V32, V40), an American stoneware
crock/jar (V65), and an imported redware jar (V64).
Identified vessel forms among the 58 ironstone/whiteware variants include 21 plates, 15
cups/teacups/teabowls, five saucers, four pitchers/jugs/coffeepots, two bowls, one basin/pan, two possible
chamberpots, five unspecifiable hollowware vessels, two unspecifiable flatware vessels, and a tureen lid
or cover. This range of vessel forms is a good representation of many common household vessels,
including tablewares, kitchenwares, and other general utility wares.
Age of Ceramic Vessels
The age of the diagnostic vessels in F7009’s assemblage is comparatively narrow. All but four of the
ironstone/whiteware vessels and related ware types are compatible with wares commonly discarded in the
1846 to 1856 period (see Table G.14). The exceptions include a residual cockled blue shell-edged plate

G.67

(ca. 1828-1838, V2), a blue transfer-printed plate (ca. 1834-1842, V34), a blue-tinted ironstone cup (ca.
1850-1870, making this partially compatible, V31) and a single inflection light bluish tinted thick
ironstone plate (ca. 1866-1878, V12). All of the other ironstone/whiteware vessels fit well within a
probable discard context of ca. 1846-1856. An 1852 impressed date Davenport marked noncockled shelledged plate (V39) was recovered and is among the more complete ceramic specimens in the assemblage.

vessels that do not belong to the refined earthenware/ironstone/whiteware paste/glaze group;, these vessels belong to the
stoneware, redware/coarse earthenware, or porcelain paste/glaze groups.
sherds from V12 that are considered to be intrusive into Feature 7009 due to their late age.
SFP1 is multisided blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware double-inflection plate with marly divides.

The mean ceramic beginning and end dates were computed for the ironstone/whiteware vessels using
bilevel intervals for F7009 (i.e., combining sets of adjacent levels). Also, computations were based upon
vessels assigned to their highest level of occurrence. If a vessel’s sherds were scattered among two or
three levels, it was used only once to compile mean dates by being assigned to its highest stratigraphic
occurrence. Thus each one of the 58 ironstone/whiteware vessels was entered into the computations only
once for the beginning, mid, and ending dates.
The nine levels in F7009 were grouped by twos to provide larger samples for compiling mean dates
compared to use of only single-level intervals. Also, one level, Level 3, was dropped from the
computations because it contained no unique ironstone/whiteware vessels that were not also found in
higher levels. The various mean ceramic dates for all ironstone/whiteware vessels and related refined
earthenwares by highest occurrence are given in Table G.15.

G.70

The dates in Table G.15 may seem to create a perfect temporal pattern, suggesting that Levels 4 to 9 are
sequentially stratified, but in reality, ceramic vessels cannot capture changes over a 12- or even 24-or 36month period. Thus the close sequence of mean ceramic dates is artificial and is actually stronger
evidence of contemporaneity than time differences measured in months. In fact, Levels 4-9 all likely
formed over a period ranging anywhere from three to eight years, particularly if the source of the sherds
did not substantially change. Thus while these three lowermost level groupings appear to be temporally
stratified by their mean ceramic dates, their differences are not great enough to capture the true time span
over which they formed. Although the three bilevel sets for Levels 4 to 9 reveal dates changing by only a
year or two, in reality the six levels probably formed over about five years of deposition. Ceramic mean
dates in Table G.15 cannot distinguish this short sequence of time.
Only Levels 1 and 2 significantly diverge from the same time sequence because they contain older sheet
refuse than the levels below (i.e, Levels 1 and 2 convey an older age than any of the levels below them).
If their small sample sizes are not biasing their dates, Levels 1 and 2 may suggest inverted stratigraphy
that probably was created when older soil and sheet refuse was used to finally seal the privy deposit after
1855. This scenario also appears to be strongly supported by the absence of any cross mends between
Levels 1 and 2 and any of the other lower levels. In fact, the distribution of cross-mended sherds ties all
levels from Level 3-8 together, making the absence of any cross mends below Level 2 significant when
combined with the few sherds recovered from Level 3. The distribution of cross mends by level is
important to examine in more detail, as explained below.
Cross-Mended Sherds
The distribution of ceramic cross-mends in F7009 indicates that Levels 4- 8 are interrelated. As Table
G.16 reveals, Levels 4-7 are associated with many cross-mend occurrences in comparison to the upper
three levels. Also, the number of ceramic sherds exceeds 20 in these levels, with Level 7 containing 44
sherds. Unfortunately, the fewer sherds and vessels in Levels 1-3 are partly due to a smaller excavated
area. This also would have impacted the number of cross mends, but it can be adjusted by using averages.
Hence the average number of sherds per cross mends between levels tabulated by level is as follows:
Levels 1-2 are not applicable (no cross mends), Level 3 is 3.0 sherds, Level 4 is 4.2 sherds, Level 5 is 8.3
sherds, Level 6 is 4.2 sherds, Level 7 is 11 sherds, Level 8 is 29 sherds, and Level 9 is not applicable (no
cross mends). As these averages indicate, Levels 3-7 are comparatively similar with averages from three
to 11 sherds, whereas Levels 1, 2, and 9 lack any cross mends with other levels and are thus also similar.
These data suggest that the filling of F7009 from Level 8 up to Level 3 share some characteristics, based
upon cross-mend frequencies. The precise nature of these characteristics requires a closer examination of
the ceramic data, as well as other important artifact data.
Matching Vessels
Several examples of matching vessels indicating either possibly full table sets or more limited settings
were identified. These include a possible matching red hand-painted floral cup and saucer (V 50, V57), a
molded porcelain cup and saucer (V21, V32), a relief-molded jug/pitcher and bowl (V44, V45), a
transfer-printed flow-blue tureen cover and possible platter or underplate (V18, V41), and at least three
12- to 16-sided molded blue-tinted ironstone plates with raised marly divides (V9, V10, V11). Four shelledged plates were also recovered; however, they do not come from the same set. Instead, they were
apparently acquired at different times or from different merchants/sources. Still, they do suggest an
attempt to build or maintain a pseudo table set of similar blue edgewares.
Special Excavation Concerns and Level Adjustments
The volume of excavated fill from F7009 varied by level according to the size of the area excavated and
the thickness of the level removed. This made it impossible to make simple comparisons of sherd
frequencies by level without standardizing their volumes. Nine levels were excavated in F7009, and the
surface size of the area sampled increased after Level 3. This produced differences in recovery densities.

G.71

The following adjustments were made to compensate for differences in volume of feature fill between
levels. The adjustments made it possible to draw some standardized comparisons by level that would
have been statistically biased otherwise. The factors applied were used to adjust the ceramic vessel
counts and sherd counts in order to make standardized comparisons. They also assume that the recovered
sample fractions are equally representative of an entire level if incomplete recovery had taken place.

‘V7 (Level 4)’ indicates that Vessel 7 cross-mends with sherds from the level within which it is noted and from Level 4.

The adjustments imposed by level were as follows. Level 1 was adjusted by a factor of 8.9 due to its
smaller area and shallower depth. Levels 2 and 3 were adjusted by 4.5 to make up for their smaller area,
and Level 9 by a factor of 5 because it was one-fifth the depth of a standard level. All of the other levels
did not require any adjustments. These adjustments are used later in this discussion when sherd
frequencies are compared level by level.
Although the depth of the feature’s fill was well over 2 ft (72 cm), the distribution of ceramic vessels by
level turned out to be fairly similar when soil volume was standardized. The raw and adjusted
distribution of ceramic sherds and vessels by level are given in Table G.17. Figure G.18 provides a
graphic representation of the adjusted frequencies that indicates rather unusual formation processes given
the depth of the feature.
The source(s) of the ceramic vessel sherds in F7009 are important to identify. If many of the vessels were
reconstructable or even partially reconstructable (i.e., more than 20 complete), the sherds would
reasonably represent contemporaneously broken vessels intentionally discarded while the privy was in
use. If, on the other hand, very few reconstructable vessels were in the feature’s fill, a different set of
scenarios may have transpired. For example, the privy may have been cleaned out periodically and then
finally filled with yard soil and sheet refuse just before it was permanently sealed. Alternatively, the
occupants of the privy may not have used it for the disposal of broken ceramics but discarded their refuse
somewhere else. Regardless, the applicability of these different scenarios was carefully weighed and
determined by closely examining the precise nature of the ceramic sherd assemblage from F7009.

levels adjusted by factors noted below to make an equivalent volume of feature recovery
vessels assigned to their highest levels and entered only once.
About 38% of all vessels (26 of 69 vessels) were represented by more than one sherd. These additional sherds were frequently
recovered from adjacent levels. Cross mends included 10 pairs (20 sherds) from the 96 sherds no assigned to unique vessels (70
assigned and 26 unassigned sherds). The ceramic contents of Levels 1, 2, 3, and 9, have been adjusted by factors of 8.9, 4.5, 4.5,
and 5, respectively, to equal the same feature volume as Levels 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (i.e., 2.1 by 2.8 by 0.1 m volume).

It reveals that the privy received similar fill material containing redeposited sheet
refuse and not many directly deposited broken ceramic vessels (see main text for
details).

G.73

Completeness of Ceramic Vessels
Ceramic vessel data from F7009 indicate quite clearly that it did not contain very many reconstructable
ceramic vessels. Only four of the 69 ceramic vessels are more than 10 percent complete. These include a
white molded and indented porcelain saucer from ca. 1840-855(V32, 92 percent complete); an 1852 datemarked noncolored shell-edged plate (V39, 50 percent complete); a poorly incised blue shell-edged plate
from ca. 1848-1858 (V23, 30 percent complete); and a thick-bodied molded and paneled CCware/ironstone/whiteware cup from ca. 1848 to 1856 (V17).
Partial cleaning of the privy on multiple occasions may have removed many sherds, providing that they
were directly discarded into the privy after they were broken. If this is the case, certain other
characteristics would have been evident in the stratigraphy of the privy and the distribution ceramic
sherds to support such a scenario. For example, the distribution of ‘sherds from same vessels’ ought to be
randomly, rather than sequentially, scattered through the mixed fill; this suggests intact rather than mixed
stratigraphy. Also, the number of sherds per vessel determined through the enumeration process should
be indicative of the source of the material. Randomly recaptured sheet refuse in the privy fill would
produce one kind of sherds-per-vessel histogram, while directly discarded broken ceramic vessels would
produce quite another.
Insights from Frequencies of Sherds per Vessel
Figure G.19 is a histogram of the sherds per vessel for all enumerated ceramic vessels from F7009. Table
G.18 gives the raw counts for each grouping. The histogram is a measure of the number of sherds
recovered for each vessel in the privy, based upon enumeration and repatriation. If entire broken vessels
were thrown into the privy and then the privy was subsequently sealed, one would have much greater
sherds-per-vessel frequencies than the histogram displays. If a random element played into the capturing
of sherds in the privy fill, then quite another pattern would be evident.
The distribution exhibited by Figure G.19 is very meaningful. It suggests that 95 percent of the identified
ceramic vessels probably came from randomly captured sheet refuse periodically dumped into the privy
from a single source, likely from a bare part of the yard where soil could be swept up when needed. In
addition, a few vessels diverge from random occurrences and are probably a result of directly discarded
refuse thrown into the privy as it was used. These points are discussed in greater detail below.
The logarithmic trend highly visible in the sherds-per-vessel data on the left side of Figure G.19 is
probably a byproduct of a binomial distribution of randomly captured sherds, most likely sheet-refuse
material from a dispersed midden (e.g., see Hietala and Moir 2000; Moir and Hietala 2000). Vessels on
the right side of the histogram, however, are nonrandom exceptions to the expected distribution. That is,
in a sizable but random sample of sheet refuse from a bounded yard area, one would expect the greatest
number of sherds to be from unique vessels, followed by the sherds from vessels where two sherds were
recovered, and then followed by vessels with three sherds, and so on.
The pattern shown in Figure G.19 produces a logarithmic pattern that fits multiples of threes: 1/3, 1/9,
1/27, and then one-half of 1/81, after which the pattern completely breaks down. That is, 43 vessels are
represented by only one sherd; approximately one-third of this number (actually 1/2.9), or 15 vessels, are
represented by two sherds; another nearly 1/9 (actually 1/8.6), or five vessels, are represented by three
sherds; another nearly 1/27 (actually 1/22), or two vessels, are represented by four sherds; and finally only
1/43 instead of 1/81 are represented by five sherds, indicating that the pattern was starting to widely
diverge from what was expected. Beyond five sherds, the occurrences indicate nonrandom capturing of
ceramic vessels that is more compatible with intentional disposal of wares in the privy. Vessels with
more than five sherds are V17 (n=6 sherds), V23 (n=8 sherds), and V39 (n=10 sherds). Sherds associated
with these three vessels may represent postdepositional breakage of large sherds as the privy consolidated
(old breaks) or from recent construction equipment or digging techniques used during the excavation. A

G.74

check for fresh breaks negated the latter two scenarios, leaving the three exceptions–V17, V23 and V39–
as probably intentionally discarded vessel portions tossed into the privy as it was used.

Figure G.19. Number of vessels using relative frequency percentages that are represented by
specific sherds counts for ceramics in Feature 7009. The feature yielded a total of 69 ceramic
vessels among which 43 vessels (62%) are represented by only a single sherd, and 15 vessels (22%)
are represented by two sherds each. Table G.18 gives the raw counts for each grouping. The
logarithmic trend suggests that vessels with one to six sherds per vessel were the result of a random
process of selection from a larger population composed of highly dispersed sheet refuse. The two
vessels with more than six sherds owe their presence to a different selective process.

The ages of Vessels 17, 23, and 39 seem to support this scenario. They were assigned date ranges of ca.
1848-1856 (V17), ca. 1848-1858 (V23), and 1848-1856 (V39), based upon typical popularity of plate
blank). The ages of these three vessels produces an 1848 beginning date and 1856.7 ending date.
Beginning dates derived from various levels with sample sizes as few as six and eight range from 1839.3
(Level 1, n=6) to 1845.7. An average of 1844.5 was derived for three larger groupings, or 52 of the 58
ironstone/whiteware vessels. Ending dates range from 1849.1 to 1855.4, indicating that the three vessels
with the greatest sherd counts do indeed fall in the most recent end of vessel age spans found in the
feature. Consequently, these three vessels are compatible with a scenario where they are among the more
recently broken and discarded ceramic vessels in the feature.
Other Considerations for the Origin of Feature 7009’s Ceramic Sherds
Ceramic source implications are derived from the lack of completeness of the ceramic vessels (only four
are more than 10 percent complete), the narrowness of cross mends restricted mostly to adjacent levels
and their lack of randomness, the closeness of the average mean beginning and ending dates for various
levels, and the characteristics of the sherds per vessel (see Table G.18, Figure G.19). The greatest
majority of ceramic material appears to come from a stratified random accumulation of sherds rather than

G.75

intentionally discarded broken vessels tossed into the privy while it was in use. The source of the sherds
seems to remain constant and derive from the same general source since the kinds of vessels by level and
the ages of vessel groups by level remain very similar.

A common household source for ceramic sherds is a dispersed midden. Dispersed middens contain
reworked and trampled sheet refuse, following Deetz’s (1977) use of the term, or secondary refuse,
following South (1977). Dispersed middens by definition contain highly mixed assemblages of small
sherds where few vessels can be completely reconstructed from a restricted excavation area (Moir 1997;
Moir and Hietala 2000). When randomly sampled, they produce sherds-per-vessel histograms that follow
binomial distributions (Hietala and Moir 2000). Unfortunately, a detailed discussion of dispersed
middens, binomial distributions, and the like is beyond the scope of this study.
Estimating the frequency of ceramic sherds per cubic meter of feature fill, however, is within range of
discussion. One would expect nineteenth-century trash-laden features to have very high frequencies of
ceramic vessel sherds per volume of soil, and samples of sheet-refuse mixed soils from dispersed middens
to have much lower frequencies of ceramic vessel sherds per same unit volume of soil. In this regard,
there is information from over 50 dispersed middens from rural house sites that can be extracted for
comparative purposes (Jurney and Moir 1987; Moir and Jurney 1987).
Frequencies of ceramic sherds by level per adjusted cubic meter of feature fill from F7009 ranges from 17
to 75 sherds per cubic meter. When one visualizes only 75 sherds scattered among an entire cubic meter
of soil, one quickly realizes that even the densest levels in F7009 lacked a sherd-rich matrix. This
becomes even clearer when typical yard midden frequencies are compared. In active yard areas of rural
nineteenth-century Texas house sites, one will typically encounter from 40 to 160 ceramic vessel sherds
per cubic meter in the cultural-bearing strata of the most heavily used part of the yard. Sherds are
typically recovered from the uppermost 25 to 33 cm of the soil column.

G.76

These estimates are computed by looking at the ironstone/whiteware sherd averages for entire house sites
covering from 1,400 to 7,000 m2 (Moir 1987b:111). Whole-site sampling revealed that over 40 house
sites produced averages ranging from 1.4 to 14.4 sherds per m2 for only ironstone/whitewares. These
frequencies exclude any porcelain or stoneware vessel sherds. The ironstone/whiteware averages still
have to be adjusted by factors of about 3.5 to 4, since they only relate to the active culture-bearing soil
strata. At most sites, the active culture-bearing soil strata was typically only 25 to 28 cm thick, making
the 1.4 to 14.4 ironstone/whiteware sherd frequencies equivalent to five to 58 sherds per cubic meter of
yard soil for an entire site. When one focuses only upon the densest part of the yard, ceramic sherd
frequencies do commonly reach from 80 to 160 sherds per cubic meter of artifact-bearing soil.
Frequencies of all ceramic sherds in F7009 ranged from 17 to 75 ceramic sherds per cubic meter of
deposit as noted above. These frequencies for ceramic sherds per cubic meter of soil indicate that
F7009’s ceramic sherds were in all probability introduced into the feature along with soil swept from the
active part of an urban lot between ca. 1852 and 1856. At the very oldest, the privy does not seem to
extend before 1850, and the lowest levels do not support older use. Instead, older ceramic sherds have
been captured by the privy because older sheet refuse provided some of the fill material. Analysis of
other artifacts in the privy may allow narrowing of ceramic vessel dates from the privy, and all data
should be synthesized. This also brings up the subject of identifying the household or households
responsible for the artifacts in the privy.
Household Affiliation and Socioeconomic Profiling
The presence of captured older sheet refuse in F7009 makes the identification of households much more
complicated than any feature that simply contains directly discarded refuse. Based upon ceramic vessel
data, it appears that the privy, formerly used as a milk cooler, was relegated to use as a privy in about
1852, receiving stratified fills composing parts of Levels 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 up to about 1856. The privy
then appears to have undergone a shift in use whereby fewer ceramic sherds cross-mend to lower levels
below Level 3, and then older sherds from older sheet refuse were used to seal the feature. The German
salt-glazed mug sherds from Levels 3 and the top of Level 4 are probably from Martin Floeck’s
ownership period. These mug sherds, along with the other ceramic evidence from Levels 1 and 2,
strongly suggest that the privy was abandoned by the lessee and then sealed by Mr. Floeck soon after he
bought the lot in 1856. Nearly all ceramic sherds in the uppermost two levels, however, are from
redeposited sheet refuse, and except for possibly the German stoneware mug, are from either the lessee or
the Wells households. Of course, any other whole or reconstructable glass vessels, bottles, or other
artifacts may also be from the Floeck ownership, whereas sheet-refuse-sized material may be from older
debris similar to the ceramic sherds.
Ceramic sherds within the privy fills below Level 3 also come from mixed sources of sheet refuse since
most vessels were less than 5 percent reconstructable. As mentioned before, only four vessels were more
than 10 percent complete. The vessels in Levels 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 come from older items discarded
during the Witt ownership period, if they date typically from 1848 to 1856, or the Wells household if they
date before 1848. Of course, vessels purchased in the 1842 to 1848 period may have been discarded by
either household since both may have acquired ceramics during that period and discarded them during
their occupations.
Interpretive Summary
The lack of completeness of most ceramic vessels, the narrowness of cross-mends and their lack of
randomness through out the feature or across broad vertical distances, and the large number of
enumerated vessels suggest that ceramic vessel sherds were captured within the fills periodically placed in
the privy. Furthermore, the fills below Level 3 were probably taken from the same part of the yard each
time since ceramic cross-mends on sheet-refuse sherds show some links supporting this scenario. The
frequency of ceramic sherds per level per adjusted cubic meter of fill ranges from 17 to 75 sherds per

G.77

cubic meter of fill from F7009. Typical yard midden from active yard areas may have from 40 to 160 or
more ceramic vessel sherds per cubic meter from the culture-bearing uppermost 25 to 33 cm of soil. The
closeness of F7009’s sherd frequency averages suggests that the sherds were indeed introduced from
typical house lot soils, possibly from bare areas were sweeping loose soil could be easily accomplished
when needed. The added fill matrix was probably done to help odor control and may have been included
lime or other material to accomplish this goal.
Finally and as noted earlier, F7009 yielded sherds from 58 ironstone/whiteware/pearlware and similar
paste/glaze variants. These specifically include 21 plates, 15 cups/teacups/teabowls, five saucers, four
pitchers/jugs/coffeepots, two bowls, one basin/pan, two possible chamberpots, five unspecifiable
hollowware vessels, two unspecifiable flatware vessels, and a tureen lid or cover. The ratio of cups to
plates from F7009 is 1.40-to-1 and is very similar to the ratio of 1.59-to-1 derived from
ironstone/whiteware cups to plates from the intensive sampling of an entire dispersed midden on a
middle-class rural house site in north-central Texas (41NV267) (Moir 1997). Of further comparative
interest, the house site in North Texas was occupied for 37 years and produced 101 ironstone/whiteware
cups and plates from a whole-site sample, whereas F7009 produced a combined total of 36 cups and
plates from an unspecified sample size of recaptured sheet refuse and an undefinable occupation period.
If sample sizes were equivalent, one might compute in reverse that F7009 could contain evidence of at
least 13 years of occupation, and if it was finally sealed in 1857 or 1858, occupational debris may have
started to accumulate by 1845. This, of course, relates to the age of the sheet refuse captured by the privy
and not the length of time the feature was actively used.
In conclusion, F7009 provides a classic example of the unique complexity of many Ball Park deposits.
The age of fill episodes in F7009 does not directly correlate with the age of the ceramic vessel sherds
mixed in with the fill. Other items, however, may have followed a different route of loss or disposal.
Whole bottles, for example, may indeed be contemporaneous with use of the privy, as well as small
personal items accidentally dropped in as the privy was in use. What is clear from ceramic vessel data is
that older ceramic debris was captured as the privy was used, and that the household responsible for
filling the privy did not engage in a practice of throwing ceramic vessels broken by their onsite activities
into the privy. Instead, whatever ceramics they broke were cast elsewhere. Captured sheet refuse
strongly suggests that they also simply discarded ceramic sherds as sheet refuse within their lot. A
number of the ceramic sherds from the privy revealed that 1848 to 1856 sheet refuse was also redeposited
in the privy as it was used and finally sealed.
Feature 7010 (Brick Pier)
This feature yielded only one piece of a high-fired sewer tile or brick (post 1885; 41HR820, Cat. No. 2326, Level 1). As such, it contained no ceramic vessel sherds.
Feature 7011 (Refuse Deposit)
Feature 7011 yielded three fragments from only three ceramic vessels. It is described as a refuse deposit
but seems to be a pocket of captured sheet refuse if the ceramic sherds are representative of the other
remains it contained. The three ceramic fragments from F7011 indicate two differently styled cups and
one saucer. These vessels are similar to some of the ceramic material from F7013, one of the oldest
features in the project. F7013 was located about 16 ft (5 m) south of F7011.
Both the red spatterware cup sherd (ca. 1835-1848, V1) and the delicate green transfer motif saucer sherd
(ca. 1832-1845, V3) are derived from vessels just like examples seen in F7013 (see V5 and V10,
respectively, in F7013). Another fragment from a similar delicate green transfer motif saucer was
recovered from F7012, just 6 ft (2 m) northwest of F7011 (see V1 in F7012, ca. 1832-1845). Only the
molded and paneled black transfer-printed late transitional/early light bluish tinted ironstone cup (ca.
1840-1848, V2 from F7011) was not represented among F7013’s ceramic vessel types.

G.78

Ages of the three vessels from F7011 are compatible with ceramics purchased between 1835 and 1848,
and they were probably sealed in this feature by 1848, if not earlier. The sherds are slightly larger than
typical sheet refuse, suggesting that they were not trampled for more than a few years before they were
captured by F7011 and sealed from further reduction. The socioeconomic status of the household(s)
discarding them cannot be ascertained due to sample size, but if F7013 represents a larger accumulation
from the same family, then the vessels seem to come from a middle-class household that does not use
completely matching table settings.
Feature 7012 (Posthole)
This feature yielded eight sherds from six ceramic vessels. These include fragments from three plates
(V3, a late transitional pearlware plate, ca. 1830-1840; V4, a thick common light bluish tinted ironstone
plate, ca. 1855-1870; and V6, a milky white thick molded and indented porcelain plate, from ca. 18501870?), two cups (V2, a blue transfer-printed willow motif cup, ca. 1838-1850, and V5, a thin doublecurved transitional late whiteware cup, ca. 1832-1842), and one saucer (V1, a delicate green transfer
motif saucer, ca. 1832-1845). Ages of these vessels are indicative of ceramics purchased in the following
two periods: (1) ca. 1835 to 1842, and (2) post 1855. They include fragments from one cup style and one
saucer style that are also present in F7013. Specifically, the blue transfer-printed willow motif cup and
the delicate green transfer motif saucer are identical to examples recovered from F7013. As mentioned, a
sherd of this same saucer motif was also recovered from F7011.
There are also two sherds from nineteenth-century porcelain dolls. One is semi crude with flaws on its
exterior glaze (Cat. No. 273-23, Level 1). The other is part of a shoulder section for a cloth body doll,
possibly a German doll (Cat. No. 275-33, Level 2). These sherds are not included in the ceramic vessel
data.
The socioeconomic status of the household(s) discarding the oldest four ceramic vessels cannot be
accurately ascertained, based solely upon this feature due to sample size. The thick porcelain plate sherd
suggests at least middle class if it comes from the ca. 1850 to 1860 period. The older and more decorative
wares are also middle class when combined with the other nearby pre-1849 features (e.g., Features 7011
and 7013), and may provide a glimpse into some of the Wells family’s ceramic tablewares.
Feature 7013 (Sealed Sheet Refuse)
This feature was rather unique among Ball Park features, since it appeared to represent a section of in situ
early yard midden apparently captured and sealed under a structure constructed in the late 1840s before
the midden material had been widely dispersed. It yielded 69 sherds from 14 ceramic vessels, producing
a comparatively high sherds-per-vessel ratio of 4.9 to 1. The vessels include fragments from four plates
(V1, V2, V3, V4), five cups (V5, V6, V7, V8, V9), two saucers (V10, V11), two bowls (V13, V14), and a
pitcher (V12). Table G.19 provides a detailed look at this very special collection of early ceramic vessels.
Unassigned Sherds
Five unassigned sherds were also recovered from this feature (Cat. Nos 43-1, 299-6, 299-7, 299-8, 29916). Two unassigned sherds are small chips, one might be from Plate V3 (Cat. No. 299-16) and two
burned sherds might possibly be from Pitcher V12 (Cat. No.’s 43-1 and 299-6). But none of these sherds
can be confidently placed with any of the suggested vessels and were left unassigned.
The small assemblage of vessels recovered from F7013 produce a picture of ceramics discarded by a
household probably in the 1838 to 1845 period. James Wells owned the lot during this time, extending to
1848, indicating that nearly all of these vessels may have come from his household. The vessels reveal a
strong preference for the popular but modestly priced decorated wares of the late 1830s-early 1840s.
These same wares, however, would become even cheaper as the 1840s progressed, and by 1848 would
have been relegated to rural families and peasants rather than stylish urban households. Further, the small

G.79

assemblage has a greater presence of red decorated wares, suggesting either a very tight period of
acquisition when red was extremely popular, or an attempt by Mrs. Wells to create a greater consistency
among her ceramic holdings. Archeological assemblages suggest some stylish peaking of red in the mid
1840s, when red shell-edged plates and platters were also produced for a brief period.

bud motif (72 cockles per 25 cm diameter plate); footring is variant of a string-type footring with a residual double
footring on the lower shoulder; ca. 40% complete; numerous cross mends, indicating considerable reduction has
taken place; entire plate would consist of 85 sherds if similar reduction had also affected its remaining missing
sherds; large recovery fraction indicates vessel was discarded and trampled for only a couple of years before it
was sealed and protected within feature; vessel likely discarded by 1840-1844 and sealed in F7013 by 1848,
although dates cannot be verified; use/storage wear on rim; Cat. Nos. 1-1, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-13, 1-14, 1-18,

slightly burned blue shell-edged very late pearlware plate with well molded incising (has better defined cockles
and incising than Plate V1 above); 25 cm original diameter with ca. 64 cockles (Cat. No. 299-24); late residual
cockled rim with incising that is a precursor to later trident-style incised motif; use wear indicates vessel used
moderately before broken and discarded; some fragments discarded well before feature was sealed and covered,
others probably dispersed across rest of active yard area during 1838-1848 to time F7013 was permanently
sealed; Cat. Nos. 299-24, 299-25; ca.1820-1835 (n=2)

moderately thin rim has a relief dotted design, footring is well defined (non-string type and more typical of plate
footrings for 1835-1850); this vessel, if purchased in a full matching set, would have been much more expensive
than other common contemporary wares; possibly purchased directly from open stock and while expensive by
itself was within cost as a single item acquisition; Cat. Nos. 1-5, 1-6, 1-16, 43-3, 299-20; ca. 1830-1842 (n=5)

Finally, if the Wells family did not bring any ceramic vessels with them when they moved onto this block
in 1838, then all of their ceramic vessels would have been acquired after the move. If this was in fact
true, then all of the ceramic vessels would have been purchased from Houston merchants. The older
vessels from this feature, therefore, may give a glimpse of some of the earliest wares available in Houston
that were purchased by the Wells household. But in all likelihood, the Wells family probably brought a
few wares with them, making it hard to know what was purchased in Houston in the 1838 to 1842 period
vs. what was brought in separately without having multiple early household assemblages to make such
inferences.
In summary, the ceramic assemblage from F7013 is important for several reasons. This feature produced
one of the oldest ceramic assemblages of any Ball Park feature and yielded vessels discarded between
about 1838 and 1848. The sherds represent sheet refuse apparently discarded by the first occupant on this
lot and mainly before 1845. They confirm the practice of discarding broken ceramics across yard areas,
and one plate, V1, reveals that it was broken and trampled into 85 pieces. Studies of sheet-refuse ceramic
sherds from dispersed middens indicate that plates will be trampled and reduced into 80 to 100 sherds,
depending upon thickness (Moir 1997). The closeness of these reduction figures strongly suggests that
F7013 is a sealed and isolated section of domestic sheet refuse that accumulated over a seven- to 10-year
period, based upon ceramic dates. Other nonceramic artifacts from F7013 would have to be assessed to
see if they confirm this interpretation or if they suggest an alternative scenario. Regardless, the ceramic
sherds provide a unique look at an early Houston assemblage of wares from one household.
Feature 7014 (Brick Cluster)
This feature yielded 11 sherds from nine ceramic vessels. There are fragments from three plates (V1, a
transitional late whiteware/early light bluish tinted ironstone, 1840-1852?; V2, a straight rim-edged CCware/ironstone plate, ca. 1850-1861; and V3, a thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware ironstone plate with
black maker’s mark dating 1841-1851 [see Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:18]), three cups (V4, a molded and
paneled black transfer-printed cup, ca. 1840-1848; V5, a molded and everted rim light bluish tinted
ironstone cup from ca. 1845-1858; and V6, an extremely thin transitional late whiteware cup, ca. 18321844), two saucers (two examples of transitional late whiteware saucers probably from the same set and
decorated with an underglaze pinkish red design; one with a pinkish red floral hand-painted motif as V7,
and the other with only the rim band evident as V8, both ca. 1834-1844), and a hollowware vessel (V9, a
transitional late whiteware/early light bluish tinted ironstone possible pitcher or mug, 1845-1858?).
The plate with a maker’s mark is from the James Edwards pottery in Burslem, England, and is identical to
the Royal Arms example shown in Stoltzfus and Snyder (1997:18). The identifying characteristics of this
incomplete mark are the exact shape of the blackened banner under the lion (unique), the partial J A
properly positioned under the label, IRONSTONE, and the shading and design of the quartered shield’s

G.81

center in-fill. Some other nearly identically styled Royal Arms back stamps that lack the same banner
angle as the James Edwards mark were used by John Alcock (1853-1861), Samuel Alcock (before 1860),
John Meir & Sons (no narrow date given for this firm’s use of this style mark), and Anthony Shaw (center
shield motifs are different, but otherwise very close, 1851 to ca. 1860). In fact, it is better to place the
manufacture of the Edwards’ plate at ca. 1846-1851. The amount of wear on the interior of the plate
indicates that it had been heavily used by the time it was discarded. Therefore, a reasonable discard date
would be between 1851 and 1858.
The age of this small assemblage is compatible with ceramics purchased over a very broad period, from
the late 1830s to the mid 1850s. The sherds would have been discarded as sheet refuse most likely
between about 1840 and 1858. The small assemblage includes fragments from the same black transferprinted cup style that is also present in F7011 (Cat. No. 326-4) and F7018. The sherds from F7014 are
indicative of sheet refuse rather than directly discarded refuse, suggesting that this feature was sealed
sometime around 1858 and definitely before 1861. Vessels discarded before 1848 would have been used
by the Wells family (i.e., V4, V6, V7, V8, and possibly V1 and V3), and those discarded between 1849
and 1856 would have been broken by the succeeding owner (i.e., probably V5 and V9, and possibly V2).
Any vessels discarded after 1856 and up to 1865 would have been thrown away when Martin Floeck
owned the lot.
Feature 7015 (Cistern)
The small number of ceramic sherds from this feature (n=11) did not have assigned levels and were
apparently from general collections inside a cistern. The larger sherd sizes indicate debris possibly
discarded as the feature was filled, while the smaller ones are most likely sheet refuse captured in the fill
matrix. However, scuff marks on the larger sherds suggest that most of them also had been trampled.
Consequently, all of the ceramic sherds may have been discarded well ahead of the final filling of this
feature.
This feature yielded sherds from nine ceramic vessels. They include fragments from three plates (a thin
body powder blue transfer-printed whiteware plate, ca. 1836-1842; a thick blue-tinted ironstone polygonal
plate with straight rim edge, ca. 1848-1856; and a CC-ware/ironstone plate from ca. 1855-1870), one soup
plate (a medium thickness molded blue-tinted/light bluish tinted ironstone soup plate with the ‘Leaf and
Crossed Ribbon’ pattern from ca. 1858-1866, modified after Wetherbee 1980:81), four saucers (a thick
dark blue-tinted ironstone saucer with molded pattern, possibly the ‘Sharon Arch,’ available ca. 18601865 with date modified after Wetherbee 1980:79; a thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer with
molded straight rim edge and panel indents, ca. 1848-1858; a thick blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware
saucer, ca. 1850-1870?; and a dark blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer/flatware, ca. 1855-1870?), and
one pitcher (a semivitrified thick-bodied dark blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware pitcher with raised molded
design, ca. 1860-1875). The ages of these vessels are compatible with ceramics purchased in the
following two periods: (1) two vessels before 1856, and (2) the remaining seven from the 1858-1872
period. In fact, all of the vessels in the second group might have been acquired between 1865 and 1870
due to the naval blockade during the Civil War.
The powder blue transfer-printed whiteware plate from ca. 1836-1842 is comparable to a plate pattern
recovered from F7013 and was probably discarded by the Wells family. The socioeconomic status of the
household(s) discarding the seven ceramic vessels in the second group appears to have middle-class
preferences for the 1858–1868 period. Given the 1861 to 1865 trade blockade and the post-1865
depression in Texas, this indicates that the household was not impoverished by any means. Archival data
lists Martin Floeck as the owner for the 1856 to 1865 period and Andrew Dunlop as the subsequent owner
to 1882. Little more can be suggested on the basis of the ceramic vessel sherds.

A very small sherd from a burned dark blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware cup (?) was recovered from this
feature. The sherd is incomplete and has been split through the middle, leaving only one glazed side. It
probably is from a ca. 1850–1870 vessel, although this cannot be positively affirmed, and little more can
be said.
Feature 7017 (Posthole)
The only ceramic sherd from this feature was from a burned blue transfer-printed whiteware bowl or
plate. It has a powder blue transfer-printed pattern typical of ca. 1836-1844. The transfer exhibits some
dark and light blue areas and thus is two-toned in appearance. This is comparable to a bowl recovered
from F7013, but it cannot be definitively tied to either that example or the same particular set. The
precise age of the posthole is undetermined from just one ceramic sherd.
Feature 7018 (Charcoal Concentration)
Only two ceramic sherds were recovered from this feature. One is from a very thick-bodied molded and
paneled black transfer-printed light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware cup (ca.1840-1848) recovered from
Level 1. The other is nearly 25 percent of the rim section of a 10-in (26 cm) diameter blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware soup plate with an inner marly raised rim lip recovered from Level 3. Other
examples of this distinctive molded style of soup plate marly were identified in F5014 (at least four soup
plates) and also from Features 7011 and 7014 nearby. This type of plate dates from 1856-1870, based
upon similar marked examples. For example, Anthony Shaw’s pottery produced at least two plates with
this type of raised inner marly lip on patterns dated as ca. 1856-1860 (Hanging Leaves pattern, see
Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:75) and ca. 1865 (Bordered Fuchsia pattern, see Stoltzfus and Snyder
1997:29).
The thick cup sherd is probably from reworked sheet refuse captured as the feature was filled and sealed.
Other examples of this cup and its black transfer pattern were identified in Features 7014 and 7011. The
larger soup plate sherd may indicate that this feature was filled after 1860 and possibly as late as 1870.
Other artifacts may help determine the best filling date for the closure of the feature.
Feature 7019 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced 73 sherds from a diverse assortment of ceramic vessels. A minimum vessel count
suggests at least 20 ceramic vessels, with most of them discarded in the 1890s or later. There are also a
few much older redeposited sheet-refuse sherds from vessels acquired before 1860 captured in the fill of
this feature. The redeposited sherds are from vessels common in the 1830s (green cockled shell-edged
plate sherd, ca. 1828-1835) and 1840s (several sherds from a blue noncockled shell-edged plate, ca. 18401854, in Levels 2 and 3). Other pre-1860 wares include redeposited sherds from vessels comparable to
several kinds of vessels from F7013. There is also a fragment from a mid to late nineteenth-century solid
brown Bennington-type yellowware vessel in Level 1.
Much later vessels in this feature include fragments from about 16 vessels: sherds from a late revival
flow-blue vessel (ca. 1890-1905) and a light-blue transfer-printed vase or cup (ca. 1880-1895) in Level 1,
and sherds from several more 1880s-1895 cups and fragments from a semivitrified light gray-tinted
ironstone platter in Level 2 with more platter sherds in Level 3. The platter was made by Henry Alcock
and is impressed with a date code of 2/87 for February 1887. It is decorated with an overglaze
decalcomania pattern labeled ‘Parisian Porcelain’ and would have been very fashionable when acquired
in the late 1880s. The mark has England in it and is an example of the use of the country name well
before the 1891 McKinley Tariff Act required such labeling (Godden 1964:11). Godden (1964:27, Mark
No. 65) indicates that Henry Alcock used England on his marks as early as 1880. Level 4 had sherds
from a porcelain cup and a thin-bodied single inflection light bluish tinted porcelain plate with traces of
overglaze decoration possibly dating from ca. 1880-1910 (?).

G.83

Consequently, all ceramics from F7019 indicate mixed temporal contexts, with the feature itself probably
created in 1890s-1910. It captured an assortment of ceramic sherds, along with some much older
redeposited sheet refuse. The late age of this feature precluded the need to complete a full enumeration of
its ceramic vessels.
Feature 7020 (Cistern)
This feature produced only four sherds from four ceramic vessels. Therse include two porcelain
tableware vessels and two pre-1850 whiteware-variant vessels. The whiteware variants consist of a sherd
from a brown-banded late transitional whiteware/early light bluish tinted thin ironstone bowl with a broad
blue slip-applied ground (ca. 1835-1850), and a fragment from a late transitional creamware/creamcolored ware blue slip-wash bowl or cup (ca. 1830-1845). The porcelain vessels include a fragment from
light bluish tinted paneled porcelain vessel dating ca. 1845-1860, and a thin-bodied single-inflection
broad marly porcelain plate sherd with overglaze decalcomania decoration (ca. 1880-1910?). This last
vessel indicates that the feature was probably created during the very late nineteenth century and captured
some older sheet-refuse sherds in its fill. This is emphasized by the two other nonvessel ceramic sherds
bagged with the ceramic vessel material. There is a piece from a semiporcelain commode/plumbing
fixture and a fragment from a crude brown salt-glazed stoneware sewer pipe with an inner round hole,
about 3.5 in (9 cm) in diameter. These artifacts suggest that the cistern may have been filled around the
turn of the twentieth century.
Feature 7021 (Cistern Gutter)
This feature yielded 24 sherds from an estimated 18 vessels. They include ironstone/whiteware fragments
from three plates (V1 is a blue-tinted ironstone double inflection plate from ca. 1850-1870; V12 is a very
thick blue-tinted ironstone plate with impressed maker’s mark from ca. 1860-1880; and V15 is a late
transitional whiteware/early ironstone plate from ca. 1845-1860), an overglaze decalcomania light bluish
tinted ironstone/whiteware hollowware vessel (V5, ca. 1880-1895), a thin-bodied molded blue-tinted
ironstone pitcher/coffeepot (V13, ca. 1870-1890), two cups/mugs (V6 is very light bluish tinted
ironstone/whiteware teacup with handle scar, 1880-1900; and V10 is a straight based CC-ware mug sherd
from ca. 1835-1850?), two saucers (a thick-bodied blue-tinted ironstone saucer with cup ring as V16, ca.
1855-1875; and V17, a molded blue-tinted ironstone saucer from ca. 1850-1870), a light ivory tint
bowl/chamber pot (V14, ca. 1870-900?), and an unspecified vessel (V11, a medium CC-ware/ironstone
hollowware form).
The stoneware bottle sherds include pieces from a Bristol/Bristol hand thrown stoneware bottle (V7, ca.
1870-1890?), three sherds from an imported Bristol/Bristol mustard-yellow cone-topped hand thrown
stoneware bottle (V9, ca. 1840-1870?), and two sherds from an imported 4-in (9.5 cm) diameter brown
salt-glazed mineral water bottle (V18, probably German, has ‘Num’ incised in script on one sherd and
part of a circle with the letter L impressed on the other sherd, ca. 1840-1890?). Porcelain vessels include
fragments from a light bluish tinted saucer (V2, ca. 1865-1880?), a pitted glazed saucer (V3), and two
sherds from a child’s molded toy dish (V4, ca. 1860-1885?). There is also a sherd from a lead-glazed
(interior and exterior) hand-thrown redware jug (V8, ca. pre 1855?) that does not appear to have been
made in Mexico. Nonvessel sherds include a bisque doll’s neck fragment from ca. 1880 to 1900.
The age of most of the vessels are compatible with ceramics purchased between 1865 and 1895 and were
probably discarded in the 1870s or 1880s. A couple of sherds may even be from items acquired as late as
1900. In addition, a few sherds were from older captured sheet refuse and are indicative of vessels
purchased before 1860. Consequently, the ceramic vessels suggest a broad date range.
Feature 7022 (Brick Pier)
A single piece of a brown salt-glazed stoneware ceramic sewer pipe (5 in [14 cm] diameter, high fired,

G.84

Cat. No. 28-5) is the only ceramic sherd recovered from this feature. It was recovered from Level 1 and
dates post 1885 (possibly as late as 1920s).
Feature 7023 (Brick Pier)
There were no ceramic vessel sherds recovered from this feature.
Feature 7024 (Well)
This feature produced 42 ceramic sherds indicating at least 18 vessels dating mainly from the 1875 to
1900 period. Also, at least one older captured sheet-refuse sherd was recovered; it came from a large late
transitional whiteware/CC-ware waisted bowl common for the ca. 1840-1860 period (Unit 7046A, no
level listed, Cat. No. 446-1). The remaining vessels were probably discarded in the late 1880s, 1890s,
and early 1900s after the well was abandoned. The various ironstone/whitewares include a cup, two
saucers (one is 20 percent of a revival copper luster tea leaf saucer from ca. 1885-1900), three plates (one
with jigger-mold lines and another with a bright blue decal-like transfer-printed design under the glaze on
a light ivory tint whiteware), a pitcher with gold gilding, and two unspecifiable hollowware vessels. The
porcelain vessels include two cups, two saucers (one overglaze hand-painted and the other on a egg-shell
thin body), and two children’s toy dishes. Stoneware vessels include an imported Bristol/Bristol glazed
machine-made bottle and a slightly older domestic brown salt-glazed (exterior) stoneware crock with
natural clay-slipped interior from ca. 1860-1880. The late age of these vessels makes further description
of them of little use, since the feature was probably sealed sometime after 1890 but before 1905 at the
latest.
Feature 7025 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced 10 sherds from 10 vessels. All of the sherds are indicative of sheet refuse sealed in
the feature’s matrix. Most of the sherds are from the 1850s to the late 1860s, but there are also a few
older captured sheet-refuse sherds (e.g., a design spatter/spongeware saucer with a green rim band and
another red spatterware saucer both from ca. 1842-1850). The majority of the sherds suggest that this
feature was formed in the 1860s and sealed by 1870 after it had captured both contemporaneous sheet
refuse, as well as much older sherds discarded some 15 to 20 years earlier.
The feature contained ironstone/whiteware sherds from a cup (older sheet-refuse sherd from a cup, ca.
1838-1848), three plates, three saucers (two are recaptured sheet refuse as noted above), and two
unspecified hollowware vessels. One sherd from a porcelain vase (?) with relief decoration (flowers and
stems) was also recovered and possibly dates from 1840-1860. A fragment from a bisque porcelain clothbodied doll, possibly imported from Germany and dating ca. 1860-1885(?) was also recovered.
The household responsible for ceramic vessel sherds in this feature would have been Martin Floeck for
post-1856 discards, and the previous occupants for sherds discarded in the 1848 to 1855 period. Only
three vessels may have been owned by the Wells household or even the subsequent occupants, since their
usage dates span both periods. Little more can be said about this feature, based solely upon ceramic
vessel remains.
Feature 7026 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced a small but very early assemblage of ceramic vessel sherds. Eight sherds were
recovered and ar consistent with six vessels probably used together and discarded in the mid to late 1830s.
The first occupant of this lot, as noted, was James Wells, who moved there by 1838. Vessels from Level
1 include a late transitional creamware/cream-colored ware cup (V1, ca. 1830-1840, Cat. No. 279-13), a
green milled and engine-turned bowl rim sherd with a orange-brown slip wash ground below the rim (V2,
ca. 1828-1840, Cat. No. 279-14), a thin-shouldered double-inflection cream-colored ware/creamware
plate (two sherds that cross mend, V3, ca. 1825-1838, Cat. Nos. 279-10, 279-11), and a light-blue small
cockled well-incised shell-edged whiteware plate with highly curved marly profile (V4, ca. 1828-1840,

G.85

Cat. No. 279-9 and possibly 279-8). Sherds from Level 2 include a very small chip from a reliefdecorated blue edgeware cream-colored ware/late creamware plate (V5, ca. 1825-1838, Cat. No. 284-27)
and a footring with purple glaze hue from a late transitional whiteware bowl or cup (V6, ca. 1830-1840,
Cat. No. 284-28). No ceramic remains were below Level 2.
Altogether, these six vessel sherds were likely discarded as sheet refuse within the first few years that the
Wells family occupied the premises. Contents of the feature were sealed from further contamination by
1840 to 1842 at the very latest. Other feature contents may help refine these dates if other datable
remains were recovered.
Feature 7027 (Posthole)
This feature yielded 14 sherds from eight ceramic vessels. These include a porcelain bowl (ca. 18701890), an unspecified large porcelain hollowware vessel (four base sherds, ca. 1880-1900), a stoneware
jug handle (ca. 1870-1890), and a chip from a large ironstone/whiteware platter (ca. 1865-1880) from
Level 1. Level 2 produced a hand-thrown dry redware small flower pot (ca. 1880-1900?, straight rim
profile lacking the collar), a molded and paneled thick blue-tinted ironstone cup (ca. 1850-1865), a very
light bluish tinted ironstone saucer (two sherds, 1880-1900), and a blue-tinted ironstone plate sherd that
cross-mends with another sherd from Level 4 (ca. 1870-1885). The range of ceramic vessels suggests that
F7027 captured sheet-refuse sherds discarded between about 1875 and 1895, as well as one older sherd
probably discarded before 1865. This suggests that the feature was dug and probably backfilled by 1895
to 1900.
Feature 7028
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7029 (Charcoal Stain)
No ceramics vessel sherds were recovered.
Feature 7030 (Posthole)
Only two ceramic sherds from a single blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate were recovered. The plate
dates from the 1870s and could have been discarded in the 1880s and captured by this posthole anytime
after that date. The sealing of the feature probably occurred sometime after 1875; however, more items
are needed to determine a precise ending date.
Feature 7031 (Brick Alignment with Refuse)
This feature produced a modest assemblage of 14 ceramic vessels represented by 19 sherds. They include
sherds from a molded/cordoned-like mug base (ca. 1840-1860), and a blue-tinted ironstone soup plate
with molded designs (ca. 1850-1865) from surface items. Level 1 produced fragments from a thin-bodied
porcelain teacup (handle scar, 1840-1870?), a porcelain plate, a late transitional/blue-tinted ironstone
plate (ca. 1845–1855), a small chip from an imported gray stoneware (mineral water?) bottle, a handle
and body sherd from a mottled brown Bennington-type pitcher (ca. 1845-1870), a possible press molded
mineral-water bottle (ca. 1885-1910 and intrusive?), a cone-top mustard-yellow Bristol/Bristol stoneware
bottle (10 percent complete), and another mustard-yellow Bristol/Bristol stoneware bottle (three sherds).
Level 1’s nonvessel ceramic material also include a porcelain bisque doll sherd and a pressed tile with
mottled glazes (browns, yellows, and greens).
Level 2 yielded fragments from a hand-thrown German (?) mineral water bottle (ca. 1840-1870 and about
5 percent complete), a thick CC-ware/ironstone handle to a tureen (crude loop handle), a semivitrified
dark blue-tinted ironstone hollowware vessel (ca. 1850-1880; true semivitrified dark blue-tinted
ironstones have been uncommon in Ball Park ceramic assemblages), a weathered sherd from a light bluish
tinted thick bowl?/hollowware vessel (ca. 1860-1885?), and burned sherds from a thick-bodied blue-tinted

G.86

ironstone vessel (ca. 1850-1870?). Level 2 also had several nonvessel ceramic items, including a piece of
a porcelain bisque doll’s head (Cat. No. 136-1, which may be from a different level, since Lot 136 is not
listed) and a crude porcelain insulator sherd (possible early telephone/electrical insulator, ca. 18801910?).
A single burned ceramic sherd was recovered from Level 3 and came from a thick-bodied double
inflection dark blue-tinted ironstone plate (ca. 1855-1875). Most all of the ceramic vessel sherds appear
to be captured sheet refuse probably sealed in this feature by 1890 or before. A few larger sherds were
also present and they seem to be from broken vessels directly discarded after 1870. The entire
assemblage of sherds in F7031, however, was discarded over a period spanning some 40 years. The
remains come from a number of different households and would have to be separated by possible
acquisition dates. Archival information for Lot 4 lists at least five different owners between 1848 and
1870. Little more can be said about this feature, based solely upon its ceramic vessels.
Feature 7032 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced a very specialized small assemblage of ceramic refuse. It contained 93 sherds
representing at least seven broken but cross-mendable British stoneware bottles. Each is a two toned
Bristol/Bristol glazed bottle that was apparently discarded directly into this feature probably in the 1870s
or 1880s. All bottles are the same shape with a cone-top style and covered with a mustard-yellow slip
above the shoulder and a plain Bristol glazed lower section.
One has the maker’s mark:
GROSVENOR\GLASGOW impressed on the side of its base. This mark was used by Frederick
Grosvenor at his pottery in Glasgow, Scotland, between ca. 1869 and 1898 (Godden 1964:295, variant of
Mark No. 1854).
Feature 7032 also yielded an older captured sheet-refuse sherd from a brown-banded transitional late
whiteware 6-in (16 cm) diameter bowl with an orange slip-wash ground (ca. 1830-1845). It was probably
discarded in the 1840s, or by 1855 at the very latest. The sherd is also heavily stained by solvents that did
not affect any of the other ceramic sherds in this feature. This and its much older age indicate that it is
older sheet refuse captured by the feature as it filled.
The narrow range of directly discarded ceramic vessels completely dominated by imported stoneware
bottles makes one believe that the function and time span of this feature was very limited. In order to
interpret it further, all other artifacts should be considered.
Feature 7033 (Refuse Deposit)
A single sherd from a wide-mouthed stoneware bottle with interior red clay-slip was recovered from a
surface context (Cat. No. 115-1). The bottle has a diameter of 3 in (8 cm) and cannot be more finely
dated beyond ca. 1820-1870.
Feature 7034 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature yielded 10 sherds from at least four ceramic vessels. The sherds are well-trampled sheet
refuse and seem to include fireplace debris and ashes (?), since many are also burned and partially
darkened with grayish discolorations. Some of the vessels include a red transfer-printed transitional
ironstone vessel from 1845-1855, an 1870s ironstone/whiteware plate, a burned bone china (soft paste)
porcelain vessel (ca. 1845-1875), and an alkaline glazed domestic stoneware crock sherd (pre 1875).
Feature 7034 was possibly sealed by 1880 or earlier.
Feature 7035 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.

G.87

Feature 7036 (Buried Bottles)
This feature was unique and consisted of several dozen imported stoneware mineral water bottles buried
upside down to form two parallel rows or alignments. As a result, the bottles formed a landscaping
feature and the precise date they were buried cannot be narrowed any further, based upon the bottles
themselves. They could have been buried anytime between about 1845 and 1875 (Schulz et al.
1980:115). It is most likely that they were buried by a single resident, and apparently later occupants left
the bottles alone until they were eventually completely buried.
Feature Description
This feature yielded 669 ceramic sherds from a rather unique kind of cultural deposit. They represent the
shattered remains of several dozen small German mineral water bottles that had been buried upside down
in two lines, probably to mark the edges of a pathway, flower bed, or similar yardscape feature (see
F7036 discussion for more details). The whole bottles were originally about 8.5 in (21.5 cm) tall and
were broken sometime well after they had been apparently buried by subsequent construction activities on
this block since 1880. They were further crushed as the lot was cleared for the current project.
Analysis of the recovered sherds indicated that no less than 21 separate German salt-glazed stoneware
bottles were originally present when all bottle finishes/necks were counted. The highly consistent and
repetitive forms indicates that the bottles were probably from the same manufacturer and are not
examples collected over a long period of time from many different sources. All of the impressed marks
are from the same company as described below. There was also a small amount of other ceramic sheet
refuse recovered. It entailed another 17 sherds, mainly from vessels common in the 1850s to 1870s.
Overview of Ceramic Vessels Recovered
Based upon field observations, the area between the two bottle alignments apparently contained a greater
amount of brick, ash and charcoal than adjacent areas. In all, 97.5 percent of the ceramic vessel sherds
(669 of 686 sherds) are from the German stoneware bottles used to make the buried decorative
alignments. The remaining 17 ceramic sherds are from sheet refuse excavated along with the German
mineral water bottles. They include six fragments, all probably from a single British stoneware bottle
with a sharp angular shoulder (cone-topped) and Bristol/Bristol glaze with a mustard-colored iron-slipped
upper section, six fragments from six different ironstone/whiteware vessels, a late pearlware/transitional
whiteware saucer sherd, two porcelain fragments (one hard-paste vessel and one soft-paste porcelain
vessel), and two possible coarse redware sherds.
All but three of the 17 ceramic sherds are compatible with sheet-refuse associations from the ca. 1860 to
1880 period. One of the exceptions is a hand-painted blue decorated late pearlware/transitional
whiteware saucer sherd that was probably discarded in the 1835 to 1840 period and subsequently burned
(Cat. No. 176-21). The other exceptions are two coarse redware sherds from the same vessel. Both have
a purple-black sandy paste with a slight pinkish hue and a dark greenish to brownish black grainy interior
glaze, along with throwing rings, that makes them look like fragments from a possible variety of poorly
fired olive jar. But a positive identification was not possible; it could be that they are from an underfired
grade of stoneware.
German Mineral Water Bottles
A comparison of the attributes among the 669 bottle sherds reveals that they are from one distinctive type
of small German salt-glazed stoneware mineral water bottle. In all, the remains of at least 21 bottles were
counted. Fragments of more than a dozen identical seals with impressed lettering identify them as
HERZOGTHUM NASSAU mineral water bottles. This labeling refers to the western German district of
Nassau, where mineral waters were bottled and salt-glazed stoneware vessels were produced (Schultz et
al. 1980:115-117). The bottles also contain an impressed seal consisting of a double circle with a rampant
crowned lion inside the inner circle and surrounded by the word: SELTERS.

G.88

All attributes of the 21 bottles identified were either identical or close enough to indicate that the bottles
may have come from the same case or manufacturer’s lot. The impressed labels indicate that the circular
seal is stamped independently above the impressed HERZOGTHUM NASSAU label. The lack of
horizontal ribbing on the necks of these bottles, their weak shoulders, high handle attachments, and the
wide range of glaze colors suggests that they were probably made before 1880. They also exhibit double
rat-tail lower handle attachments where the handle is bifurcated and splays into a double eared type of
attachment. This attribute seems to suggest a pre-1870 date, although additional comparative data are
needed to verify this point.
Tentatively, the bottles could have been manufactured any time between ca. 1820 and ca. 1870, based
upon available data (Schultz et al. 1980:115-117). The stratigraphic relationship of the 17 other sherds to
the bottles is not precise enough to know whether they were part of the fill placed in the holes when the
bottles were buried or were simply from the surrounding, lower, culture-bearing soil horizon containing
sheet-refuse material unrelated to the buried stoneware bottles. If the ceramic material is representative of
the other artifacts recovered and if the sherds came from the fill used to seal the bottles in their holes, the
sheet-refuse ceramics indicate a ca. 1865 to 1875 burial date for the bottles.
In terms of other comparative data, two examples of similarly marked stoneware bottles were identified in
the artifacts from old Sacramento, California (Schultz et al. 1980:116). The short description of the
bottles, however, does not give their size or a photograph of their impressed seal designs. All the
publication conveys is that they were stamped with the circular “rampant lion surrounded by the word
SELTERS and labeled beneath with HERZOGTHUM NASSAU,” apparently also impressed (Schultz et
al. 1980:116). Other larger stoneware bottles are also described by Schultz et al. (1980:115-117) and held
either Dutch gin (A. Houtman & Co.) or specialty liquors (schnapps). Finally, the old Sacramento
stoneware bottles appear to be the larger sizes, ranging from 10.5-12 in (25-30 cm) tall, but are similar in
shape and manufacture to the Houston examples. The Sacramento examples held 28 to 40 oz of liquid
(about a liter), were wheel thrown, salt-glazed, and their bases revealed wire imprints made when they
were cut from the potter’s wheel by passing a wire beneath them as they turned (Schultz et al. 1980:115).
The bottles from F7036 are smaller and probably hold about a pint (0.5 liter).
Two 10.5-in (25 cm) tall German-made stoneware jugs containing Dutch gin were recovered from the
wreck of the steam boat Bertrand that sank on the upper Missouri River on April 1, 1865. Over 6,000
other bottles were also recovered in the excavations conducted in late 1960s (Switzer 1974). The material
from the wreck indicated that these particular containers were comparatively scarce among the cargo.
Seals on the two stoneware gin bottles were impressed in a style similar to the F7036 Selters seals
(Switzer 1974:14-15). In fact, they also pictured a rampant (standing) lion wearing a crown in the inner
‘circle,’ which actually appears more oval. Around the lion in the second oval is the word:
AMSTERDAMSCHE, and in a separate horizontally impressed area lower down on the side of the bottle
is: AMSTERDAM. This difference, however, separates them from the F7036 bottles presented here.
The slightly lower placement of the small handle, steepness of the shoulders, and the well-defined basal
incised cordoned line/groove seem to indicate a possible older age for the F7036 bottles than those noted
above. Consequently, a case or two of smaller Herzogthum Nassau bottles may have been purchased in
the 1845 to 1855 period, and the empty bottles subsequently used to create a decorative landscaping
design. This is speculative but may be defendable when more examples are discovered from later welldated contexts between 1860 and 1880 that reveal differences.

G.89

Interpretive Summary
Feature 7036 yielded a group of ceramic bottles in a rare in situ buried archeological context. Empty saltglazed stoneware bottles from a single brand of imported German seltzer water were used to create a
curbing or edging decorative treatment in the yard. The placement of the bottles seems most compatible
with a small walkway or special landscaping area. The use of only one bottle style and the identical
nature of the bottles probably indicate that they were set in a single brief episode. The wide range of
firing effects and glazing colors, however, suggests that singleness in appearance other than size and
shape was not necessary. Excavators noted that the handles were oriented in similar cardinal positions
depending upon which row they occupied. There was a suggestion that nails had been placed through the
handles of several recovered specimens. All of the other associated ceramic sherds (n=17 sherds)
represented sheet refuse discarded mostly after 1860s, with the exception of a very early ca. 1835-1840
discarded saucer and an undatable coarse earthenware jar or jug (possible olive jar?).
The precise orientation of each bottle, combined with their identical German brand, suggests that the
person who placed them in the ground preferred to organize them in a structured manner. While it is
inappropriate to stereotype such endeavors, the bottles and their placements may be indicative of a
western European folk belief (e.g., German, Swiss, etc.). In fact, they may have special significance from
a folk culture viewpoint worthy of further research. The bottles were probably buried soon after enough
empties were available to begin the work. The suggested age for the burial of the bottles is most likely
pre 1860, although confirming evidence is not available. Their small size and the nearly two dozen
identical examples suggest either a well-to-do household with income to spare or possibly a special
necessity for their contents. In either case, the family was well off enough to be able to afford purchasing
them apparently all at once. It is unlikely, but also not impossible, that empty bottles were obtained from
elsewhere and only buried on this block. However, one would expect different sizes and brands if that
were so.
Preliminary archival information indicates that Joseph Mueller (a.k.a. Muller or Miller) acquired the
property, Lot 3, in 1848, where F7036 was subsequently located. Mueller died soon thereafter, and Lot 3
was transferred to his widow, Florine Mueller. Mrs. Mueller was born in 1804 in France; in 1850, her son
Isador, age 17, was living on the premises with her. He is listed as a blacksmith by occupation on the
1850 census. Isador Mueller purchased Lot 3 from his mother in December 1854 and then sold it to
William Anders in January 1856, along with Lots 1 and 2. Anders sold it to Felix Goetzman in December
1857, while retaining a lien on the premises. Goetzman sold Lot 3 to Louis Harde in August 1859, and
Harde retained the property up through the 1870s and beyond. Louis Harde was apparently a European
immigrant born about 1831 and whose wife was from Sicily and domestic servant from Saxony.
Consequently, there are several potential immigrant families that could have buried these bottles.
Without finer dating, we can only surmise who may have actually done so. Whether the bottles served
merely a decorative function or had some special powers according to folk beliefs and folk rituals cannot
be ascertained, based solely upon the ceramic information.
Feature 7037 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced only one ceramic sherd from a mineral water bottle, possibly like the German
bottles noted in F7036 (Cat. No. 119-20). It can only be dated broadly to the ca. 1840-1880+ (?) period,
since the sherd lacked any other diagnostic attributes.
Feature 7038 (Brick Scatter)
Nine sherds representing four ceramic vessels were recovered from this feature. Eight of the sherds were
from surface contexts and only one was from Level 1. The vessels represented by fragments include two
Bristol/Bristol glazed stoneware bottles (one is 15 percent of a mustard-yellow-colored rounded or
sloping shouldered bottle from possibly ca. 1850 to ca. 1880?), a solid brown molded Bennington-type
vessel (ca. 1840-1860) and a molded blue-tinted ironstone plate from 1845-1865. This very small group

G.90

of sherds represents occupational debris or sheet refuse probably discarded in the late 1850s or 1860s,
unless other artifacts indicate a broader time frame.
Feature 7039 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature produced 14 sherds representing 11 vessels from two levels. Level 1 yielded eight sherds
from the following five ceramic vessels: a blue-tinted single inflection transitional ironstone plate (ca.
1860-1870?), a light bluish tinted ironstone/CC-ware plate (ca. 1850-1865?), a semivitrified blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware thin-bodied cup (ca. 1840-1860?), a thin transitional late whiteware/early tinted ware
cup (ca. 1835-1848?), and 20 percent of a Bristol/Bristol glazed stoneware bottle (non-sheet-refuse) with
a mustard-yellow slipped upper section and a cone-topped angular shoulder (ca. 1840-1880?). Level 2
produced sheet-refuse fragments from a dark purple floral transfer-printed blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware plate (ca. 1845-1855), a light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware saucer (ca. 18801890?), a possible early transitional ironstone/whiteware chamberpot (ca. 1832-1845), an early
transitional ironstone/whiteware footringless plate/platter (ca. 1840-1850), a late ironstone/whiteware
cup? (ca. 1875-1890?), and a yellowware bowl (ca. 1860-1880?).
The broad range of ages for ceramic vessels from F7039 indicates that the feature captured sheet-refuse
sherds from the 1840s, 1850s, 1860s, and 1880s. However, over half of the vessels were probably
discarded before 1860, supporting the premise that later ceramic sheet refuse was replaced by more
frequent carting off the premises.
Feature 7040 (Refuse Deposit)
This feature yielded five sherds from four vessels. These include a red transfer-printed thick ironstone
bowl (ca. 1845-1855), a blue slipwashed/banded bowl (ca. 1845-1855), a pattern-molded ironstone vessel
(ca. 1850-1865), and a Bristol/Bristol glazed stoneware bottle (post 1840). Altogether, the ceramic sherds
suggest that F7040 may have been sealed in the late 1850s or 1860s if they are also representative of the
other artifacts recovered. Little more can be said about this feature, based solely upon the ceramic
vessels.
Feature 7041
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7042 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7043 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7044 (Posthole)
This feature produced two sherds from an eggshell-thin porcelain cup. The cup has a very thin graybodied paste and was gilded along the rim. It could possibly be from the ca. 1890 to 1920 period,
although an unquestionable confirmation was not possible.
Feature 7045 (Cistern Gutter)
This feature yielded 32 sherds representing ten vessels. Only parts of one vessel, V1, were recovered
from Level 1. It is a thin slightly cockled/notched late transitional whiteware/light bluish tinted
whiteware 9-in (23 cm) diameter plate with a curved marly from ca. 1832-1842. Three sherds from it
were recovered from Level 1, and nine more from Level 2, altogether making about 12 percent of the
plate. The remaining nine vessels were all recovered from Level 2. The sherds include fragments from a
molded and paneled bluish white porcelain cup with a pedestal base (V2, ca. 1840-1860), a blue willow
ironstone platter with a wire-cut base (V3, ca. 1838-1850; see also Unit 7042 and also Lot 441 in F7005),

G.91

a molded blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate or bowl (V4, ca. 1845-1865), a black transfer-printed
wavy rim transitional ironstone/whiteware plate (V5, ca. 1832-1842), a cranberry red two-tone (dark and
light shades) transfer-printed wavy rim transitional ironstone/whiteware plate (V6, ca. 1838-1848), a
blue-tinted ironstone/whiteware plate with a broad footring (V7, ca. 1840-1855), a greenish blue-tinted
ironstone/whiteware cup/bowl (V8, ca. 1840-1850), a burned double-curved large bowl (V9, ca. 18351845), and nine sherds from a hand-thrown lead glazed redware storage jar with a red sandy paste and an
incised line near the shoulder (V10, ca. 1830-1845?, unique looking paste/glaze).
Ceramic sherds in this feature appear to represent comparatively early sheet refuse captured by the feature
when it was sealed about 1848 to 1850. The vessels represent ceramic wares belonging to the Wells
household (ca. 1838-1848, V1, V3, V5, V6, V9, and possibly V10) and a subsequent occupant (V4) when
the renters occupied the lot. Vessels V2, V7, and V8 could have belonged to either occupant. The cistern
gutter was probably constructed by the renters near the beginning of their period of occupation of the
premises. Apparently when the trench was back-filled, soil was pushed into the trench that contained
sheet refuse from the prior 10 to 12 years of occupation. This, of course, assumes that the ceramic sherds
are also representative of all other artifacts in the fill.
Feature 7046 (Posthole)
This feature produced two ceramic sherds from a late transitional hand-painted flow-blue ironstone plate
or platter. The sherds cross-mended and are from a vessel common for the ca. 1825-1835 period.
Consequently, the platter was probably brought to this lot by the Wells family in 1838.
Feature 7047 (Posthole)
This posthole yielded 10 sherds from six ceramic vessels. All but one of the vessels consist of fragments
in the size range of sheet refuse. The exception is V1 with four cross-mended sherds that make up 25-30
percent of a molded floral pattern blue-tinted ironstone saucer with a 6 in (16 cm) diameter. The saucer’s
sherds were mainly from Level 2 (Cat. Nos. 316-11, 316-16, 316-17, 281-1) with a cross mend to a sherd
from Level 1 (Cat. No. 281-1). The saucer has a British pattern registration mark for April 12, 1861,
indicating the date that its molded pattern was accepted for copyright protection by the Patent Office in
London, England. It also shows lots of wear and some fire damage and, therefore, was probably
discarded by 1865. The other five vessels include a unique banded/annular blue and white vessel (V2, ca.
1850-1860, Cat. No. 325-4), a molded blue-tinted ironstone saucer (V3, ca. 1848-1860, Cat. No. 316-14),
a plain rim blue-tinted ironstone saucer/dish (V4, ca. 1848-1860, Cat. Nos. 316-12, 316-13), a late
transitional ironstone/whiteware saucer with purple glaze hues (V5, ca. 1840-1850, Cat. No. 316-15), and
a different molded pattern blue-tinted ironstone saucer/dish with an everted rim (V6, ca. 1848-1860, Cat.
No. 266-4). As these descriptions reveal, five of the six vessels are saucers or saucer-type dishes.
The six ceramic vessels from this feature point to a comparatively narrow sheet-refuse accumulation date
falling within the ca. mid 1850s-mid 1860s. The dated saucer indicates that it was directly deposited in
the posthole after 1861, and the extent of wear on it suggests that it had been used intensively for at least
several years or more. Consequently, this hole was probably excavated in the mid 1860s and back-filled
with soil containing a narrow range of sheet refuse. Most likely, it was probably dug in the 1863-1866
period.
Feature 7048
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7049 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.

Feature 7050 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7051 (Post Support)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7052 (Brick Pier)
This feature produced five large sherds from two ceramic vessels. One is a molded ironstone saucer from
ca. 1850-1868, and the other is a thick ironstone plate common for the ca. 1855-1870 period. Both
vessels were probably discarded in the 1860s and the feature was sealed or back-filled by about 1870 or
1872.
Feature 7053 (Posthole)
This feature produced a single sherd from a blue-tinted/light bluish tinted ironstone/whiteware cup. It
representsabout 30 percent of the 3-in (8 cm) diameter cup that stood about 3 in (8-8.5 cm) tall. The
shape of the cup places it ca. 1878-1890. The large size of the sherd suggests that it may have been
tossed directly into this feature, indicating that the feature was sealed in the 1880s or early 1890s.
Feature 7054 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7055 (Posthole)
This feature yielded two sherds from two ceramic vessels. One is a CC-ware/ironstone chamber pot
probably from the ca. 1845-1865 period, and the other is a blue-tinted/light bluish tinted
ironstone/whiteware molded dish or bowl common for the 1850-1865 period. If these two ceramic
vessels are representative of the other material in this feature, it may have been sealed by about 1860 to
1865.
Feature 7056
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.
Feature 7057 (Privy)
This feature was identified as a wood-lined privy pit. It yielded 12 sherds that account for parts of only
two ceramic vessels. Eleven sherds are from an imported stoneware mineral water bottle and one sherd is
from an ironstone/whiteware flatware vessel probably from ca. 1850-1875. Consequently, the feature did
not receive much ceramic vessel refuse and was probably sealed in the 1860s or 1870s, if these sherds are
representative of the other artifacts in the privy.
Feature 7064 (Posthole)
No ceramic vessel sherds were recovered from this feature.

APPENDIX I
GEOARCHEOLOGICAL DATA
Frederick Pearl

I.1

Eleven geologic cores were taken by Weston Engineering in preparation for the Ball Park at Union
Station Project, Houston, Texas. These cores were examined and analyzed prior to excavation of
archeological materials on the project location. The 11 cores were scattered beneath the footprint of the
stadium: SBO2, SB03, SBO4, SBO5, SBO7, SBO8, SB09, SB1O, MWO1, MWO2, and MWO3.
None of the cores exhibited evidence of significant subsurface disturbance. There were no lithologic
discontinuities or other unconformities. With the exception of Core 8 (SB08), each core was of a clay or
clay loam. Although some were more indurated than others, it was expected that excavation and
screening would be difficult and even problematic. The clays were of two varieties: black to brown with
gleying, and olive to yellow with redoxomorphic features. Gleying is color change in soil due to
anaerobic conditions. Redoxomorphic features, such as red or yellow mottles, result from repeated drying
and wetting of iron-rich sediments.
Wheeler (1976) designates the Project Area as urban land (Ur), with no soil descriptions given. At a
larger scale, the Houston area is situated in a soils area called the Lake Charles-Bernard Association.
Soils in this association are described as having very dark gray clay or clay loam epipedons, and gray clay
endopedons. These soils are known for their vertic properties, such as slickensides and gilgal relief.
The descriptions in Wheeler (1976) are consistent with those noted in field observations, suggesting that
these sediments are not severely disturbed. The very dark cores look similar to delta, lagoon, and
bottomland deposits observed elsewhere in Harris County. The depositional environment appears to be
made of ponded or sluggish floodplain sediments. Nearby Buffalo Bayou is the most likely source for
these sediments.
Most of the cores examined had less than 10 cm of surface disturbance. Although these cores made a
poor sample of the total surface area of the Project Area, soils have a high degree of lateral extensibility,
and these cores are probably indicative of what to expect while excavating across the site. Generally,
there appears to have been very little grading or other surface modifications prior to later construction.
Features, such as pits, privies, and pilings, are easily discernible from the clayey matrix, although water
should be expected to have collected in these features even if otherwise filled with debris and other
sediments. Mottling appears to be the result of natural oxidation and reduction processes.
Core Descriptions
Each of the cores is herein described in limited terms. Each horizon includes its thickness, measured in
centimeters below surface, texture, color, and boundary, as well as any other information that could be
determined in the field. Core analysis is not conducive to structure and ped analyses, so these are not
presented. In addition, some of the core descriptions differ from standard soils descriptions in that their
horizon designations are presented only in general terms. In these cases, there was not enough
information to properly classify the soils.

Description
depth and integrity is not preserved; appears to be a range of clays similar to Core 1;
some distinctly ‘unnatural’ mottling of indeterminate origin at the top of the core;
reminiscent of ‘privy’ material seen on other sites; the hope for this seems low because
it is only at the surface; reddish yellow/brown mottle is a ‘g1ob,’ approximately 5 cm
thick; core is otherwise nearly black, while the lower portions give way to yellow; black
might be petrochemicals
