ABSTRACT
On December 15, 2015, aci consulting conducted a cultural resource survey for the
Kensington Detention and Channel Improvements Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The project consists of regional stormwater detention pond and channel repairs for the
tributary known as Dry Branch Tributary 1 traversing through the Kensington Place
Neighborhood. The goal of the stormwater detention facility is to reduce the frequency
of flooding in the vicinity of the intersection of Gattis School Road and Greenlawn and to
reduce the erosive velocities through Dry Branch Tributary 1. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) consists of the approximate 20-acre (8-hectare) area of the existing detention
pond, channel, and three drop structures downstream.
The survey did not result in the locat ion of any new archeological sites, historic
structures, or addit ional historic propert ies. Based on these results, no further
archeological work is recommended. Records from this investigat ion will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as Principal Invest igator.

INTRODUCTION

On December 15, 2015, aci consulting conducted a cultural resource survey for the
Kensington Detention and Channel Improvements Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The project consists of regional stormwater detention pond and channel repairs for the
tributary known as Dry Branch Tributary 1 traversing through the Kensington Place
Neighborhood. The goal of the stormwater detention facility is to reduce the frequency
of flooding in the vicinity of the intersection of Gattis School Road and Greenlawn and
to reduce the erosive velocities through Dry Branch Tributary 1. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) consists of the approximate 20-acre area (8-hectare) of the existing
detention pond, channel, and three drop structures downstream.
The project will be funded through the City of Round Rock, thus the project is
conducted in compliance with the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) as well
as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for any
additional compliance for impacts to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) potentially
regulated waters. The investigation will consist of an intensive pedestrian survey,
shovel testing, site recording, assessment of sites for listing on the national Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), data
analysis, and reporting in accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archaeologists
(CTA) standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1
Physiography
The project area is located in central Texas in the East Central Texas Plains, east of the
Balcones Escarpment, which is a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low
relief to the east and south. The topography to the west of the Balcones Escarpment,
the Balcones Canyonlands, is hilly and characterized by the presence of springs, karstic
since, caves, and rock shelters. The topography of the East Central Texas Plains is
categorized by irregular plains with acidic soils along the parallel ridges and valleys,
sandy and sandy loam soils on the uplands, and clay and clay loams occupy the lowlying areas (Griffith et al. 2004). Elevation increases gradually from southeast to
northwest. The project area is within the “Post Oak Woods/Forest” designation, as
noted on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Vegetation Types of Texas map (McMahan et al.
1984).
2.2
Geology and Soils
The surface geology of the APE is mapped as Austin chalk (Kau): chalk and marl; chalk
mostly microangular calcite with minor Foraminifera tests and inoceramus prisms,
averages about 85% calcium carbonate, ledge forming grayish white to white;
alternates with marl, bentonitic seams locally recessive, medium gray; pyrite nodule
common, weather to limonite; thickness 325-420 feet (USGS 2015).
The soils within the APE are mapped primarily as Austin silty clay. The Austin series
consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that
formed in residuum weathered from chalk. These soils are on nearly level to sloping
erosional uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent (NRCS 2015). In eastern portions of
the project area, the Austin-Whiteright complex and Heiden clay are also mapped. The
Heiden series consists of deep and very deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly
permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from mudstone. These
nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on footslopes of base slopes, shoulders of
interfluves, and backslopes of side slopes of ridges on dissected plains. Slopes range
from 0.5 to 20 percent (NRCS 2015).
The soils are upland soils that formed in situ and are likely eroded. There is also an
existing detention pond and channel within the APE, so the soils have been disturbed.
Backhoe trenching will not be necessary.

REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURE CHRONOLOGY

3.1
Prehistoric Background
The property falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a synthesis of
Central Texas archeology in which he divides the prehistory of Central Texas into three
periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these
is further divided into subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as Before
Present or BP in Table 1.

4,000-1,200 BP
1,200-500 BP
500 BP +

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP (Collins
1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger, regional cultural
horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis and Folson are two cultures that existed within the
Paleoindian Period. Clovis sites record a general hunter-gatherer lifeway based upon a
wide variety of fauna including large herbivores as well as smaller animals. Evidence of
plant resources is less common, but it is presumed that local flora were also important
to subsistence. In contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon big game
hunting. The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and Archaic
in that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as those
associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem more
similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic (Collins 1995:383-385) sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the
use of heated rock in hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters. The period as a whole is
defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in
comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist)
in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late Archaic to xeric (relatively dry) during
the Middle Archaic and beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic times

is centered on the live-oak savanna, while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes may
have occurred during xeric intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2
Historic Background
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries when Spanish explorers traveled through
the region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De
León followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the
1680s, and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy
Creek and the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French
explorer, and Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through
the area and camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They
named them Arroyo do las Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In
1721, the Marques de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions
through present-day Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions.
In the mid-eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established along the San
Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753 drought and
disease made the missions uninhabitable, and Spanish influence in the area declined
(Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In 1835
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his
company of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters
of Brushy Creek in southwestern Williamson County. Tumlinson Fort, as it was called,
was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838 Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenney’s Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. However, Indian attacks
were a frequent problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by
Indians. By 1846 the Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In
1848 the Texas legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert
Williamson, a Milam County Judge and state senator (Odintz 2002).

By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half. During the
1850s and 1860s, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the county.
Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat, the bulk of the
county remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived on subsistence
farms in log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s, the slave
population increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became more
diverse. Wheat and corn were the predominant crops in the Blackland prairies, and
cattle and sheep ranching was widespread throughout the county. Cotton was
introduced in the 1850s, but it was not a significant cash crop (Odintz 2002).
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War but picked up again in
the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by the Chisholm trail, which was established
in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through or
originated in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s were also marked by the arrival
of railroads to Williamson County (Odintz 2002).
By the early twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry in
importance. With the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy
developed. As late as 1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By
1890 43 percent of the farms were worked by owners, and by 1930 only 29 percent of
the farms were worked by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the
Great Depression (Odintz 2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by
nearly half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and
sheep, poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country
and vice versa. The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend
schools outside of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s,
Rock House School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the

school boasted a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was
consolidated with Liberty Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had
become a dispersed agricultural community (Odinzt 2002).
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population
of Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700. A
pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land also intensified
following World War II. Austin, Georgetown, and Liberty Hill grew rapidly (Odintz
2002).

LITERATURE REVIEW

A literature review of the THC Archeological Sites Database (the Atlas) revealed that no
previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted and no previous archeological
sites have been recorded within the APE. A survey along I-35 in 1985 was conducted
within one kilometer of the APE but did not result in the location of any new
archeological sites in the area. One archeological site has been previously recorded
within one kilometer (.6 mile) of the APE (Table 2; Figure 4). Site 41WM981 consists of
an historic wooden barn and limestone water through with an ephemeral scatter of
historic artifacts. The site was recorded in 2000 by Hicks and Company for the Loop 1
survey (Feit and Griffith 2001), and has since been officially determined ineligible for
listing on the NRHP.

FIELD METHOD

A pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological sites or other
historical properties that may be adversely affected by construction. The pedestrian
survey was conducted within the entire APE, but focusing primarily on the boundary of
the retention pond as this area seemed to not have been previously excavated during
the construction of the existing detention pond (see Figures 1 and 2).
The pedestrian survey was augmented by shovel testing. Shovel tests were excavated
in settings where the ground surface visibility is less than 30 percent and the soil
appeared to be intact. The tests were excavated one foot (30 centimeters) in diameter
to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible. The depth of Holocene deposits varies
extensively depending on landform. The shovel tests were dug in 4 inch (10 centimeter)
levels, and the excavated sediments will be screened through ¼-inch (.63-centimeter)
hardware cloth unless high clay or water content requires that the material be troweled
through or sorted by hand. Shovel tests were recorded on logs and the locations of the
tests were recorded on a GPS unit. Other field forms include a daily journal and
photograph log.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

The survey was conducted under pleasant conditions in the morning, under a cloudy
sky, with a light breeze. Survey started at the northern end of the APE as it runs along
Dell Way. The current APE sits adjacent to the Dell campus to the north and east sides
and a commercial business park to the west. The topography consisted of mostly lowlying wetland area and an intersecting creek with primary and secondary terraces along
the edge of the APE (Figures 5 and 6). The majority of the APE has been previously
disturbed by the construction of the existing retention pond.
The ground surface visibility in this area was good, averaging about 30 percent. The soil
consisted primarily of clay with calcium carbonate inclusions. Shovel tests were placed
on either side of the APE in two locations where the soil appeared to be intact (Figure
9). The shovel test on the west side of the pond revealed fill material to a depth of one
meter. The shovel test on the east side revealed intact Austin series soils with a solum
to a depth of about 70 centimeters below surface. This area was a small strip of level
land on the east bank between the existing pond and the Dell Campus parking lot
(Figure 5). No artifacts were observed on the surface or in either shovel test, nor were
any cultural material encountered during the survey.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On December 15, 2015, aci consulting conducted a cultural resource survey for the
Kensington Detention and Channel Improvements Project in Williamson County, Texas.
The project consists of regional stormwater detention pond and channel repairs for the
tributary known as Dry Branch Tributary 1 traversing through the Kensington Place
Neighborhood. The goal of the stormwater detention facility is to reduce the frequency
of flooding in the vicinity of the intersection of Gattis School Road and Greenlawn and
to reduce the erosive velocities through Dry Branch Tributary 1. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) consists of the approximate 20-acre (8-hectare) area of the existing
detention pond, channel, and three drop structures downstream.
The investigat ion consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by shovel testing (n=2),
and did not result in the locat ion of new or previously recorded archeological sites, nor
any other historic propert ies. Based on these results, no further archeological work is
recommended. It must be noted that no level of survey intensity can be guaranteed to
locate all cultural features within a project area. Therefore, should previouslyunrecorded cultural resources, including human remains, be discovered during the
course of construct ion for this project, the City of Round Rock or K. Friese and
Associates will contact a qualified professional archeologist to assess the findings.
