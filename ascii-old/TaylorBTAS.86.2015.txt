The Midland Calvarium and the Early Human
Habitation of the Americas
Matthew S. Taylor

ABSTRACT
Craniometric analysis of Paleoindian human crania from North and South America has raised vital questions
concerning the initial human settlement of the New World. Most researchers have reported a cranial morphology
distinct from that of more recent American Indian populations. Paleoindian crania exhibit a generalized morphology that some researchers have likened to recent Melanesians, Australians, and other Pacific populations.
In this report, the calvarium from the Midland site (dated to 11,600 B.P.) is remeasured and compared with data
from South American Paleoindians and world-wide cranial data collected by W.W. Howells. Morphometric
analysis reveals that the Midland calvarium is most similar to modern Japanese and several prehistoric Pacific
Rim populations. This finding is consistent with recent DNA analysis and previous work on Paleoindian morphometrics. The evidence from the Midland calavarium also lends support to the hypothesis that the Americas
were originally settled by at least two morphologically diverse populations.

INTRODUCTION
The initial human habitation of the Americas
is one of the major issues in American archeology
(Dillehay 2009). The traditional interpretation for
early human settlement is that a relatively small
population of hunter-gatherers migrated over
land across the Bering Strait from northeast Asia
(Haynes 2005). Other hypotheses have suggested
maritime migrations along the coastlines (Fladmark 1979). The timing and speed of these migrations has been debated (Hamilton and Buchanan
2007), but the best evidence suggests humans
inhabited North America by at least 13,500 years
ago (Pitblado 2011; Lepper 2014).
The physical remains of Paleodindians have
helped to shed light on human migration to the
Americas. Craniometrics, DNA analysis, dental
nonmetrics, and biological surveys of extant Native American populations have been employed to
decipher the origins and migration patterns of the
earliest Americans. However, the number of human
remains that date to the Paleoindian period is quite
small (Lepper 2014). Data from every individual
is an invaluable resource and as much information
as possible should be reported.
The purpose of this article is to present new
information for craniometric studies of the first

Americans. Previously unpublished data from a
Paleoindian individual from the Scharbauer (Midland) site is compared with individuals of Paleoindian date. This data is also compared to W.W.
Howells’ collection of world-wide craniometric
variation. The results of this analysis are then
evaluated in light of current theories regarding the
first human habitation of the New World.
BACKGROUND
According to various studies (Hubbe et al.
2007; Jantz and Spradley 2014; Neves et al. 2005;
Powell and Steele 1992; Steele and Powell 1992,
1999), cranial remains of Paleoindian date exhibit morphology somewhat divergent from what
is typical for late prehistoric and modern Native
Americans. Neves and coworkers (2003) have
observed that recent Native Americans resemble
northeastern Asians, while Paleoindians have a
generalized morphology more similar with Australians, Melanesians, and Africans. Other researchers
have drawn comparisons between Paleoindians and
the prehistoric Jomon of Japan (Brace et al. 2014).
Although the meaning of these differences is a
source of discussion (see Gill 2014; Owsley and
Jantz 2001; Swedlund and Anderson 1999, 2003),

craniometric analysis can provide useful information on the population history of the Americas.
In both North and South America, the number of
human remains that date to the Paleoindian time
period is relatively small (Neves et al. 2005).
Therefore, detailed data from each available specimen is important for increasing the sample size and
improving the statistical power of analyses.
Recently, DNA was extracted from a Clovisera individual (Anzick-1) from Montana. Researchers determined that the genome of this individual
is closely related to modern American Indians
(Rasmussen et al. 2014). This interpretation is
consistent with genetic studies of recent Native
Americans (Kemp and Schurr 2010) and DNA
analysis of coprolites dating to the Paleoindian
period (Gilbert et al. 2008). However, Rasmussen and coworkers (2014) found evidence that an
ancient population split had occurred before the
Clovis period. One of these lineages remained in
the northern part of the Americas while the other is
found in South America (Rasmussen et al. 2014).
Skeletal evidence for this proposed split was documented by Stojanowski and coworkers (2013), who
noticed a clear morphological distinction between
North and South American Paleoindians.
To explain the dichotomy between North and
South American samples, Neves and coworkers
(2005) have suggested a “two-main biological
components model.” They hypothesize that two
early populations with different cranial morphologies settled the Americas. This idea has been discussed by Gill (2014), who postulated that the two
components came to the Americas by different
routes. One, featuring a cranial morphology similar to the modern Ainu and Polynesians, migrated
by boat and entered the continents from the sea.
The second population, which reflected a more
“typical” Native American morphology, crossed
over Beringia by land and into the Americas. The
similarity between Ainu and Polynesian crania with
the earliest Paleoindians does not mean they have a
direct connection to either group. Rather, the Ainu,
Polynesians, and Paleoindians may share a common ancestry (Jantz and Spradley 2014).
ARCHEOLOGICAL CONTEXT
In 1953, vocational archeologist Keith Glasscock found human skeletal remains exposed by
wind erosion near Monahans Draw (Wendorf et

al. 1955:4) south of the city of Midland, Texas
(Figure 1). Archeological salvage excavations were
conducted by Fred Wendorf (Museum of New
Mexico), Alex Krieger (University of Texas), and
Jack Hughes (Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum). Artifacts included Paleoindian stone tools,
Early Holocene faunal remains, and the fragmentary
bones of a single human (Wendorf et al. 1955). The
artifacts from the Midland site were scattered across
five localities over a small dunefield. The human
remains were found in Locality 1, a “blowout” or
deflation basin, along Monahans Draw (Wendorf et
al. 1955). Among the artifacts recovered at the site
was a new type of dart point subsequently classified as a Midland point. These points, essentially
unfluted Folsom points, have generated considerable
interest and debate among archeologists (Agogino
1969; Bousman et al. 2004).
The site location is near the southern edge of
the Llano Estacado, a semi-arid, flat, nearly featureless plain that is found in northwestern Texas
and eastern New Mexico (Wendorf 1961). The surface geology of the Midland site is the Blackwater
Draw Formation, which is characterized by Pleistocene eolian deposits. The local area is heavily
modified by dunes, eastward flowing intermittent
streams, and by occasional seasonal lakes, known
locally as “playas” (Holliday 1989, 1995).
Based upon site stratigraphy and uranium
series dating, Wendorf and Krieger (1959:77-78)
suggested that the skeleton may date to as early as
20,000 years Before Present (B.P.), but probably
between 13,400 and 10,000 B.P. After a reanalysis
of the Midland site and a new geoarcheological
survey of the locality, Holiday and Meltzer (1996;
see also Holiday 1997:102) suggested that the
skeleton dated (at the eldest) to the Folsom period.
Direct dating of the remains by U-series methods
produced an average date of 11,600 ± 800 years
B.P. (McKinney 1992).
The human remains from the Midland site
were first examined by T. Dale Stewart (1955) of
the Smithsonian Institution. Stewart reconstructed
the skull and completed a standard osteological
analysis. He concluded that the remains represented an adult female around 30 years of age at death.
Stewart reported that the cranium was notably long
and narrow, unlike those observed from later periods of North American prehistory. However, he
pointed out that the dilochocrany of the Midland
cranium was morphologically similar to Archaic
and Late Prehistoric remains found in other parts

of Texas, particularly those from the Lower Pecos
(near the junction of the Pecos and Devils Rivers
with the Rio Grande) and Big Bend regions (Stewart 1935, 1955). The “Paleoindian” morphology of
later Texas hunter-gatherer populations was also
commented on by Neumann (1952), who suggested
it was evidence of biological continuity from the
first human inhabitants of the Americas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The state of preservation of the Midland individual restricts the number of observable measurements. The cranial remains consist of a calvarium,
with the base and face missing or represented
by small fragments. Measurements were taken
from the Midland calvarium (Figure 2) following
Howells (1973, 1989). The calvarium displayed

no evidence of artificial modeling or post-mortem
taphonomic deformation. A total of 20 measurements was taken from the remains. Some of these
measurements had previously been recorded by
Stewart (1955), but new, previously unreported
data is presented in Table 1.
Midland can only be compared statistically
with other females because of sexual dimorphism.
Craniometric measurements between females and
males are significantly different (Franklin et al.
2005; Giles and Elliot 1963). Inclusion of males
in the sample would fatally skew the results.
Therefore, well-documented male crania, such as
Kennewick Man, are excluded from this analysis.
Midland was compared to a data set of female
Paleoindian crania from North and South America.
In the North American sample, only data from
Midland and a female individual found at Pelican
Rapids, Minnesota, could be employed. Pelican

Rapids was selected because the published raw
data contained enough variables to compare with
Midland. The number of female Paleoindians in
North America is tiny and, often, published reports
do not include every possible observable measurement. The South American sample was much larger
and included individuals found at several sites in
Brazil (Table 2).
The data from Midland was then compared
with W.W. Howells data representing world-wide
craniometric variation (1989). Howells’ samples
and their geographic origin are listed in Table 3.
Average cranial measurements from early South
American crania employed in the first round of
analysis were added to Howells’ database for
comparative purposes. Only female crania were selected for analysis. Craniometric data was analyzed
via Mahalanobis distance analysis using SPSS
version 22. Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis
1936) is a robust statistic for evaluating biological
distance. Raw data is transformed into standardized
uncorrelated scores, which takes into account the
scale of the data. It neutralizes any potential bias
of correlated traits by using the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of cranial measurements.
(De Maesschalck et al. 2000). Results were illustrated with dendrograms using hierarchical cluster
analysis with average linkage between groups.
Average linkage between groups is expressed in a
dendrogram by determining the average similarity
between cases (via squared Euclidean distance).
RESULTS
The measurements taken from the Midland
cranium are listed in Table 1. These measurements
include those previously published by Stewart
(1955) and new ones recorded by the author. A total
of 10 variables were selected for comparison with

Paleoindian female crania (Table 4) and Howell’s
data for world-wide female cranial variation (see
Table 3). Table 5 contains the Mahalanobis matrix
calculated from the Paleoindian sample. Tables 6a
and b show the Mahalanobis matrix for the Howells
data set.
Figure 3 illustrates the results of the Mahalanobis calculations comparing Midland with female
Paleoindians. Not surprisingly, the two North
American individuals are most similar to each
other. However, there is close affinity with several
of the South American individuals.
Figure 4 is a dendrogram comparing the Midland and South American crania with Howells’
world-wide data. Midland and the South American Paleoindians (PaleoSA) are broadly grouped
with other North American samples (Santa Cruz,
Eskimo) but also show affinity with some African
(Bushmen) and East Asian (Atayal, South Japan)
samples.
DISCUSSION
One of the major problems of Paleoindian
skeletal research is that low sample sizes may
fatally bias statistical analysis. Small samples
are inherently problematic for scientific research
(Hoyle 1999). Neves et al. (2005) have advocated
a strategy of comparing several isolated individuals
from different geographic areas in order to mitigate
any potential error. Analysis of the Midland individual adds another source of data for the shallow
pool that represents the Paleoindian sample. Based
upon various studies of Paleoindian remains from
across the Americas, the original human settlers
possessed a generalized cranial morphology distinct from later generations of Native Americans
(Hubbe et al. 2004; Jantz and Spradley 2014). The
measurements from Midland are consistent with

the hypothesis that Paleoindians possessed a morphology representing a real biological entity, rather
than statistical error due to small sample size.
Previously, Neves et al. (2005) had proposed a
“two main biological components model” to explain
early migrations to the Americas. This model has
some merit, even though their two components were
likely made up of multiple small migrations over
generations. Genetic evidence from the Anzick-1
individual is consistent with a proposed early split
between Paleoindian populations in North and South
America (Rasmussen et al. 2014).
Therefore, the morphological similarity between Midland and the Pelican Rapids individual
is expected. Since they are both North American
crania, they should be the most similar since they are

the most geographically proximate (Wright 1943).
It may also be evidence of geographic restrictions
on the migration of peoples (and by extension, their
genes). Ramachandran and Rosenberg (2011) have
hypothesized that the geographic orientation of the
Americans inhibited north-south gene flow. While
North and South American Paleoindians shared a
common ancestry, later migrations from northeast
Asia may not have contributed much to the genome
of South American populations.
Like other Paleoindian crania, Midland shares
some morphological similarities with Pacific
populations. Statistical comparisons in this study
between Midland and Howells world-wide craniometric sample produce some intriguing, but not
unexpected results. She most closely resembles

modern Japanese and prehistoric Tasmanians.
There is a slightly more distant relationship with
prehistoric Atayals (the aboriginal tribe of Taiwan) and Eskimos. It should be noted that the
lack of a face on the Midland calvarium prevents
a more refined statistical analysis, but the present
results are intriguing. The Mahalanobis calculations demonstrate that there is little morphological

similarity with recent Native Americans. This has
been previously observed among other Paleoindian
crania. Her similarity to prehistoric Atayals and
Tasmanians fits with previous research linking
Paleoindians (particularly South American individuals) with early Pacific populations.
The craniometric data from Midland and other
Paleoindians reflect considerable morphological

Taylor—The Midland Calvarium and the Early Human Habitation of the Americas 205
diversity. How this fits in with DNA research and
later descendant groups is still an open question.
The DNA evidence from Anzick-1 strongly suggests that Paleoindians are ancestral to modern
American Indians. Paleoindians may have a somewhat different cranial morphology, this should not
be taken as an implication that they are not the
ancestors of Native Americans. As mentioned by
Stewart (1955), Midland does exhibit morphological similarity to later Archaic populations in Texas.
Given that cranial morphometrics are not static
through time (Weisensee and Jantz 2014), one cannot rule out the lineal descent of Paleoindians to
modern Native Americans by measurements alone.
In addition, one should also realize that Native American populations were not genetically
isolated. Once the pathway to the continent was
established (by land, sea, or both), nothing would
have prevented later populations from migrating
from Asia to the Americas. Indeed, gene flow likely
went the other way as well: from the Americas to
Asia (Jantz and Spradley 2014).
One should not discount the possibility that
human migration from other regions had an effect on the modern Native American genome. For
example, there is compelling evidence that groups
of Polynesians landed on the coasts of North and
South America after A.D. 1300 (see chapters in
Jones et al. 2011). This migration would have resulted in gene flow between populations. Indeed,
Gonçalves et al. (2013) reported that two mtDNA
haplogroups associated with Polynesians was
found among Botocudo Indians from Brazil. Paleoindians may have been the first people to migrate
to the Americas, but they were not the last.
Employing a combination of DNA and craniometric research, a clearer picture of the initial human
settlement of the Americas emerges. There was an
initial, early population stratum that occupied both
continents, followed closely by a second (and closely
related) group that inhabited mostly North America.
The data from the Midland site are consistent with
this model. The affinity that Midland exhibits with
some South American crania should not be surprising, since they both share a common ancestry with
the earliest inhabitants of the Americas.
CONCLUSIONS
The new data provided from Midland is
consistent with previous findings about the

craniometric diversity of the earliest Americans.
These populations had a generalized morphology
that was just as diverse as modern American Indians.
While Paleoindian morphology was different from
their modern descendants, there is ample evidence
they are the direct ancestors of Native Americans.
The passage of time and continued gene flow from
other parts of the world has had an effect on cranial
shape and morphometrics.
The new measurements from the Midland
crania provide vital information that quantifies
the craniometric diversity of the Paleoindians.
Although the sample size is low, it is apparent that
morphological variation was considerable. This
implies that the earliest inhabitants of the Americas did not originate from a single migration or
a single population. While our understanding of
early migrations is incomplete at best, future discoveries and advances in research methods will
undoubtedly refine current hypotheses. It is the
hope of the author that the data from the Midland
site will inform future research and refine our
understanding of the earliest Americans.
