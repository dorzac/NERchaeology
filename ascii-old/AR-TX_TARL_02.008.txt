PREFACE
Solveig A. Turpin

In the past decade, archeological research has proliferated well beyond the
capacity of the few established publishing venues in Texas and surrounding areas. As
a result, important data reside in unpublished papers or in the minds of archeologists
where their accessibilty is limited to personal communication among a few select
individuals. The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory is addressing this prob­
lem by issuing special reports in its Studies in Archeology series, thus providing an
outlet for information of utility to regional researchers that might not otherwise be
circulated due to the specificity of the topics, the level of data detailed, or the simple
constraints imposed by the limited number of journal pages available to Texas ar­
cheologists.
The papers in this volume draw upon information generated by excavations, old
and new, in the Lower Pecos River region of Texas and, with the exception of Brown's
Chapter 4, are largely data-oriented.
The first chapter, my contribution to the volume, summarizes the radiocarbon
sequence and proposed cultural chronologies. Grappling with the vagaries of the
dating sequence was an educational experience and hopefully one that will save future
researchers time and frustration while directing their attention to areas that need
additional research effort.
Chapter 2, Leland C. Bement's statistical study of Middle Archaic dart points,
recovered from radiocarbon-dated strata at Arenosa Shelter, concludes that the
differences between recognized variants within the Langtry Val Verde categories
merit the establishment of a third type, Arenosa, to accomodate the contracting stem
variety. In the third chapter, Jay Peck analyzes the projectile points recovered from
Fate Bell Shelter during the 1930s University of Texas excavations and compares them
to other Lower Pecos rock shelter assemblages.
In Chapter 4, Kenneth M. Brown discusses theoretical approaches to the analysis
of prehistoric economics at Baker Cave, a site excavated most recently by the Univer­
sity of Texas at San Antonio and the Witte Museum. He introduces a number of
models that have been applied to hunters amd gatherers in other parts of the world
and considers their potential contribution to Lower Pecos studies.
Chapter 5, by Roberta McGregor, describes one aspect of the fiber industry, the
late introduction of twined and threaded mats into this region. Joseph F. Powell's
analysis of human skeletal remains from Skyline Shelter on the Devils River is

Skyline and Conejo shelters is the subject of Chapter 7 by Jeffery A. Huebner. The
concluding paper, by Thomas R. Hester, Frank Asaro, Fred Stross, Anne C. Kerr, and
Robert D. Giauque, presents the results of trace element analysis of obsidian flakes
from Arenosa Shelter, demonstrating the introduction of exotic materials during the
Late Archaic period.

the cover and assisted in the editing stages of manuscript production.

TIME OUT OF MIND:
THE RADIOCARBON CHRONOLOGY
OF THE LOWER PECOS RIVER REGION
Solveig A. Turpin
by comparing different archaeological sequences and trying to under­
stand them as evidence of societies changing over time, archaeology
discovers diachronic regularities that are significant for evaluating high­
level theories. The successful pursuit of such understanding requires not
only that care be paid to inferring behavior from archaeological data but
also the elaboration of even more detailed chronologies. This takes ar­
chaeologists back to the first problem that was addressed by their discipline
and one that they will never outgrow (Trigger 1989:409).

Regional chronologies, their problems and pitfalls, have become a much­
debated issue in Texas archeology, and one that is unlikely to be resolved without
additional research. The argument proceeds from two divergent views and was largely
precipitated by Prewitt's (1981a) advancement of a cultural chronology for Central
Texas. One camp questions the validity of the radiocarbon dates that Prewitt cited in
support of his sequence, thus addressing weaknesses in the data (Black 1988; Johnson
1986, in press). The other perspective takes aim upon the use and misuse of standard
archeological constructs. Reacting to the use of the term phase, Johnson (1986)
called for more terminological rigor, reminding the archeological community that 40
years ago Willey and Phillips (1958) established a nomenclature to describe the spatial
and temporal dimensions of archeological units. More general is a blanket indictment
of the proliferation of regional chronologies, an excess which Hester (1986) described
as the "Balkanization" of Texas prehistory because their makers often fail to consider
broad processes that transcend the boundaries (also imposed by archeologists) that
define cultural areas.
The Lower Pecos River Region is the smallest of the cultural areas of Texas
(Brown et al. 1982) but the regional chronology has often been applied to adjacent
areas, especially as a context for Paleoindian sites and artifacts. Most recently, the
periods within the Archaic sequence from the Lower Pecos have been related to
similar cultural stages in the Greater Southwest (Wills 1988). The following review
of radiocarbon assays from this region, however, began as an attempt to address a
purely regional phenomenon-the production of elaborate ritual art by hunters and
gatherers who, according to archeological lore, operated at a very elemental level of
social organization.
The subject matter of this paper may seem anachronistic to a community
schooled in functionalist and processual archeology, but, in this case, time is thought
of as one dimension that describes process, here the cultural trajectory of Lower Pecos

prehistory. Sequencing the various Native American cave painting styles found in the
area surrounding the confluences of the Devils and Pecos rivers with the Rio Grande
provides an essential context for the study of social structure, ideology, religion, and
culture change. It is not yet possible to date these prehistoric paintings by absolute
means but, through superimposition and an analysis of subject matter, a relative
sequence has been developed (Gebhard 1965; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Turpin
1984, 1986a, 1986b, 1989). Attempting to tie that series to what was considered to be
one of the more precise regional chronologies prompted an examination of the
supporting data - the stratigraphic analyses and the radiocarbon date list - for two
immediate purposes. The first was to determine how well the competing
cultural-historical sequences are supported by radiocarbon dates by evaluating the
data. Inconsistencies in the number and accuracy of dates for various periods can
then focus research on ambiguous or unsupported segments of the cultural
sequence.The second consideration is the contribution that regional chronologies
make to more broad-based studies of human adaptation, thus addressing the utility
of these constructs.
The Study Area
The core of the Lower Pecos River Region is the area surrounding the confluen­
ces of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio Grande (Frontispiece). Its regional
extent is determined by the distribution of the Pecos River pictograph style and by
the commonality of materials found in dry rock shelter deposits. In terms of modern­
day political units, the region includes all of Val Verde County and adjacent segments
of Terrell, Crockett and Edwards counties. The southern boundary, as yet undefined,
lies in Coahuila, perhaps as far as 90 miles south of the mouth of the Pecos River
(Turpin, in press). Although the region is generally considered insular, these tentative
boundaries undoubtedly fluctuated through time, especially during the earliest and
latest periods of prehistory and aboriginal history.
The Lower Pecos River Region is now a semi-arid rangeland dominated by
thorny scrub and xeric succulents. Rolling hills are cut by deeply entrenched canyons
tributary to the three major rivers - the Rio Grande, the Devils and the Pecos. Rock
shelters hollowed from the steep limestone cliffs were home to Archaic hunting and
gathering populations who concentrated around the reliable water sources. The
combination of dry rock shelter deposition and the arid climate have resulted in the
preservation of normally perishable items and an elaborate body of Native American
rock art.
This region has been the focus of archeological investigations since 1930. The
majority of the radiocarbon dates listed in Table 1.1 were generated during the
National Park Service salvage program (n = 95) prior to the impoundment of Amistad
Reservoir in 1969. Subsequently, the largest block of assays (n =30) was commis­
sioned by Texas A & M under a National Science Foundation grant for the analysis of
Hinds Cave (41VV465).

The Evolution of Lower Pecos Chronologies
The first attempts to place the Lower Pecos rock shelter deposits in a chronologi­
cal framework relied on terminology borrowed from the Southwest. In 1954, Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks included the Lower Pecos in the Trans-Pecos which they divided
into broad stages, foci, and aspects appropriate for the level of information then
available. Their terminology has been somewhat altered but their broad quadrapar­
tite divisions are perpetuated in the commonly used Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods (Hester 1989). In many ways, this broad periodiza­
tion remains the most useful for communicating in generally understood terms
applicable across Texas.
The pending construction of Lake Amistad spurred interest in a regional
chronology, at first largely based on projectile point typologies but later augmented
by radiocarbon dating. The artifacts produced from some of the initial excavations
were analyzed in the context of four series that grouped projectile points by form
(Epstein 1960,1963; Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965; Parsons 1965; Ross 1965). The
major flaw in this approach was the mixing of types of different ages into morphologi­
cal categories, thus undermining the typology's effectiveness as a chronological
device. Johnson (1964), using the type and variety approach to projectile point
classification, identified Paleoindian, Early, Middle, and Late Archaic components at
the well-stratified Devils Mouth Site. His seriation of dart point styles and his
estimates of their age range remain remarkably accurate, especially since the samples
he collected for radiocarbon dating were inadvertently destroyed at the laboratory
(Johnson, 1989, personal communication).
In 1966, Story (Story and Bryant 1966) compiled the radiocarbon assays from
stratified sites then excavated in the Amistad Reservoir district. Her eight periods,
named I through VIII from oldest to latest (Fig. 1.1), were defined solely by certain
groups of projectile points whose estimated ages were derived from the radiocarbon
dates (Story and Bryant 1966:13). The same year, Bryant (1966) integrated paleon­
tological, paleobotanical, and archeological data to reconstruct the
paleoenvironmental sequence. He named five stages and three intervals that can
often be roughly equated to periods in the culture history. Because he derived much
of his information from archeological sites and analyses, the parallels between the
cultural and environmental sequence are inherent in the data. In later publications,
Bryant (1969; Bryant and Shafer 1977) moved away from his named sequence, ad­
vocating a more linear view of environmental change which, in essence, described the
same climatic trends and interruptions. Although more sophisticated climatic models
have since been proposed (see Brown, this volume), Bryant's sequence is discussed
here because of its relevance to the construction of the regional chronology.
By 1969, when Amistad Dam closed, several additional site excavations had
expanded the Lower Pecos information base. The increasing number of radiocarbon
assays, most notably those from Arenosa Shelter, enabled Collins (1974) to refine
Story's sequence. His chronology consisted of the Paleoindian period, followed by
nine prehistoric units, A through J, omitting I. (Fig. 1.1). In another venue, Collins

12 / Turpin

(1976) recognized six possible divisions of the Terminal Pleistocene between 14,000
and 5000 years ago, spanning the traditional Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods.
Continued analysis of the Arenosa Shelter materials led Dibble to informally propose
a 12-part chronology, including a historic unit (Fig. 1.1). Prewitt (1983) first published
Dibble's chronology in his discussion of the cultural sequence ofthe adjacent Stockton
Plateau. In 1985, the age ranges listed by Prewitt were adjusted to accord with new
radiocarbon assays and the characteristics of each period were described (Turpin and
Bement 1985). Johnson's (1986) later criticism of the use of phase chronologies in
Texas is acknowledged here by referring to the general age ranges as periods (Turpin
1988).
In 1986, Shafer (1986) couched his discussion of the Lower Pecos material
culture in entirely different terms. He divided Lower Pecos prehistory into seven
intervals, some of which bear the names of recognized projectile point types (Fig. 1.1).
These intervals should not be confused with the stages and intervals in Bryant's (1966)
paleoenvironmental model. In the face of these competing chronologies, most
recently Hester (1989) reverted to the older terminology, once again dividing Lower
Pecos prehistory into Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Fig. 1.1).
It is somewhat ironic that one of the most common criticisms leveled at the 1960s
archeology of the Lower Pecos was its over-concern with chronology when some 30
years later, in 1990, consensus has yet to be reached.
The Sample in Table 1.1

The following discussion is primarily presented in terms of the broad-based
quadrapartite division most familiar to Texas archeologists or Dibble's scheme which
is the most detailed. Their equivalents in other chronological and environmental
sequences are discussed where appropriate (Fig. L 1). The minor differences between
Story, Collins, and Dibble are the natural consequence of an increasingly larger pool
of excavated sites and concomitant radiocarbon assays.
Table 1 lists 268 radiocarbon dates from sites in or adjacent to the Lower Pecos
Region (Fig. 1.2); the majority are from Val Verde County. The remainder are assays
from shelters and hearth fields in Coahuila (n = 4) and Nuevo Leon (n = 42), Mexico
and Crockett (n =32), Terrell (n = 9) and Sutton (n =5) counties, Texas. In some
instances, only one or two assays from a given site are relevant to the Lower Pecos
chronology but the whole series is listed for comparative purposes. Assays that the
site excavator or analyst considered stratigraphically incongruent or potentially in
error are indicated by a comment (suspect).
The list is ordered from oldest to youngest by uncorrected radiocarbon age or
the corrected age if that is the date reported, followed by one-sigma deviations. By
far the majority of the assays were run at the University of Texas Radiocarbon
Laboratory and reported in the journal Radiocarbon. Discrepancies between the
dates as published in Radiocarbon and as discussed in the archeological reports were
relatively common. In only one case did the report err by more than a century and
the majority of the mistakes appear typographical rather than interpretative. Errors

were more frequent when the uncorrected age in radiocarbon years was translated
into uncorrected B.c. or A.D. dates.
Laboratories are referenced by acronyms: University of Texas (TX), Beta
Analytic, Inc. (B), University of Arizona Accelerator (AA), Smithsonian (SI),
Radiocarbon, Ltd. (RL), Geochron Laboratories (GX) and Humble Oil Company
(0). Texas site numbers are those assigned by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, the central repository at the University of Texas at Austin. Mexican site
numbers are project-specific, given during Epstein's Northeastern Mexico Project to
identify sites recorded in Nuevo Leon (NL) and Coahuila (C).
The Internal Provenience and Associations column in Table 1.1 provides a very
abbreviated description of the location of the sample in terms of the local stratigraphy
and lists any pertinent associations mentioned by-the submitter or author of the
report. Although the vertical measurements are gross, they give the reader a broad
impression of the internal provenience of the sample. The listed associations are
general and seem impressionistic but they are a measure of stratigraphic expectations.
Horizontal provenience was omitted because it is not comparable from site to site.
The most common associations are dart and arrow point styles, following the
nomenclature established by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Johnson (1964) [see Turner
and Hester 1985]. Projectile points serve as key index fossils in all the Lower Pecos
chronologies, an emphasis fostered by a number of factors (Story and Bryant 1966:9).
Dart and arrow point styles are the lowest common denominator, described in every
site report, thus permitting intra-site and intersite comparisons. Additionally, formal
lithic tool types are the easiest to recognize, providing a means of assigning relative
ages to features, strata, components, and sites where datable material is lacking. The
majority of the reports generated during and since the Amistad salvage program
conform to an established typology, providing some comparability in classificatory
criteria. Thus, projectile point styles have the added advantage of providing a rough
measure of external relationships when compared with the assemblages of adjacent
regions that share this typology. The backside of this typological uniformity is that
errors or ambiguities, introduced into the classification system as it grew rather
haphazardly through time, are perpetuated and translated into the chronological
schemes. It is, for example, hard to explain a Late Archaic "Desmuke" point in Early
Archaic levels at Eagle Cave or the presence of "Carrollton" and "Gary" dart points,
East Texas types, in northern Mexico except as excessive typological zeal.
The major flaw in the approach is the tacit assumption that projectile point
morphology somehow accurately reflects trends and disjunctions in the larger cultural
system. Obviously, projectile points as index lithics should ultimately be used to link
people and their behavior to units of time that describe the trajectory of prehistoric
cultures rather than the type of artifacts they created.
The material dated is provided in the event the more meticulous readers are
interested in performing estimated a13C corrections across the board. Often, and
especially in the earlier decades of radiocarbon dating, the type of charcoal is not
specified so wood charcoal is presumed unless otherwise indicated.

RadiocaTbon Chronology / 15

The final column in Table 1.1 gives the published references: first, the journal
Radiocarbon with the volume number in parentheses, and then the report that
provides the context are cited. In those cases where the dates are not published in
the site report, the parenthetical reference provides a general context for the samples
assayed.
The Concept of Core Dates
The core dates for each period have been extracted from Table 1.1 for discussion
under the appropriate heading; their uncorrected ranges are plotted in Figure 1.3.
These assays meet several criteria. First, the excavator or analyst expressed no
concern over their accuracy, either in the report or in their comments published in
Radiocarbon. Secondly, the dates are not stratigraphically anomalous. Thus, the
majority are from suites of dates where their concurrence can be evaluated. Third,
these dates can be related to strata or zones rather than individual events, such as
burials, pits, or hearths that lack associated cultural material of relevance to the
chronology. In some cases, dates were retained despite large standard deviations
because they filled gaps in the sequence or were generally informative.
A small margin of error is introduced by the absence of o13C corrections for all
dates run prior to 1977 and many thereafter. The vast majority of the material that
produced the core dates was charcoal so the estimated o13C correction is a matter of
a few decades, an error so small it is unlikely to affect the general discussion. The
d13C correction was estimated for other types of material using a program written by
Julien (1990) for use on IBM-compatible personal computers. Calibrated ranges for
dates younger than 8100 years (Fig. 1.4) were calculated by the Calib computer
program (Stuiver and Reimer 1987), using the 20 year atmospheric curve for cons is­
tancy. To maintain comparability, the age ranges for each period are given in
uncorrected radiocarbon years.
CORE DATES AND THEIR INHERENT PROBLEMS

Although 268 dates have been run from archeological deposits in the Lower
Pecos region, less than half are relevant to this review. In the infancy of the dating
process, samples were seemingly submitted with little regard for their associations.
Once a chronology had been proposed, many radiocarbon dates were run to determine
how specific features, events, or artifacts fit within that time frame so they are of little
utility in assessing the validity of the chronology. Given that many Lower Pecos sites
are deeply stratified, one valid function of a suite of radiocarbon dates is to measure
the integrity of the site deposits, an approach that does not necessarily apply to dating
of associations and one that may contribute little to a regional chronology unless the
relationship between assay and material culture is made apparent. Clear stratigraphy
is rare in these sites where successive occupants disturbed the surfaces laid down by
their predecessors and where vandalism is all pervasive. Single component sites or
sealed "pure" strata, such as are often fictionally attributed to Arenosa Shelter, are

rare to nonexistent and when present usually contribute samples from a single time
period. The chances of encountering the idealized strata so devoutly desired in
Central Texas (Johnson 1986) are even slimmer in the Lower Pecos region.
In addition, because chronological sequences are a somewhat vain attempt to
force a process - the passage of time - into finite compartments, blending of types in
transitional strata, overlap in radiocarbon assays, and extreme variability in the
inventories from different sites are inevitable (see Prewitt 1985 for a similar opinion).
The choice becomes whether to proceed toward the refinement of the sequence by
sorting through trends, tendencies, and probabilities, hoping that increased sample
size will compensate for error, or to remain within a broad-based chronology that
imposes little rigor on research.
Eliminating stratigraphically incongruent or questionable assays and those that
lacked definitive associations with index fossils reduced the sample to 116. Ideally,
only the dates that had been fully explained or interpreted by excavator or analyst
should be used to test the validity of any chronological sequence. Unfortunately, that
caution would have eliminated the two largest date lists - Arenosa Shelter and Hinds
Cave with 32 and 30 dates respectively-leaving only 65 assays to evaluate a chronol­
ogy that encompasses 14,000 years.
The temporally diagnostic projectile points recovered from strata or features
generally equivalent to the core date proveniences are listed in Table 1.2 so readers
can judge for themselves the validity of any associations. In many cases, it is no longer
possible to determine the exactitude of the relationship between these artifacts and
the material submitted for assay.
A very general computer inventory of artifacts from Arenosa Shelter was
prepared by TARL for the National Park Service so the associations given in
Radiocarbon could be checked against listings of projectile point types by strata. This
was essential in the case of the Smithsonian Institution (SI) dates where no
information beyond the stratum designation is available. Several flaws in this system
are apparent. First, the typological classifications are very broad and may be
internally inconsistent. Secondly, the provenience information does not take into
account horizontal and vertical variation across the site so that divisions within strata
(such as Strata 9, 11 and 22) recognized by Dibble are not reflected in the computer
inventory. This is particularly apparent in the case of features that may have been
clearly associated with other items of material culture but those distinctions are
blurred by their both being lumped under such broad provenience as strata that extend
across the site. In addition, Dibble (1989, personal communication) cautions that
these strata designations are not always directly equivalent to cultural levels across
the site. Thus, listings in Table 1.2, and especially those from Arenosa Shelter, should
be recognized as approximations of the distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts
by depth and not as clear associations between radiocarbon-dated features and those
same artifacts.
Hinds Cave associations are taken from the original submission forms or the
description published in Radiocarbon; subsequently, levels and lenses were com­
bined to form Analysis Units (AU) which are summarily described in Lord (1984).

The primary criterion for the formation of analysis units was apparently age, whether
indicated by radiocarbon dates or index fossils, so the dates for these units can not be
used to test the validity of the chronology that produced them.
Unpublished dates listed in Table 1.1 were provided by Kenneth M. Brown of
TARL (Baker Cave) or are samples run at the UT-Radiocarbon Laboratory too
recently to have been reported. The majority of the latter are assays of burial goods,
undertaken in an attempt to assess the age of various regional mortuary practices.

Date Ranges for Periods
PALEOINDIAN: 14,500 to 11,900 B.P.
Story's Period I, Collins' Paleoindian Period, Dibble's Aurora Period, Shafer's
Clovis Interval

The Aurora period is the hypothetical earliest Paleoindian occupation of the
region, estimated by Dibble to pre-date 12,000 years ago. The four dates in this time
range were derived from strata dominated by extinct fauna (Table 1.3). Wood and
charcoal samples from a stratum of burned and broken horse, camel, bison, and bear
bones at Cueva Quebrada (41 VV162a) range from 14,520 to 12,110 radiocarbon years
in age. Scattered charcoal, collected from Stratum H -1, Bone Bed 1 in Bonfire Shelter
(41 VV218), where it was intermingled with horse and mammoth skeletal materials,
produced a date range between 12,920 and 11,940 years ago. Lundelius (1984),
Dibble (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), and Bement (1986) attribute these bone strata to
human bunters and butcherers but no formal tools were recovered from Bone Bed 1
at Bonfire and only the vertebrate fauna from Cueva Quebrada have been reported
in detail.

Artifacts of obvious human origin were recovered from all strata in Cueva
Quebrada, including the bone levels that produced the radiocarbon samples, accord­
ing to Collins (1976, 1989 personal communication) who is planning to analyze the
archeological materials. The lower zone, with its 14,000 year old dates, contained two
flint flakes, one uniface, and an antelope calcaneum with cut marks; the 12,OOO-year­
old intermediate zone yielded ten flint flakes and a Clear Fork Gouge (Collins 1976).
The presence of human populations in this region during this period is thus strongly
indicated by Cueva Quebrada cultural and faunal remains (Lundelius 1984). Similar­
ly, the intermingling of diverse species of game animals and the butchering practices
identified at Bonfire Shelter are most appropriate in the context of human activity
(Bement 1986; Collins 1976; Dibble and Lorrain 1968).
At the time Story (Story and Bryant 1966) and Collins (1974) were proposing
their chronologies, the paleontological data from Cueva Quebrada had not been
published and the lowest bone beds in Bonfire Shelter were undated. Their earliest
periods, therefore, were described simply as before 9000 B.P. and included both the
Aurora and Bonfire periods as defined by Dibble. The estimated age of the Aurora

Radiocarbon Chronology / 23

period slightly predates the range that Shafer (1986) called Clovis in his chronology
but presumably they are roughly equivalent. Artifacts of this time period are exceed­
ingly rare. Only four Clovis or Clovis-like points have been reported from this region
and all came from surface contexts or private collections (Gonzalez Rul1959; Greer
1968c).
Until such time as clear associations between these extinct fauna and humankind
are demonstrated, the cultural reality of the Aurora period remains a major research
topic. Both sites, however, are compatible with the concept of Paleoindians as big
game hunters exploiting the specialized environment of the terminal Pleistocene and,
as such, are part of a hemispheric phenomenon.
PALEOINDIAN: 10,700 to 9800 B.P.
Story's Period I, Collins' Paleoindian Period, Dibble's Bonfire Period, Shafer's
Folsom-Plainview Interval
Based on a series of dates derived from charcoal recovered from the upper
component of Bone Bed 2 at Bonfire Shelter, Dibble estimated a range of 12,000 to
9800 years for his Bonfire period, a span traditionally called the Paleoindian period.
Bone Bed 2 is a massive accumulation of faunal elements, largely made up of Bison
antiquus, that yielded one Folsom and four Plainview projectile points. The Bonfire
dates cluster between 10,710 and 9770 B.P. (Table 1.4). In addition, the estimated
a13C correction of one assay of bone apatite (Table 1.1: TX897), a date that was
previously not considered reliable, brings it more into line with the core range.
Discounting the anomalous Hinds Cave date of 1l,500± 190, a gap of 1000 years
remains between the late end of the Aurora range and the uppermost limit of the
Bonfire range as it is currently represented.

Other dated components that fall in this time range are the lowest level of
Coontail Spin, below the lone Plainview point recovered in that excavation, and Unit
6 of La Calsada in Nuevo Leon, a site with an entirely different lithic tradition. In
addition, the youngest date from Unit 6 at La Calsada may have been contaminated
by materials trickling down from higher strata. The core dates for the Bonfire period

then approximate a range of from 10,700 to 9800 years ago which roughly equates to
the Medina stage in Bryant's climatic model. This mesic period is reflected by an
increase in pine and riparian tree pollen and, of course, the megafauna found in Bone
Bed 2 at the type site. The numerous fine-grained sedimentary layers identified at
depth in Arenosa Shelter are also attributed to a humid interlude, ca. 9500 years ago,
which Patton and Dibble (1982: 109) interpreted as a phase in the deterioration of the
cooler and more humid late glacial climate. Some confusion is introduced by their
later discussion ofthis humid interval, represented in the lowest strata at Arenosa, as
lasting from 9000 to 7000 B.P. In reality, these strata predate the oldest radiocarbon
assay from the site - 9550± 190 (Table 1.1), thus approximating Bryant's estimate of
the age of the Medina stage.
From a cultural perspective, a major problem in the definition of the Bonfire
period is differentiating between Folsom and Plainview strata (Johnson 1986), a
difficulty that may be reflected in Shafer's (1986) choice of the name
Folsom-Plainview for his interval. The dates from Bonfire Shelter are from the
uppermost component, thus probably applicable to the Plainview use of the site. The
1200-year gap between the Aurora and Bonfire periods could well accomodate the
Folsom occupation of the region. Unfortunately, all other Folsom points reported
from this region came from surface contexts or private collections (Greer 1968c;
Bement and Turpin 1987). Also, caution is introduced by a similar but lesser gap in
the Aurora period dates; both may well be the product of sample size. Although it is
surely unwise to speculate about over two millennia of human occupation of the
region from the viewpoint of a single site, the evidence from Bonfire Shelter again
supports the traditional concept of Paleoindians as big game hunters.
LATE PALEO INDIAN: 9400 to 8800 B.P.
Story's Period I, Collins' Period A, Dibble's Oriente Period, Shafer's Golondrina
Interval

Although Johnson (1964) first defined the index lithic of this period, Golondrina
dart points, at the Devils Mouth Site, Baker Cave may be considered the type site
because it contributes four radiocarbon dates associated with the Golondrina occupa­
tion (Table 1.5). This dominant projectile point style is also reflected in Shafer's
(1986) naming the period from 6000 to 7000 B.C. the Golondrina interval. Although
this range is older than Collins' Period ~ his index lithics of Golondrina and Angos­
tura provide the link between the different chronologies.
The Baker Cave cluster ranges from 9400 to 8770 radiocarbon years ago. Slightly
older dates were generated by Unit 5, La Calsada and Stratum 38 at Arenosa Shelter
(41 VV99). Stratum 38 was above a concentration of Bison antiquus bones uncovered
in Stratum 42 and below the first appearance of the Early Barbed projectile point
styles characteristic of the subsequent Viejo Period but the lithic material in this level
consisted of four unifaces with no chronological significance. Lord (1984) describes
the temporally equivalent Analysis Unit 8 at Hinds Cave as lacking evidence of much

cultural activity. Eliminating these assays from the core date list inserts a 400-year
gap between the Bonfire and Oriente series.
Stratum P from Area D of the Devils Mouth Site, which also roughly corresponds
to this time range, contained a number of stemmed dart points (n = 7) which Johnson
(1964) and Sorrow (1968) classed within the Paleoindian period as it was then defined.
The specimens clearly predate the Early Barbed series that characterizes the follow­
ing Viejo period but the large deviation in the single radiocarbon date detracts from
their usefulness as chronological markers. Similar projectile points (n=3) were
recognized in the deepest strata at Eagle Cave (Ross 1965) where they were com­
mingled with Early Barbed specimens (n = 7). Although the Eagle Cave dates are
here included in the subsequent Viejo period, the stylistic and chronological
similarities with Stratum P indicate that the post-Paleoindian periods are more
complex than the core date list would suggest.
Although commonly called the Late Paleoindian period, the Oriente period sees
the onset of the desert adaptation most commonly associated with the Lower Pecos
Archaic (Collins 1976). Johnson (1964) first noted that it was difficult to distinguish
between Paleoindian and Archaic strata at the Devils Mouth Site where the evidence
for an economy oriented toward big-game hunting was lacking. Detailed analyses of
the materials recovered from this time period at Baker Cave demonstrate that the
broad spectrum resource procurement that was to characterize the majority of the
remainder of Lower Pecos culture history was already in effect by 9400 years ago
(Hester 1983). The fiber industry, utilizing desert succulents to manufacture bas­
ketry, sandals, matting, and cordage, was well developed by this time throughout
northern Mexico and the Lower Pecos (Andrews and Adovasio 1980). The people
seemingly continued within the Paleoindian lithic traditions while adopting an Ar­
chaic economy.
In Bryant's (1966) climatic model, the Oriente period would correlate with the
beginning of the Stockton Stage, a drying trend which began 10,000 years ago and
lasted until about 5000 B.P. Bryant noted a decrease of pine, oak, and riparian tree
pollen and an increase in desert herb pollen. Thus, the perceived economic and
technological shifts probably reflect some degree of cultural response to the changing
environment at the end of the Pleistocene. The problem of small sample size remains
to inhibit any more precise reconstruction of Oriente period lifeways.

26 / Tupin

EARLY ARCHAIC: 8900 to 5500 B.P.
Story's Period II, Collins' Period B, Dibble's Viejo Period, Shafer's Baker Interval
All of the above are but new names for the familiar Early Archaic. This extreme­
ly long period encompasses a 3400-year range characterized by a series of overlapping
projectile point styles, generically called Early Barbed, Early Stemmed, Early Comer­
Notched, and other descriptors that have not yet achieved the status of type names
(Table 1.6). The typology of Early Barbed points has been refined to single out Baker
and Bandy styles but a wide variety remains to confuse the chronology. In addition,
Baker and Bandy are better known to Texas archeologists in their old guise as Uvalde
and Martindale (Turner and Hester 1985) so, in this case, typology contributes to the
fragmentation of Texas prehistory (Hester 1986). Shafer's corresponding interval,
from 3000 to 6000 B.C., is named Baker, presumably after the point type and the site,
41VV213 or Baker Cave.

Radiocarbon Chronology I 27

The earliest dates associated with generic Early Barbed points are from Stratum
V of Eagle Cave, discussed above in the context of miscellaneous Paleoindian proj ec­
tile points first recognized at Devils Mouth; the latest are a composite date taken from
Stratum 32 and below at Arenosa Shelter, one from Level 24 at Skyline Shelter, and
an assay from a feature in Zone N-O at Devils Mouth. Level 24 at Skyline Shelter
was immediately below the Pandale zone and at the top of a 50-cm zone that contained
only projectile points typically considered Early Archaic in age. The Arenosa date,
however, is somewhat incongruent stratigraphically and the Devils Mouth sample was
dispersed charcoal in silt. A more reasonable terminal date for this period is indicated
by the mixture of Viejo and Eagle Nest temporal diagnostics in Strata III at Eagle
Cave around 6100 years ago and the definitive emergence of Pandale as the dominant
style at Arenosa Shelter in Stratum 30 (nearest date, Stratum 28) and Eagle Cave
Stratum II-d at 5500 years ago.
In defining the more general Texas Early Archaic period, Johnson (in press)
omitted the Eagle Cave dates from Stratum V in estimating a duration from 6000 to
3600-3500 B.c. This is a most reasonable assumption in light of his experience at the
Devils Mouth Site and certainly adds a measure of convenience as it lowers the
inception of the period to within range of Stuiver and Reimer's (1987) calibration
program. It also helps focus upon one of the major weaknesses in the definition of
this time period - accounting for the anomalous Paleoindian lithic artifacts found in
an Archaic context. Future research may produce a better definition of this transi­
tional time and justify its separation as a distinct period in Lower Pecos prehistory.
Other obvious flaws are the unrealistic length of this period in terms of cultural
uniformity and the considerable overlap during the 1000-year interval from about
6000 to 5000 years ago. Only six of the core dates for this period are from levels or
features that are clearly and solely associated with Early Archaic index fossils (Table
1.6). Some resolution may come from the 14 dates attributed to Hinds Cave Analysis
Units 6 and 7, the largest sample of this time period from a single site. According to
Lord (1984), these units contained a burned rock midden, prickly pear floors, perish­
able materials, coprolites and projectile point styles Bandy, Baker, and Early Barbed.
The absence of radiocarbon dates for the century around 7700 B.P. (Fig. 1.2) can be
attributed to sampling error as this gap is bracketed by assays from Hinds Cave.
Other site components of this age are Units 4 and 5, La Calsada; the Intermediate
Zone at Bonfire Shelter; remnant hearths cemented to the wall over 2 meters above
the current floor at Black Cave; levels 24 and below at Skyline Shelter; and the lowest
burial level at Seminole Sink. Possible contaminated dates in this series are TXI09
from Eagle Cave and TX41 from Centipede Cave.
The Early Archaic or Viejo period continues the latter half of Bryant's Stockton
Stage, the xeric trend which spans a 5000-year range. Economically, the Archaic
broad resource procurement strategies are intensified, presumably in concert with an
increasingly arid environment. A skeletal population of 21 individuals recovered
from a vertical shaft sinkhole burial site, Seminole Sink, provides some information
on mortuary practices and human biological adaptation (Turpin 1988). The absence
of major pathologies indicates that the human population suffered only temporary,

-

perhaps seasonal, dietary stress and little trauma. Williams-Dean's analysis of a Hinds
Cave coprolite lens, dated to the transition from the Viejo to Eagle Nest periods
(TX2458, TX2459: Table 1.1), produced the same impression of an extremely success­
ful adaptation to an increasingly arid environment.
Two observations, however, remain unexplained in the current climatic model.
Sometime before 6800 B.P., the earliest date for cultural strata at Black Cave, massive
erosion reduced the deposits to Pleistocene levels, exposing the platular eboulfs
produced by frost-wedging. Erosion also enlarged the opening to Seminole Sink,
permitting its use as a corpse disposal area, during this same general time period.
Whether these phenomena are related to the onset of the Stockton Stage or to an
episode that may have transpired anytime within it is again a viable research question
that is most appropriately studied in the context of a more complex climatic model
(see Brown, this volume).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC: 5500 to 4100 B.P.
Story's Period III, Collins' Period C, Dibble's Eagle Nest Period, Shafer's Pandale
Interval
The index lithicsof the Eagle Nest period are the distinctive beveled Pandale
projectile points, a regional style with a limited spatial distribution. Shafer subsumed
the Eagle Nest and subsequent San Felipe period under his Pandale interval which he
dated from 1000 to 3000 B.C. presumably because ofthe findings from Analysis Unit
5 at Hinds Cave (Lord 1984). As noted above, Pandale points appear in mixed strata
attributed to the range from 6100 to 5500 years ago at Eagle and Hinds caves with
more reliable assays favoring a 5500-year start date. Specimens have been recovered
from radiocarbon-dated strata at Arenosa Shelter, Eagle Cave, Conejo Shelter, Hinds
Cave, Skyline Shelter and Fate Bell Shelter (Table 1.7). About 4100 years ago, mixed
strata again signal the transition to the subsequent San Felipe period although
Pandale remains dominant in levels dated to between 3700 and 4000 B.P. at Arenosa
and Skyline shelters.
Other components that fall within this range include Cueva de la Zona Occupa­
tion Levell, La Calsada Units 3 and 4, Baker Cave (upper Pre-Archaic), and Cueva
Ahumada. Anomalies are assays from the Devils Mouth Site, Hinds Cave, and
Arenosa Shelter that were related to Early Barbed strata, one bone date from
Seminole Sink that again is clearly too recent, and a stratigraphically incongruous date
from Centipede Cave. The charcoal samples from Bonfire Shelter date features not
directly associated with any artifact type (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Bement 1986).
The windscreen posts from Coon tail Spin were supposed to be associated with late
Shumla or early Ensor occupational levels; in fact, Uvalde, Pandale, Langtry, Shumla,
and Ensor type points came from these obviously mixed strata (Nunley, Duffield, and
Jelks 1965). The close agreement of the core dates for this period, however, provides
an uncalibrated range of 5500 to 4100 years ago for the maximum popularity of the
Pandale type.

The beginning of the Eagle Nest period would coincide with the culmination of
the Stockton Stage in an extremely hot, dry interlude which Bryant (1966) called the
Ozona Erosional after disconformities in strata of this age at Arenosa Shelter (Dibble
1967) and the Devils Mouth Site (Johnson 1964). A second massive erosional episode
at Black Cave sometime after 5500 B.P., again scoured the deposits to beneath
Pleistocene levels (Turpin 1982). This climatic crisis coincides with increasing
regionalization in projectile point styles, tempting speculation that cultural insularity
might have been produced by a retreat to the rivers in the face of drought conditions.
MIDDLE ARCHAIC: 4100 to 3200 B.P.
Story's Period IV, Collins' Period D, Dibble's San Felipe Period, Shafer's Pandale
Interval
The transition from the Eagle Nest to the San Felipe periods continues the trend
toward regionalization. No radical disjunction in technology differentiates the
dominant point types diagnostic of the San Felipe period, Langtry, Val Verde, and
Almagre, from their predecessors. San Felipe styles first appear in strength in
Stratum 23 at Arenosa Shelter where they overlap with Pandale points of the Eagle
Nest period (Table 1.8). Strata 21 through 23 at Arenosa; Stratum II-A at Eagle Cave;

30 I Turpin

Zone III, Level 1 of Fate Bell Shelter; and Lens 50 at Conejo provide a tight cluster
of dates between 4100 and 3200 B.P. for these related projectile point styles. Other
components within this time range are Analysis Unit 3, Hinds Cave; Level 20b in
Cueva Ahumada; and Level 17 of Cueva de la Zona. The two charcoal samples from
Hidden Shelter were collected from relic hunter holes to date the abandonment of
the site where only Langtry and Val Verde points were found on the surface (Turpin
1984). The problems with the Coontail Spin windscreen dates remain as discussed
above.

Climatically, the trend to aridity established in the Stockton Stage resumes after
the Ozona Erosional as the Sanderson Stage (Bryant 1966). Of the 20 floods iden­
tified at Arenosa Shelter, 10 occurred within the time period Dibble called the San
Felipe period (Patton and Dibble 1982; Bryant and Shafer 1977). Based on com­
ponent counts (Marmaduke 1978) and graphs of projectile point frequencies in many
of the larger rock shelters (Turpin 1990b), population density increased dramatically,
perhaps due to concentration of people along the major rivers during a period of
increasing aridity. This concentration of people and the concomitant stress are, in my
opinion, probable causes for the introduction of cave painting as ritual activity (Turpin
1990b). Thus, I have suggested that the Pecos River style rock art for which the region
is most famous originated in the San Felipe period.
LATE ARCHAIC: 3150 to 2300 B.P.
Story's Period V, Collins' Period E, Dibble's Cibola Period, Shafer's Devils Interval

The Cibola Period is one of the few Lower Pecos time spans defined as much by
environment and economics as by diagnostic artifacts. The relationship between
bison bone and the dart points characteristic of this period first appears at Skyline

Shelter (and perhaps Piedra del Diablo) on the Devils River where strata marked by
Marshall dart points are dated to about 3100 B.P. (Table 1.9). Montell is usually
considered the most characteristic projectile point type, dated by assays from Bonfire,
Bone Bed 3; Arenosa, Strata 10 and 11; and Devils Mouth, Zone 9, all of which are
considered reliable. It should be noted, however, that Castroville-like dart points
(n = 13) were the dominant style associated with the bison kill at Bonfire Shelter.
Thus, it appears that Dibble's rationale for combining these styles into a generic
broad-bladed, barbed category, including Marshall, Montell, Marcos, and Castroville
types, is justified by their stratigraphic associations and attendant radiocarbon dates.
Other components with similar specimens include Nopal Terrace, Level 7a and
Conejo Shelter, Lens 38. A burned rock midden near Felton Cave in Sutton County
produced one date in this range, but the surface finds consisted of Montell, Marshall,
Ensor, and Frio points (Greer 1968b).

In Bryant's (1966) climatic sequence, this time span is called the Frio Interval.
A resurgence of pollen types characteristic of cooler, more mesic conditions is
accompanied by a change from coarse to fine-grained sediments in the flood sequence
at Arenosa Shelter (Patton and Dibble 1982). The faunal evidence at Bonfire Shelter
is incontrovertible. There, Bone Bed 3 produced the estimated remains of 800
modern bison, 3 Montell and 13 Castroville-like dart points, and radiocarbon dates
clustering around 2600 years ago (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Lesser amounts of bison
bone have been recovered in deposits of this age at Eagle Cave (Raun in Story and
Bryant 1966), Castle Canyon (Greer 1966), Arenosa Shelter, and Skyline Shelter
(Turpin 1990a) but more striking is the absence of bison in the vast majority of the
deeply stratified dry rock shelters.

32 / Turpin

This same variability is seen in the distribution of the characteristic projectile
points. Relative percentages fall off in many of the large stratified sites such as Fate
Bell, Eagle Cave, Morehead Cave, and Conejo Shelter while increasing dramatically
at the Devils Mouth Site, an open terrace occupation.
Based on the evidence from Bonfire Shelter, Dibble first· suggested that the
return to mesic conditions permitted the grasslands of the Great Plains to recolonize
the Lower Pecos. Migratory bison herds expanded their range to the Rio Grande,
followed by people who had developed an efficient hunting economy. Thus, the
activities that centered around bison hunting are attributed to intrusive populations.
If a parallel can be drawn with historic times, the bison herds most likely drifted into
the Lower Pecos during the winter and retracted north in the summer. Although the
consensus admits that the Cibola period was climatically and economically different
from the general Archaic, little attention has been paid to the potential effect of these
intrusions on the resident popUlation. Even if peaceful means of sharing territories
was worked out, some fragmentation of society must have been experienced, if only
due to the stress inherent in adjusting to social pressure.
Shafer's Devils Interval is a new name for the old concept of the Late Archaic
period which encompasses Story's Periods IV-VI, Collins Periods F-H, and Dibble's
Cibola, Flanders, and Blue Hills periods. This lumping blurs the clear economic and
environmental differences that set the Cibola period apart from the earlier and later
Archaic lifeways. Of all the Lower Pecos Archaic time periods, Cibola is the most
distinct and most closely approximates the definition of a horizon - "a spatial con­
tinuity represented by cultural traits and assemblages whose nature and mode of
occurrence permit the assumption of a broad and rapid spread" (Willey and Phillips
1958:33). The horizon concept then serves, as it was intended, by providing a bridge
between regional chronologies.
LATE ARCHAIC: 2300 B.P.?

Story's Period V, Collins' Periods F and G, Dibble's Flanders Period, Shafer's
Devils Interval

Although Shumla dart points are one of the most characteristic of Lower Pecos
artifact types, their age is difficult to detect in the radiocarbon series. In northern
Mexico, at Cueva de la Zona, Shumla points first appear in very small numbers around
3100 years ago, the estimated starting time of the Cibola period in the Lower Pecos.
Shumla became a major type at Cueva de la Zona, reaching its maximum at 2300 years
ago and appearing in deposits dated as late as 1850 B.P. (Table 1.10). North of the
Rio Grande, only Arenosa Shelter provides more than one date applicable to Shumla
strata and these are inconclusive. Stratum 9, where Shumla is the dominant type,
produced three dates with centroids of 2070, 2230, and 2785 B.P. Assays from Strata
10, also a Shumla-bearing level, and 11 are younger than the latter rather than older
as would be expected from their stratigraphic position. The only other applicable date
is from Coontail Spin, a site where the radiocarbon series has been out of step with
its stratigraphy and with the regional suite of dates for various projectile point series.

The few available dates suggest a range between 2800 and 2000 years ago, overlapping
the radiocarbon span of the preceding and subsequent periods.
A typological problem affecting the description of this time period was noted by
Dibble (1967) at Arenosa Shelter. Two varieties of Shu mIa-like points were
recovered in strata separated by the Cibola period Montell-bearing levels. In a sort
of reverse nomenclature, he distinguished the early style as Shu mia-like and the later
as Shumla. Greer (1966) resolved the problem by naming a new point type, Arledge,
to accomodate the Shumla-like points he recovered from the Castle Canyon Site but
the type has yet to be generally accepted. Other researchers quickly became aware
of this possible source of confusion (McClurkan 1966; Sorrow 1968) but McClurkan
pointed out that the two varieties of Shumla that were well-dated at Cueva de la Zona
were not the same as Dibble's Shumla and Shumla-like styles.
Based on the present limited data, it is tempting to look to the south for the
origins of the populations that manufactured Shumla points in the Lower Pecos.
Bryant's climatic model proposes a return to aridity, called the Juno Stage, at the end
of the Frio Interval. The retreat of the bison herds and their attendant hunters in the
face of what was to them a deteriorating environment may have created a vacuum
suitable for the expansion of desert-adapted people living in northern Mexico.
Another possible scenario is that Shumla popUlations experienced a hiatus during the
Cibola period, resuming their dominance of the region after several hundred years.
There is no doubt that the people that produced Shumla points left a substantial
record of their lifeways in many dry rock shelters such as Coontail Spin and Mosquito
Cave (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965). However, the lack of well-dated and
well-provenienced Shumla-bearing strata north of the Rio Grande certainly provides
a research topic to be pursued in future excavations.

LATE ARCHAIC: 2300 -1300 B.P.
Story's Period VI, Collins' Period H, Dibble's Blue Hills Period, Shafer's Devils
Interval
During the Blue Hills period, the Lower Pecos region seems to lose its regional
insularity. The most common dart point styles, Ensor and Frio, are shared across a
much larger area than were their predecessors. In addition, the radiocarbon dates
overlap those for the preceding Flanders period, showing the mixture of Ensor, Frio,
Shumla, and Marcos projectile points at about 2300 years ago (Table 1.11). The
several dates from Arenosa Shelter span almost 1000 years and Ensor points continue
in mixed strata with arrow points up until 500 years ago.

This difficulty in clearly separating the cultural manifestations of the Blue Hills
period from the preceding Flanders period is mirrored in Shafer'S lumping of both
and the Cibola period into his Devils Interval. According to Bryant (1966), the trend
to aridity, which resumed at the end of the Cibola period, continued. Bundled burials,
the corpse bound in a fetal position and wrapped in layers of matting, may be a trait
that distinguishes the Blue Hills period. Since the last summary of the known burials
from the Lower Pecos region (Turpin 1988), several additional radiocarbon dates on
bundled burials, especially infants, have been obtained. The materials dated are wood
or desert succulents that were buried as grave goods but in all cases the burials were
exhumed 30 to 50 years ago and true proveniences are now but a matter of memory.
The d13C corrected dates are erratic and the sample is still insufficient to clarify the
chronological extent of the this particular mortuary practice.

Radiocarbon Chronology I 35

LATE PREHISTORIC: 1320-450 B.P.
Story's Period VII, Collins' Period J, Dibble's Flecha Period, Shafer's Comstock
Interval

The Flecha period, as the name implies, signals the adoption of the bow and
arrow, the traditional hallmark of the Late Prehistoric period in the general Texas
chronology. Arrow points, the index lithics of the period, first appear with Ensor dart
points in Stratum 2a at Arenosa Shelter, radiocarbon dated to 1320-1440 years ago
(Table 1.12). Next, La Calsada and Cueva de la Zona, both in Nuevo Leon, see the
advent of arrow points in strata dated to the range from 1240 to 970 years ago. Arrow
points were also recovered from dated strata at Centipede Cave, the Perry Calk and
Sotol sites, Skyline Shelter, and the Cammack sotol pit. Although Ensor dart points
are consistently reported in the same context as arrow points throughout the Flecha
period, arrow points dominate the assemblages at Cueva de la Zona after about 1000
years ago. It is, however, very difficult to sequence the various arrow point styles
identified in the region. While McClurkan (1966) reported only unstemmed arrow
points from Cueva de la Zona in Nuevo Leon, sites north of the Rio Grande produced
stemmed and unstemmed types.
The change in technology and economic strategies implied by the introduction
of the bow and arrow is accompanied by several other intrusive traits. A new approach
to parietal art, the Red Monochrome style, shows human beings carrying bows and
arrows, placing it securely within the Flecha period (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967).
Similar paintings have been documented in the Big Bend area but it is impossible to
determine which came first.
Another imported trait is a change in mortuary customs. Cairn burials on high
promontories are more common north of the Lower Pecos region. The only cairn
excavated to date produced two arrow points and two dart points, again illustrating
the overlap of the index lithics from different periods (Turpin 1982). One burial dates
late in the Flecha period. A child was interred in a rock shelter grave outlined by
sotol stalks, on a prickly pear bed, covered with an antelope skin robe and large rocks.
and accompanied by a bone awl and large mussel shells. Although the burial is flexed,
the body was not bound and wrapped as was the habit in the earlier bundle burials.
Ring middens, crescentic scatters or piles of burned rock, are another site type
that consistently dates to the Flecha or later periods (Greer 1968a,b; Luke 1983).
Some caution is introduced by the frequent mixture of all ages of projectile point styles
on these open sites and by the common sense observation that charcoal is less likely
to survive for long periods of time in such a context (Varner 1967). Nevertheless, this
particular configuration of burned rock results from ethnographically described cook­
ing practices, consistent with its relatively recent age in the Lower Pecos region (see
Brown, this volume, for further discussion).
In Bryant's (1966) climatic model, the Flecha period is a continuation of the Juno
stage, a drying trend which he and Shafer saw as persisting until modern times. The
Juno stage equates to Shafer's Comstock Interval, which also encompasses the period
from A.D. 900 to 1600. However, between A.D. 1000 and 1200 or, in terms of

radiocarbon years, about 750 years ago, many areas of North America were stricken
by extreme drought to the detriment of many marginal agricultural populations
(Bryson and Murray 1977). Shortly thereafter, the northern hemisphere as a whole
experienced a cool period often called the Little Ice Age. The result was a wholesale
reduction in temperature and increase in moisture. Cultures collapsed, migrated,
abandoned familiar territories all over North America and it is unlikely that the Lower
Pecos escaped either the direct or reciprocal effects of such dramatic events (Bryson
and Murray 1977; Gunn and Adams 1981; see Bamforth 1990 for a moderating view).
Many dry rock shelters, the favorite subject of intensive archeological analysis,
lack substantial Flecha period deposits and the uppermost strata are often highly
disturbed. Their research potential seems negligible when compared to the deeper
Archaic deposits so it is not surprising that this period has received little research
attention until lately. Again, it is tempting to attribute the changes in art styles,
mortuary practices, site types, settlement patterns and technology, to the movement
of people, perhaps precipitated by events that transcend the regional scale. Unfor­
tunately, at present we cannot correlate these various events locally, much less
demonstrate any causative factors.
LATE PREHISTORIC: Estimated 450 to 250 B.P.
Story's Period VII, Collins' Period J, Dibble's Infierno Phase, Shafer's Comstock
Interval
The Infierno phase is here subsumed under the Late Prehistoric or Flecha period
because although 15 radiocarbon dates fall within its estimated span (Table 1.1), only
one is at all relevant to the cultural phenomena that define this period (Table 1.11).

Radiocarbon Chronology I 37

Despite the lack of absolute dates, of all the Lower Pecos time periods, Infierno comes
the closest to meeting Willey and Phillips definition of a phase:
... an archaeological unit possessing traits sufficiently characteristic to
distinguish it from all other units similarly conceived, whether of the
same or similar cultures or civilizations, spatially limited in the order of
magnitude to a locality or region and chronologically limited to a
relatively brief period of time (Willey and Phillips 1958:22; see also
Johnson 1986).
The hallmark of the Infiemo phase is a tool kit composed of small stemmed
arrow points, steeply beveled end scrapers, prismatic blades, and plain brown
ceramics. These artifacts are tightly associated with stone circles that are presumably
the remnants of pole supports for hide or brush huts. These sites characteristically
are found on high promontories adjacent to a reliable water source.
A casual observer would probably align the Infierno phase with the Toyah phase
of Central Texas because of the superficial similarity in index artifacts when there are
major differences between the two. In this case, the construction of regional
chronologies has helped keep the two distinct.
The Infierno phase is assumed to be proto historic, largely because the ceramics,
which have been found at only about a dozen sites in the Lower Pecos and northern
Mexico, are very similar to one type recorded at the Apache mission of San Lorenzo
de la Santa Cruz (Tunnell and Newcomb 1969). At the Soto1 Site in Crockett County,
two sherds were recovered from a stratum that dated to the range from 460 to 340
years ago (A.D. 1436-1617, calibrated). One of the ceramic fragments was grey
micaceous ware entirely unlike the pottery found on Infierno sites; the other was listed
as a small piece of plain brown ware (Lorrain 1968), a description that could apply to
the Infierno ceramics as well as many other wares.
By far the majority of the radiocarbon dates that fall within the projected span
of the Infierno phase were derived from hearths and ring middens. Two samples date
the cremation of an adult male whose remains were then deposited in a sinkhole; this
interment, however, can not be attributed to Infierno phase people.
Neither Shafer nor Bryant recognize any cultural or climatic disjunctions be­
tween the end of the Cibola period (ca. 2400 B.P.) and the traditional date for the start
of the historic period, A.D. 1600 (Bryant and Shafer 1977). The ethnohistoric
evidence, however, clearly indicates that at the time of European contact the Lower
Pecos environment was once again capable of sustaining migratory bison who ap­
parently moved south to the Rio Grande, probably during the winter (Turpin 1987).
This period of climatic clemency minimally lasted from the 1580s, the time of first
written records, until the 1880s. Presumably, this mesic interlude was in effect in
protohistoric times, enduring until about the time of the final eradication of all Native
Americans in this region.

HISTORIC: post-A.D. 1600,350 B.P.
Story's Period VIII

Until recently, little attention has been given to the Native Americans that
peopled the Lower Pecos region after the Spanish conquest so their occupation was
drably identified as the historic period by all the chronologists. Ethnohistory and
history, however, can be used to subdivide this period into four units, depending upon
which government's flag flew over Texas and which Plains Indian tribe was winning
their internecine war (Turpin 1989). At present, aboriginal sites from this period
consist largely of rock art panels with little or no accompanying occupational debris
so radiocarbon dating has had little effect on the chronology of the historic period.
Summary

This review demonstrates that several periods within the local chronology are
poorly supported by the current inventory of radiocarbon assays. This, however, does
not invalidate the proposed sequence but rather points out areas where radiocarbon
resources should be concentrated when the opportunity is presented. For example,
the small sample size for the immediate post-Pleistocene occupations is a persistent
problem that cannot be rectified until more deposits of Paleoindian age are excavated,
not a simple task under the current climate of funding for archeological studies.
However, since it is currently fashionable to abjure the traditional view of Paleo in­
dians as big-game hunters, this time period in the Lower Pecos is an arena for studying
the potential range of diversity in human adaptation.
At present, there is very little justification for the proliferation of names and
numbers for what is and has been essentially the Early Archaic period for over 30
years. The copious dates are poorly supported by information on their specific
associations. Many of the index lithics are shared with adjacent regions (Hester 1986;
Johnson, in press; Turner and Hester 1985) despite their more recent christening with
local type names. The unrealistic length of the period suggests that refinement into
more meaningful units is possible when and if more sites of this age are analyzed.
Division of the subsequent Middle Archaic period into two parts is justified by
radiocarbon dates and their associations. The index lithics provide an excellent
avenue for studying the extent of cultural interaction because they are so uniquely
characteristic of this region. The periods that are traditionally considered Middle
Archaic, Eagle Nest and San Felipe, are fairly well-supported by the radiocarbon
inventory so the task at hand is to enlarge upon the social and environmental context,
especially through the testing of hypotheses concerning increased regionalization and
population density, factors critical to the reconstruction of Lower Pecos social struc­
ture and ideology (see Brown, this report).
The Cibola period is clearly a disjunction in the cultural trajectory and one that
is again well-supported by radiocarbon assays. Environmentally and economically,
this time span sees a broadening of interaction, this time probably through the
movements of people, thus requiring that regional chronologies be bridged.

~--~-----------------

-------------~

Radiocarbon Chronology I 39

The difficulty comes in the subsequent Flanders period where the sample size is
small and erratic. There is no doubt that stratigraphic deposits bearing the index
lithics of this period exist; unfortunately, many of the most substantial deposits of this
age were never dated (Nunley, Duffield, and Jelks 1965). The considerable overlap
that exists between the Flanders and Blue Hills periods can only be resolved by more
precise dating of upper strata in excavated sites, but few if any Lower Pecos sites have
escaped profound vandalism of those very deposits. This same problem is com­
pounded in Flecha period sites and deposits which are even rarer and more vulnerable
to vandalism. The difficulties in dating open sites will continue to plague radiocarbon
definition of the Flecha period and Infierno phase.
In summary, then, the scant evidence to date supports the view that the Paleoin­
dian period can indeed be locally divided into subsets corresponding to the Aurora,
Bonfire, and Oriente periods as suggested by Dibble. Some 3000 to 4000 years later,
the Middle Archaic period again merits subdivision because of the association be­
tween radiocarbon dates, index lithics, and possible adaptive changes in cultural
patterns. Immediately thereafter, the Cibola period should be extracted from the
generic Late Archaic period on the basis of index tithics, economics, and environment.
Although less clearly defined by the radiocarbon inventory, the time-honored Late
Prehistoric or Flecha period is identified by a wide number of traits, ranging from
feature and artifact types to art styles. The salient characteristic of all these identifi­
able periods is that they are defined by more than just the presence of specific stone
tool types, making them more tangible reflections of cultural processes.
The vagaries of the radiocarbon record do not negate the other proposed
divisions which are probably no less real if only because such experienced ar­
cheologists as Dibble, Collins, and Story are unlikely to err in concert. In addition,
the Infierno phase of protohistoric times is a discrete episode separable from the Late
Prehistoric period but this separate identity is not reflected in the radiocarbon series
that are the subject of this paper. The implication is that more precise radiocarbon
dating and rigorous analyses will be needed to improve the validity of this particular
data set. It should be noted here, however, that archeological expectations may well
exceed the interpretive potential of the sites being dated and of the radiocarbon
dating process itself.
The Utility of This Regional Chronology
The issue of regional chronologies, addressed by both Johnson (1986) and Hester
(1986), is at face value a problem in semantics. Archeology, like most disciplines, has
seen a exponential increase in basic information, producing myriad entities that must
somehow be codified in a manner that can be recognized by other members of the
discipline. The proliferation in names-for projectile points, ceramic types, culture
areas, time periods, interaction spheres, horizon styles, environmental episodes - is
directly related to the need to communicate information. Forty years ago, recognition
of this trend prompted Willey and Phillips. among others, to establish a nomenclature
intended to clarify meanings so that names for concepts were standardized. Although

much of their later evolutionary scheme for cultural development is obsolete, their
related set of definitions usefully specify the temporal and spatial implications of their
terms (Johnson 1986). In terms of Lower Pecos chronologies, for example, Shafer's
intervals meet Willey and Phillips (1985:25) definition of a local sequence because,
with the exception of the Clovis interval, they represent "a chronological series of
components, phases, or subphases within the geographical limits of a locality", in this
case Hinds Cave. Periods or phases, such as the Infierno phase, that are not evident
at Hinds Cave have been omitted from this chronology but they can be integrated
through the means of regional chronology.
When local sequences, "which are the very stuff of archaeology" according to
Willey and Phillips (1958: 25), are correlated, they produce regional chronologies and
it is here that zealotry introduces the areal biases and tunnel vision discussed by
Hester (1986). The proliferation of period names is reminiscent of a fervor that swept
through typology a decade ago, resulting in genetic trees of projectile point styles and
the editorial affectation of italicizing type names as though they were scientific
notations for genus and species. Just as the biological approach to projectile point
typology strains the credulity of most reasonable archeologists, so does the myopia of
scholarly ethnocentrism. It is, however, difficult to find a substitute for the naming
process as more and more information needs to be sorted and classified. For example,
in this paper alone, one environmental interlude and four divisions of the historic
aboriginal period have been discussed but not named. The horns of this dilemma are
the broad sweep of the traditional chronology as opposed to the pincushion prolifera­
tion of period names.
In the case of the Lower Pecos, the regional chronology is important for estab­
lishing the parameters of regional phenomena. The careful examination of the
regional sequence in turn identified a number of extra-local traits that provide bridges
to other regional chronologies. Thus, the flaws lie not in the constructs, which are
essentially passive, but in their active application by archeologists.
Finally, we are left with one of those great contradictions - the ultimate goal of
the broad perspective is only gained from a platform constructed of individual data
items. This review began during my attempt to estimate the possible age range of
prehistoric pictographs in the Lower Pecos region, essentially to better understand
hunter and gatherer ideology and aesthetics. It culminated in a recognition of several
weaknesses in what was purported to be one of the best developed chronologies in
North America and one that is essential to reconstructing the cultural system that
produced one of the world's great religious art styles. It is unlikely that the complexity
of the human mind and spirit can be explored unless the basic context has been
developed and agreed upon.

THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF
LANGTRY VARIANTS FROM ARENOSA SHELTER,
VAL VERDE COUNTY, TEXAS
Leland C. Bement

Abstract
A sample of dart points recovered from Middle Archaic-age deposits in Arenosa
Shelter, 41VV99, was statistically analyzed to determine if three generally recognized
variations of the Langtry type were, in fact, sufficiently distinct to warrant division
into separate types. Discriminant function and F-test of variance segregated the
sample into three distinct morphological groups: the previously defined Langtry and
Val Verde types, and a third contracting stem form named Arenosa after the origin of
the sample analyzed here. Fracture pattern analysis verified the common function of
all three groups as projectile points. Type descriptions based on the discriminating
variables are presented for the Langtry, Val Verde, and newly defined Arenosa types.

Introduction
This paper addresses the typological validity of variants of the Langtry dart point
style as defined by Schuetz (1956). In 1956, in her analysis of Val Verde County cave
materials from Shumla, Jacal, and Eagle caves, Schuetz (1956:129-160) divided the
Langtry type into four varieties. The first group, "typical" Langtry dart points, fits the
classification description provided in Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954:438):
Outline: Triangular blade with edges straight to concave or recurved,
seldom convex, which is unique among Texas dart-point types. Usually
exceedingly thin and finely chipped, even the largest ones. Shoulders
prominent to widely outflaring, often uneven; barbs may sweep widely
outward. Stems long, contracting, at times nearlyparaUel-edged or even
expanding slightly. Bases are usually concave, even when stem contracts
strongly, but may be straight or (rarely) convex. Possibly more than one
type is represented, but features intergrade so that separation difficult.
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 7 cm., average about 6 cm. Maxi­
mum width across shoulders about 2.2 to 4 cm. Base.6 to 1.6 cm. wide.
Stem often 1/2 total length but ranges to 1/4 .
Even this description notes that more than one type might be present in the sample,
setting a precedent for Schuetz's segregation of the type into four varieties, retaining
the Langtry type description and name for the first variety.
Schuetz provisionally named her second variant "Val Verde" describing it as:

The stems of this group are flared at the tips and, in addition, are
beveled, usually on the right side of each face although occasionally on
the left. Their length varies from 3.5 to 7 em., their width from 1.9 to
3.5 cm. at the shoulders (Schuetz 1956:141).
Her third group was also defined by stem attributes. This deviant form has
contracting stems with pointed bases and is referred to hereafter as Variant 3.
Beveled contracting stems characterize a minor fourth category, which is subsumed
under the Langtry type in this analysis. Workmanship on all specimens is very fine
and consistent.
The Val Verde type name for the expanding stem Langtry variant was not
generally accepted until much later. In fact, Johnson's landmark publication of the
excavations at the Devils Mouth Site some eight years later does not utilize the Val
Verde name even though expanding stem varieties were identified as Langtry Variety
II and familiarity with Schuetz's work is displayed in the references (Johnson 1964:38.
39). The low frequency (n = 5) of expanding stem specimens at Devils Mouth probab­
ly explains his adherence to the established type-variety concept. The numerous sites
analyzed by Schuetz provided a much larger sample of this general type. Important
to this discussion is that, to date, no single Val Verde component site or deposit has
been excavated.
The Site

Arenosa Shelter, 41VV99, is a deeply stratified rock shelter on the right (west)
bank of the Pecos River, 1 km above its confluence with the Rio Grande
(Frontispiece). When excavated in the 1960s as part of the Amistad salvage program,
the site, which had been buried by alluvium deposited during flood stages of the Pecos
River, contained 43 distinct strata ranging from late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric
in age (Dibble 1967; Patton and Dibble 1982). Cultural strata were sealed by sterile
alluvium laid down during flood episodes, thus preserving a stratigraphic record of
characteristic tool types augmented by radiocarbon dates that form the basis of a
12-part chronology proposed by Dibble (see Turpin: Table 1.1, this report). Of
interest here are Middle Archaic strata 20-23.
The Sample

Arenosa Shelter Middle Archaic levels 20-23 yielded 101 projectile points that
were used in this analysis (Dibble 1967). Uncalibrated radiocarbon dates obtained
from charcoal in these levels range from 3220±70 years B.P. (TX 701) in stratum 21
to 3600±70 years B.P. (TX 1975) in stratum 23 (Patton and Dibble 1982; see Turpin:
Table 1.1, this report). The sample consists of all stemmed projectile points, including
whole and fragmentary specimens, from these strata.
An attribute list consisting of nominal, presence/absence, and linear variables
was devised following the form used by Gunn and Prewitt (1975). Their list was

-~--

Langtry Variants / 53

expanded to include other variables that might be significant in determining the
defining characteristics of the Langtry and Val Verde point types, including all at­
tributes noted in both Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) and Schuetz (1956). A total
of 28 variables, 12 linear, 14 presence/absence, and 2 nominal, were encoded for each
artifact. Linear measurements were obtained directly using calipers or indirectly by
measuring the xeroxed image on a form after a consistent 1% reduction to eliminate
the expansion inherent in this process (Fig. 2.1).
The first variable is a specimen identifier; in this instance, lot numbers were
used. The next 12 variables are linear measurements of length, width, thickness, and
angles of blade and haft elements. Following these are 16 presence/absence variables
describing edge and base treatment such as bevelling, grinding, notching, and fracture
pattern. Once the basic analysis sheet was set up, all projectile points were xeroxed
and two dimensional measurements taken. Angles were marked on the xerox, par­
ticularly the haft angle which relied upon intersecting lines. Thickness measurements
and all presence/absence variables were coded with the artifact in hand.
The variable list is biased toward the specific problem of typological variation
and does not include such categories as material type, burning or annealing, or use
wear. The fracture pattern variable was coded but was not included in the various
inferential statistical tests.
Analysis
Each of the three Langtry varieties was assigned a group number to identify the
a priori group required by discriminant function analysis. Specimens were classified
according to the descriptions provided by Schuetz (1956): 1 = Langtry, 2 = Val Verde,
and 3 = Variant 3. Untyped specimens were coded as O. All cases were entered into
the University of Texas at Austin CDC computer in preparation for statistical analysis
using the SPSS software package (Nie et al. 1970).
The frequency of cases for each variable was. first determined by condescriptive
analysis which provided means and standard deviations, distributional scores for
skewness and kurtosis, and the number of cases with missing values for each variable.
This information was important to the evaluation of variables included in subsequent
analyses to determine the normality of their distribution.
DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

Discriminant analysis (Nie et al. 1970) was chosen as most appropriate to the
problem of determining the difference between the three variants of Langtry projec­
tile points. In this analysis, variables that force the classes apart were selected and
each case was then scored and plotted in statistical space accordingly. Stepwise
discriminant analysis orders the variables by their discriminating power, thus iden­
tifying the attributes that contribute the most to the uniqueness of each group.

Langtry Variants / 55

During the first run, a sample of 75 projectile points was used. This initial sample
consisted of only Langtry and Val Verde dart points; Variant 3 was added later. In this
first stepwise discriminant analysis, eight steps, and thus eight variables, were utilized
to group all 75 cases. All specimens previously identified as either Langtry or Val
Verde were correctly classified using these eight variables. The discriminating
variables, in order of rank, were neck angle, haft angle, haft length, barb length,
alternating bevel, blade bevelling, neck to base bevelling, and blade width. Five of
these are linear measurements and three are presence/absence. Of the 38 cases not
previously assigned to either type, 21 were grouped with Langtry and 17 with Val
Verde. With a test of variance (F) figured at 33.736 at a significance of .0000 with a
cutoff of 5.28 at .01 (Blalock 1972:571) between the two groups, this analysis supports
the hypothesis that Val Verde points should be considered a distinct projectile point
type. However, when the artifacts included in the Val Verde grouping were
re-examined, it became apparent that many cases were being assigned to this group
based largely on longer haft length.
At this point, the Variant 3 specimens were added to the analysis, increasing the
sample size and providing yet another a priori group. With the expanded sample size,
the stepwise discriminant function utilized 15 steps to group a11101 cases with 98.15%
of the previously identified cases correctly assigned. A single Langtry case was shifted
to the Variant 3 group, accounting for the less than 2% discrepancy in identification.
The ranking of variables in the IS-step analysis differed from the 8-step order
(Table 2.1). Haft width replaced neck angle as the variable with the most discriminat­
ing power. Step 2 remained the same, utilizing haft angle. Step 3 changed from the
misleading haft length variable to the more consistent alternating bevel variable. Haft
length did not appear in the 15-step analysis until step 12, thus no longer influencing
most of the classification.
Prior to the analysis. 54 cases were assigned to one of the three groups, Langtry,
Val Verde, and Variant 3. The discriminant analysis distributed the remaining 47
untyped cases among these three groups with counts of 19 Langtry, 17 Val Verde, and
11 Variant 3. As previously mentioned, one Langtry was reassigned to the Variant 3
group.
Utilizing the F-statistic, the variance between the three groups was measured.
All F-values calculated were larger than the 2.87 one-tail cutoff at .01 stated for the
analysis with 15 and 37 degrees of freedom (Blalock 1972:571). As seen in Table 2.2,
all values are highly significant to .0000 and are well over the 2.87 cutoff. This analysis
confirms that Val Verde dart points are indeed distinct from Langtry dart points.
More importantly, Variant 3 differs significantly from both the Langtry and Val Verde
types. The plotting of all cases, according to this analysis, forms three distinct
groupings around separate centroids (Fig. 2.2).
In order to substantiate these results, another path of analysis was taken. First,
variables defined by Gunn and Prewitt (1975) as the most significant in typing
projectile points were selected: haft angle, base depth, neck width, haft length, neck

much less, yet still significant at 12.043. All scores exceed the one tail cutoff of7.14

The relative closeness of the Variant 3 and Langtry groups is, in part, biased by
the variables selected by the Gunn and Prewitt analysis. For example, the variable
haft angle has overlapping values for Langtry and Variant 3 groups at 1 standard
deviation - 70± 12 and 79±9 - but neither comes close to the Val Verde measure of
103±11. The only Gunn and Prewitt variable that reverses this trend is the base depth
measurement (Step 2) in which the Langtry and Val Verde measurements actually
overlap and the Variant 3 group is disparate.
Combined, these analyses show that the Val Verde and Variant 3 groups are
significantly different from the Langtry group and from each other. Thus, segregation
of these groups is supported on a statistical basis.
OBJECTIVE-SUBJECTIVE REALITY OF TYPE

The discriminant function analysis is an objective measure of the difference
between groups of cases defined by linear and presence/absence variables. During
the analysis, a centroid was identified for each group by the canonical discriminant
functions. Those projectile points with discriminant scores nearest to the centroid
should, in a purely objective way, be the epitome of that group or type. To test this,
a single projectile point, thought to be the typical specimen for each group, was
selected by the analyst prior to the identification of each case according to its
discriminant score (Fig. 2.3a-c). Each selected "typical" specimen was then identified
in the two variant mappings of all cases (Fig. 2.2). All three specimens identified by
the analyst as epitomes of each type actually appeared on the periphery of the
groupings. In fact, for groups 2 and 3 (Val Verde and Variant 3), these specimens are
the most distant members of both groups. The "typical" Langtry has the second
greatest linear distance possible between cases in the Langtry group and either the
Val Verde or Variant 3 groups.

A case nearest the centroid of each group, representing the "average" specimen,
was then selected and placed under the "typical" specimen (Fig. 2.3d-f). The at­
tributes of each of these specimens were compared to the others from that group. The
result was that each "typical" case had more attributes of the type than did the
near-centroid specimens. Thus, the analyst's "typical" case is, in effect, the extreme;
the classic example of the type, probably nearing the mental template for that
particular type. The typical mental template specimen is the embodiment of all
discriminating attributes for a type, but the majority of specimens within a type, and
those about the centroid, possess a subset of these discriminating attributes, although
retaining a significance level of variance with specimens of other types.
FRACTURE ANALYSIS

A cross tabs statistic was utilized to quantify fracture patterns, a nominal variable,
according to type (Langtry, Val Verde, Variant 3). Three broad groups were defined
on the basis of fracture morphology: use, manufacture, and unidentifiable fracture.
The last type includes post-depositional breaks caused by excavation or natural forces.
Fracture pattern causes were identified by comparison with breaks obtained through
the experimental use and manufacture of projectile points (Odell and Cowan 1986;
Bement et al. 1989). Of the Arenosa sample used in this study, 47.5% were complete
specimens (Table 2.4). An additional 32.7% fractured from use as projectile points;
only 4% of the breaks were attributable to manufacture. The remaining 15.8% could
not be attributed to either factor. The breakdown of the fracture patterns by type
(Table 2.4) shows that all three a priori groups contained specimens with fractures
attributable to use as projectile points and only one Variant 3 specimen was broken
during manufacture. The largest number of manufacture breaks were on specimens
plotted centrally between the group centroids during discriminant analysis. This
indicates that manufacture failure occurred prior to final shaping of specimens,
especially, final bevelling or stem retouch.
All three groups identified through discriminant analysis contain completed,
utilized specimens, providing added evidence that prehistoric knappers purposefully
produced three distinct types within the general technology of the Middle Archaic
period. Variant 3 is thus a statistically valid type equivalent to the Langtry and Val
Verde types. Based on the origin of the sample used in the analysis, Variant 3 is most
appropriately named Arenosa.

LANGTRY

Projectile points of the Langtry type have blades that range from 3A to 4A em
long, 2.9 to 3.8 em wide, and OA5 to 0.63 em thick. The shoulders are square or may
have short, pointed barbs less than 2 em long. The stems contract at angles ranging
from 97 to 105 degrees and are from 1.4 to 2A em long, 0.8 to 1.2 em wide and OA7 to
0.64 em thick. The bases are from 1.6 to 2.3 em wide, with concavities from 0.05 to
0.2 em deep. The stem edges are alternately bevelled and the concavity in the base
is also bevelled. The haft angle, defined as the angle of intersection of lines drawn
through the neck of the stem, ranges from 58 to 82 degrees, with a mean of 70 degrees.
VAL VERDE

Specimens of this type have blades 2.7 to 4.0 em long, 2.2 to 2.9 em wide, and OA
to 0.6 em thick. Shoulders flare outward due to a reeurved stem that expands to the
base. The stem is from 1.2 to 1.6 cm long and 0.35 to OA9 em thick, expanding to a
base from 1.0 to 1.6 em wide. The base is concave with a depth ranging from 0.03 to
0.17 em. Stem and base treatment vary from alternately bevelled, to stem edges
bevelled to one surface and the base to the other, or both stem edges and base bevelled

62 I Bement

to the same surface. The haft angle for this type ranges from 91.8 to 113.2 degrees
with a mean of 102.5 degrees.

ARENOSA
Specimens of the Arenosa type have blades that range from 2.8 to 4.4 cm long,
2.3 to 3.2 cm wide and 0.5 to 0.7 cm thick. Shoulders are square although occasionally
have incipient barbs. Stems contract at 96 to 106 degree angles with lengths ranging
from 1.6 to 2.0 cm. The bases are from 0.5 to 0.7 cm wide and convex to pointed,
adding from 0.06 to 0.08 cm to the length of the stem. Stems and bases are not usually
bevelled; however, both alternate and stem opposite the base bevelling were noted.
Haft angles ranged from 70 to 87 degrees with a mean of 79 degrees.
Conclusion

The objectivity of the discriminant function confirms the more subjective
division of the Langtry type into Langtry and Val Verde types, as suggested by Schuetz.
The analysis has also isolated a third group that has often been described as a variety
of the Langtry type, but which was never proven to be sufficiently cohesive to warrant
type status. The F-statistic of variances substantiates the discriminant results of the
three distinct groups to a significance of .0000 and justifies assigning the type name
Arenosa to this third group. Morphological analysis of fractures in blade elements of
specimens from all three groups indicates their functional equivalence as completed
and used projectile points.
At various junctures in this analysis, the artifacts and original measurement
sheets were consulted to provide a three-dimensional verification or, at least, illustra­
tion of the analytical groups being defined. This return to the artifact proved useful
in identifying biases or misrepresentations attributable to small sample size or weakly
discriminating variables. One of the purposes for selecting a sample from an ex­
cavated context, rather than compiling measurements from various typed groups, was
to observe the interaction between the typology construct of the archeologist and the
innate variation within an ancient tool class.
Although defining new projectile point types has been frowned upon in recent
years by the archeological community, such practices are still necessary as a means of
establishing a shorthand reference to a set of characteristics with suspected cultural
significance. Recently, points with the characteristics of the Arenosa type have been
found in the Big Bend region of Texas (Robert J. Mallouf, personal communication).
There, they are called Langtry variants, reminiscent of the Arenosa type, or some­
times, lora points after Taylor's (1966:Fig. 3) definition from Coahuila, Mexico.
When found in undated contexts, these dart points have been used to assign a Middle
Archaic age to the site. The age of the Langtry, Val Verde, and Arenosa types is
established and co-terminous. If specimens similar to the Arenosa type are found in
the trans-Pecos to the exclusion of the Langtry and Val Verde types, then important
cultural implications arise.

Langtry Variants I 63

Establishing the Langtry Variant 3 as a new type, the Arenosa dart point type,
forces scrutiny of the specimens now identified in the Big Bend region as possible
Langtry points, and provides an avenue to investigate the possible cultural division
between the lower Pecos Langtry groups to the east and the Jora groups to the south.
This analysis has defined a distinct set of variables that discriminate between the
Arenosa and Langtry types, setting the stage for a similar analysis of J ora specimens.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECTILE POINTS
FROM THE 1932 EXCAVATION OF
FATE BELL ROCKSHELTER
lay Peck

Abstract

Projectile points recovered during the 1932 excavation of Fate Bell Rockshelter
are analyzed and catagorized. Proposed sequences of cultural evolution in the Lower
Pecos Region are reviewed. Fate Belllithics are compared with and organized around
sequences developed on stratified and radiocarbon-dated excavations at other impor­
tant sites in the region.
Introduction

Fate Bell Rockshelter, 41VV74, is located at the northern end of the main branch
of Seminole Canyon which leads into the Rio Grande River a few miles east of the
mouth of the Pecos River (Frontispiece). Within the canyon system (including Semi­
nole, West, Infierno, and Presa canyons) are up to 100 sites, many of them rockshelters
exhibiting spectacular rock paintings. Fate Bell Rockshelter is the site of the only
major excavation done in Seminole Canyon. This took place late in 1932 under the
direction of A.T. Jackson (Pearce and Jackson 1933). Three test pits were later
excavated in 1963 by Mark Parsons (1965) and these two projects are the extent of
excavation at this site.
Jackson chose Fate Bell because it is the largest shelter in Seminole Canyon and
was at the time relatively undisturbed. The shelter extends 454 feet north-south and
is 98 feet east-west at its deepest point.
Among cultural remains found during this excavation were manos, metates,
uniface and biface tools, bone and antler tools, painted pebbles, and fortunately,
preserved perishables such as baskets, mats, cordage and sandals, 1495 unbroken
projectile points and 1624 broken projectile points. The present count of surviving
projectile points is as follows:
937 unbroken, or whole enough to identify, dart points
oarrow points
35 broken points which appear to be of the Shumla type
181 points fragmentary enough to preclude identification
66 preforms
As to what caused the attrition in this collection over the last 56 years we can
only speculate. Many of the broken, unidentifiable specimens are numbered and we

65

66 I Peck

must assume that an unknown percentage of the originally unbroken points have
moved into this category. More have probably been lost or stolen over the decades.
Because of these losses, strict statistical analysis is not appropriate to this collection.
In the analysis, the points were first ordered purely by morphology. These
catagories were compared with illustrations and diagnostic attributes from A Hand­
book of Texas Archeology: IYpe Descriptions (Suhm and Jelks 1962) and A Field Guide
to Stone Artifacts of Texas Indians (Turner and Hester 1985). All groupings were then
compared with those in studies of the major sites in the Lower Pecos region: Eagle
Cave (Ross 1965), Parida Cave (Alexander 1970), Baker Cave (Word and Douglas
1970), and Devil's Mouth (Johnson 1964). Where possible, direct comparisons were
made with the actual collections from these sites housed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.
The Projectile Points
In total, 937 projectile points were analyzed. Because the bases of projectile
points are diagnostically critical, those broken specimens with missing bases were
disregarded. Specimens from the other sites compared within the Lower Pecos region
have been assigned names which in some cases are types characteristic of other
regions. In order to avoid further confusion projectile points of the Fate Bell collec­
tion have been ordered by "Form" and assigned numbers. Dimension ranges of all
forms are listed in Table 3.1.
FORM 1 (Fig. 3.1a; n = 65)

Large, wide, thick and crude points. Shape is generally triangular with straight
to excurvate lateral edges. Stem is short and contracting; base is rounded. Shoulders
are rounded with barbs only in a few examples. These conform to the Almagre type
(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Ross 1965; Johnson 1964; Word and
Douglas 1970). Due to shape and general crudeness they appear to be preforms for
Langtry points.
FORM 2 (Fig. 3.1h; n=2)

Well made, triangular points with barbs formed by deep corner notching. Stem
is slightly expanding with flat base. Lateral edges are straight. These coincide with
the Arledge type which Greer (1966) places within the Langtry-Shumla time frame.
FORM 3 (Fig. 3.1c; n =4)

Thick, relatively crude points with strong barbs and bifurcated base; excurvate
lateral edges and widely expanding stems. These conform to the Baker type (Turner
and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970).

Fate Bell Rockshelter / 69

FORM 4 (Fig. 3.1d; n = 10)

Most are thin and well made with excurvate lateral edges and strong barbs
formed by corner or basal notching. Base is expanding and "fishtail" or biconvex.
These conform to the Bandy type, which is also known as Martindale in south Texas
(Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970).
FORM 5 (Fig. 3.le; n = 2)

Lanceolate blades with short barbs and slightly excurvate lateral edges. Stems
are slightly contracting and have straight, wedged bases. These resemble the Bul­
verde type (Turner and Hester 1985; Johnson 1964; Alexander 1970).
FORM 6 (Fig. 3.lf; n= 14)

Generally large and triangular with excurvate lateral edges. Stems expanding
and bases convex. Barbs are strong and formed by basal notching, sometimes corner­
notched. Workmanship is very good. These conform to the Castroville type (Suhm
and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970).
FORM 7 (Fig. 3.lg, n=3)

Lozenge shaped with blade to stem ratio of 5 to 3. No shoulders or barb with
rounded base and straight lateral edges. These look like the Desmuke type (Suhm
and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970; Johnson 1964; Ross
1965), however, Michael Collins (personal communication) thinks that at least one is
a reworked Shumla.
FORM 8 (Fig. 3.1h, n= 1)

Small, finely made point of cryptocrystalline flint; excurvate lateral edges, strong
barbs formed by corner notching, flat base, and slightly expanding stem. This is
analogous to the Early Barbed I type (Word and Douglas 1970; Ross 1965).
FORM 9 (Fig. 3.li; n = 1)

1tiangular point with straight, serrated lateral edges and moderate barbs. Base
is rectangular and deeply concave. This conforms to Early Barbed II type (Word and
Douglas 1970; Ross 1965)
FORM 10 (Fig. 3.lj; n = I)

Triangular point with excurvate lateral edges. Base is broken and one barb is
broken. Existing barb is very long and formed by deep basal notching. Point is thin,

70 I Peck

flat and finely made. What exists of this specimen conforms to the general Early
Barbed category (Johnson 1964; Ross 1965).
FORM 11 (Fig. 3.1k; n = 17)

Triangular points with straight to incurvate lateral edges and moderate to long
barbs formed by deep corner notching; stems rectangular to slightly contracting or
expanding; bases concave; lateral edges slightly serrated. These correlate with the
general Early Barbed category (Johnson 1964) and resemble the Shumla type (Form
35).
FORM 12 (Fig. 3.11; n = 4)

Triangular points with straight to barely excurvate lateral edges; bases expanding
and concave. These conform to the general Early Barbed category (Johnson 1964).
FORM 13 (Fig. 3.1m; n = 9)

Isosceles triangle shaped. Thin with slightly excurvate lateral edges and slightly
concave bases; workmanship is good; some beveling of edges. These are coincident
with what has variously been called the Early Triangular type (Turner and Hester
1985); Triangular convex and Triangular concave (Word and Douglas 1970); Tortugas­
like (Alexander 1970); Triangular Dart Points (Johnson 1964).
FORM 14 (Fig. 3.1n; n = 152)

Elongated triangular shaped points with straight to slightly excurvate lateral
edges; deep to shallow side notching with bases generally straight but sometimes
slightly concave or slightly convex; points generally thick exhibiting fair to poor
workmanship. These conform to the Ensor type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and
Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970; Ross 1965; Johnson 1964). This category
includes forms that correspond to some degree to the Paisano type (Kelly 1963).

FORM 19 (Fig. 3.2b; n = 18)

Thick, triangular points with generally straight to slightly incurvate or excurvate
lateral edges; prominent shoulders formed by deep to moderate side notching; stems
expanding and bases concave but not as deeply as Form 18, above. These correlate
with the Frio type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas
1970; Johnson 1964).
FORM 20 (Fig. 3.2c; n = 9)

Thick, crude points with slight shoulders to barbs; stems formed by side or corner
notching with bases resembling "legs" due to extremely deep basal notch. These
conform to the Gower type as illustrated by Turner and Hester (1985) and they are
similar to other points defined as Gower (Shafer 1963) and Group I (Crawford 1965).
FORM 21 (Fig. 3.2d; n = 6)

Elongated triangular points characterized by semi-circular concave bases. These
correspond to the Kinney type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985).

Triangular points with straight to slightly excurvate lateral edges; stems rectan­
gular with straight bases; shoulders prominent and formed by corner notching;
specimens generally thick and crudely produced. These are analogous to the Lange
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Johnson 1964) and Miscel­
laneous Parallel Stem 5 (Ross 1965).

Fate Bell Rockshelter / 73

FORM 23 (Fig. 3.2f; n = 1)

Narrow, long bipoint, slightly wider at one end, careful, even flaking of lateral
edges creating a slight serration. This conforms to the Lerma type (Suhm and Jelks
1962; Epstein 1963; Turner and Hester 1985).
FORM 24 (Fig. 3.2g; n = 18)

Triangular points with convex lateral edges; barbs formed by corner notching;
stems sharply expanding with rounded, convex bases. These coincide with the Marcos
type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970; Ross
1965).
FORM 25 (Fig. 3.2h; n = 94)

Generally triangular points, thin and well made with straight lateral edges;
shoulders are strong, some barbed with barb/haft angle 90 degrees or more; stems
contracting with bases straight or concave; some are beveled with more beveling seen
on stems than on lateral edges. These conform to the Langtry type (Suhm and Jelks
1962; Turner and Hester 1985); Langtry II and IV (Ross 1965); Langtry I and VI (Word
and Douglas 1970); Langtry III (Alexander 1970).

barblhaft angle less than 90 degrees; stems contracting with bases straight, concave,
or slightly rounded. Lateral edges generally straight. These conform to Langtry
(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985); Langtry I (Ross 1965); Langtry II
(Word and Douglas 1970); Langtry II (Alexander 1970). These specimens have been
distinguished from Form 25 due to the difference in barb/haft angle.
FORM 27 (Fig. 3.2j; n = 13)

Generally triangular points, thin and well made, slightly thicker than Forms 25
and 26; all with barbs, with barb/haft angle less than 90 degrees; stems contracting,
all with concave bases; most have beveling on stems. These coincide with Langtry
(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985); Langtry I (Johnson 1964; Alexander
1970). Except for the downturned barbs and concave base these exhibit some Bul­
verde-like characteristics in general shape.
FORM 28 (Fig. 3.2k; n = 16)

Generally triangular points, thin and well made, slightly thicker than Forms 25
and 26; lateral edges generally straight to slightly excurvate; stems contracting with
bases straight or slightly concave; some stems beveled. These conform to Langtry

74/ Peck

(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985); Langtry I (Alexander 1970). Some
specimens in this catagory bear strong resemblance to Bulverde and appear here due
to presence of barbs, barb/haft angle, or contracting stems.
FORM 29 (Fig. 3.21; n = 10)

Generally triangular points, some thin and well made, some thick and irregular;
lateral edges straight to slightly incurvate; stems severely contract, bases almost
pointed; most stems beveled; most are strongly barbed. These correlate with Langtry
(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985); Langtry III (Johnson 1964; Ross
1965); Langtry IV (Word and Douglas 1970). These specimens seem to grade into the
Shumla category. (See Bement, this volume for a complete discussion of Form 29
which he has named the Arenosa type.)
FORM 30 (Fig. 3.2m; n=2)

Triangular points very wide compared to length; lateral edges excurvate;
moderate barbs on both examples; stems slightly expanding with slightly concave
bases. These correlate with the Marshall type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Word and
Douglas 1970; Johnson 1964).
FORM 31 (Fig. 3.2n; n=21)

Generally triangular points; some finely made, most thick and irregular; straight
to convex lateral edges; shoulders to barbs; stems expanding and bases deeply notched
in V or U shape forming little squared off "legs." These conform to the Montell type
(Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Word and Douglas 1970; Johnson
1964; Alexander 1970).

Triangular points with excurvate lateral edges; shoulders prominent with rectan­
gular to expanding stems and straight to convex bases; stems all alternately beveled.
These conform to the Nolan type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester 1985; Ross
1965; Word and Douglas 1970).
FORM 33 (Fig. 3.2p; n = 9)

Triangular points with excurvate lateral edges; strong shoulders formed by side
notching; stems expanding to form rounded bases; points have an overall spade shape.
These are analogous to the Palmillas type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and Hester
1985; Johnson 1964; Word and Douglas 1970; Alexander 1970; Ross 1965).

FORM 34 (Fig. 3.2q; n = 53)

Long slender lanceolate points with excurvate lateral edges; slight shoulders on
most specimens; stems short, rectangular to slightly expanding, with straight or
slightly concave bases. The most characteristic attribute is the twisted appearance
created by alternate beveling of blade edges on both sides and opposite, alternate
beveling of stems. These coincide with the Pandale type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner
and Hester 1985; Ross 1965; Johnson 1964; Word and Douglas 1970; Alexander 1970).
FORM 35 (Fig. 3.3a; n = 56)

Triangular, bell-shaped points with excurvate lateral edges; long barbs formed
by deep basal notching; bases round; very wide in relation to width; stems rectangular
to slightly expanding or slightly contracting. These correlate to the Shumla type
(Turner and Hester 1985; Ross 1965: Word and Douglas 1970; Alexander 1970). Some
of these are finely made and large enough to resemble the Bell type.
FORM 36 (Fig. 3.3b; n=37)

Triangular points with straight, slightly excurvate or slightly incurvate lateral
edges; long barbs formed by corner or basal notching; stems generally rectangular
with straight or rounded bases. Many specimens have serrated lateral edges. These
conform to the Shumla type (Turner and Hester 1985; Ross 1965; Johnson 1964; Word
and Douglas 1970; Alexander 1970) and are quite long in relation to width.
FORM 37 (Fig. 3.3c; n=41)

Triangular points with straight to slightly incurvate or slightly excurvate lateral
edges; strong barbs formed by corner notching; stems slightly expanding with rounded
bases. Most specimens have serrated lateral edges. These correspond with the
Shumla type (Turner and Hester 1985; Ross 1965; Alexander 1970). These points are
considerably smaller than Form 46 and are long in relation to width.
FORM 38 (Fig. 3.3d; n = 21)

Triangular points with straight to excurvate lateral edges; strong barbs formed
by corner notching; stems rectangular with rounded bases. Some specimens have
serrated lateral edges. These conform to the Shumla type (Turner and Hester 1985;
Ross 1965); Shumla Variety II (Johnson 1964). These specimens are much shorter,
wider, and thicker than Form 37.
FORM 39 (Fig. 3.3c; n = 8)

Discussion And Chronology

Among the chronologies of the region with which Fate Bell has been compared
a general agreement is found as to the sequence of point styles. The exact
chronologies differ slightly as to how early or late the periods begin or end but period
markers remain the same. Sequences are divided into five (Ross 1965), six (Word and
Douglas 1970), seven (Alexander 1970), eight (Collins 1969; Johnson 1964; Turpin
1982; Shafer 1986) and twelve (Turpin, this volume) periods (see Figure 1.1). The
following scheme utilizes an eight period sequence for the region.
Period 1. A Paleoindian presence is documented for the sites used here for
comparison as follows:
»

8300 B.C.(14C) - Coontail and Mosquito Caves - Lerma points (Nunley et at.
1965).

»

8200 B.C.(14C) - Bonfire Rockshelter - Folsom and Plainview points
(Dibble and Lorrain 1968).

»

7000 B.C.(14C) - Baker Cave - Plainview Golondrina points (Word and
Douglas 1970); Golondrina (Chadderdon 1983; Hester 1983).

»

7000 B.C. - Devil's Mouth-Golondrina points (Johnson 1964).

»

7000 B.C.(14C) - Centipede and Damp Caves - Lerma points (Epstein 1963).

The present Fate Bell collection exhibits only a slight hint of this early occupation
with the existence of one possible, not classic, Lerma point (Jeremiah Epstein,
personal communication) and two broken bases which, due to well-centered channel
flaking, resemble Plainview type bases. As the lowest levels of occupational strata at
Fate Bell have not been thoroughly investigated it is not possible at this writing to
ascertain a Paleoindian presence at the site.
Period II. The next period in the sequence is characterized by bifurcated base
and barbed styles. This period is referred to as the Early Archaic and is documented
for the sites used here for comparison as follows:
»

6700-4000 B.c.(14C) - Eagle Cave - bifurcated base and Early Barbed (Ross
1965).

»

6500-4000 B.c.(14C) - Baker Cave - Baker, Bandy, and Early Barbed points
(Word and Douglas 1970); Early 'Ii'iangular (Chadderdon 1983; Hester 1983).

»

5000-4000 B.C.-Devil's Mouth-Early Barbed points (Johnson 1964).

This period is represented at Fate Bell with 4 (.4 %) Baker, 10 (1 %) Bandy, 9
(1 %) Gower, 9 (1 %) Early Triangular, and 24 (2.6%) Early Barbed points. These
types represent 6% of the Fate Bell collection. At compared sites these types repre­
sent the following percentages of total identified Archaic type specimens: Baker
Cave-14.5%; Eagle Cave-4.4%; Devil's Mouth-4%.
Period III. The following period is referred to as the early Middle Archaic and
starts with a marker, the Pandale point. In this period we find solid evidence of a

80 / Peck

distinct local cultural adaptation associated with xeric flora. The period is dated
4000-2500 B.c. and is characterized by Pandale, Nolan, and Zorra points with Bul­
verde and Travis introduced late. At Fate Bell we find 53 (5.7%) Pandale, 28 (3%)
Nolan, 14 (1.5%) Zorra, 2 (.2%) Bulverde, and 8 (.86%) Travis type points. These
types comprise 11.2% of the total collection. At compared sites these types represent
the following percentages of total identified Archaic type specimens: Baker Cave­
15.8%; Eagle Cave -18%; Parida Cave -15.4%; Devil's Mouth -14%. There is some
inconsistency among the compared sites as to the exact dating of this period and what
points are included. Word and Douglas (1970) include an early Langtry variety and
Almagre, Epstein (1963) and Johnson (1964) begin Langtry earlier; only Johnson
(1964) and Word and Douglas (1970) include Travis and Zorra; only Johnson (1964)
and Alexander (1970) include Bulverde. Great quantities offiber material in the Fate
Bell collection, presently undated, would seem to indicate a parallel development
with dated material of the same nature at Baker Cave (Word and Douglas 1970;
Chadderdon 1983) and Eagle Cave (Ross 1965) included in this period. This may be
due to increased reliance on floral material or just better preservation from this time.
Period IV. The next period is characterized by contracting stem, corner-notched
dart points of the Almagre, Langtry, Val Verde, and Shumla types, and more xeric
climatic conditions. This also is a period of distinctly local cultural adaptation. This
part of the sequence is considered to have occurred from 2500-1000 B.C. (Word and
Douglas 1970; Collins 1969; Alexander 1970). Johnson (1964) dates this earlier,
starting prior to 3000 B.C. and Epstein's (1963) dates from Centipede and Damp
Caves are much earlier, starting prior to 4000 B.C. Ross's (1965) dates from Eagle
Cave are considerably later, dating this period from before 1400 B.C. to A.D. 1 or
later. This period is the late Middle Archaic. These point types represent 48.77% of
the total Fate Bell collection with 65 (7%) Almagre, 181 (19.3%) Langtry, 155 (16.5%)
Shumla, and 56 (5.9%) Val Verde types. At compared sites these types represent the
following percentages of total identified Archaic type specimens: Eagle Cave­
55.2%; Parida Cave-80%; Baker Cave-50.6%; Devil's Mouth-19%.
Percentagewise, Fate Bell seems to compare best with Baker and Eagle Caves,
with approximately half of these collections being related to this 1500-year period.
Included in this period are a small sample of 6 (.6%) Kinney points which are only
represented elsewhere at Baker Cave and are classified there as "long Tortugas"
points (Word and Douglas 1970).
The Arledge type has been defined at Castle Canyon (Greer 1966) and is also
included in this period. There are two Arledge points in the Fate Bell collection
(.2%).
Period V. The fifth segment of the Lower Pecos chronology is characterized by
corner- and basal-notched dart points with a time range of 1000 B.C. to A.D. 200
(Alexander 1970; Collins 1969). At Baker Cave this period is conjoined with Period
VI (below) and extended to A.D. 1000 (Word and Douglas 1970). The Montell,
Marcos, Castroville, and Marshall points of this time are considered to be Central
Texas types to which may be added Palmillas, Desmuke, and Lange. Percentages of
occurrence at Fate Bell are 21 (2.2%) Montell, 18 (1.9%) Marcos, 14 (1.5%)

Fate Bell Rockshelter I 81

Castroville,2 (.2%) Marshall, 9 (1 %) Palmillas, 3 (.3%) Desmuke, and 10 (1 %) Lange
types. This group as a whole constitutes 8.3% of the total collection. At compared
sites these types represent the following percentages of total identified Archaic type
specimens: Devil's Mouth-28.5% (with 24.4% Montell); Baker Cave-6.9%; Eagle
Cave-3%; Parida Cave-4.6%.
The presence of these types may relate to a reentry of bison into the area as Bone
Bed 3 at Bonfire bison jump includes Castroville and Montell points and is radiocar­
bon-dated around 700 B.C. (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Bison hunting episodes are
seen in the Red Linear rock art style, although these cannot be firmly dated to this
period. However, the renewal of mass bison kills at Bonfire Shelter at this time and
rock art at 41VV162A depicting what seems to be a jump-kill may correlate (Turpin
1984b).
Period VI. The sixth period ofthe regional chronology, and the last to be strongly
represented at Fate Bell, is characterized by the presence of side-notched dart points
and is dated to approximately 200 B.C. to A.D. 1000 (Collins 1969; Alexander 1970),
earlier at Devil's Mouth (Johnson 1964) and later at Eagle Cave (Ross 1965). At Fate
Bell we have a strong presence of 152 (16.3%) Ensor, 54 (5.76%) Frio, with only 1
(.1 %) Figueroa and no recognized Paisano points. This constitutes 22.1 % of the total
Fate Bell collection. At compared sites these types represent the following percent­
ages of total identified Archaic type specimens: Devil's Mouth -35.5%; Eagle
Cave - 24.4%; Baker Cave -12.2%.
This period overlaps with period VII based on continued usage of the side­
notched dart points and the introduction of the bow and arrow about A.D. 600. We
see the bow and arrow pictured in the Red Monochrome rock art style which repre­
sents a very different, realistic approach to rock art and may be intrusive (Turpin
1984a).
Period VII. This period is known as the Late Prehistoric and dates from A.D.
1000 to 1600. It is characterized by the occurrence of arrow points which include the
Scallorn, Perdiz, Toyah, Clifton, and Harrell types. No arrow points occur in Jackson's
Fate Bell collection; however, Parsons (1965) found one in his 1963 testing and there
is one tiny point classified here as Ensor.
At the other sites, 13 arrow points were found at Baker Cave, 12 at Eagle Cave,
2 at Parida Cave and 61 at Devil's Mouth. Devil's Mouth is an open terrace site and
this large representation (18.5%) along with the occurrence of arrow points in
association with tipi rings on the mesa tops would seem to indicate a preference for
open sites at this time.
Period VIII. An eighth period, the Historic, is documented by rock art depicting
crosses, firearms, horses, conquistadors and other historic indicators along with the
occurrence of metal arrow points and other intrusive matter but nothing of this time
is found in the Fate Bell collection (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967).

Conclusions
Study of the Fate Bell projectile point sequence indicates occupation of the site
for approximately 8500 years. Seventy percent of the collection is constituted by a
representation of two periods: Period IV, 2500-1000 B.C., and Period VI, 200 B.c.to
A.D. 1000. This compares fairly well with other sites in the region with roughly 50%
of Fate Bell and Eagle Cave collections being derived from the Middle Archaic. The
three previous periods would certainly indicate habitation by at least 6000 B.C. with
continued, or at least periodic, occupation of the region. In Period III, we find the
earliest evidence of the development of a gathering economy with xeric fiber material
discovered at Baker Cave dating to 4000 B.C. With 50% of the point collection
derived from Period IV, a time of comparatively great population and a full blown
florescence of this type of adaptation is indicated.
In closing it should be made apparent that future work in the unexcavated
portions of Fate Bell rockshelter is desirable for at least two reasons. Although the
upper strata of this site have been severely looted, it is now protected by the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department and should degenerate no further. Parsons (1965) has
recommended a thorough examination of the strata all the way to bedrock. A modern
excavation with full consideration of stratification and vertical provenience of diag­
nostic artifacts and careful dating of organic materials should put to rest many
questions of cultural sequence at this site and help fill in the picture of the evolution
of culture in the entire region.
Secondly, the important question of cultural continuity or discontinuity between
Paleoindian and Archaic lifestyles may find some answers through careful excavation
of the lower, undisturbed strata, with special emphasis of association of floral material
discovered with any Paleoindian artifacts.

PREHISTORIC ECONOMICS AT BAKER CAVE:
A PLAN FOR RESEARCH
Kenneth M. Brown

Abstract

The dry rockshelters of the Lower Pecos with their well-preserved plant and
animal remains provide a unique laboratory for examining the prehistory of food
economies in the region. Their potential has not been thoroughly tested. This paper
is not a report of completed research, but rather offers a suggested perspective for
future research. It proposes that:
1) the supposed economic conservatism of the prehistoric Lower Pecos has
often been asserted, but not adequately proven;
2) climatic change is astronomically driven and hence needs to be modeled
on a global basis to be understood; regional studies of empirical proxy
data are important for understanding local effects, but global modeling
must be used to understand paleoclimatic chronology;
3) optimal foraging and decision theory offer potentially useful new
perspectives on dietary variation that have not yet been tested in the
Lower Pecos;
4) climate influences diet breadth, and this influence can be measured if
other factors such as
a) variability in social group composition,
b) variability in forager mobility patterns, and
c) time-averaging of archeological deposits
can be controlled for;
5) the onset of the Hypsithermal coincided with the introduction of
economies of scale based on pit-baking of sotol, lechuguilla, and yucca
in the Lower Pecos. Initially occurring in sheltered base camps, per­
haps as a winter(?) response to dietary stress, beginning about A.D. 900
(with further intensification at about A.D. 1200), pit-baking was relo­
cated in springtime(?) to open sites closer to stands of these plants, as
a way to produce a temporary food surplus in the warm season when the
nutritional state of the plants was highest.

Introduction
This paper is not a report of completed research, but rather the outline of a plan
for future research on prehistoric food economies in the Lower Pecos region of Texas.
It offers an assessment of what has been accomplished so far and offers a particular
viewpoint for structuring future work. Field work at Baker Cave in 1984-1985 fur­
nishes the point of departure for the discussion, but these comments should apply to
other Lower Pecos sites as well. Because the dry shelters in this area often have
perfect preservation of plant and animal remains, at least in the upper deposits, we
have a better base for understanding prehistoric economics here than anywhere else
in Texas.
However, most previous work on diet and nutrition has been based on just four
sites: Hinds Cave, Conejo Shelter, Parida Cave, and Baker Cave. A few other studies
in surrounding areas, at Caldwell Cave and Granado Cave in Culberson County and
Gobbler Shelter in Crockett County can be added, and other studies such as a recent
analysis of stomach contents from a transitional Late ArchaicILate Prehistoric burial
(Turpin, Henneberg, and Riskind 1986) also add to the data base, but these studies
are still spare in number.
The available studies range in scope from midden analyses which have looked
at the aggregate residues from entire residence groups (but don't tell us anything
about the diets of individuals, families, or even larger social groups on a short-term
basis) to detailed studies such as Turpin's last meal analysis, which gives us a good
deal of specific information on the diet of one individual, but doesn't tell us how
representative it is of entire populations.
Most of the major studies have emphasized the extreme stability of Lower Pecos
diet throughout the Holocene. However, most studies have been qualitative in
nature, looking at presence-absence rather than shifts in frequency, or have been
quantitative only to the point of listing counts or weights. Few have tried to integrate
studies of both plant and animal remains. None of these studies has been embedded
in a theoretical framework. Of the studies mentioned above, the Hinds Cave research
is the most useful by virtue of comprehensiveness, thoroughness, and use of contem­
porary research methods and perspectives. Perhaps the study most useful for the
questions addressed in this presentation is that of Stock (1983), because she not only
examines the macrofossil constituents of coprolites in detail, but also looks at dietary
diversity in the same way that I advocate here. We need many more studies like
Stock's before we can confidently begin to track Lower Pecos dietary history. What
I propose to do is to outline what seems to me a plausible research plan, one which
pivots around proposed research on the Baker Cave collections. It is of necessity
programmatic in nature, rather than a report of research results, because most of the
research needed to answer these topics, at least at Baker Cave, has just begun. Except
where otherwise noted, radiocarbon dates cited in this paper are not dendrocorrected
(see original sources for full documentation).

Climatic History From A Global Perspective
We now know that the climate of the earth has changed constantly throughout
its history, and that changes in the global energy budget are astronomically driven.
We know that there is a major cycle at intervals of 100,000 years caused by orbital
eccentricity, then superimposed on this another cycle of 41,000 years caused by axial
tilt, then superimposed on these two more major cycles of 23,000 and 19,000 years
caused by axial precession. There are also several other lower-order cycles, for
example one at about 11,000 years, whose origins are poorly understood (Fig. 4.1;
Imbrie and Imbrie 1986). Broecker and Denton (1990) also argue that the earth's
ocean-atmosphere system has jumped back and forth between glacial and interglacial
modes during the Quaternary as changing seasonality has shut off or turned on North
Atlantic Deep Water production (this refers to a major Atlantic ocean current respon­
sible for transferring equatorial heat to the northern hemisphere). They propose that
at these long cycle lengths, the climatic system exhibits "quantized states." None of
the larger-order cycles are really of concern to us here, however. Less well studied
but of more interest here are lower-order climatic cycles (in the range of a few
centuries to millennia) which may also be astronomically driven, for these are short
enough to show up in the archeological record, but not so short as to be blurred by
mixing of deposits or other cultural factors. The point I want to make is that the
climatic history of the Lower Pecos is astronomically driven and therefore can be
mathematically modeled. This means we can look at climatic change from a global
perspective and do not have to depend on local empirical data to understand the
trends. In fact, confirmation of the model has come mostly from studies of oxygen
isotope ratios in Antarctic ice cores and in the remains of fusilinids (microscopic
marine animals) and aerosolic dustfalls (Rea 1987) in deep-sea sediment cores, from
studies of sea-level change, glacial advances and retreats, and the like.
Of course, global trends may have different local effects. There may be lag
effects in response of the local environment to global trends (see Wright 1984 for a
comprehensive review), or there may be local counter trends, as Bryan and Gruhn
(1964) demonstrated for the Great Basin. Wright (1976) suggests that Holocene
climatic episodes are time-transgressive in nature - that is, the beginning and ending
dates for climatic episodes may not be contemporaneous everywhere in North
America, but may show progressive change over geographic space. It may be possible
to compute transfer functions - either empirically, where historical climatic data are
adequate, or by atmospheric behavior modeling - that articulate local climate with
global energy budget values, but this goal remains remote for the Lower Pecos at
present. Limited weather data are probably available for Camp Hudson from the
1850s, but unfortunately continuous records do not begin until the twentieth century.
In a significant paper published in Science, Davis (1984) argues for an axial
precession cycle at 22,000 years (rather than the 23,000-year and 19,000-year cycles
described by Imbrie and Imbrie) causing maximum insolation at different seasons at
different periods during the Quaternary. Specifically, he argues that maximum in­
solation during May-June occurred at 13,000 B.P., maximum insolation during
July-August occurred around 10,000 B.P., and maximum insolation during September­

orbital eccentricity cycle, a 43,000-year axial tilt cycle, and 23-000- and 19,OOO-year precession cycles; but
some minor cycles less than 7000 years long also contribute to the climatic signal.

October occurred at 5000 B.P. (Fig. 4.2). Since different components of the vegetation
may respond differently to thermal or precipitation stress depending on which season
is considered, we in effect have not one Hypsithermal, but at least three, one for early
summer, one for midsummer, and one for fall, all during different parts of the late
Quaternary. Computer simulation of Holocene climate by the COHMAP project
likewise indicates high midsummer insolation (and maximum seasonal contrast) at
about 9-12,000 B.P., peaking at about 10,000 B.P. (COHMAP Members 1988:Fig. 2),
but climatic effects not appearing until around 9000 B.P. (COHMAP Members
1988:Fig.3). An important feature of this simulation is the appearance of maximal
seasonal contrast at the onset of the Holocene, decreasing steadily throughout, with
the maximum rate of diminution centered at about 6000 B.P. during the Hypsithermal
maximum.

The climatic history of the Holocene is now known to have been episodic in
nature, with climatic episodes separated by intervals of rapid change (Bryson 1987;
evidence of short-cycle "quantized states"?). Climatic episodes were first recognized
in the European pollen record and formalized by Blytt and Sernander, later extended
to North America by Wendland and Bryson. More recent studies have created
reconstructed curves for Holocene temperature, rainfall, and length of growing
season through the use of transfer functions (for examples see Bartlein, Webb, and
FIeri 1984; Bartlein and Webb 1985; Gajewski 1988). Most of this work has been done
for Canada and the northern United States, and as a result the pollen data are most
often used to model July temperature, since that is the climatic variable that seems
to work best for explaining modern pollen production at these latitudes. Some of the
more recent work has shown clear examples of globally synchronous climatic episodes
during the Holocene. In some cases the direction of change at any given time is
opposite in different parts of the world; for example, the paleoclimatic history of
northwestern India appears essentially opposite to that of North America, with mesic
periods there matching arid periods in America (see Bryson 1987:Fig. 3). Further­
more, as Bryson observes,
It is also clear that if the direction of change is of opposite sense in two
regions, there must be places in between where there is no change. The
argument that one site shows no change is thus no argument at all
(Bryson 1987:4).

The general trend in paleoclimatic modeling in North America has been to begin
with the empirical proxy data (pollen profiles, packrat middens, mollusks, microver­
tebrates, or whatever) at a single site or in a restricted region and to work inductively
toward a reconstruction of climatic history. The trouble with this approach is that
because of differential response lags in different classes of proxy data, or because of
problems caused by time- transgressive biotic changes, or simply because of differen­
ces in interpretation by different scholars, there is an almost endless supply of
discrepancies between the different data sets. All too often in pollen studies there
has been a tendency to assume that vegetation is in equilibrium with climate, and that
bioturbation has not affected the discreteness of samples.
On a long time scale, one measured in millennia, astronomical forcing (or
perhaps even changes in the solar constant itself) has changed the global energy
budget as we have seen, making the earth hotter at times and cooler at others. From
this perspective the earth looks like an open system. From a short-term perspective,
however, the earth behaves like a closed system; if heat is added somewhere, it must
be balanced by heat loss somewhere else. As Bryson has pointed out, this means you
can't have it hot and dry everywhere at the same time. An area moving toward aridity
and elevated temperatures is likely to be balanced somewhere else in the world by
depressed temperatures, reduced evapotranspiration, or increased rainfall. As the
time scale of changes in the global energy budget are increased, when does the earth
cease to behave like a closed system and start to behave like an open system? The
scale of the transition is not yet clear. Many of the supposed discrepancies in
paleoclimatic reconstructions of adjacent regions may be due to this aspect of the

Baker Cave I 93

climatic system. Climatic reconstructions that work from the ground up, without
recognition of the global nature of climatic change, seem likely only to multiply the
number of regional discrepancies, when in fact the discrepancies may be an integral
part of the system.
Climatic History of The Lower Pecos Region: Monotonic Or Episodic Change?
Now let's consider the climatic history of the Lower Pecos region. It's a semiarid
area that at present has an annual rainfall of only about 46 em, with heaviest rainfall
in May (or June) and September (Kochel 1980:Fig. 10; Table 3). This bimodal rainfall
distribution is typical of Texas as a whole, and is largely due to relative proximity to
the Gulf of Mexico. The typical winter-dominant rainfall pattern of the modern
Southwestern deserts does not begin to appear until one gets farther to the west,
isolated from both Gulf and Pacific moisture (except for the Big Bend, which has a
summer-dominant pattern). Although paleoecologists have suggested the South­
western rainfall pattern has shifted from winter-dominant to summer-dominant at
various times in the past, I assume Lower Pecos rainfall has probably been bimodal
throughout the Holocene, though the degree of seasonal expression may have
changed. That is, there may have been periods when annual rainfall distribution was
more equable, and other times when it was concentrated seasonally. At present,
rainfall can be quite erratic over the course of several decades, a few years, or even
months. Because it's an area with marginal rainfall, it presumably has been subject
to periodic environmental stress throughout the Holocene, and I think we can now at
least roughly model an environmental stress curve for comparison with economic
behavior.
Owen and Schmidly's (1986) biostatistical study of the state of Texas shows net
above-ground primary productivity for the Lower Pecos (quadrat 155) to be 512
g1m2jyr [these figures are actually not directly measured but rather computed from
climatic data using a formula provided by Rosenzweig (1968)]. A west-to-east tran­
sect immediately to the north approximately along latit~de 30° N (Fig. 4.3) shows a
dramatic rise in primary productivity at the position of Baker Cave. This, of course,
is the boundary between the Chihuahuan and Balconian biotic provinces. The region
is characterized by fairly diverse rodent and carnivore faunas (Owen 1988:Fig. 2) and
lizard faunas (Fig. 4.4; Owen and Dixon 1989).
Let's look at paleoclimatic data for the Lower Pecos now, specifically at the last
10,000 years. In the most recent review of pollen evidence, Bryant and Holloway find
a Late Pleistocene mosaic of woodland, parkland, and scrub grassland gradually giving
way to larger areas ofscrub grasslands in the early Holocene, with xeric plants entering
the areas by 8500 B.P., followed by an interval from 7000 to 4000 B.P. marked by poor
pollen records. This, of course, corresponds to the single Altithermal model of
Antevs, and while Bryant and Holloway don't identify the interval as such, they do
note increased grass pollen and economic pollen from lechuguilla, sotol, prickly pear,
and mesquite at Hinds Cave from 8700 to 7000 B.P. Following this is a reduction in
grass pollen and increase in tree pollen until 6000 B.P. The last 4000 years is marked

Turpin, personal communication) by bison bone beds. Another xeric interval begin­
ning at about 1000 B.P. on the southern Great Plains (Hall 1990), but dated
somewhere 2100 B.P. and 1500 B.P. in east-central Texas by Holloway, Raab, and
Stuckenrath (1987), probably affected the Lower Pecos as well, where much of the
record for this interval has been removed by pothunters.
Hulbert (1984:Table 3) judges the period at 5000-3000 B.P. in western Val Verde
County to have been drier, with annual rainfall less than 31 em, based on relative
proportions of cottontails and jackrabbits, but his data come from early work at
Centipede, Damp, and Eagle caves, poorly dated sites where the provenience units
are too inclusive. His hypothesis should be evaluated with more radiocarbon dates
and finer-grained provenience units, which might show that the xeric interval is valid
but should be dated somewhat earlier. Holliday (1989), reviewing geologic, soil, and
faunal evidence from the Llano Estacado, suggests that summers were warmer than
present and effective precipitation was reduced in the interval 6500-4500 B.P..

To summarize, one viewpoint on modeling the global energy budget suggests a
single or double thermal peak (preceded and followed by some secondary peaks as in
Fig. 4.5), tagged the Altithermal by Antevs, at around 7000 to 4000 years ago, which
seems to be reasonably well confirmed by the Lower Pecos paleoenvironmental data.
This would have been a period of reduced and erratic rainfall, elevated temperature
and evaporation rates, and of course maximum environmental stress both for human
populations and for the plant and animal populations on which they depended.
This also happens to be the cutoff point for good plant preservation at Baker
Cave. There, at least along the back wall, we have good plant preservation back to
about 5000 B.P. or beyond. We can therefore examine human response to the second

of the two Hypsithermal maxima, and we can look at economic behavior under
ameliorating conditions up to 1100 B.P. or later.
A second viewpoint, that ofDavis, suggests a mid-Holocene thermal peak at 5000
B.P., but only for mid-fall insolation; this was preceded by another thermal peak at
the outset of the Holocene, but only for July-August insolation. Modeling has not
proceeded far enough to show the effects of this more complicated situation on Lower
Pecos vegetation either directly or through displacement of atmospheric circulation
patterns.
Optimal Foraging
Let's look at economic behavior now from the perspectives of optimal foraging
theory and of decision theory. Optimal foraging theory is something that comes to us
from the field of evolutionary ecology, as practiced by MacArthur and Pianka and
others. Some of the earliest studies considered the behavior of birds foraging in berry
patches and the like. It became a minor fad in archeology a few years ago, but

-

Baker Cave I 97

shouldn't be dismissed for that reason. According to Winterhalder (1981), optimal
foraging theory considers solutions to four kinds of problems: diet breadth, foraging
space, feeding period, and foraging group size. I will focus mostly on the problem of
diet breadth. As Winterhalder says, most foragers are faced with a broad array of
potential resources, and most are selective to some degree. Models of optimal diet
analyze that selectivity. Foragers may be generalists or specialists, operating in
environments that are patchy or homogeneous. Environmental patches may be fine­
grained or coarse-grained. Foraging effort is divided into search time and pursuit
time. If we're pursuing whitetail deer, for example, these terms have pretty
straightforward meanings. If we're pursuing fish, search time might mean travel time
to a known waterhole, while pursuit time might be time spent grinding toxic plants,
throwing them in the water, and waiting for the fish to float belly up. Ifwe're pursuing
cactus tunas, search time might mean searching for a cactus patch that hasn't been
raided by other predators, while "pursuit" time might involve picking the tunas.
The difference between search time and pursuit time is that all items are
searched for simultaneously but pursued singly. When an item is encountered the
forager must decide whether to pursue it or continue searching for more desirable
prey. According to Winterhalder (1981: 24),
If prey are ranked by net rate of energy return from ... highest to ...

lowest ... the rule is that prey types should be added until the additional
pursuit time necessary for including the next type is greater than the
savings in search time.
In other words, if we rank food items starting at the top with those that give the
best payoff for the least effort; and if we then start broadening our diet on down the
scale, we reach a point of diminishing returns; in other words, by being less choosy we
are able to find acceptable food items more often as we move about, but the pursuit
time increases. Optimal foraging models help us predict where that point of diminish­
ing returns falls (Fig. 4.6).
We should note that the rank of a food item does not predict how common it will
be in a forager's diet, but only whether it will be taken when encountered. The
presence or absence of a candidate depends on encounter rates with higher-ranked
resources, and its abundance, once admitted to the diet, depends on the rate at which
the candidate is encountered. If the encounter rate with higher-ranked resources
fluctuates, the optimal diet will also fluctuate, retaining only the very highest-ranked
resources (Smith 1983:628; Hawkes, Hill, and O'Connell 1982:388). One implication
of this is that a simple count of taxa may be preferable, as a measure of diet breadth,
to common ecological diversity measures (such as the Shannon-Weaver information
statistic, or measures of evenness and richness) that use information on relative
abundance. In the case of Alexander's study of Conejo Shelter, discussed later in this
paper, his "diversity" index (D) measures diet breadth as treated here, while his
"intensity" index (I) may not (Alexander 1974:Figs. 17, 18,20,21).
Another thing to think about is that the ratios of search time and pursuit time
are going to be different depending on whether you are after plants or animals. Since
plants aren't mobile, search time is relatively minimal by comparison to animals, but

pursuit time (which in the case of plants includes digging up, chopping down, pulling
off thorns, digging cooking pits, hauling firewood, grinding, and so forth, ie., process­
ing time) may be substantial. In the case of animals, search time may be greater, but
pursuit time (including butchering) is relatively less (Simms 1987:49). This has
significance for prehistoric Lower Pecos economies, which have been characterized
as chiefly plant-based rather than animal-based (Fig. 4.7). Kelly (1983:301) also
points out that hunting economies and gathering economies are aimed at different
trophic levels, implying that
Reliance upon plant resources requires not only high residential
mobility, but thorough coverage of an area as well, since there is a rapid
drop in the utility of commuting long distances for plant foods. Reliance
upon fauna allows for a greater expenditure of energy in commuting;
however, it also means that a foraging area will become more rapidly
depleted of resources.
The effect of game depletion has been demonstrated for tropical village­
dwelling horticulturalists who also hunt extensively. The Ye'kwana and Yanomamo

of Venezuela (Hames 1980), the Siona and Secoya of Ecuador (Vickers 1980), and the
Gidra of Papua New Guinea (Ohtsuka 1989) are examples. Hunting yields are high
in a newly occupied area but diminish near villages due to sustained game cropping
(Fig. 4. 8). The length of hunting trips increases, caloric efficiency and total protein
consumption decline, and the percentage of trips with no kills increases. Moreover,
the game taken may come to show more emphasis on smaller (r-selected) species with
higher reproductive rates as diet breadth expands (Vickers 1980: 17-18,21: Hames and
Vickers 1982:364). Hunting zone rotation may be practiced as a response, or in some
cases village fission or movement may occur when yields become unacceptably low.
While these are examples of semi-sedentary villagers in tropical habitats, it seems
likely that the same basic principles apply, though with an accelerated rate, to mobile
foragers .

The game depletion zones mentioned above are just a special case of the
economic zonation practiced by hunter-gatherers. Binford distinguishes between the
foraging radius (area traversed during a single day) and logistical radius (area
traversed by task groups on overnight trips) around a camp (Binford 1982:7). Camps
are relocated as both zones are depleted; in low-biomass environments like the Lower
Pecos, residential mobility is most commonly of the point-to-point type (Binford
1982:9, Fig. 2C). If we think about the history of a single site like Baker Cave as it is
occupied by successive groups (related or unrelated) offoragers, we would expect that
as long as the site is abandoned long enough between occupations to allow the plant
and animal communities in the neighborhood to recover, the onset of occupation
ought to show a dietary regime that differs from the end of the occupation episode,
when failing resources trigger resettlement. We would predict, in fact, that diet
breadth would be initially narrow, broadening during the occupation as the most
desirable resources are eliminated first and as first the foraging radius and later the
logistical radius is depleted of resources. The result is a maturation curve for diet
breadth that expresses the history of each occupational episode (Fig. 4.9). All other
things being equal, successive occupations of a single site ought to show a cyclic,
sawtooth pattern of measured diet breadth, even where the occupations are by
unrelated populations, provided only that the habitat is given sufficient time to
recover.
We should also note that foraging in the logistical radius is done chiefly by adult
males, while foraging in the foraging radius is done by those of all age and gender
categories, especially women and children, who tend to forage in areas near camp
already depleted of game. Small quantities of plants no longer available in the
depleted foraging zone may be contributed by male hunters returning from the
logistical zone.
Now let's ask two questions: 1) does this theory have any meaning in the real
world of living hunter-gatherers'! And 2) where does it get us?
To answer the first question, let's ask an optimal forager. Actually, we can't ask
the forager, but we can consult a recent book by Richard Lee on the San of the
Kalahari Desert. Lee says,
The way the !Kung hierarchically evaluate their plant inventory in order
of importance as food suggests a productive analogy to the way they
utilize space in the short run in subsistence activities. The !Kung typi­
cally occupy a campsite for a period of weeks and eat their way out of it.
For instance, at a camp in the mongongo forest the members exhaust
the nuts within a 1.5 km radius the first week of occupation, within a 3
km radius the second week, and within a 4.5 km radius the third week.
This progressive increase in walking distance occurs because the !Kung
are highly selective in their food habits. They do not eat all the food in
a given area. They start by eating out the most desirable species, and
when these are exhausted or depleted they turn to the less desirable
species. Because plant food resources are both varied and abundant, in

FIGURE 4.9. Diet breadth maturation curve. This is a hypothetical model showing how diet in a single
site like Baker Cave is thought to diversify progressively as the occupants eat their way through an
expanding hunting and gathering catchment around the site. Abandonment allows the catchment to
recover before the next occupation.

any situation where the desirable foods are scarce, the !Kung have two
alternatives in food strategy: 1) they may walk further in order to eat the
more desirable species or 2) they may remain closer to camp and exploit
the less desirable species. In fact, both alternatives are practiced simul­
taneously: the younger, more active camp members go farther afield to
bring back foods of classes I and II, and the older, more sedentary camp
members collect class III and IV foods closer to home. Because the
day's foods are pooled within families ... every camp member has a
variety of food available at the end of the day (Lee 1979: 175).

102/ Brown

In one of the few actual tests of resource use and patch choice among living
hunter-gatherers, O'Connell and Hawkes (1984) found good agreement with an
energy return-maximizing model for the Alyawara of Australia (confirmation was
more certain for gathering than for hunting). Pate (1986), however, has identified
exceptions to the relationship under drought conditions, a topic to which we will
return later. Among tropical foragers, the Ache of Paraguay are claimed to fit the
model (Hill and Hurtado 1989:438- 439).
Most ethnographic accounts of actual forager behavior show that certain dietary
items are greatly preferred and are intentionally sought, but when these are unavail­
able, or when other foods are opportunistically discovered, less-preferred items are
substituted. Elizabeth Thomas' account of Bushman foraging is a good example:
We were going to an almost imperceptible small hill, a place, said
Twikwe, where a great deal of veld food grew . .. We were going
particularly to look for bi, a fibrous, watery root that is the mainstay of
the Bushmen's diet during the hot season when the melons are gone ..
we found no bi root, but we found other kinds of veld food: a bush with
red berries, several kinds of roots, and a spiny cucumber not three inches
long (Thomas 1989:103-104).
The account continues with the foraging party persistently digging hole after hole
in a search for just the right kind of root until finally an edible one is found. Other
accounts of modern foragers likewise show persistent pursuit of preferred species,
even where other species are easier to obtain; Northern Paiute bitterroot diggers
(Couture, Ricks, and Housley 1986:156) and Anbarra shellfish collectors of Australia
(Meehan 1983) are examples. Meehan refers to this preference as "targeting" of
species.
Some techniques for animal procurement, of course, entirely avoid targeting: net
hunting and fish poisoning are two examples in which there is no discrimination in
pursuit. Fire drives and animal surrounds are other techniques in which there may
be varying degrees of discrimination as to what is harvested. These activities all tend
to be labor-intensive systems involving groups of people (see, for example, Abruzzi
1979:186-187). It is not entirely clear whether this kind of hunting fits the optimal
foraging model, or how it would affect the archeological record of optimal foraging.
To answer the question posed above about where optimal foraging theory gets
us, let's consider a prehistoric population in a deteriorating environment, for example
the Lower Pecos at the onset of the Hypsithermal. In a stressful environment all
resources, (or at least all upland resources) regardless of rank, would perhaps be
lessened in density or reproductive capacity. The effect of this would be that a
significant increase in diet breadth would probably be necessary just to maintain the
status quo. Because all prey is in a state of relative scarcity, foragers would have to
move well down the optimal ranking just to maintain an adequate diet. Search time
would probably increase in proportion to lessened prey density. As Winterhalder
says, an optimal forager is selective in a rich environment, less discriminating in a
poor one.

Baker Cave I 103

To summarize then, if the optimal foraging model works, we can predict, or
retrodict, that in a stressful climatic state human populations should adopt increased
diet breadth and in a benign climatic state populations should show decreased diet
breadth (Fig. 4. 10).

Now let's shift perspective slightly and look at decision theory. There are several
possible economic strategies. One might be a simple maximizing strategy, in which
the forager simply goes for the food item that gives the biggest caloric payoff for the
least effort in collection, regardless of the consequences. We might think of this as
optimal foraging gone berserk. It doesn't seem like it would work for very long since
it wouldn't take long to exhaust the optimal food items in an area. A much more
conservative economic strategy would be a minimax or least-risk strategy in which
the forager tries to maximize the minimum payoff (Coombs 1980: 191-192; see also
Christenson 1982). In other words, an economic strategy that gives the best payoff
under the worst conditions. As you can imagine, this would make the most sense in
a hostile environment. In Archaic deposits at Fresnal Shelter (near Alamagordo, New
Mexico), Vorsila Bohrer found
.. a well-buffered system of collecting that provides a minimum of risks.
Ten [plant foods] represent highly visible perennial food resources apt
to be found in the same location year after year by people who regularly
frequent the area. Only one is an opportunistic annual ... allowing food
to remain stored on the living plant (fleshy roots, stems, berries) may
create as reliable a food supply as aggregating harvests of these or
certain other plant products in caches (Bohrer 1981:45,46).
The other possibility can be termed an average payoff or Bayes strategy, which
maximizes the average payoff based on some knowledge of long-term previous be­
havior of the environment (Coombs 1980: 192-193). This is a bit more risky than the
minimax solution, but has the advantage of incorporating knowledge of past environ­
mental history. This might work well for human populations with strong oral history
traditions, or with a system of communication such as rock art, unless the environment
becomes unpredictable. In other words, how well can the oral history data bank of a

culture record and deal with larger-order climatic cycles (see Hayden 1975: 15 ff;
Mine 1986; Wright and Dirks 1983)1
Moreover, as Coombs points out, average payoff is a meaningless concept unless
a population has some sort of storage capability to average out food supplies from one
year to another. Populations without adequate storage facilities should use strategies
whose minimum payoffs are greater than or equal to the subsistence level.
In summary, it seems reasonable to expect that economic strategies ought to vary
with and to monitor the state of the environment: a benign climatic state ought to
encourage narrow diet breadth and an average payoff strategy. A stressful climatic
state ought to encourage, or even demand increased diet breadth and adherence to a
least-risk economic strategy. And as climatic states, measured in the Lower Pecos
chiefly by rainfall rates, have oscillated back and forth during the Holocene, we should
expect that prehistoric economic strategies have also oscillated between generalist
and specialist, minimax and average payoff. Even though most attention in human
optimal foraging studies has been directed toward models that emphasize the maxi­
mizing of energy return (perhaps in part a derivative of anthropological interest in
Zipf's least-effort principle), and in some cases confirmation of the model seems
warranted, such as for O'Connell and Hawkes' Alyawara. we should remember that
in other situations a risk-minimizing model may be more appropriate. In the
Alyawara case, the community was not environmentally stressed and in fact was
experiencing economic security brought on by outside intervention. Winterhalder
(1986) thinks that both models are similar in their outcome, especially where within­
group food sharing is active.
Of course, I fully recognize that adjusting diet breadth is only one of several
possible mechanisms for buffering environmental variability (see Halstead and
O'Shea 1989; Spielmann 1982:Table 3». Two short-term mechanisms used in
northern Mexico for coping with seasonal stress were changes in body fat reserves and
reprocessing of discarded vegetal foods (Brown 1988). On a longer time scale,
increased mobility, both residential and logistic, is a classic hunter-gather response.
Two other responses, exchange (see Spielmann 1982) and storage, have often been
used by other hunter-gatherers, but there is as yet little evidence that these were
significant strategies for the prehistoric Lower Pecos. Later in this paper I will suggest
that the introduction of labor-intensive plant-processing may itself have precipitated
the appearance of storage facilities and changes in group size during at least part of
the year. These are all aspects of risk-pooling. The !Kung maintain a system of hxaro
or gift partners; these are lifelong partners, many of them living with other bands in
distant places. Because the Kalahari environment is differentiated, failure of natural
resources in any given year in a band's territory may not be widespread, and the
presence of hxaro partners in another area allows families to migrate temporarily to
more favorable areas (Wiessner 1982). In subsequent years the situation may be
reversed. Risk is thus pooled over the entire population in the region.

Baker Cave I 105

Can We Identify An Optimal Ranking?

A key problem with optimal foraging models is that for a real test of the model,
some kind of rigorous measurement scale must be applied against the list of potential
food items. In Winterhalder's terms, some sort of "currency" must be chosen and an
input-output analysis must be done. In most anthropological work to date, energy
yield in calories has been the currency usually selected.
In order to establish an etie value ranking against which an ernie system of
selection can be tested, then, it is necessary to 1) measure the caloric yield of all the
potential food sources in the region, and 2) estimate energy loss involved in searching
for, collecting, and processing each kind of item - in other words, a thorough inpu t­
output analysis of the sort that Richard Lee has done for the !Kung bushmen. Some
work of this kind has been done in the Great Basin, where Steven Simms (1985,1987)
has carried out timed collecting experiments on 23 different kinds of plants (seeds,
nuts, roots, and pollen), keeping carefully separated records of pursuit and processing
times. Plant parts were collected and processed (milled on metates, parched, and so
forth) using replicas of aboriginal technology, and the caloric values of the plant parts
were measured by a nutritional chemistry lab (see Simms 1987:Appendix).
For the Lower Pecos, an admirable start has already been made by Winkler
(1982), whose literature search on Southwestern native esculent plants covers many
of the plant foods available to Lower Pecos foragers. However, some of the more
important food sources are not covered (for example, no data on nutrient content of
sotol or of non-flowering parts of lechuguilla were located). Likewise, comparable
analyses are needed for animal foods. Some efforts to fill these gaps have been made.
From April, 1986 to October, 1987, in conjunction with the Baker Cave project, a study
of nutritional properties of sotol (Dasylirion cf. D. texanum) and lechuguilla (Agave
lechuguilla) plants from the Hughey Ranch was undertaken. We collected specimens
of these plants at intervals of several months in order to check for seasonal changes
in nutritional state, looking also at nutritional differences between leaf layers of a
single plant. The seasonally-spaced samples seem to indicate that lechuguilla, as a
succulent, is more responsive to seasonal environmental stressing than sotol, and that
its water and nutrient content are highest in the spring. Two specimens of Yucca
reverchonii were also analyzed.
Despite these efforts, I think it is probably not practical to carry out an input­
output analysis for every potential food source in the Lower Pecos. To do so would
mean not only securing nutritional analyses of every species, but also estimating the
energy expenditure involved in harvesting, transporting, and processing each one with
simulated aboriginal technology. And this, in turn, would necessitate our guessing at
much of the technology implied. Too many unknowns would be involved to allow us
to make realistic estimates. Any sort of serious effort would require a long. term
project like that of Simms in Utah and Nevada or like the Old Rag project in Virginia,
where field camp members live under simulated aboriginal conditions, and measure
their own daily energy expenditure with biomedical monitoring equipment. Such an
effort is probably beyond our means.

If identifying an etic ranking based on caloric input-output analysis is unrealistic,
then what can we do? A realistic goal, perhaps, is simply to try to identify long-term
changes in diet breadth and compare these against the history of climatic change.

Responses To Increasing Aridity: Upland Habitat
In an earlier section of this paper, the working assumption was made that on a
long time scale, increasing aridity would lessen overall regional biomass, directly
affecting economic strategy and diet breadth. In an interesting critique of O'Connell
and Hawkes' study, however, Pate (1986) has suggested that increasing aridity in the
Western Desert of Australia may actually increase productivity of certain desert
plants, based on data recorded by Gould in a series of wet and dry years in the late
1960s. How this would relate to arid episodes on the much larger time scale under
consideration here is unclear. How would increasing aridity on a time scale of
generations or centuries affect both overall biomass and species dominance in dif­
ferent communities in this part of the Lower Pecos region? Would very xeric-adapted
species such as lechuguilla become more dense at the expense of less xeric adapted
species such as shin oak or sotol? Unfortunately we have no time-series data to help
us here. The only approach we can follow is to plot the modern distribution of the
major dominants and to compare them to the range of modern temperature and
rainfall clines. Lechuguilla, for example, covers the Chihuahuan Desert and beyond,
extending from as far north as about Coke County and Schleicher County in Texas
southward to the state of Hidalgo in Mexico, and as far west as EI Paso (Gentry
1982:Fig.7.22; Nobel 1988:Fig.7.25). The present annual productivity of lechuguilla
in part of Coahuila with an annual rainfall of 43 cm (only slightly less than that of the
Baker Cave area) is reported to be about 32 kglm2/year (Nobel 1988:Table 7.1;
however, note that this estimate of lechuguilla biomass is about 60 times as great as
that for total biomass of the Lower Pecos given by Owen and Schmidly, cited earlier).
Nobel (1988) has defined an environmental productivity index (EPI) for lechuguilla
and other agaves that is the product of a water index, temperature index and an index
of photosynthetically active radiation (sunlight at wavelengths of 400-700 nm) and is
designed to predict net C02 uptake. Lechuguilla, a crassulacean acid metabolic plant,
is not only characterized by extreme efficiency in the use of water, but is also
remarkably efficient at C0 2 uptake at the low nighttime temperatures characteristic
of desert environments (Nobel and Quero 1986). Studies of the monthly variation in
the EPI show that nearly all variability is due to variation in the availability of water
(Quero and Nobel 1987). Productivity, incidentally, is highest from April to June
through September and lowest from November through January or February (Nobel
1988:216-217; Fig.7.10; Quero and Nobel 1987:Figs. 3,4). A plot of the EPI over the
entire range of the species (Nobel 1988:Fig.7.25, adapted for this paper as Fig.4.11)
shows that it varies from 0.14 or less at the northwestern end of its range, to over 0.48
in the southern part. The EPI for the Baker Cave area is about 0.30. This suggests
that productivity could be significantly increased simply by increasing annual rainfall.
Hicks (1965:19) claims that Agave in Baja California becomes too desiccated to eat
due to failure of winter rains less than one year in 25, but gives no authority for this

assertion. Martinez (1936:261) claims an average density of21,000 lechuguilla plants
per hectare for some areas of Mexico, with a maximum of up to 30,000 plants per
hectare. For Big Bend National Park, an area even more arid than the Lower Pecos,
Leopold and Krausman (1988;Table 2) list lechuguilla density (stems/m2) ranging
from 0.14 in association with creosote bush, candelil1a, and Opuntia to as much as 1.00
in the sotol-giant dagger plant association. Density in the sotol-Iechuguilla-grass
association is 0.99 stems/m2 (by contrast, sotol density in the Juniper Canyon and
Horse Mesa study areas is 0.03 and 0.18, respectively). Even though this is a more
arid area, these may be some of the best available estimates since the area has
presumably been protected from grazing for decades.
Gutierrez et al. (1988) have studied the effects of artificially supplied water and
nitrogen fertilizer on Chihuahuan desert creosote flats near Las Cruces, New Mexico
(with annual rainfall about 21 cm). They studied only annuals, not perennials, from
1981 to 1984, finding that water supplements did not increase total annual plant
density or biomass, although nitrogen supplements did increase biomass. In some
cases plant density increased, but biomass did not. One species (Lepidium lasiocar­
pum) accumulated biomass faster with frequent but conservative waterings than with
infrequent but liberal waterings. The implication to be drawn from this study is that
plant communities may show complex responses to changing climate, responses that
are difficult at present to model. Because this study included only annuals and is very
short in comparison to the span of time considered in this paper, it may have only
limited applicability.
Le Hourou, Bingham, and Skerbek (1988) studied primary production on arid
and semiarid rangelands from a global statistical database, finding that variability in
annual production is relatively greater than variability in annual rainfall, possibly
suggesting that some sort of positive feedback is operating. They do not discriminate
between annuals and perennials, though presumably most of the rangeland species
are perennials. They also note that variability in production is proportional to aridity.
If this can be generalized to a long-term perspective (the longest study in their
database lasted 51 years), it suggests biomass may be least predictable during xeric
climatic events. But is the study applicable to time spans of archeological scale?
Sotol has a conspicuously patchy distribution in the area around Baker Cave.
Because it is a more deeply rooted plant than lechuguilla, it prefers flat ground with
at least shallow soil development (although flat areas with deeper soil profiles tend
to support grasses except under excessive grazing pressure). Around Baker Cave,
these areas are mapped (Golden, Gabriel, and Stevens 1982) as Ector-Rock outcrop
(hilly). Dense stands of sotol sometimes occur on narrow saddles between slightly
higher ridge tops, along drainage divides. Scattered sotol plants will grow on rockier
hillsides (here mapped as Ector-Rock outcrop (very steep), especially where lime­
stone benches have trapped narrow bands of soil, but this kind of terrain is more apt
to be favored by lechuguilla. Even within these mapped soil units, however, distribu­
tion of both these plants (as well as most of the other major upland economic plants,
including yucca species, persimmon, prickly pear, blackbrush, shin oak, and others)
is quite patchy. According to Ditton and Schmidly (1977:81), "sotol was harvested

Baker Cave I 109

extensively to feed cattle during the severe droughts of the 1890's and this species has
never become fully re-established in the Amistad region." Nealley, in 1888,
remarked that
West of Devil's River the sotol (Dasylirion texanum) became noticeable
from its abundance on the side of the hills - in many places forming
the principal vegetation. .. The herders of sheep and goats value it
as a forage plant. Cattle also seem to be fond of it. I saw several plants
where the leaves had been cut away and the head left for the benefit of
the stock. One herder in Val Verde County said that in the dry season
he placed his main reliance on the Sotol for the sheep.
Proceeding westward from the Devil's River the Lechuguillo [sic]
(Agave heteracantha) presents itself in great profusion, like the Soto1,
occupying the ground in places to the exclusion of all other plants
(Nealley 1888:4).
Whether this applies to the immediate Baker Cave area also, and whether it
might be partly responsible for discontinuous distributions is unknown. It doesn't
seem likely to account for the slope associations, however. Golden, Gabriel, and
Stevens (1982:22-23) list Hall panicum, hairy tridens, red grama, perennial threeawn,
juniper, coyotillo, mountain laurel, and Jatropha as increasers on Ector-Rock outcrop
(hilly) units, and these same species plus condalia, persimmon, ocotillo, cacti, sotol,
lechuguilla as increasers on the "very steep" unit. Since there are fairly well­
preserved collections of grasses from the Baker Cave deposits (especially from about
1100 B.P. onward) it may be possible to examine the ratio of increasers to decreasers
in both the archeological and living grasses in order to evaluate range condition
(although the cessation of grazing on the ranch a few years ago is once again changing
pasturage conditions).
Responses to Increasing Aridity: River Habitat
One aspect of the Lower Pecos environment, however, sets it apart from both
the Australian desert of Pate and the Chihuahuan desert of Gutierrez et al., and that
is the Devils River and its springs. These provide a highly reliable water source (at
least under the present climatic regime) along with dependent plant and animal
communities, arranged in a long, linear, north- south running array. The Devils River
is somewhat unique in the Lower Pecos environment in that unlike the Rio Grande
and the Pecos, which are fed by runoff originating in New Mexico and/or Mexico, the
Devils River has no runoff derived from precipitation except during infrequent flood
events, and is instead fed by discharge from the regional limestone aquifer, often
directly into the bed of the river, insuring that discharge is much less erratic and free
from dependence on extraregional climatic events. Pecan Springs, on the Hudspeth
River Ranch upstream from Baker's Crossing, has a recorded discharge in historic
times of up to 1200 liters per second (Brune 1981:451).

In addition to providing a reliable water source, the springs and river also support
significant fish and turtle populations and somewhere between one and two dozen
plant taxa of dietary significance, many of which are late summer to fall producers
(Table 4.1). Fish taxa identified from Baker Cave include carp sucker, blue sucker,
gray redhorse sucker, sunfish, Rio Grande perch, smallmouth buffalo, largemouth
bass, channel cat, blue cat, gar, and freshwater drum. These fish species assume
considerable importance late in the prehistory of the site.

Smith and Butterwick list Quercus fusifonnis as present in the Dolan Creek area, but Paul Cox
(personal communication) has identified the oak (both in modern comparative samples and
archeological samples from Baker Cave) on the ranch as Quercus sinuata, which is usually an
upland, not a riverine species.

One can imagine that in the case of relatively short-term arid episodes - on a
scale perhaps of generations, rather than centuries - climatic deterioration would
initially affect upland plant communities much more than riverine communities,
which, until depletion of the aquifer began to affect spring discharge, would persist
as a relatively secure oasis in an increasingly arid landscape. An initial human
response at the beginning of an arid episode, then, might be increased reliance on
riverine communities. Prolonged aridity, though, would have two effects: 1) sig­
nificant aquifer depletion would reduce the number of reliable springs, with the least
reliable sources drying up first; this would probably both increase the spacing between
water sources and would also reduce the size of hydrophytic or mesophytic plant
communities and aquatic or water-dependent animals; 2) deterioration of upland
ground cover, especially if coupled with convective thunderstorms, would lead to
increasingly flashy discharge in the Devils River and its tributaries. This would lead
to "flushing" of riverine resources such as pecan and walnut trees and fish populations
by extreme flood events. The removal of a stand of mature pecan trees many decades
old by severe flooding at Baker's Crossing in the 1970s is a good example; the 1932
flood also removed large stands of pecans, some older than 100 years according to
tree ring counts (Kochel 1980:308). Re-establishment of fish populations would also
be slowed by reduction of the drainage to isolated pools separated by lengthy gravel
bars, although the present pool and riffle system sustains a few very large catfish.
Dolan Falls, on the river below Baker's Crossing, is about 7.5 m high and also functions
somewhat as a barrier to re-establishment of fish popUlations. Flushing would be
especially devastating to the endemic populations of aquatic fauna that characterize
the Devils River, perhaps leading to irreversible extinction.
In comparison to the Pecos River, the Devils River is a more efficient and rapid
conductor of runoff (due to such factors as higher tributary drainage density). The
standard deviation of its annual maximum discharge is said to be greater than for any
other river of comparable size in the United States (Kochel 1980:254).
Harrell (1978) inventoried fish populations in the Devils River from Dolan Falls
upriver past Baker's Crossing to Pecan Springs, both before and after the major flood
of September 18, 1974. He found that for the most part species yielding the highest
biomass were very small fish such as minnows, shiners, and the Rio Grande darter
which, though individually small, are present in much larger numbers. Species such
as these might not be well represented even in the 1/8" mesh matrix collections from
Baker Cave. It was the larger species, such as bass and catfish. plus many of the
panfish which were absent after flooding (Harre111978:Table 1). Harrell found after
flooding that "habitat distinctness and species diversity declined, as did the popula­
tions of 6 of the 8 subdominant fishes. . . Four of the 6 dominants. . . increased
in abundance after the flood" (Harrell 1978:67). These four were, of course, generally
small (minnow to panfish sized). Short-term studies (not spanning flood events) of
macrobenthic diversity of the Devils River (Davis 1980) show high diversity and
significant endemism. In other desert ecosystems such as the Sonoran Desert, studies
of fish populations have sometimes shown rapid recovery after flooding (Meffe and
Minckley 1987), suggesting that the bedrock knickpoints in the Devils River are
critical barriers.

Such flushing of riverine resources might eventually reverse the initial trend
toward concentrated economic attention to the riverine zone by prehistoric human
populations. Eventually, continued aridity might lead to increased mobility.
Kochel (1980) studied slackwater deposition sites at the mouths of tributaries to
the Devils River both upstream and down from Baker's Crossing (Kochel
1980:Fig.70). One site studied (DR-9) is at the mouth of Miller Canyon, about 11.6
river km downstream from Baker's Crossing; a second, referred to as the Jarrett
Ranch site (DR-8), is located at the mouth of a nameless tributary about 2.1 river km
farther downstream from Miller Canyon, and about 11 km overland from Baker Cave.
Here Kochel found a basal gleyed unit (Unit 1), probably ponded sediments dammed
up by a Devils River side-channel bar; the overlying snail and mussel-bearing Unit 2
yielded a radiocarbon date on charcoal of 4505 ±130 B.P. (corrected). Units 3-5
contained buried soils, the Unit 4 soil dated at 3240±80 B.P. and the Unit 5 soil at
1265±80 B.P. The upper 4.5 m of deposits (Units 6-9) are gravels thought to have
been deposited by the 1932, 1948, and 1954 floods on the Devils River. Kochel
concludes that the section suggests a lack of catastrophic flooding from about 1300
B.P. until the 1932 flood (Kochel 1980:218-224). This probably accords well with our
recovery of riparian biota such as pecan stems, leaves, nutshell and hulls, walnut shell,
sections of cane, crawdad shell fragments, occasional aquatic snails, and fish bone and
scales in the most recent deposits in the 1984 and 1985 excavation areas at Baker Cave.
Future laboratory work on the Baker Cave collections ought to include some effort
to radiocarbon date the topmost strata excavated in 1985, along with careful sorting
to see if any post-BOO B.P. strata can be found that are lacking in riparian biota as a
result of catastrophic flushing. Very small fragments of fine, two-ply knotted netting
have also been recovered from nearly all of the fine screen samples that have been
picked so far. This netting is too fragmentary to give any definitive indication of the
mesh size, but the fine gauge of the cordage is appropriate for fish nets. These should
also be tabulated on a stratum-by-stratum basis.
Dietary Opportunism And Problems or Sampling
Time-Dependent Depositional Units

Shifts in economic strategies driven by climatic change represent only one
possible cause of variability in diet breadth. There are a number of other potential
causes. One troublesome cause is simply variation in the scale of timespans repre­
sented by deposits of dietary remains. To begin with, the diet of any predator itself
varies through time. One of the best ethnographic examples of this is Betty Meehan's
plot of the number of days when a given number of shellfish species were collected
by Anbarra gatherers (Fig. 4.12, adapted from Meehan 1982:Fig.l0), which ap­
proximates a Poisson distribution. Diets of most nonhuman predators vary on a
seasonal basis. One might expect maximum diet breadth, for example, in springtime
when an abundance of flowering and fruiting plants becomes available after the
winterlong season of dietary stress. In fact, however, it is often the opposite that
happens, because when a particularly nutritious and abundant fruit first ripens,
predators may gorge themselves on that particular item almost to the exclusion of

other food classes, until local patches are exhausted. This sort of variable omnivory
is a short-term analog for the kind of long-term diet- breadth/environmental stress
model proposed below. If we examine the wildlife biology literature on predator
diets, we soon find that much of the variation in diet breadth within a species or even
between unrelated species can be ascribed to two sources: 1) whether the analyst was
a lumper or a splitter; and 2) the span of time covered by the study. Even when the
dietary breadth of such diverse predators as barn owls, bobcats, and coyotes are
plotted, an exponential relationship between the time depth of the study and the
number of food classes can be recognized (Fig.4.13). Yellen (1986:Fig. 5) illustrates
essentially the same thing for diversity of animal species taken by !Kung hunters. Staff

et aI. (1986) refer to this effect as "time-averaging" and point out that it serves to
inflate the species richness of fossil death assemblages. There is also another way in
which time-averaging affects diversity indices. Peterson (1977) has shown that the
pooled diversity of time-averaged fossil assemblages nearly always exceeds the
average diversity of past living communities not so much because more of the rare
species are encountered as the sample is enlarged (indeed, information statistics such
as Shannon's H' are insensitive to changes in the rare species), but because of the
effect of increasing evenness of the more common species. If, however, diet breadth
is measured simply by counting taxa (as was discussed earlier), without considering
abundance or encounter rates, then the kind of diversity inflation discussed by
Peterson may not apply.

Ethnographic studies of hunter-gatherers, like the G/wi Bushmen of the central
Kalahari Desert or western Australian aborigines, also show significant seasonal
fluctuations in both quantities and diversity of plants and animals consumed as food
(Figs. 4.14, 4.15,4.16). Tanaka's studies of the San show that on a daily basis, more
than 90% of the diet may be provided by a single food plant (Tanaka 1980:Table 9).
We can easily imagine that the diversity of food remains in Bushman refuse must
fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis, and if different seasonal samples are
collapsed into a single annual sample, or into a sample representing several years,

species richness will inevitably increase. Alonso de Le6n, writing in 1649 or 16550
about unspecified bands of Indians in Nuevo Leon, seems to indicate heavy reliance
was placed on lechuguilla in winter and on prickly pear tunas and flowers in the
summer (de Le6n 1975:22); how otherwise diversified the diet might have been is not
indicated, but the same pattern of seasonal dependence may well have obtained for
the Lower Pecos. Kelly (1983:301-302) points out that the complete range of
economic strategies used for survival by hunter-gatherers is not manifested in a single
year, but over periods of ten, twenty, or perhaps thirty years or more. Richard Lee
(1976:95) says, "there is no such thing as a typical year for a hunter-gatherer."

The same principle can be expected to apply to dietary studies of prehistoric
humans. Turpin's last meal analysis records perhaps two or three kinds of economic
pollen, two kinds of seeds, a small amount of agave fiber, two fish taxa, one snake
taxon, a probable bat bone, bird feathers, two rodent taxa, and abundant grasshopper
remains (Turpin, Henneberg and Riskind 1986). Thus, perhaps slightly over a dozen
food classes are represented. If we look at Janet Stock's detailed study of Hinds Cave
coprolites, we find from 0 to 17 macrofossil constituents in her Area C sample, 2 to
16 constituents in the Area D sample, and 2 to 13 constituents in the Area B sample
(Stock 1983:Table 15). If we were to make an aggregate list of the constituents in each
deposit (although I haven't tried it yet), I would guess that the list of food classes
would be greater than the maximum number in anyone coprolite (that is, no coprolite
contains the complete range of constituents in the deposit). This means we would get

a significantly different dietary picture depending on whether our sampling strategy
addressed individual coprolites (as has been done in all of the Lower Pecos coprolite
research) or simply sampled entire latrines as single units. The number of con­
stituents might vary from as few as none in a single coprolite to as many as two dozen
or more in an aggregate latrine deposit.
Fortunately, individual coprolites can usually be identified as distinct units of
analysis (although this isn't always the case, as witnessed by the finding of two possible
sheet latrine deposits at Baker Cave in 1985). The situation is more difficult for
midden analysis, where discrete deposits mayor may not be recognizable, and where
we usually have very little idea of the amount of time expressed by a given deposit.
Another problem is presented by the large size of the fiber beds, which makes
representative sampling difficult. Note that in both the accounts of San foragers (by
Lee) and Anbarra foragers (by Meehan), smaller amounts of relatively less common
food items are contributed by marginal members of the community (the infirm, the
very young, or the very old) who operate as non-optimal foragers.
The radical stratum-to-stratum fluctuations in the diversity index (especially for
plant remains) that Alexander found at Conejo Shelter represent, I think, just this
kind of sampling difficulty. Most of the short- term diversity peaks are probably due
to aggregation of deposits that could have been separated had field conditions
allowed. Another interesting aspect of Alexander's diversity indices are the some­
what smaller diversity peaks displayed by the animal remains. This difference,
although not pronounced, may be because the animals behave more like perennials;
that is, except for hibernating (chiefly herpetofauna) or migratory species, much the
same suite of animal resources is available from season to season, probably more so
than for the contemporary G/wi, as in Figure 4.15.

Another possible cause of fluctuations in biodiversity might be fluctuations in
community size, since larger groups of occupants might well be simultaneously send­
ing out more foraging groups to sample different plant associations. Meehan
(1982:71, 74; 1983:10-11) also identifies some other sources of diversity that arise
despite targeting of preferred species. These include 1) contributions by children who
had not yet learned to identify preferred species; 2) contributions by older women or
children who were no longer able to reach the habitat where the preferred species
grew; 3} windfalls of all species created by natural events; 4) collection of a few
"snack" species that could be processed faster than the staple item; and 5) opportunis­
tic collecting that occurred when expected species were not available (as in the
Bushman account given above by Elizabeth Thomas).
Studies of the effects of aging on hunting efficiency among native bow-and­
arrow, shotgun, and axe hunters in Papua New Guinea have shown that hunting output
varies according to age and increasing knowledge of animal behavior, and that
differential access to shotguns and dogs and different amounts of time spent in
near-village (game-depleted) versus distant (pristine) habitats are influential factors
(Ohtsuka 1989; Dwyer 1983). A study by Toshio Kawabe of hunting by boys aged 6-16
years at the village of Rual in Papua New Guinea shows that the repertoire of animals
bagged increases predictably with age (Kawabe 1983:Table), although his study is
based on recall and does not show the number of different animals bagged at anyone
time. At any rate, the age and gender composition of any community may be expected
to exert at least some influence on the kinds of biological trash it discards.
Of course fluctuations like these, if truly documenting variations .in group size,
composition, length of occupation, or seasonal variability in resources, are in them­
selves topics of major interest to archeologists. I simply want to stress that if we are
interested in testing whether larger-order diversity fluctuations are driven by chang­
ing climate and economic adaptations, we must be able to distinguish between these
different orders of diversity cycles.
Lower Pecos Plant-Based Economies: Rummaging in the
Lechuguilla Patch with Labor-Intensive, Least-Risk Strategies
One of the most important events in the economic prehistory of the Lower Pecos
was the advent of large-scale collection and processing of lechuguilla and sotol (and
San Angelo yucca at Baker Cave). In fact, the Archaic economies of this region have
been characterized as heavily based on these semi-succulent staple plants. When
exactly did this occur? Answering this is more difficult than you'd think. Finding out
when major use of these plants developed can't be established just by determining
when they first appeared in the native vegetation, or even when scattered occurrences
first appear in archeological deposits. Van Devender (1986:Fig.4C) has found both
lechuguilla and sotol macrofossils in packrat middens at Boquillas in the Big Bend
(about 200 km west-southwest of Baker Cave) in mid-Wisconsin context, before
36,000 B.P., and he suggests the montane parts of the Big Bend served as a full-glacial
refugium for these and other xeric plants. At Maravillas Canyon, however (about 170

Baker Cave / 119

km west-southwest of Baker Cave), sotol makes its first appearance at about 28,000
B.P. and lechuguilla at about 12,500 B.P. (Van Devender 1986:Fig.3C). Here the order
of appearance is probably consistent with the fact that sotol, presently endemic as far
to the northeast as Johnson City (with an annual rainfall of about 34 inches, or 87 cm),
can tolerate a much wider range of moisture conditions than can lechuguilla.
Lechuguilla tolerates annual rainfall of about 30-50 cm (Gentry 1982:156) and rarely
occurs east of the Devils River, although Gentry reports it has been collected in
Uvalde County. It exists as far north as Coke County, with about 52 cm or less of
annual rainfall, but only in restricted xerophyte communities (Witter 1971). Since
May and June (and the months before and after) are the chief reproductive season
for sotol and lechuguilla, a thermal maximum at 13,000 B.P. as postulated by Davis
might have created a barrier to entry of the Lower Pecos until later in the Holocene.
Although vegetative propagation is more important for lechuguilla, seed dispersal is
a faster means of migration, so May-June temperatures (and especially rainfall rates)
might have been critical to dispersal.
At Eagle Cave, sotol pollen first appears in deposits roughly dated at 6000-9000
B.P. (period II, Story 1966:Table 1), followed by Agave (presumably lechuguilla)
toward the end of this period and the beginning of the next (period III, 4500-6000
B.P.; McAndrews and Larson 1966:Fig. 29). Remains of lechuguilla appear at Fate
Bell in the lowest stratum, Zone IV, poorly dated at period II (6000-9000 B.P.); at six
to seven feet in Area A of Coontail Spin ("mixed period I and II") and in Stratum V
of Eagle Cave (period II) (Irving 1966). The difficul ty with this early work at Amistad
is that botanical samples are small, depositional units are mixed or very thick, and
radiocarbon dating is inadequate.
At Hinds Cave, Agave (4%) and sotol (0.5%) pollen appear in Bryant's Sample
1 of Pollen Column 1 (depth 120 cm), dated before 8280 B.P., and rising to 16% sotol
in Sample 3 and 26% Agave in Sample 4. Both plants thus appear early, although
pollen counts aren't high enough to establish definite economic usage until samples
3 (105 cm) and 4 (95 cm), which are undated (Sample 8, at 30 cm, is associated with
Pandale points; Bryant 1977:75,77, Tables 1 and 2). In units AC-2 and AC-3, a massive
midden of fire cracked rock was excavated, associated with "cut leaf bases, quids of
lechuguilla and sotol and charred whole bases of lechuguilla" and Bandy points
(Shafer and Bryant 1977:43), although no baking pit was located in the midden. These
units have radiocarbon dates of 6230 and 6160 B.P. (Lord 1984:Table 3).
High incidences of dental caries among the Archaic burial population at
Seminole Sink led Marks, Rose, and Buie (1985:151) to propose a diet high in
carbohydrates and sugars, with polishing of enamel surfaces due to high fiber intake.
This population is thought to be Early Archaic (8900 to 4000 B.P., but more likely at
the early end of that time span), but any number of alternative plant foods, including
mesquite pods or prickly pear tunas, could be responsible for a high carbohydrate diet
(see also Hartnady 1988). At Conejo Shelter in the lower Pecos, Alexander (1974)
found both sotol and lechuguilla in his Period II deposits, dated 6000 to 9000 B.P., but
with only one radiocarbon date of 6700 B.P. Preservation at this level seems to have
been uneven, and I'm not sure how important these plants were. At Hinds Cave,

120 / Brown

Dering (1979) reports lechuguilla but no soto1 in Analysis Unit 8, dating to about 9200
B.P. or earlier (Lord 1984). A sotol flower stalk appears in the next highest analysis
unit, at about 9200 to 6800 B.P. We must go up to about 4500 B.P. before we can be
sure that these plants were major dietary components.
Recent stable isotope research by Huebner (this volume) promises to bring
important new evidence to pear on this problem. Briefly, a wide spread of a13C values
(-11.4 to -22.1 %0) appears in the late Hypsithermal Seminole Sink population at
5750-4670 B.P. (uncorrected), while the much smaller Late Holocene samples at
Conejo Shelter (2690-1980 B.P.) and Elcor Burial Cave (770 to 1020 B.P., collagen)
show less variable values ranging from -12.3 to -14.6%0. Of the values obtained, the
smaller ones suggest a certain reliance on plants with either c4 or CAM photosyn­
thetic pathways (especially lechueguilla) in both time periods, consistent with the
model presented here. At present, it is difficult to model climatic effects (mediated
through altered diet) on human diet. Simultaneously, increased diet breadth and
increased reliance on CAM plants during the Hypsithermal might have had counterac­
tive effects on the isotope signal.
The evidence is equally spotty in open sites. The consensus seems to be that ring
middens in the Lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos regions were earth ovens for baking
sotol and lechuguilla, but relatively few have been radiocarbon dated and fewer still
have produced identifiable plant remains. A ring midden in the Sanderson Canyon
watershed trenched by Shafer, yielding charred sotol remains, is one of the few
exceptions. A survey of dated ring middens published in 1968 by John Greer
produced mostly radiocarbon dates in the 12th to 15th centuries AD, with the com­
plete time span running from 960 B.P. to 460 B.P. (uncorrected), except for one
anomalously early date of 2560 B.P. (uncorrected) from Felton Cave No. 1 in Sutton
County (Greer 1968:Table 1). Other excavations since Greer's survey have continued
to produce similar results. Radiocarbon dates at Midden 1 at 41CX30 (discussed by
Greer but undated at the time) range from 970 to 1160 B.P. (three assays). This
midden had a central slab-lined pit about a meter in diameter with multiple fills, and
produced a single Ensor point (Sommer 1968; Word 1971:Figs. 4,5). Ring middens
at the Ram's Head site in Pecos County produced late radiocarbon dates, ranging from
about 940 to 240 B.P. (Young 1982:13, 15). At the Squawteat Peak site (41PCI4), also
in Pecos County, radiocarbon dates from Feature 1, a composite ring midden com­
posed of several overlapping ring middens, ranged from 420 to 1050 B.P. (Valastro,
Davis, and Varela 1977:311). Apparently at least two central processing pits were
exposed (separate assays were obtained from excavation levels as much as 0.76-0.90
m below the surface in the Midden 1 pit and 0.9-1.0 m below the surface in the Midden
2 pit), but because oflack of profiles and poor records (Young 1981) nothing is known
about these features. The oldest sample, at 1050 B.P., was recovered at a depth of
1.4-1.5 m but is not recorded as derived from a processing pit. Ring middens at Musk
Hog Canyon in Crockett County have, for the most part, produced similarly late dates
(520 B.P. at 41CX216C, 730 B.P. at 41CX216B, 660 B.P. and 1200 B.P. at 41CX217),
while an excavated earth oven (41CX131) produced very late dates of 170 B.P., 260
B.P., and 290 B.P. (two assays; Luke 1983:117-118, Table 2). Another ring midden in
Culberson County (41CU97, Feature 5) has produced a date of 710 B.P. (Katz

-

Baker Cave I 121

1978:87). Three Sutton County ring midden sites with central pit-baking features
(41SU8, 41SU9, and 41SU10), two of them with multiple middens, have been reported
by Jarvis and Crawford (1974:Fig.6) but have not been radiocarbon dated; they
suggest the sites date from the Middle to Late Archaic, based on surface finds of
projectile points resembling Langtry and Montell types. In the EI Paso area, several
small "roasting features" with firecracked rock have been reported at sites in the
Keystone Dam area. These are not typical ring middens. but may be related or
incipient features. One of these (Feature 10 at KS 36) has charred fibers tentatively
identified as Agave on the basis of polarized light microscopy (Scott 1985). This
feature has a radiocarbon date of 2660 B.P. (dendrocorrected), but Carmichael feels
this and other radiocarbon dates from the sites are too old because of collection of
dead wood as fuel. Radiocarbon dates for other large firecracked rock features at
these sites range from 1740-3410 B.P., but Carmichael prefers a date of A.D.5oo-90o
for KS 36 and AD. 1100-1400 for KS 37, based on obsidian hydration and cross-dating
(Carmichael 1985:479; 336-337). Ring middens in the Guadalupe Mountains
described by Katz and Katz (1981) lack baking pits, but may be plant-baking features
nevertheless, perhaps situated in areas without enough soil development to allow
digging a pit (see Katz and Katz 1981:203). These sites have Mesilla Phase, El Paso
Phase, or Transitional period (Late Archaic) artifacts associated. The Playa site, a
shallow ring midden in Hudspeth County without a central baking pit, is estimated to
date 600-1050 B.P. (Skinner, Steed, and Bearden 1974:73). Earth ovens (some with
multiple fills) lined with limestone cobbles were also investigated at the Walker No.
2 site, located on a Colorado River terrace in Coke County (Shafer 1971:115-122).
These produced very late dates of 110 and 240 B.P., and while this area is far to the
north of the Lower Pecos, Witter (1971:153) reports that small yuccas and restricted
stands of lechuguilla and sotol were found on exposed limestone areas on mesatop
terrain. This area must surely be at the northern limit for these latter two plants.
At Baker Cave, lechuguilla and sotol are absent from the Golondrina hearth at
about 9200 to 9000 B.P. (Hester 1983:Table 2). Charred sotol fiber definitely appears
in another hearth (Feature 84-16) dated at about 6500 B.P., and in the 1985 excavation
area is a bed of charred sotolleaf bases which may be even earlier; it is undated, but
seems to occur at about the same elevation as a date of 8000 B.P. obtained in 1976 by
Hester (1983).
In all of these instances, it is impossible to tell how crucial these plants were even
when we know they were being used. Perhaps more significant is the fact that at Baker
Cave, excavation and repeated reuse of large cooking pits began in the central part of
the shelter about 5000 B.P. and continued until late in the prehistoric sequence,
probably after 1100 B.P. (Fig.4.17). Presumably these pits were used primarily to cook
lechuguilla, sotol, and yucca, although analysis of some of the pit contents by Paul
Maslyk has shown a wide range of contents due to repeated backfilling and re-excava­
tion, even in one of the smaller and more discrete pits.
What seems to have happened at Baker Cave is that around 5000 B.P. a major
economic shift occurred, when significant quantities of lechuguilla, sotol, and San
Angelo yucca began to be processed in the central part of the shelter. Large fires

were built in these cooking pits, and the substantial heat released, followed by rapid
quenching when the cooking pits were sealed with dirt led to severe thermal stress on
the roof. The result was a major roof fall that occurred soon after the onset of this
cooking pit phase. These huge roof blocks in turn served to partition the interior
space and to function as windbreaks, thereby continuing to confine the cooking area

Baker Cave I 123

to the central part of the shelter. This persisted until around 1100 B.P., by which time
the deposits had accumulated to such an extent around the roof blocks that they no
longer functioned as effective windbreaks. The latest cooking pit (Feature 85-2,
containing two Perdiz points) is, as a result, offset to one side.
I would like to suggest that this major economic shift, which is marked in the
1984 profile by a sharp contact between tan roof dust below and black, charcoal­
stained deposits above, doesn't occur at the end of the Hypsithermal simply by
accident. I would like to suggest that it represents a least-risk response to mid­
Holocene environmental deterioration, and I also think it is evidence of increasing
diet breadth. Lechuguilla and sotol are plants that require a lot of work to process.
The heat levels required are critical since lechuguilla contains a toxin, called
sapogenin, which must be broken down by cooking before the plant becomes edible.
But both plants were abundant and, most important of all, because they are perennials
they were secure resources.
The shift to a lechuguillalsotollyucca-based economy probably marks the entry
of an economy of scale into the Lower Pecos, since substantial investments of energy
in processing the plants was required. Considerable effort was required to dig a
cooking pit and to haul firewood, water, grass and limestone (at Baker Cave, the
rapidly spalling roof produced friable clasts that were unsuitable as thermal reser­
voirs, hence talus rock had to be introduced from outside the shelter). Lechuguilla
and sotol plants had to be dug, trimmed, and hauled to the pit. After firing, the pit
had to be loaded and covered with backdirt, and after baking, the pit had to be
reopened, and at least in the case of soto1, further processing was probably required
after the plants were extracted. Even in the loose fill of Baker Cave, digging a large
cooking pit with a digging stick and basket represented a substantial investment of
labor. At least one of the cooking pits, Feature 84-12, showed evidence of repeated
use: eleven or more discrete fill units were visible in section. In cases like this, the
initial cost of digging a large pit could be amortized over many use episodes (see Hicks
1965:19), and the Baker Cave evidence seems to indicate that this was in fact cus­
tomary, even where we can't demonstrate multiple fills. Proposed Agave roasting sites
in California with multiple pits seem to show some evidence of stone-robbing, al­
though apparently new pits were dug when the site was reused (Shackley 1983:5). In
any case, lechuguilla, soto1, and yucca processing can probably be regarded as labor­
intensive, at least by comparison with the use of other plants that did not require such
extensive cooking to neutralize toxins or improve digestibility. It may also be that
storage facilities for these plant products came into use at the same time that major
emphasis on their collection began, marking the onset of an average payoff type of
economic strategy. Changes like these would have affected human mobility, com­
munity size, and territoriality as well.
If consumption was delayed, there should be some archeological evidence, both
in the form of processing features (for reducing cooked plants to flour) and storage
features. Buckelew reported that the Lipan Apache reduced baked sotol to flour with
wooden pestles in wooden or rock mortars. During the historic period, the Mescalero
Apache, equipped with horses or pack mules, penetrated the Guadalupe Mountains

124/ Brown

to gather and process large quantities of Agave for later consumption (Katz and Katz
1981:206-207). Although Shackley (1983:2) reports "bedrock agave processing an­
vils" and "associated hammerstones" at postulated Agave roasting sites in Imperial
County, California, comparable features are not known from the Lower Pecos region.
Bedrock mortars, however, are common at many Lower Pecos sites, both with and
without earth ovens. Testing of four bedrock mortars at the Perry Calk site revealed
mostly mesquite and Opuntia (prickly pear or tasajillo) seeds, with some Torrey yucca
seeds and walnut shell fragments and only traces of Agave fiber (Collins 1969:Table
3). The evidence for storage features is more ambiguous. Large storage pits seem to
be fairly uncommon in shelters, though some examples like Feature 84-3 at Baker
Cave are known. These features are easy to overlook without careful excavation, and
it seems possible that many pits could have been missed in excavation or destroyed
by prehistoric human activity.
Climatic Change As A Proximate Cause Of Changes In Dietary Diversity

It remains to consider whether climatic change might have directly influenced
dietary diversity without the intervention of human choice. rve characterized human
diet here as a highly biased sample of what the environment produces. structured by
facultative foraging considerations. What if prehistoric foragers were to take an
unbiased sample of whatever was available, but biodiversity changed as a result of
changing Holocene climate? Or, to propose a more realistic model, what if there is a
(minor) environmental component of dietary diversity along with a (major) human
component of diversity? How much change in dietary diversity might be due to
climatic change unmediated by foraging decisions? Van Devender (1980:368)
proposes that species diversity increased greatly in late Holocene plant communities
of southeastern New Mexico due to invasion of xeric species. We might approach the
problem of long-term changes in biodiversity through studies of packrat middens as
Van Devender has done, but unfortunately the packrats themselves are optimal
foragers, and we have no packrat midden data for the Lower Pecos. The extent to
which optimal foraging by packrats filters environmental changes in biodiversity
remains untested. Pollen analysis might offer more hope, but is plagued by differen­
tial pollen destruction over time, inability to discriminate certain taxa, and so forth.
James Owen has studied present-day mammal diversity on a statewide basis,
finding that variability of precipitation and temperature has only weak partial regres­
sion effects on diversity of mammals, although a statistically significant increase in
rodent diversity with increasing annual range of temperature was found. Of the
climatic variables, mean January temperature accounted for the most variance (Owen
1990:Table 1). While this study omits plants and may not be very applicable to
diachronic aspects of biodiversity, it seems to suggest that climate has only weak
effects on biodiversity.

Baker Cave I 125

Summary And Speculations

To recapitulate, the model I've outlined here predicts that if we adopt a non­
seasonal model embracing one or two major mid-Holocene thermal peaks, the onset
of the Hypsithermal should result in
1) increasing diet breadth
2) least-risk economic strategies, perhaps including the first semisuc­
culent plant based economies
3) volumetrically significant storage and processing facilities making
their first appearance simultaneously with volumetrically significant
cooking pits
Economic history following the Hypsithermal peak should result in
1) decreasing diet breadth
2) average-payoff economic strategies
The matter of diet breadth following the Hypsithermal was partially tested by
Alexander. His diversity indices for plant (Alexander 1974:Fig.17) and animal
remains (Alexander 1974:Fig.18) show stratum-by-stratum fluctuations which
probably indicate fluctuations in length of occupation and group size, but the diversity
curve for plant remains shows a slight long-term decline from about 4900 B.P. to 3300
or later (probably corresponding to Bryant and Holloway's mesic interval at 2500
B.P.), followed by a gradual rise to the top of the sequence at 1800 B.P. The faunal
diversity index is much more stable, but possibly shows the same trends. The curves
look different when summarized by chronostratigraphic units (Alexander 1974:Figs.
20, 21) and may be somewhat misleading. We should also recall that the diversity
index includes information on abundance not called for by the diet breadth modeL
Stock (1983) seems to provide additional confirmation; she finds that the average
diversity of constituents in a given coprolite seems to increase from the earliest
deposit studied (at about 8250 B.P.) to a later deposit at about 6750 to 7450 B.P., then
decrease in her latest deposit at about 5650 B.P. (Stock 1983:191; see FigA.18 in this
paper, which uses only number of species present). If we compare these dated
deposits to the global temperature curve (FigA.5 in this paper) we find the time span
between Stock's earliest and middle deposits corresponds to increasing temperature
during the onset of the Hypsithermal, while the span between the middle and latest
deposits corresponds to waning temperature after the first Hypsithermal maximum.
If, however, we embrace Davis' model of seasonally differentiated thermal peaks, the
situation may become somewhat more complex, since there is the potential for
differential response by different components of both plant and animal communities.
We should also note that Davis' thermal peak at 5000 B.P. corresponds to a thermal
minimum proposed by Imbrie and Imbrie (see FigA.5).
What seasonal role do lechuguilla and sotol play in the Lower Pecos archeologi­
cal record? Are these foods collected during spring, a time of relative abundance, and
the following warm months, or are they a winter famine food? The coprolite evidence

is difficult to interpret, and depends on finding significant quantities of fiber from
these plants associated (either in the same coprolite, or at least in the same latrine
deposit) with some kind of seasonal indicator. The most usual time of flowering for
both plants is in the spring, although delayed or repeated flowering may occur in
following months, depending on rainfall. High levels of pollen in coprolites therefore
probably indicates spring consumption, but it may indicate only consumption of
flowers unless some fiber from the plants is also demonstrably present (Bohrer found
considerable evidence of consumption of sotol flowers at Fresnal Shelter). At Parida
Cave, Riskind found enough Agave pollen in coprolites from Test Pit 4 to suggest an
economic (rather than "background" rates of ingestion) origin, especially in specimen
I and perhaps others from levels 2 and 3 (Riskind 1970:Table 6). This suggests
consumption during the spring. The dating of these specimens is uncertain. Bryant
(1974:413-415) found economic levels of Agave (8 coprolites) and sotol pollen (7
coprolites) plus macrofossil specimens of yucca flowers (8 coprolites) in coprolites
from Conejo Shelter attributed to the Late Archaic (ca. 2450-1150 B.P.). Four of the
specimens with economic levels of Agave pollen (coprolites 2, 7, 25, and 35) also
contained monocot fiber of Agave, sotol, or yucca, which may suggest spring consump­
tion oflechuguilla bulbs (Bryant 1974:Fig.3). Glenna Williams-Dean found economic
levels of Agave pollen in one coprolite (specimen 51) and of soto1 pollen in three
coprolites (specimens 30, 56, 78) out of 100 specimens from lens 13 (with radiocarbon

Baker Cave I 127

dates of 5710 and 5590 B.P.; Williams-Dean 1978:227) at Hinds Cave; of these,
specimen 51 also contained a trace of Agave epidermis, while specimen 78 contained
a trace of sotol epidermis (Williams-Dean 1978:Table 8). Many of the other coprolites
contained some evidence ofAgave epidermis (51 specimens) or sotol epidermis (eight
specimens), but these two specimens are the only ones that seem to point toward
spring pit-baking of soto1 or lechuguilla. The evidence for pit-baking of lechuguilla
and soto1 during the spring is therefore quite sketchy, and most of the evidence is
relatively recent in the archeological chronology.
The Agaves are characterized in the ethnographic literature chiefly as a
springtime food, although for a few groups (Yavapai, Kaibab Paiute, and unspecified
groups in Nuevo Leon; Brown 1988) it is explicitly mentioned as a winter famine food.
Sotol and yucca leaf bases are probably similar. As a footnote, we might note that the
toxic saponin (smilogenin) in lechuguilla is activated by a photodynamic agent, so that
toxicity is elevated during periods of bright sunlight (Gentry 1982:157). Presumably
this would be at a minimum during the winter. I have characterized these foods here
as dietary stress-response foods. If this is true, we might expect primary emphasis on
these pit-baked plants at the outset of the Holocene, since this is when seasonal
contrast was highest (and enamel hypoplasias on a small sample of teeth from the
Seminole Sink population do suggest periodic dietary stress in the early middle
Holocene); yet the archeology as reviewed here shows no evidence of heavy reliance
before about 5000 B.P. (except possibly at Hinds Cave, where baking of lechuguilla
and sotol may be present by 6200 B.P., although no pit was found), and most of the
dated sotoVmescal pits are quite recent. Perhaps this indicates the crossing of a social
threshold in the middle Holocene, when reduced mobility or larger group sizes
permitted community plant-processing tasks. It is striking that open sites with ap­
parent pit-baking features (Felton Cave and KS 36 at Keystone Dam are exceptions
with early dates at about 2600-2700 B.P.) date from about A.D.750 to the historic
period, but with most of the radiocarbon dates appearing at about A.D.1200-1500
(the Pacific period of Baerreis and Bryson). Despite this, the vegetal residue of the
pit-baking process appears much earlier in sheltered sites, by at least 5000 B.P. if not
earlier.
The pattern that seems to emerge in all of this is that pit-baking of lechuguilla
and sotol (and, at Baker Cave, San Angelo yucca as well) appears earliest in the Lower
Pecos at base camps in large rockshelters, possibly occurring only as relatively small­
scale winter(?) consumption in response to dietary stress. Late in the Medithermal,
especially in the Pacific climatic interval from A.D.1200-1500 , the economic role of
pit-baking changes and springtime(?) baking of these plants by special task groups at
open sites situated near stands of lechuguilla, soto1, and firewood becomes
widespread, presumably not in response to dietary stress but as a way to take ad­
vantage of high sugar levels in the plants at flowering season, harvesting of the plants
occurring at a rate permitting a temporary surplus of production. Pit-baking sites are
moved out of rockshelters and relocated adjacent to stands of these plants and
firewood because larger quantities of the plants are being processed. This episode
occurs at a time (A.D.1250-1300 ) in southeastern New Mexico when bison hunting
rather quickly becomes widespread, perhaps prompted, according to Stuart and

Gauthier (1981:274), by a shift to increased and winter-dominant rainfall, followed
shortly by the onset of the "Great Drought" tree ring-dated at A.D. 1276-1299 in the
core area of the Southwest, and followed (at about A.D.1300-1650) by widespread
bison hunting in west central Texas (Creel, Scott, and Collins 1990:64). Some pit­
baking in large shelters continues (for example, at Baker Cave, and perhaps at Fate
Bell), but is perhaps a spring activity here as well. My assignment of baking to
wintertime and springtime, above, is simply speculative at this point since no effective
seasonality test has yet been devised, either for open or sheltered sites.
We can see that pit-baking of Lower Pecos xerophytes by native human
populations certainly evolved by mid-Holocene time, and we can see that the practice
was taken over and continued by Apachean immigrants to the area. But we cannot
see any unquestionable Apache ring middens (though Katz and Katz suggest sites with
pits might be Apache). Some of the excavated sites with very late radiocarbon dates
(like Walker No.2, Squawteat Peak, or 41CX131) may be Apache in origin, and
ethnographic accounts such as Buckelew's testify to historic pit-baking of sotol or
other plants by Apaches (indeed, the practice was still common enough elsewhere in
the Southwest to be photographed in 1906 by Edward S. Curtis). What is particularly
interesting from an archeological viewpoint is that these late sites seldom or never
have any identifiably Apachean artifacts, while known Infierno phase sites in the
region have no known pit-baking features. Adaptation to the environment, then,
appears rationally and economically structured, not ethnically or culturally
"dictated" .

THREADED AND TWINED MATTING:
A LATE INTRODUCTION INTO THE LOWER PECOS
Roberta McGregor

Introduction

Dry rockshelters in the Lower Pecos area of southwest Texas contain the
evidence of thousands of years of human occupation. Around 7000 B.C., hunting and
gathering peoples began using the rockshelters as living sites and later, starting about
A.D. 200 (the beginning of the Transitional Archaic period), as both living and burial
sites. During the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1600), occupation of
rockshelters continued but with a reduction in intensity.
Throughout this long period of rockshelter habitation, the people left behind in
the deposits the debris of everyday life. Scattered amid layers of fire-cracked lime­
stone, ash, lithic refuse, and plant remains are items of material culture not usually
preserved in the archeological record. Among these are fiber artifacts, including
literally thousands of matting fragments and even dozens of complete mats, preserved
because of the dry and protected surroundings.
Mat TYpes

Four different mat types have been recovered from rockshelter deposits; two of
these were made by plaiting, one by twining, and the final mat type, the one with which
this paper is concerned, by a combination of threading and twining. The repre­
sentative matting type of the Lower Pecos is the plaited mat which occurs in
overwhelming numbers and is found wherever matting is reported. In contrast, only
one twined mat, from Shumla Cave, which is probably intrusive, has been published
(Schuetz 1963). The twined and threaded mat is almost as rare (six are known) and
is possibly a late introduction into the area.
The customary mat is one produced by simple plaiting, that is, one element is
woven over the other in an over-one-under-one alternation (lIl) resulting in a
checkerweave appearance. Mats of simple plaiting are absent in the Southwest and
Great Basin (MacNeish 1958:102), but have been found in the Big Bend area of Texas
(Coffin 1932:36; Setzler 1932:136) and in Mexico, both in Tamaulipas (MacNeish
1958: 102) and Coahuila (Cosgrove 1947:115; Taylor 1966:74).
The simple plaited mat is closely followed in frequency by twilled plaiting in
which the rhythm is varied to over-two-under-two (2/2), creating a herringbone effect
with diagonal patterns. In prehistoric times, native people also wove twill mats in
what is now New Mexico (Cosgrove 1947:115), Arizona (Haury 1950:402), the Big

Bend area of Texas (Cosgrove 1947: Fig. 107; Smith 1927:60), and in Tamaulipas
(MacNeish 1958: 100), Coahuila (Cosgrove 1947: 115; Taylor 1966:74), and
Chihuahua, Mexico (Weltfish 1940:79).
A third type of mat is made by open simple twining, using bundles of grass as the
warp and cordage as the weft. Twined mats have been recovered from Shumla Cave
in the Lower Pecos (Schuetz 1963:149), the Big Bend area of Texas (Coffin 1932:43;
Cosgrove 1947:113; Jackson 1937:177), Utah (Steward 1937:29-32; Adovasio
1986:195), Nevada (Loud and Harrington 1929: Plate 24; Rozaire 1974:90), Oregon
(Adovasio 1986:195), and
Arizona (Guernsey 1931: Plate 58), as well as Coahuila, Mexico (Taylor 1966:
Fig. 21).
The last mat type, the threaded and twined mat, is referred to by W. W. Taylor
(1988:37) as "strung matting." This technique involves the aligning of plant stems (the
warp) horizontally one above the other and threading the stems on cordage (the weft),
probably with the aid of a needle. The sides are twined with cordage.
Bobby L. Hicks recently donated such a threaded mat, found in a shelter in
Crockett County, 7 miles northwest of Pandale and 1 mile east of the Pecos River, to
the Witte Museum (Fig. 5.1). Similar mats have been recovered from four other sites
in the Lower Pecos: Fate Bell Shelter (Pearce and Jackson 1933:Plate XXIII); the
Zuberbuehler Ranch (the artifact generously loaned to the Witte Museum by Emil
Zuberbuehler for analysis and documentation); Leaping Panthers, 41VV237 (Solveig
Turpin, personal communication, 1990); and the Walters site in Crockett County
(Lorrain 1968:38). Holden (1941:45-50, Plate 6) reports comparable matting from
four shelters in Pecos County, Texas. In New Mexico, threaded matting was found in
the Upper Gila area (Cosgrove 1947:114) and at Tularosa Cave (Hough 1914: Figure
178). Taylor (1988:37) recovered a fragment of "strung matting" from a burial cave
in Coahuila, Mexico.
The Hicks threaded mat measures 131 cm long and 47 cm wide and, although
incomplete, a large portion, including selvage on one side, remains. The other three
selvages are completely missing. The intact selvage has been twined with two-ply Z­
twist cordage, 1 cm from the edge. A 2 mm-wide Z-twist cord is threaded through the
plant stems parallel to the selvage and 14 cm from it. A second cord, slightly wider
at 3 mm, is threaded through 13-14 cm from the first. There is some evidence of
deliberately split fibers approximately 13 cm from the second cord, indicating a
possible third cord may have been threaded through the fibers. The mat appears to
have been folded lengthwise at the second threaded cord. This probably indicates the
center of the mat. If this is the case, the mat was originally around 55 cm long.
Determining the length of the mat is less speculative than determining the width,
because the second thread cord is tied around a split sotolleaf, designating one end.
At the opposite end of this cord are three knots, fairly close together, probably
indicating the weaver had started the mat at this end. The threaded second cord
measures 155 em to the first knot.

The twined selvage cord extends 9 cm beyond the last plant stem on one end and
29 cm on the other. Both ends are knotted. The open spaces, where the plant stems
were once inserted, remain in the cord. When first made, this mat probably
measured around 169 cm. Now, however, it is fragile and distorted so that the
measurements are approximate.
Dr. Don McLean of Incarnate Word College, San Antonio, Texas, identified the
mat fibers as Scirpus acutus Muhi., a hard stem bulrush. This triangular stemmed plant
is a common sedge of the Trans-Pecos bottom lands, thriving during intermittent flood
situations.
Dr. Solveig Turpin of the University of Texas at Austin submitted loose fibers
from the Hicks mat to the University Radiocarbon Laboratory for assay. The ~13C
corrected radiocarbon date of 570±70 B.P. (TX6838) calibrates to the range from
A.D.1290 to 1420 (Stuiver and Reimer 1987), placing the mat firmly in the Late
Prehistoric period and indicating this type of matting was introduced into the Lower
Pecos area during Transitional Archaic-Late Prehistoric times.
Prehistoric Lower Pecos Sleeping Pits

Shafer (1988:30) provides a description of pit features found in several shelters
in the Lower Pecos where they are best interpreted as ancient bedding areas:
The living areas in the better-preserved caves often have shallow,
grass-lined pits, usually near the back wall, which presumably served as
sleeping areas (Shafer and Bryant 1977, Epstein 1962 [sic], Dibble and
Prewitt 1967). These pits sometimes have a rather complex structure;
they are oval, scooped out of the cave floor, and layered with green twigs
and branches that are in turn covered with thick layers of grass. A layer
of flat objects-prickly pear pads (with spines removed), fragments of
matting, or discarded sandals-was placed on top of the grasses, and over
this apparently was placed apetate (rectangular checker-weave mat).
The Hicks mat, discovered in a crevice created earlier by a roof fall, most likely
made up the top layer of a prehistoric sleeping bed. In preparing the bed, a pit,
approximately 16 inches deep, had been dug from the midden fill. A thick layer of
prickly pear pads covered the bottom of the pit, followed by almost 6 inches of grass.
The next layers consisted of sotol leaves neatly placed lengthwise, a simple plaited
mat, and finally the threaded mat. Peyote buttons were found on the south end of the
bed and a paint brush on the north (Bobby L. Hicks, personal communication, 1990).
Prehistoric Lower Pecos Burial Pits

Just a few threaded and twined mats have been reported from the Lower Pecos.
Of the six known, one is from a burial pit (Solveig Turpin, personal communication,
1990); one is from a sleeping bed, the Hicks mat; and the two from Fate Bell Shelter
(Pearce and Jackson 1933:61-64) may be portions of sleeping beds rather than burials.

Threaded and Twined Matting / 145

The differences between beds prepared for burials and those prepared for
sleeping are not clearcut. Some burials duplicate the same traits found in sleeping
beds: layers of brush, grass, prickly pear pads, and matting (see Martin 1933; Pearce
and Jackson 1933). The order of layering can vary. In addition, burial pits possess
other features. Most significant is the stone lining and covering of some of the pits.
It may be that in a few cases (where only unidentifiable bones are found), features
described as burials are instead sleeping areas with their attendant hearths.
According to Shafer (1988:30-32):
Fire hearths are generally either ash lenses from in situ burning or
shallow ash-filled basins. It is the author's impression that at Hinds
Cave these kinds of hearths were found in the sleeping area of the
shelter near the back wall and may have been more for warming-fires
than for cooking. The shallow ash-filled basins measure from less than
1 meter to 2 meters across and are lined with slabs of burned limestone.
The construction of pit burials L-4 and L-5 at Fate Bell Shelter (Pearce and
Jackson 1933:61-64) appear to be the same: a layer of brush, followed by plaited
matting, and on top a threaded and twined mat. Small limestone slabs rest above and
below the layers. The lack of information on the skeletal material recovered from the
pits leads one to question whether these were burials at all. In reference to Burial
L-4, Pearce and Jackson (1933:61) write: "There was nothing in the grave that could
positively be identified as human skeletal remains . .. Possibly it was a cremated
burial, though the charred bones may have been those of some animal or bird." In
regard to Burial L-5, Pearce and Jackson (1933:64) recall: "The burial was in a deposit
of ashes and small burnt stones." Yet, there is no description of the corpse nor any
record of it.
However, at one site, a threaded and twined mat was found in direct association
with a burial. At 41 VV237, Leaping Panther, two individuals (gender unknown) were
buried about 3 feet below the surface. The grave contained a threaded and twined
mat measuring 6 to 8 feet long (rolled up like a carpet), a plaited mat, a digging stick
and a rabbit skin vest. Two metates, one stained with red ochre, were placed over the
heads (Solveig Turpin, personal communication, 1990).
In conclusion, a new type of mat appeared in the Lower Pecos area, probably
during the Late Prehistoric period. The flexible threaded and twined mat, usually
longer and wider than plaited mats [the largest plaited mat known is the outer
wrapping of the Skiles Mummy which measures 185 cm long and 73 cm wide (Turpin,
Henneberg, and Riskind 1986:303)] may have been used as a "back-pack" as well as
a resilient cover for the bed. Because of the water-proofing capabilities of sedge, the
plant from which this mat type is made, the mat may also have been used during
inclement weather as insulation on a brush hut, a type of housing probably used at
this time when open terrace and upland sites were more frequently utilized.

HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS
FROM SKYLINE SHELTER (41VV930),
VAL VERDE COUNTY, TEXAS.
Joseph F. Powell
Although studies of human adaptation and bioarchaeology have their roots in
the pioneering efforts of Hooton (1930) and Angel (1966) to break from the tradition
of case-by-case reports of prehistoric disease, the push toward population-level
studies of prehistoric human biology began in the 1970s. Bioarchaeology is directed
to examining how human biology and culture interact at the level of population, not
the individuaL Unfortunately, only a few large scale bioarchaeological studies of
populations in the Lower Pecos region have been conducted (Hartnady 1988; Marks,
Rose, and Buie 1985; Reinhard, Olive, and Steele 1989; Steele and Powell in review).
It is only with an expanded series of skeletal remains from the region that effective
bioarcheology can be conducted in the Lower Pecos. In this chapter, the individuals
buried at Skyline Shelter (41VV930) are described, and features of their health and
skeletal/dental biology are compared to other Archaic and Late Prehistoric
populations. This study is intended to enlarge our current knowledge of Lower Pecos
populations.
Skyline Shelter (41 VV930) is a large rockshelter situated on the west bank of the
Devils River in Val Verde County, Texas (Frontispiece). The site is approximately 75
meters long, 15 meters wide, and contains over 3 meters of deposits that have
produced a wide range of Archaic and Late Prehistoric cultural materials, rock art,
faunal remains, and human skeletal remains (Turpin 1990). Like many other localities
in the Lower Pecos region, preservation of bone was excellent but considerable
post-burial mixing and fragmentation made accurate description and analysis of
human remains difficult.
Excavation and Analysis
Test excavations in Skyline Shelter focused on two areas - the main shelter and
a small alcove 35 meters to the north. Human skeletal remains were recovered from
Unit 2 in the Alcove, and from Unit 4 in the main shelter. In Unit 4, only one burial
feature was recorded (Feature 4-3). Seven contiguous lxI-meter units located in the
Alcove produced a varied assemblage of human remains. Because of rodent distur­
bances, repeated use of the area, and roof fall, these remains were badly fragmented
and comingled. Units 2 and 2A produced three separate burial features, designated
as Skeletons 2, 3 and 4, the latter extending into Unit 2E. A fifth feature, Skeleton 5,
was also noted in Unit 2E. Dates for the sample are forthcoming, but at least one
burial pit (Feature 4-3) was excavated into Middle Archaic strata, suggesting a Late
Archaic date for this burial (Solveig Turpin, personal communication). Other burials

149

are associated with both Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. All excavated
materials were plotted in the field on level forms. Field conservation of bone was
performed using polyvinyl acetate (diluted in ethanol) applied directly to exposed
bone. After recording and stabilizing bone, human and faunal remains were returned
to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at
Austin, for initial inventory.
Human skeletal remains were analyzed at the Physical Anthropology
Laboratory, Texas A&M University where each box of skeletal remains was checked
against the specimen inventory, then washed, dried, and labeled. Poorly preserved
bones and reconstructed crania or facial bones were not washed. After drying,
nonhuman faunal remains were separated and returned to TARL for curation. Each
human specimen was inventoried using the Vertebrate Faunal Analysis Coding System
(FACS) (Shaffer and Baker 1990). Because of the fragmented and comingled nature
of the human remains at Skyline Shelter, the FACS system was used to generate
inventories by lot number, unit, feature, and area. This was done to provide the most
accurate estimate of minimum number of individuals (MNI) possible. MNI data were
produced by first determining the number of same side, same element bones present
(Chaplin 1971:70-75). Also taken into account was the presence of individuals of
different ages (Bonkonyi 1970:291-292) and different sizes (Klein and Cruz-Uribe
1984:27). These methods are typically used for nonhuman faunal assemblages, but
have great applicability for human remains because they prevent the artificial depres­
sion of the MNI (Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984:27). Three identifiable individuals in
Feature 4-3 were inventoried separately and added to the Alcove MNI. Attempts
were made to assess the degree of comingling in the Alcove materials by comparing
the MNI for feature designation with the MNI for site area.
Before conducting MNI analysis, age and sex determinations for individual
elements were made. Sex was assessed only for adults. Determinations were based
on the os coxae, sacrum, and cranium using general skeletal architecture (Bass 1987;
Krogman 1962; Steele and Bramblett 1988), metric functions (Steele 1976) or specific
skeletal traits, especially on the os pubis (Phenice 1969; Suchey et al. 1979). The age
of sub adults was determined using estimates of size (Fazekas and Kosa 1978; Kosa
1989; Ubelaker 1989), epiphyseal fusion (Krogman 1962; McKern 1970), and dental
eruption (Schour and MassIer 1944). Adult ages were determined from the os pubis
(McKern and Stewart 1957; Gilbert and McKern 1973), the auricular surface (Lovejoy
et al. 1985; Meindl and Lovejoy 1989), ectocranial suture closure (Meindl and Lovejoy
1985), or dental wear (Brothwell 1982). Because of the high rates of attrition in
individuals from the Lower Pecos, Brothwell's (1982) method was slightly modified
to account for premature tooth loss and differential wear as noted by previous
researchers (Turpin, Henneberg, and Riskind 1986; Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985;
Hartnady 1988). Age categories used in this study include:
Fetus: less than 10 lunar months;
Infant: birth to 1 years;
Young Child: 1 to 5 years;
Older Child: 6 to 10 years;
Young Adolescent: 11 to 15 years;

Skyline Shelter I 151

Older Adolescent: 15-19 years;
Young Adult: 20-35 years;
Middle Adult: 36-49 years;
Older Adult: 50 or more years of age
After inventory, long bones and cranial fragments were reconstructed and os­
teometric data were recorded following Bass (1987), Olivier (1969), and Steele and
Bramblett (1988).
The osteometric analysis is not presented in this chapter because the small
sample and highly fragmented nature of the skeletal assemblage produced only a
handful of metric data. Medical disorders of the teeth and bones were recorded by
type and area on each skeletal element. Disorder categories include osseous infec­
tions (either periostitis or osteomyelitis), alveolar resorption (periodontal disease),
dental abscessing, degenerative lesions of the vertebral column or appendicular
skeleton, neoplasms, trauma, hemopoietic lesions (such as porotic hyperostosis and
cribra orbitalia), and other disease conditions.
Dental data were recorded for each tooth present, including the type of wear,
infections, caries, and congenital defects. In addition, dental wear rates were
analyzed following Scott (1979).
Shelter Remains

The number of identified specimens (NISP) recovered from the main area of
Skyline Shelter represented only three individuals although a number of other graves
had obviously been plundered by relic hunters (Solveig Turpin, personal com­
mmunication, 1990). All three were located in Unit 4 and were designated as Feature
4-3, "Mother and Child." This feature consisted of an adult female in a flexed
position. She had been placed on a smooth, flat limestone bench, on her right side,
facing the rear wall of the shelter. On her neck and left cheek were the remains of
what appeared to be a single neonate. Analysis later proved this to be one premature
or fetal individual and a second neonate. A broken metate was placed over her torso,
and another metate and a large flat rock were used to cover a portion of her lower
body. Associated with this feature were a broken drill and a mano which mayor may
not have been grave goods.
Of the total NISp, 319 bone fragments belong to the adult female (#3488). This
individual was determined to be 30 to 40 years old at the time of her death. This
summary age was derived from a principal components analysis of ages determined
using the auricular surface (Meindl and Lovejoy 1989), dental attrition, and pubic
symphysis (Gilbert and McKern 1973) following the formulae of Meindl, Lovejoy and
Mensforth (1983). Modal age for dental wear was 40 to 45 years; age from the
auricular surface was 40 to 45 years; using the Gilbert and McKern (1973) method for
the os pubis, an estimate of 30 to 47 years was produced. Dental wear in this
population advances at a rate that is unusual for most hunter-gatherers (Marks, Rose,
and Buie 1985; Hartnady 1988) and thus overestimates age. The Meindl and Lovejoy

152 \ Powell

(1989) method also tends to overestimate ages. Thus, the 30-40 year age range seems
most accurate. The importance of the age estimate for this individual will be dis­
cussed below.
The state of preservation of this individual is fair. Most of the bones of the upper
body are well-preserved, presumably protected by the metate. The lower body is
more deteriorated and fragmented. Root etching is present on ribs, the radii, and
humeri. The right femur is highly eroded on the proximal side due to post-mortem
exposure or chemical leaching.
Estimates of the body size of the adult female were hindered by the fragmented
condition of many of her long bones. Although reconstructions were conducted, the
portions present did not permit any metric assessment of size. The female appears to
be typical of the Lower Pecos populations where female average adult stature is
between 152 and 158 cm (Steele and Powell n.d.).
The dental health of this female is also representative of most Lower Pecos
individuals of the same age. The lower molars are missing premortem or have highly
angled wear that exposes the underlying dentin and pulp cavity. Other mandibular
teeth have dentin exposure and formation of secondary dentin. The upper molars are
either not worn or are moderately worn because their lower occlusal partners were
lost earlier in life. The upper incisors are missing premortem. This is a pattern typical
of the region (Turpin, Henneberg, and Riskind 1986; Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985;
Hartnady 1988), one that has been attributed to a combination of specialized process­
ing of desert succulent plants and an oral environment conducive to infection and
premature tooth loss.
The adult woman from Feature 4-3 also reflects the medical disorders of mid­
dle-aged hunter-gatherers. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is present in the
vertebral column in the form of osteophytosis on the superior and inferior anterior
borders of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrae, one unidentified thoracic
vertebra, the fifth lumbar vertebra, and the border of the sacral promontory. Periar­
ticular pitting and lipping was present on the sternal facets of both clavicles and on
the distal radius. A compression fracture of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae
indicate that age-related osteoporosis may have affected this individual. Schmorl's
nodes are present in the centra of C4, C5, LS, and the first sacral element.
In addition to age-related degenerative changes, this female was affected by
trauma. Two left ribs evidence healed fractures. A circular depression on the dorsal
aspect of the costal end of both ribs, as well as the poor alignment of the fragments,
suggests that a dorsally directed force not only broke these ribs, but resulted in their
dislocation from the sternum. No other medical disorders were noted in this in­
dividual.
An attempt was made to determine the colon contents of the adult in Feature
4-3 by sampling pollen contained in the soil adhering to the sacrum. As a check, soil
samples from the iliac crest and from outside the feature were analyzed by John Jones,
Palynology Laboratory, Texas A&M University. The results showed that while the
samples from the iliac and extraburial regions contained windblown, non-economic

Skyline Shelter I 153

pollen types, the sacral sample was filled with economic pollen. Frequent species
included Dasylirion (sotol), Platyopuntia (prickly pear), and Low-spine Asteracae
(ragweed group). Most striking, over 90% of the pollen was from Typha angustfolia
(cattail). Such high concentrations suggest that this pollen was consumed, perhaps in
the form of medicinal tea or food prior to death (Jones, Powell, and Turpin n.d.).
In addition to the adult female, there were neonate/fetus remains in Feature 4-3.
At first these materials were considered to be a single individual, since almost all of
the long bones were present with no duplication of elements. However, metric
analysis of long bone dimensions revealed that two distinct individuals were present
(Table 6.1). The first, a neonate (#3489A), was well represented, with 21 skeletal
elements primarily from the right side of the body. The second neonate (#3489B)
was represented by only four left skeletal elements. No pathological conditions or
taphonomic features were present in either of these individuals.
Age was determined using long bone measurements given in Fazekas and Kosa
(1978), Kosa (1989), and Ubelaker (1989). Table 6.1 presents the results of age
assessment. The regression of body length on age for #3489A is between 47.9 and
53.3 em long, for an estimated age of 8.59 to 9.97 lunar (fetal) months (Fazekas and
Kosa 1978:Table 181). The second neonate is much larger and appears to represent
a live birth, with a body length of 50.6 to 60.8 cm (Fazekas and Kosa 1978:Table 184)
and estimated age of well over 10 lunar months. It must be stressed that age for size
in the Lower Pecos population was probably not the same as for the modern popula­
tions from which Fazekas and Kosa (1978) drew their measurements. In fact,

154 \ Powell

undernutrition and other environmental factors tend to reduce birth weights
(Ubelaker 1989:64; Lechtig et al. 1975). Thus, the accuracy of the ages can be
questioned.
What is undeniable is that one fetus or small-weight infant, and a second longer
term child about 2-3 months older, are included with the skeleton of a middle-aged
(by Lower Pecos standards) female (see Reinhart, Olive, and Steele 1989; Steele and
Powell n.d. for discussions of Lower Pecos demographic patterns). Although the
"Mother" could have been the mother to one of the children, there is no biological
possibility that she could be the mother of the second because of the proximity of the
ages of the children. Why is an older female, past the prime of childbearing years for
most hunter-gatherers, buried with two small babies? Why is another child, which
could not be hers, buried with her? Unfortunately, the skeletal evidence does nothing
to clarify these interpretive difficulties.
Alcove Remains
All materials recovered from the Alcove area are badly comingled. Although
the estimates of MNI take mixing into account, it becomes difficult to describe the
frequency of conditions by the number of individuals affected. Instead, frequency of
disorders is presented by percentage of that element affected. This approach is
similar to that used for ossuary samples (Pfeiffer 1984; Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985).
MINIMUM NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
MNI estimates for the Alcove sample were generated using the techniques
described above. First, the MNI of all Alcove materials was determined. Then, each
Lot number assigned to a specific feature number was used to generate MNI by
feature in hope that the field identification of individuals was actually a minimum
number. Finally, as a check of both vertical and horizontal mixing, MNI for each Unit
was determined.
Tables 6.2 through 6.4 describe the differences in MNI using the three methods.
MNI by Unit shows that a minimum of 19 individuals are represented. From Table
6.2, it can be seen that several individuals are scattered across units. Using the
Feature number method (Table 6.3), a total of 15 individuals is produced. It is obvious
that a majority of the NISP are not assigned to a feature. Of the designated features,
all represent two or more individuals (with the exception of Skeleton 5), again
indicating that some comingling occurred. Using the entire Alcove assemblage (Table
6.4), an MNI of 10 individuals is reached. This is the most conservative approach to
the analysis of these comingled remains. It can be said that there are a minimum of
10 individuals in the assemblage, but there could be as many as 19 or more persons
represented by a few skeletal elements each.

DEMOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT

Because of the difficulty in assigning isolated bone fragments to individuals, the
age and sex data for each individual adult bone are presented in Tables 6.5 and 6.6.
Ages represented in the Alcove materials range from 2.5 to 50 years. One young child,
approximately 2 to 3 years of age, was represented by a mandible fragment, one
deciduous tooth, and a parietal fragment. The bulk of aged elements are in the Middle
Adult range, although this is artificially lowered by the broad age ranges resulting
from forensic techniques. Averaging the midpoint of each range by element (Table
6.6), the mean age at death for adult Alcove burials was 30.8±8.7 years, compared to
a mean age of 26.86± 13 years for all individuals at Skyline Shelter. This indicates that
the Alcove sample is dominated by middle and older adults. No adolescent remains
were recovered.
TAPHONOMY

Nearly every bone in the Alcove assemblage exhibited dry breakage, presumably
from the weight of overburden, the frequency of roof fall, and the repeated use of a
small space as a burial ground (Solveig Turpin, personal communication). In addition,
there is evidence of rodent disturbance in the area. Rodent gnawing on bone was

of both fractures suggests repeated heating, both before and after collagen had left
the bone. Also charred or partially calcined were two ulna fragments, a piece of skull,
and a distal femur. Many specimens suggest exposure to low heat. The limited extent
of burning, indications of repeated heat exposure, and presence of charred human
and nonhuman bone are all typical of indirect heat exposure. There was nothing in
the human remains to suggest intentional cremation, although cremations are known
in the region (Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985; Turpin, Henneberg, and Riskind 1986).
Human Biology at Skyline Shelter

The human skeletal remains from Skyline are significant for a number of reasons.
Their biological information supports previous studies in the area regarding dental
disease, diet, and overall health (Hartnady 1988; Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985; Rein­
hard, Olive, and Steele 1989; Steele and Powell n.d.). In addition, the osteological
evidence has shown that the population was able to deal with debilitated individuals.

Feature 4-3 demonstrated that the original "Mother and Child" was actually "Mother
and Children", This appears to be a unique situation among the many burials in the
Lower Pecos (Turpin, Henneberg, and Riskind 1986). The fragmentary nature of the
remains prevented several types of analysis, but did yield data on the taphonomy,
demography, and health of the inhabitants of Skyline Shelter.
TAPHONOMIC FACTORS

The prime taphonomic factor affecting human remains at Skyline is crushing and
dry breakage of bone. The remains from the Alcove are both fragmentary and
comingled. To illustrate the level of breakage, the NISP per individual was generated
for both Skyline and Seminole Sink remains. At Skyline, the NISP is 2341 for 10
individuals, with a representation of 234.1 fragments/individual. At Seminole Sink,
bodies were subject to breakage from falling into the cave, rockfall, and water action.
The NISP is 2087 for 22 individuals (Marks, Rose, and Buie 1985), with a repre­
sentation of 94.9 fragments/individual. Why the Skyline assemblage is so badly
damaged is not certain, but excessive roof fall in the Alcove must be considered.
Rodent activity certainly played a role in moving bones within the area, although there
is little evidence for rodent gnawing or other events that might have fractured dry
bone. Probably most pertinent is the continued reuse of this very small crawl space
for human burials over a long period of time (Solveig Turpin, personal communica­
tion).

Skyline Shelter / 159

DEMOGRAPHY

Based on the most conservative MNI estimates, a minimum of ten individuals
are represented in the Skyline Shelter skeletal remains. Two are neonates, one a
young child, and the rest adults. The mean age at death for the sample, using the
midpoint of each individual age range, is 26.86± 13 years. The mean age for sub adults
is 1.58 years; for adults it is 46.2 years (based on estimates of age from Table 6.6).
The subadult/adult ratio at Skyline is typical of a small skeletal series with minor
sampling bias, but is also similar to other hunter-gatherer groups (Table 6.7).
Hartnady (1988) found a 40% subadult ratio in a sample of 82 Late Archaic individuals
from the Lower Pecos. Examination of Table 6.7 shows that the proportion of
subadults at Skyline shelter differs from most Lower Pecos samples in that a wider
age range is represented. Based on these meager demographic data, there appears to
be no bias in the recovery of individuals nor in the mortuary practices of the groups
burying their dead at Skyline Shelter.

PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS

Human paleopathology has great utility in providing first-hand data on the health
status and lifeway of extinct populations. However, determination of the exact cause
of lesions is quite difficult (Steinbock 1976; Goodman et ai. 1988). This being the
case, all pathological conditions are reported in broad etiological categories:
degenerative disease, infection, hemopoietic disease, and neoplasm. Although most
bioarcheological reports present data as the percentage of affected
individuals/individuals in the sample, this was not done for Skyline Shelter remains.
The large number of fragments and low number of individuals make comparison
across populations difficult. In fact, the small sample size inhibits statistical power
(Hodges and Schell 1988), making it nearly impossible to discern differences in
proportions between this and other skeletal samples. Comparative data are

160 \ Powell

presented (Table 6.8), but no statistical consideration is given to apparent differences
between populations.

Degenerative J oint Disease

Degenerative changes to joints are a natural part of the aging process. Degenera­
tion Joint Disease (DJD) can also be caused by trauma, infection, or autoimmune
response (Ortner and Puts char 1981; Steinbock 1976), although the etiology can
sometimes be sorted out through careful differential diagnosis (see Rothschild,
Woods, and Ortel 1990 for a review of the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis).
Degenerative changes in the Skyline Shelter materials took the form of periarticular
lipping of diarthrodial joints, pitting of joint surfaces, and eburnation (polishing) of
joint surfaces. Vertebral DJD was present as osteophytes along the margins of the
vertebral centra, and less frequently, as spicules of bone on the transverse and spinous
processes.
DJD was by far the most common disorder seen in the Skyline Alcove materials.
Fifty-one elements in the assemblage (2.2%) were affected by DJD (Table 6.9). This
disorder was most frequently seen in the vertebral column, with 37.3% of vertebral
elements affected. Most severely affected was the sacrum, followed in frequency by
the cervical, lumbar, and thoracic vertebrae (Table 6.9). The most common nonver­
tebral sites were the phalanges ofthe foot (27.2%) and os coxae (18.2%). Additional
sites with DJD are the phalanges of the hand, radii, carpals, and tarsals. Just two
individuals could account for the entire series of affected bones, thus producing a rate
of 20% per individual which compares favorably to the Seminole Sink and Trans-Pecos
populations.

1 Only affected elements are presented; all skeletal elements, including the hyoid, were present in
the 2341 NISP.

En thesophytes
Enthesopathies are spicules of bone at the location of muscle or tendon attach­
ments that result from extensive mechanical stress to the site (Kennedy 1989). They
generally are more severe forms of normal roughening of muscle sites on bone
associated with repeated use of a muscle. One case of enthesopathy was noted in the
calvarium of Skeleton 4. Large, 3-4 mm bony outgrowths all along the superior nuchal
line, external occipital protuberance indicate repeated use of the muscles of the
nuchal region by this individual.
Infection
Infections are apparent on bone only when the infection is chronic and the
pathogen is not virulent enough to kill the host. Osseous inflammations represent
chronic responses many days or weeks (or even years) in duration. Infection of the
periosteum (periostitis) results in the deposition of reactive bone over existing lamel­
lar cortex, while osteomyelitis produces gross alteration of bone as the pathogen

invades the Haversian system and medullary space (Ortner and Putschar 1981; Stein­
bock 1976).
Only three elements displayed inflammation in the form of periostitis: a left
ilium, a left distal tibia, and a left distal fibula. The latter two elements are probably
from the same individual. A single individual could account for all affected bones if
infection was systemic, creating an infection rate for Skyline Shelter of 10 percent;
this is similar to other West Texas groups but lower than that for eastern hunter­
gatherers (Table 6.8).
Trauma
Trauma results from some outside force creating damage to bone, either through
fracturing or puncturing (Ortner and Putschar 1981). There were 13 bones with
trauma in the form of fractures, for a total of 0.55% per bone in the total Skyline
assemblage. Most frequently affected bones include the sacrum (16.7%), the lumbar
vertebrae (15.8%). and the cervical vertebrae (13.3%). Additional trauma sites are
the phalanges of the hands and feet, suggesting activity-related damage to the fingers
and toes. Trauma rates per individual (Table 6.8) are just slightly higher than other
Lower Pecos samples.
Two outstanding cases of vertebral trauma are present in the skeletal remains
from Skyline Shelter. There is an extreme case of compression fracture to a sacrum,
resulting in misalignment of the first sacral element and subsequent scoliosis (to the
right) of the upper spinal column. A lower thoracic vertebra (TI2), exhibits an
irregular shape, with the right side being enlarged and the articular facets realigned
on the neural arch. These elements probably are from a single individual who
experienced severe trauma to the lower back, perhaps from a fall. The resulting
compression fracture led to curvature of the spinal column, and a bony response of
centrum enlargement and dislocation as the body attempted to stabilize the vertebral
column. This condition would have been at least partially debilitating.
A second case of vertebral trauma is present in the lumbar spine of an individual
recovered from Unit 2A. 1\vo lumbar vertebrae are fused by gross, flowing os­
teophytes on their anterior lateral margins. There were no osteophytes in the central
anterior region. The osteophytes appear to be an ossification of the anterior common
ligament, and ossification is more severe on the right side. The superior vertebra has
undergone extreme compression fracturing on the left side, creating a 30 degree
angulation of the spine. On the dorsal aspect, the transverse process of the superior
vertebra has been fractured and has healed with misalignment to the left. The inferior
vertebra also has a transverse process fracture with misalignment to the right.
There was apparently a massive trauma to the lower spine resulting from a
caudocranially directed force. most likely a fall. The individuals suffering from these
vertebral traumas would have had impaired mobility and extreme kyphosis or scoliosis
of the upper vertebral column. However, such trauma was not fatal, as supported by
fracture healing and osteophyte formation.

Skyline Shelter / 163

Porotic Hyperostosis
Porotic hyperostosis is a disorder affecting the hemopoietic areas of the skull,
primarily the cranial vault and orbital roof. Although the etiology has been debated
in the literature, the condition appears to be associated with some type of stress that
produces an anemic response (Goodman et al. 1988). Porotic lesions appear as micro­
and macro-porosity of the parietal and frontal bones, thickening of the cranial diploe,
and porosity of the orbital roof (cribra orbitalia).
Porotic changes were noted in six parietal fragments and one frontal fragment
from two separate individuals, (22.2% of all parietal fragments and 9.1 % of frontal
fragments). These specimens exhibit active macro porosity which indicates that both
individuals were undergoing bony remodeling from anemia at the time of death.
Rates for this disorder are similar to Seminole Sink, and higher than all other
comparative samples other than Indian Knoll (Table 6.8). The high level of anemia
at Indian Knoll is due to inclusion of sub adults. Marks, Rose, and Buie (1988)
obtained a 4% adult rate of anemia for Indian Knoll using Cassidy's dissertation data
(Cassidy 1972).
Marks, Rose, and Buie (1985:128) suggested that dietary iron in dessert suc­
culent plants was bound and available only seasonally when Vitamin C levels (in
flowering plants) rose. This explanation seems plausible, although Sobolik (1990:32)
has suggested that Vitamin C intake was adequate based on coprolite evidence.
Perhaps a better explanation for anemia would be intestinal bleeding from parasites,
chronic diarrhea, or even bleeding due to bowel perforation during digestion of bone.
Evidence for the latter is supported by large numbers of bone fragments in Lower
Pecos coprolites (Williams-Dean 1978).
Neoplasm
Only one neoplasm was present in the sample (10% of all individuals). An adult
left femur has a small walled cyst, approximately 3.2 cm by 2.1 cm in size, in the
cancellous portion of the metaphysis. The size, location, and pattern of change is
similar to a benign fibrous or chondral tumor.
DENTAL ANALYSIS

Like bone. dental remains provide life-long histories of the oral health of
populations. Interruption of enamel growth can indicate physiological stress during
the time of tooth formation (Goodman and Armelagos 1988). Patterns of dental
attrition can indicate the quality of diet, types of foods processed, and use of the teeth
for special functions (Schmucker 1985). In addition, oral infections and caries can
provide information on the quality of the diet and on factors that may have altered an
individual's eating patterns during life (Powell 1985). Although the dental remains
from Skyline Shelter are limited. they do provide good data for comparison with other
Lower Pecos populations.

..........-~-.-- ........~------------~----------------_..............

Four types of dental disorder are present in the sample: caries, hypercementosis,
alveolar resorption, and abscessing. No hypoplastic defects were noted in the dental
remains. Data on the rate of disorder by tooth type are presented in Table 6.10.
Upper and lower teeth were combined to provide adequate descriptive samples.
Attrition

Dental wear for each tooth was scored modifying the method of Scott (1979).
Scores range from 0 for no wear to 40 for complete loss of all occlusal enamel. The
anterior teeth of the Skyline sample show moderate attrition, leaving some occlusal
enamel intact. Angled wear was present on some of the upper incisors, but these data
were not quantified for this study. Molar attrition scores are summarized in Table
6.11. The data show that there is the typical graded wear following the order of
eruption, with the first molar having the most severe attrition. There is only a
moderate difference in attrition between the Skyline and Seminole Sink samples. A
Student's t-test of differences within the Skyline materials shows that there is a
significant difference in attrition between upper and lower teeth (Table 6.12; t =

sides.
Caries

The consumption of dietary sugar or sticky carbohydrate foods, combined with
complex enamel and susceptibility to infection, all contribute to the level of dental
caries in a population. Caries were present in 9.7% of all permanent teeth, and were
most frequent in premolars and molars (Table 6.10). The premolar lesions occupied
the entire crown or the occlusal surface of the root, depending on the level of attrition
in each tooth. All carious lesions in molars were on the occlusal surface. Comparison
of caries rates in several populations (Table 6.13) shows that the per tooth rate in the
Skyline population is within the range for other hunter-gatherers and is slightly lower
than either Seminole Sink or a general Lower Pecos Archaic sample. The rate of

caries per person (1.00) is lower than either West Texas sample but is higher than that

extremely small sample is the most probable cause of this pattern. However, it may
be that age bias between samples or, more remotely, slight differences in sugar and
carbohydrate intake could explain these differences.

Premortem Tooth Loss
Hartnady (1988) has already investigated patterns of premature tooth loss among
the Late Archaic population in the Lower Pecos region. This pattern of loss, at­
tributed to a combination of cariogenic activity and oral processing of desert succulent
plants, is unique to Lower Pecos groups and is not present in samples drawn from far
West Texas (Powell n.d.). The typical pattern ofloss begins early in life with evulsion
of the lower molars due to caries. The cessation of occlusion, with its cleansing action,
then makes upper molars susceptible to loss via caries. Use of the anterior teeth leads
to loss of incisors and premolars, especially the maxillary teeth. The dentition in the
typical Lower Pecos adult was one where only the upper molars and lower incisors
were present. This condition must have made food consumption difficult in later life,
with little effective chewing possible. The presence of whole food items, such as
rodents and insects (Williams-Dean 1978; Sobolik 1990) in human feces may be
evidence of such an age-related change in diet.

Only five mandibular fragments and two maxillary dental arcades were available
for the generation of antemortem tooth loss patterns (Table 6.14). Like Seminole
Sink, there is a significant loss of mandibular molars, maxillary incisors, and man­
dibular incisors in the Skyline Shelter sample. The percentage of tooth is remarkably
close for such small samples, attesting to the strong pattern of premortem tooth loss
in Lower Pecos adults.
Inflammations, in the form of gingivitis, occur when tartar buildup and plaque
affect the supporting alveolar bone, or when trauma or soft tissue infections alter the
alveolus. Resorption and hypercementosis are evident in the sample (Table 6.10).
Resorption is most severe in the incisors, the last teeth to remain in the mouth during
the process of tooth loss. Over 41% of all implanted teeth have some degree of
resorption of the alveolus. As teeth weaken in the socket, hypercementosis occurs.
This condition was most evident in the premolars and canines (Table 6.10), and
affected 19.4% of all teeth in the sample. Abscesses were present, but only in one
tooth for a 3.1 % rate of abscess per implanted teeth.
Conclusions

A minimum of ten individuals, three sub adults and seven adults, are represented
in the 2341 human bone fragments from Skyline Shelter, Val Verde County, Texas.
Three individuals were distinct, articulated burials. The remaining persons were

represented by badly fragmented and comingled bone forcing a reliance on MNI
analysis. Little demographic data could be generated from the Skyline Shelter
remains, but a majority of adults were in the 30 to 40 year age range.
Individuals at Skyline were in good health, given the harsh environment in which
they lived. A wide range of medical disorders was present in the sample, but the
severity of disease was low compared to populations experiencing the shift to agricul­
ture. Present in the series of conditions were osseous infections, hemopoietic disease
moderate to severe degenerative disease, benign neoplasm, and enthesopathies.
Trauma was present and quite severe for at least one and possibly two individuals.
Severe vertebral fracture, with misalignment, compression, and scoliosis of the ver­
tebral bodies was present in this skeletal series. Such a condition probably resulted
from a fall. Degenerative disease of the vertebral column was extensive in the
sampled elements. While this can be partially attributed to the age bias toward older
adults, the degree and location of joint changes suggests an active lifestyle in a rugged
terrain. Movement from the rockshelters to the river valleys, or from the uplands
down to the shelters, traversed rocky, nearly vertical terrain. The constant risk of
falling and excessive mechanical loading in joints due to activity seem to explain the
patterns of trauma and degenerative change in the sample.
While the osseous health of Skyline Shelter individuals was good, their dental
health was not. Individuals were strongly affected by dental caries, perhaps from a
high carbohydrate diet. Dental attrition was extreme in the sample, and indicated
that some activity was contributing to excessive wear and damage to the teeth.
Alveolar inflammations were common in both upper and lower teeth, and patterns of
premortem tooth loss demonstrate that the cariogenic environment of the mouth, loss
of attritional cleansing during occlusion, and exposure of tooth pulp to bacteria led
to the patterns seen here. Such changes must have had a profound affect both on the
types of activities performed with the teeth, the content of the diet, and the overall
quality of life for aged persons in the Lower Pecos.
Even though the human skeletal remains from Skyline Shelter are not extensive,

CACTUS FOR DINNER, AGAIN!
AN ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF LATE ARCHAIC DIET
IN THE LOWER PECOS REGION OF TEXAS.
Jeffery A. Huebner

Abstract
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on the remains of
five prehistoric humans from the Lower Pecos region of Texas. The 0 13 C results of
this study indicate that these people relied on CAM plants for a large portion of their
diet. This finding is in agreement with previous coprolite studies, and further shows
that year round diet would not have been significantly different from the spring/sum­
mer pattern identified from coprolites. Based on the dietary pattern model for carbon
isotopes designed by Krueger (1985), a ninth dietary pattern is represented by the
Lower Pecos pattern. Nitrogen isotopes are more variable (5.3%0-16.6%0) and while
the sample is small, these results suggest that olsN ratios may be useful in paleoen­
vironmental reconstruction in the arid Lower Pecos region.
Introduction
The dietary patterns of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Lower Pecos region are
undoubtedly the most extensively studied of any archeological population in Texas.
These studies have taken advantage of the remarkable preservation of macrobotanical
parts (Dering and Shafer 1976; Dering 1979), fauna (Word and Douglas 1970; Hester
1983; Lord 1984), pollen (Bryant 1974), and coprolites (Riskind 1970; Bryant 1974;
Williams-Dean 1978; Stock 1983; Sobolik 1988; Reinhard, Jones, and Barros in press)
found within dry rockshelter deposits to chronicle a very conservative adaptation to
a difficult xeric environment. In sum, these indicate a hunter-gatherer subsistence
regime centered around several desert succulents and a number of animal species.
While the identification of floral and faunal remains have indicated the parameters
of diet, and the analysis of coprolites have shown specific seasonal intake, a direct
analysis of total diet via stable isotopes has only been touched upon (Turpin 1988).
In this paper, the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human
remains from two Late Archaic sites in the Lower Pecos are presented. The results
are discussed in reference to the findings of coprolite and other isotope studies in the
region.
Over the past decade, archeologists have increasingly applied chemical methods
of isotopic analysis to the study of prehistoric human diets. The measurement of
stable carbon (o13C) and nitrogen (0 15N) isotope ratios in human bone collagen have
proven to be a highly useful adjunct to the more traditional methods cited above. The

ratio of stable carbon isotopes (12C/13C) in human bone and other tissues reflects the
isotope ratios of the plants at the bottom of the food chain. Terrestrial plants use one
of three photosynthetic pathways C3, C4, and CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism).
These are identified by how they fractionate carbon during the first step of photosyn­
thesis. The average d13Cvalue ofC3and C4 plants is -26.5%0 and -12.5%0 respectively
(Smith and Epstein 1971). CAM plants which are primarily desert succulents and
cacti have the ability to use either pathway to adapt to changing environmental
conditions (Lerman and Queiroz 1974), thus their d13C ratios will fall somewhere
between those of C3 and C4 plants. Research on CAM plants from the American
Southwest indicates that these species resemble C4 plants in carbon isotope values.
A d13C ratio of -13.9%0 was obtained on Opuntia polyacantha recovered from within
a 10,000 year old Neotoma midden located in a dry cave near Frenchman Flat, Nevada
(Troughton, Wells, and Mooney 1974). Modern examples of Opuntia engelmannii and
Agave lechuguilIa harvested in Big Bend National Park, Texas averaged d13C values of
-12.7%0 and -14.2%0 respectively (Eickmeier and Bender 1976). Using these data,
the average d13C values for CAM plants from the Lower Pecos should average around
-13.5%0, which is very near those of C4 plants.
Background to Isotopic Analysis

When plants and animals are consumed by humans their carbon is broken down
during metabolic assimilation. This process, known as fractionation, deposits differ­
ing amounts of 13C in each body tissue. Bone, which is most commonly used in
archeological studies, is enriched in 13C relative to diet. The two fractions of bone
take up 13C in unequal amounts. The organic or collagen fraction of bone has a d13C
of + 5%0 and the inorganic or apatite fraction has a d13C of + 8%0 to + 12%0 to the
average of dietary intake dependent on the ratio of plant to animal food (Krueger and
Sullivan 1984).
Other body tissues can either be enriched or depleted from the d13C value of the
diet. Vogel (1978) demonstrated that hide, flesh, and fat from eight extant ungulates
in South Africa were depleted by -0.6%0,-2.3%0, and -7.9%0 on average, relative to
the d13C value of their bone collagen. Referenced to their diets, hide and flesh are
enriched and fat is depleted in these animals. Information on stable carbon fractiona­
tion in human tissues is limited to a single small study by Lyon and Baxter (1978).
Their results indicate that internal organ tissues from a single individual cover a
spread of approximately 5%0; unfortunately this sample did not include bone and is
not referenced to diet.
The mean residence time (MRT) of the diet signal preserved in animal tissues is
a point of controversy at this time. This does not present much of a problem in
herbivores that subsist on a stable regime of browse or grass, but it is problematic in
the case of omnivores such as humans. The principal argument centers around bone
tissue. One school holds that bone turns over very slowly with an MRT of 30 + years
(Stenhouse and Baxter 1979; H.W. Krueger, personal communication 1990). Others,
primarily physiologists, argue that bone is constantly being remodeled through the

Isotopic Analysis I 177

actions of osteocyctes and other biochemical constituents of the body, leaving an MRT
of 2 to 3 years at most. A third group suggests that a 10-year MRT is indicated
(Bumsted 1984).
Other tissues tend to turn over at a faster rate. Jones et al. (1981) demonstrated
that the diet signature in cattle hair turned over completely in 180 days when the
animals were moved from a pure C4 pasture to one with only C3 grass. Soft tissues in
humans have a MRT of 6±4 years with no differences noted for the age or health of
the donor (Stenhouse and Baxter 1979).
The ratio of 15N/14N in terrestrial systems is also a function of the plant kingdom.
In this instance, the difference is not the photosynthetic pathway as in carbon isotopes,
but rather if the plant is or is not a legume. Legumes, such as acacias, beans, and
mesquite, have the ability to obtain nitrogen from the air. . due to a symbiotic relation­
ship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, where other plants get nitrogen from the soil. 15N
is more concentrated in soil nitrates and ammonium than it is in air thus nonlegumes
have higher o15N ratios. Legumes have an average o15N of ±O%o, while other plants
average between 2%0-5%0 (Harold W. Krueger, personal communication, 1990). In
nonlegumes, o15N ratios are affected by the surrounding environment. Plants as­
sociated with saline or arid environments have the highest o15N values, whereas
nonleguminous plants in moist forest and mountain areas have the lowest values
(Heaton 1987). Some of this variation may be caused by the enrichment or depletion
of 15N in soils. Hot arid conditions inhibit the fixation of nitrogen in soil and
accelerate the volatilization of ammonia which results in heavier o15N values (Stewart
1970; Letolle 1980). Thus moister soils have greater nitrogen fixation which results
in the dilution of 15N, and lighter overall o15N ratios in these areas (Mariotti et al.
1980).
Initial1y, it was thought that o15N ratios could be used to distinguish marine from
terrestrial inputs into prehistoric human diets (Chisholm, Nelson, and Schwarcz 1982;
Schoeninger, DeNiro, and Tauber 1983; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). In arid
environments, however, it was found that o15N values from marine and terrestrial
organisms showed a great deal of overlap (Sealy et al. 1987). While o15N ratios may
be useful for the analysis of diets in mesic environments, their elevated values in arid
terrestrial settings indicated the technique as a potential source of paleoenvironmen­
tal information.
olsN ratios in animal tissues are enriched by 3%0 relative to their diet (DeNiro
and Epstein 1981). This fractionation is cumulative by trophic level with herbivores
being enriched by 3%0 and carnivores by 6%0 relative to the plants at the bottom of
the food chain (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984; Sealy et al. 1987).
Materials and Methods

The sample selected for isotopic study comes from two rockshelter sites in Val
Verde County, Texas, within the Lower Pecos archeological region (Frontispiece).
Cortical bone from each of four stratigraphically discrete burials excavated at Conejo

178 / Huebner

Shelter (41VV162) and muscle tissue from the well-preserved arm of Burial 1 were
analyzed. In addition, a specimen ofAgave lechuguilla from Lens 17 was radiocarbon­
dated to provide an age determination for Burial 1. A fifth bone sample was secured
from Burial 1 at Skyline Shelter (41VV930) (Solveig Turpin, personal communication,
1990).
All of these samples date to the Late Archaic Period (Hester 1988; see Turpin,
this volume). The four burials from 41VV162 are bracketed between radiocarbon
assays of 1810:t70 B.P. (TX17S7) and 2690:t80 B.p. (TX1759) with Burial 1 being the
highest in the stratigraphic sequence and Burial 4 being the lowest (Alexander 1974).
Burial 2 is female, the other three are male; all were adults at the time of death. Burial
1 from 41VV930 is an old adult female (see Powell, this volume). She is suspected to
date to the early Late Archaic; however, her grave pit extends into the Middle
Archaic deposits at the site (Solveig Turpin, personal communication 1990).
The physiography of the region is characterized by rolling uplands which are
dissected by the narrow steep walled canyons of the Devils, Pecos, and Rio Grande.
The relief of the canyons creates a variety of habitats based largely on the availability
of water (Flyr 1966). Upland plant communities are typical of a semi-arid desert.
Within the canyons, on alluvial terraces and talus cones, more mesophytic com­
munities exist. Principal economic taxa in the uplands include: Agave lechuguilla,
Dasylirion texanum (sotol), Yucca torrey;, several species of Opuntia (prickly pear),
and Gramineae (grasses). Various nut-bearing trees such as Juglans microcarpa
(walnut), Carya illinoensis (pecan), and Quercus sp. (oak) along with Celtis reticulata
(hackberry), Diospyros texan a (persimmon), and Prosopis glandulosa (mesquite) are
found within the deeper soils of the canyons, and along rivers.
The fauna of the area is diverse and includes numerous species of mammals,
birds, reptiles, amphibians, reptiles, and fish all of which were exploited by the
aboriginal inhabitants. Major species represented in archeological faunas are
Odocoileus virginian us (white-tail deer), Sylvilagus sp. (cottontail), Lepus cali/omicus
(j ackrabbi t), members of Testudinata (turtle) and Pisces (fish) (Lord 1984).
The preparation and analysis of the samples was performed at Geochron
Laboratories, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The following is a summary of their proce­
dures abstracted from Krueger and Sullivan (1984). Bone samples are manually, then
chemically cleaned in A1conox followed by an overnight bath in 1N acetic acid until
all reaction with any remaining carbonates ceases. The samples are neutralized, then
crushed to a 1 mm powder and again reacted with IN acetic acid until all reaction
stops.
One gram of bone powder is demineralized under vacuum with IN HCI which
releases C02 which is cryogenically purified and then analyzed as the apatite fraction.
The collagen fraction is separated by decantation and filtration on fiberglass. It is
kept acidic by the addition of a small amount of HCI, then dissolved by boiling. The
hot broth is then filtered and the filtrate is evaporated and transferred to teflon
crucibles and dried to crystalline gelatin in an oven at 70 degrees C.

Results
RADIOCARBON ASSAY

Agave lechuguilla from Lens 17 at 41 VV162 was submitted to provide an age
determination for Burial 1. Based on floorplans drawn during the 1967-1968 excava­
tion, it was determined that Lens 17 was the origin of the grave pit for Burial 1.
Juvenile leaves from the interior of an apparently roasted plant were selected for
dating for two reasons. First, juvenile portions of the plant would provide the most
representative age for the lens, thus avoiding "post-growth sample error" (Ralph
1971:4), that could occur if the outer, older leaves of an A. lechuguilla were dated.
Secondly, recent isotopic analysis of plant remains by DeNiro and Hastdorf (1985)
indicates that roasted and anaerobically carbonized examples maintain nearly all of
their carbon and nitrogen, yielding 613C and 615N ratios very similar to those of
modern examples. Pit ovens, such as those common to most Lower Pecos rockshel­
ters, would have supplied the proper environment to leave plant remains in this
condition. The age of the sample as determined by its radiocarbon content, corrected
for o13C is 1980±80 B.P. (GX16198), o13C = -11.0%0. This new date fits well in the
radiocarbon chronology established at the site by Alexander's (1974) previous re­
search. The addition of this assay to the chronological sequence at 41 VV162 reduces
the maximum time span between Burial 1 and Burial 4 from 880±150 to 710±160
radiocarbon years.
STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES

The results of the stable carbon isotope analyses are presented in Table 7.1. The
variation in o13e ratios on collagen in this sample (-12.6%0 to -15.7%0) is within the
limits reported by Bumsted (1984) for an isochronous population, and indicate a

stable diet rich in CA/CAM plants. Of these two groups, CAM plants made a much
greater contribution to the prehistoric diet. From the analysis of coprolites in the
Lower Pecos region, the only CA plants consistently identified are Chenopodium and
members of the Gramineae, and then only in small amounts. In his analysis of 43
coprolites from spring and summer occupations at 41VV162, Bryant (1974) found
Opuntia sp. to be the major dietary constituent. Other taxa represented in smaller
amounts from this coprolite sample were Allium and Dasylirion, which are C3 plants,
along with the CAM species of Yucca and Agave. Small amounts of mammal, reptile,
and fish bones were present as well. The human o13C ratios compare favorably with
the macro botanical data from a roughly contemporaneous set of spring/summer
coprolites. Since the o13C ratios of bone indicate long term dietary patterns, it would
appear that fall/winter diets were not a great deal different from those evidenced in
the 41VV162 coprolites. At this point in time, it would be difficult to accurately
estimate the percentage of C4ICAM plants in the diet because of our incomplete
knowledge of their prehistoric o13C ratios in this region. However, if the average o13C
value of -13.5%0 is used, roughly 45 to 68% of Late Archaic diets were derived from
CAM plants. The remaining portion of the diet would have been made up of C3 plants
and C3 plant consumers. Again, we have excellent data as to the species consumed,
but we are largely ignorant of their isotopic values. A greater understanding of the
isotopic ecology of the Lower Pecos is an important concern for future research.
Through isotopic research it may be possible to get past one of the inherent problems
with coproli te analysis - the inability to identify the meat component in the aboriginal
diet.
From the analysis of several prehistoric human populations that utilized diver­
gent subsistence strategies, Krueger (1985; also see Krueger and Sullivan 1984) has
developed a predictive model to identify dietary regime based on the cross plot of
o13C ratios from collagen and apatite. Eight dietary patterns were established, each
comprised of either C3, CA, or marine foods, or a combination of two groups (Fig. 7.1).
When the results of the Lower Pecos isotopic study are plotted, they fall partially
within Diet Group 6 (Mixed, mainly maize), and partially to the left, or lighter side

of the plot for ,,13C collagen. The o13C apatite fall within the lighter half of Diet
Group 6. This outcome is not unexpected since the postulated average o13C value for
CAM plants in the Southwest United States is lighter than the overall average for C4
plants, which was used by Krueger to construct the model. From the five data points
in this study and two additional points from the Eleor Burial Cave (Skinner, Haas,
and Wilson 1980) in Culberson County, Texas, a ninth Diet Group is suggested. The
parameters of Diet Group 9 (CAM plants and C3 meat) are: o13C apatite -6.0%0 to
-9.0%0 and o13C collagen -11.0%0 to -16.0%0.
The 41 VV162, Burial 1 muscle tissue sample is depleted by 1.6 relative to the
associated bone sample (Table 7.1). Given the dearth of information dealing with the
isotopic fractionation of human tissues it is difficult to assign meaning to this o13C
ratio. However, based on the more rapid turnover of soft tissue carbon in comparison
to that of bone (Stenhouse and Baxter 1979), samples of this type may be useful in
gauging the last several years of a prehistoric human's life.
STABLE NITROGEN ISOTOPES

The results of the stable nitrogen isotope analysis exhibit more variability than
the stable carbon isotopes (Table 7.1). The olsN ratios of Burials 1 and 3 from
41 VV162 are consistent with those found in other prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups
with a terrestrial diet base (Krueger 1985; Heaton et a/. 1986), and historic West Texas
mission horticulturists near El Paso (Evans 1989). The other three samples are
problematic given the ecology and location of the study area, and o13C results. Burial
1 from 41VV930 has a o15N ratio that would normally be associated with a terrestrial
herbivore (Ambrose and DeNiro 1986). For humans to have a o15N of 5.3%0, their
diet would have to consist solely of legumes and animals that ate legumes, or a strict
vegetarian regime. Of these two options, the latter is considered the most viable
alternative. While a diet of Acacia sp. seeds and Prosopis glandulosa pods and beans
(the two most common legumes) and the rodents that consumed them might possibly
supply proper nutrition, it does not match the o13C ratio (-15.7%0) for this old female.
The remaining samples from 41VV162, Burials 2 and 4 show olsN values nor­
mally associated with a marine dietary component. The o15N ratio of Burial 2 is just
slightly beyond the normal range of terrestrial diets. Prehistoric and historic groups
from Ontario, Canada that exploited large amounts of fish from the Great Lakes show
a similar increase in o15N (Schwarcz et al. 1985; Katzenberg 1989). Thus the slightly
enriched olsN value seen in Burial 2 may be a product of increased fish intake. The
o15N ratio from Burial 4 falls fully within the range of marine diets. Several isotope
studies from Mrica have seen marine-like nitrogen patterns in interior areas (Heaton
et al. 1986; Sealy et al. 1987; Sealy 1989). These studies link enriched o15N ratios with
xeric climatic conditions. olSN ratios in both humans and animals become increas­
ingly enriched as the annual precipitation drops below 400 mm (16 inches), thus there
is a negative correlation between precipitation and o15N ratios in terrestrial mammals.
Modern rainfall data places the Lower Pecos region between the 15 and 20 inch
(375-500 mm) isohyets (Haragan 1983). Paleoclimatic data based largely on fossil

Isotopic Analysis I 183

pollen indicates that this region has experienced xeric conditions, similar to the
modern situation, over much of the Holocene, except for a brief mesic interval
between ca. 3000-2400 RP. (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Based on these data, it is
surprising that all of these Late Archaic samples do not show enriched olsN ratios.
But it is even more suprising that Burial 4, which may date to this mesic interval, has
such an enriched o15N ratio.
The muscle tissue sample from Burial 1, 41VV162 is enriched 0.4%0 relative to
the bone sample (Table 7.1). Unfortunately there are no other comparative data for
human samples; however, Sealy et al. (1987) demonstrated that the olsN ratio of
muscle tissue in herbivores is very similar to that of their bone collagen. Given the
range of difference between these two tissues, + 3.6%0 to -2.3%0 in the data
presented by Sealy et al. (1987), further research in this area of isotopic studies is
indicated.
Discussion
Figure 7.2 presents the results of carbon isotope analysis of humans from this
study and two other sites, Seminole Sink [(41VV620) Turpin 1988], and Elcor Burial
Cave (Skinner, Haas, and Wilson 1980) in western Texas. Both of these sinkhole sites
functioned as mortuary localities in the past, Seminole during the Early Archaic
Period and Eleor during the later stages of the Late Archaic. One very negative o13C
ratio from Seminole (-22.1%0) has been deleted from the histogram because it is an
obvious error. The two lightest o13C values shown may also be erroneous, but are
included because the overall sample is small, and o13C values this light cannot be ruled
out statistically at this time. Error in these three samples is considered likely for the
following reasons. First, the age of the samples (ca. 6700-5300 B.P.) and the effects
of the sinkhole depositional environment on bone preservation may have led to
increased contamination and collagen loss in these samples. This conclusion is
supported by the erroneous radiocarbon assay (AA1316) also run on human bone (cf.,
Turpin 1988: 33), the fact that not all bones found in association with each other will
exhibit the same amount of diagenesis (cf., Ambrose and DeNiro 1989), and that one
of the submitted samples (848), contained no collagen. Secondly, in his study of
postmortem preservation and alteration of in vivo bone collagen, DeNiro (1985)
found that badly altered samples were isotopically light in comparison to unaltered
or slightly altered samples. While the definitive test for alteration, the determination
of atomic C/N weight ratios, was not performed on any of the Texas samples. the light
o13C ratios of these three samples suggest that they are in error. Finally, the large
body of data from the analysis of coprolites in this region indicate that CAM plants
have been the primary dietary staple at times during the Holocene (cf., Kenneth M.
Brown, this volume). The light o13C ratios of these three samples are incongruous
with the copralite data. o13C ratios in the -18%0 to -20%0 range are more consistent
with human diets in the Central Coastal Plain of Texas (Huebner, unpublished data).
Within these potential problems, the dietary pattern of prehistoric peoples in the
Lower Pecos, as evidenced by stable carbon isotope analysis, appears to be very

similar for those portions of the Holocene for which we have data. Aside from the
-18.1 %0 and -18.4%0 values obtained from Seminole Sink, the diets from all temporal
periods overlap. The range of diet in this group (3.4%0) is only slightly larger than
that of the 41 VV162 group (3.1 %0), which not only indicates a stable diet, but that
the photosynthetic pathway of CAM plants have also remained C4-like through time.
Summary
Stable carbon isotope analysis of both the collagen and apatite fractions of Late
Archaic skeletal material has identified a new dietary group that expands Krueger's
(1985) predictive model. This ninth pattern is indicative of a diet based on CAM
plants and C3 animals. Although the o13C values are similar to those associated with
horticulturalist societies, the people of the Lower Pecos always practiced a hunting
and gathering economy. This combination of dietary resources is for the most part
available only in xeric environments. In addition, the analysis of nitrogen isotopes
may be relevant to the reconstruction of paleoclimate. The nitrogen isotope results
show a great deal of variation when compared to other hunter-gatherer populations.
The aridity of the Lower Pecos may be more responsible for the elevated o15N values
than is the dietary intake. Building on this small sample, further research with
nitrogen isotopes using other species, such as deer, in good stratigraphic context may
yield paleoclimatic information.

Isotopic Analysis I 185

The muscle tissue sample from Buriall, 41VV162, shows only a small difference
from the bone sample. The Jl. of -1.6%0 <5 13C, and 0.4%0 <5 15N may be solely a product
of differential fractionation in the two tissues; or represent a shorter record of diet.
Currently, there is not enough background research to determine which factor is
responsible for the difference. This aspect of prehistoric isotopic research is espe­
cially suited to the Lower Pecos due to the number of conserved human remains that
have preserved skin, muscle, nails, and hair, as well as bone tissues. Before studies
of this kind can be fully useful in diet reconstruction, controlled baseline studies with
modern large mammals or human cadavers must be done to supply greater resolution
from those presently in the literature.
Future isotopic research in this region should endeavor to broaden the sample
base. Locating human populations dated to the Middle Archaic and to the mesic
interval during the early centuries of the Late Archaic are a high priority. Further,
preserved plant and animal remains from all temporal periods need to be analyzed to
supply an accurate context for the human diets. Given the uncommonly good preser­
vation of archeological materials from the rock shelters along the Devils, Pecos, and
Rio Grande, and the extensive collections available for study, the potential of isotopic
analysis to supply answers to questions of paleodiet, paleoenvironment, and
paleoclimate looms great indeed.

TRACE ELEMENT ANALYSES AND
GEOLOGIC SOURCE STUDIES OF
OBSIDIAN ARTIFACTS FROM ARENOSA
SHELTER, VAL VERDE COUNTY, TEXAS
Thomas R. Hester, Frank Asaro, Fred Stross,
Anne C. Kerr, and Robert D. Giauque

Trace element analysis of an obsidian artifact enables archeologists to determine
its geologic origin. Since each obsidian source has its own specific chemical charac­
terization (cf. Cann and Renfrew 1964; Weaver and Stross 1965), geochemical studies
of an artifact of volcanic glass (obsidian) can ascertain its particular trace element
"fingerprint" and determine its geologic origin. Since artifact-quality obsidian does
not occur in Texas, each obsidian flake or projectile point fragment found at a
prehistoric site is ultimately derived from distant geologic outcrops in western North
America or Mexico (cf. Hester et al. 1985). The use of trace element analysis is thus
very important in making inferences about ancient trade or exchange. The present
paper reports trace element analytical results for two obsidian flakes excavated at
Arenosa Shelter in the Lower Pecos region of Texas. These have been traced to their
geologic source and the implications of this linkage are explored here.
Arenosa Shelter (41VV99) is located on the west side of the Pecos River just
above its confluence with the Rio Grande (Frontispiece). Excavated by David S.
Dibble (Dibble 1967; Patton and Dibble 1982), the site yielded well-stratified cultural
deposits extending as far back as 9500 B.P. Forty-two strata were identified by Dibble,
many yielding distinctive time-diagnostic projectile points. Radiocarbon dates were
obtained from a number of these contexts (Dibble 1967; Patton and Dibble 1982;
Turpin, this volume).
Stratum 9 contained projectile points of the Late to Transitional Archaic (the
Flanders and Blue Hill phases of Dibble; see Turpin 1985). These included Ensor and
Frio points, beginning at the base of Stratum 9 and continuing upwards to Stratum 2
(Dibble 1967:34,36); Marcos and Marcos-like points (lower Stratum 9 and in the
underlying Stratum 10; Dibble 1967:35,38), and Shumla points, also from lower
Stratum 9 and in Stratum 10 below (Dibble 1967:35,40).
Two radiocarbon dates were obtained from Stratum 9. These are TX285:
2070±140 B.P. (120 B.c.; uncorrected; Dibble 1967:30); and TX696: 2230:1::80 (280
B.C.; uncorrected; Dibble and Patton 1982:106). A radiocarbon assay from Stratum
10 is SI1397: 2540:1::75 (590 B.C.; uncorrected; Turpin, this volume).
Among the artifacts from Stratum 9 are two obsidian flakes. One specimen (Fig.
8.1a; TOP [Texas Obsidian Project] No. 129) is derived from Stratum 9, Cut 3 in Unit
N190[W200 (filed at TARL as AMIS 10543); the second (Fig. 8.1b; TOP No. 131)
comes from a provenience described as Stratum 9, Lower Cut/Stratum 10, Mixed,

from Unit N180-191/W160 (AMIS 10545). A third obsidian flake from Arenosa (Fig.
8.1e; TOP No. 130) is from unknown provenience within the site (AMIS 10544).
The two provenienced obsidian artifacts from Arenosa were removed from the
TARL collections with the permission of the National Park Service and were sub­
mitted for trace element analysis at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. We used the
Precise X-Ray Fluorescence (PXRF) method, a non-destructive technique which is
being developed by Robert Giauque. The initial tests, of which this work is part,
suggest that the method is highly sensitive, and will provide precise measurements,
albeit for fewer elements, comparable to those obtained through neutron activation
analysis (NAA). In the present stage of development, reliable elemental abundances
could be obtained for nine elements (see Table 8.1). The resulting pattern matched
that of the source we have been referring to as "Valles Caldera" in New Mexico. The
trace element pattern for the source samples collected from the localities of Cochiti
and Bland Canyons (samples kindly provided by Cathy Cameron) and Obsidian Ridge
(Baugh and Nelson 1987) are indistinguishable and thus have been given a single
source designation as the "Valles Caldera Composition Group" (Helen Michel, letter
of June 29, 1984).
The Valles Caldera is located in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New
Mexico, 56 km north of Santa Fe, and in the southern part of the Southern Rocky
Mountains geomorphic province (Fig. 8.2; Baugh and Nelson 1987:314,317; Kudo
1974). It is the younger of two Pleistocene calderas in this area.
The volcanic history of the Jemez Mountains is generally divided into three
episodes, with the first producing the basalt flows of the Palizo Canyon Formation

about 10 million years ago (mya), and the second producing latite flows and deposits
of the Tshicoma Formation about 6.8 mya (De Nault 1987). The third episode was
marked by two major Plinian-type eruptions, the first of which caused the formation
of the Toledo Caldera about 1.4 mya. The second and smaller eruption, about 300,000
years later, obliterated much of the earlier caldera as the Valles Caldera was formed
(De Nault 1987). This well-preserved caldera complex has served as a model for the
sequence of volcanic events (Smith and Bailey 1966, 1968) which has relevance for
the location of obsidian deposits.
After eruption and collapse of the cauldron into a caldera and formation of a
resurgent dome, further post-collapse activity in the ring-fracture zone produced
rhyolite lava flows and domes (Smith and Bailey 1968). For the Toledo Caldera, the
remaining rhyolite domes have been mapped as the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite Formation
(Griggs 1964; Smith, Bailey, and Ross 1970). This formation is made up of fine­
grained light-gray banded rock and obsidian composed primarily of sanidine and some
quartz phenocrysts (Griggs 1964:57; Smith, Bailey, and Ross 1970). Our trace ele­
ment reference samples, that have been referrred to as "Valles Caldera," actually
come from outcrops or sediments of the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite Formation, collected
from Cochiti and Bland Canyons, both to the southeast and outside of the Valles
Caldera, and from the Obsidian Ridge area, farther to the southeast, which is partly

formed of tuffs and sediments of Cerro Toledo Rhyolite (Smith, Bailey, and Ross
1970).
In an earlier study, Newman and Nielson (1985) began differentiating some of
the trace element patterns, including that of the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite, for the Jemez
Mountains. In an more extensive effort, Baugh and Nelson (1987:Table 1) identified
at least seven trace element characterizations for the various geologic units of the
Jemez which are closely related to the geologic history of the region. In light of this
information and the proveniences of our reference samples, we suggest that "Cerro
Toledo Rhyolite" provides a more specific and potentially less confusing source
designation than our previous use of "Valles Caldera" (cf. Mitchell et al. 1980) which
was geographically based.
The Texas Obsidian Project, under which these specimens were analyzed, has
identified 30 other Texas specimens derived from the Cerro Toledo Rhyolite source.
These include specimens from the Panhandle (Hutchinson and Roberts counties), the
Llano Estacado (Andrews, Garza, and Lubbock counties), north~central (Knox
County) and west-central Texas (Nolan and Tom Green counties), west Texas
(Hudspeth and EI Paso counties), central Texas (Bandera, Bell, Bosque, Comanche,
Hill, Travis, and Williamson counties) and south Texas (Dimmit County).
Approximate plottings of these specimens are indicated in Figure 8.2. Of these 30
artifacts, at least 18 are of Late Prehistoric date, two are assignable to the Archaic
(Knox County: general Archaic; a Middle Archaic specimen comes from Bell County),
and another is Paleoindian (41LU1, Lubbock County; Johnson et al. 1985).
The two specimens reported here from Arenosa can be attributed to the
Lateffransitional Archaic. While obsidian artifacts of Cerro Toledo Rhyolite source
were widely distributed across the northern, central and western parts ofTexas in Late
Prehistoric times, the southernmost Archaic occurrence that can be demonstrated is
at Arenosa. However, our data for the presence of Cerro Toledo Rhyolite materials
in the Archaic is too meagre to offer any suggestions as to possible trade routes. If
we look at the overall distribution (Fig. 8.2). it appears that the obsidian from Cerro
Toledo may have been moving through trade networks that followed major river
valleys. The Cerro Toledo Rhyolite source in the Jemez Mountains is just above the
headwaters of the Rio Grande and the Pecos Rivers. Unfortunately, we know little
about the distribution of Cerro Toledo artifacts in these two river systems, and can
only speculate that the Arenosa specimens may have been derived from exchange
systems operating along either of those major rivers. We can, at this time, point only
to the fact that the ancient peoples of the Lower Pecos had trade contacts that allowed
them to obtain materials that had been derived from a great distance (roughly 570
"straight line" miles in this specific case - or 800 miles if following the Rio Grande).
Other examples of material culture from distant areas found in Lower Pecos sites
include marine shells from the Texas Gulf coast, an incised ceramic pipe attributable
to the Frankston Focus (ca. A.D. 1200-1600) of northeast Texas (Greer 1968:184-185;
from the Devils' River drainage), and a stone pipe of catlinite found at 41VV537, a
multicomponent open site on the Devil's River (Hester: Baker Cave Project notes

1% / Hester

1984). The latter is reminiscent, though it has obviously been much reworked, of the
late Pueblo clay pipes of Pecos (Kidder 1932).
Acknowledgments

The analyses reported here were made possible by an Advanced Research
Program grant to Hester from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board
(Grant No. 4137). Joseph Labadie, archeologist with the National Park Service
Amistad Recreation Area, helped facilitate the approval from the Park Service for
the study of these specimens. Dr. Darrell Creel, Pamela Headrick and Susan Dial, all
of whom have worked on the Amistad Collections Project (National Park Service,
Santa Fe, Contract CA 7029-8-006), have helped in various ways in the study of the
Arenosa obsidian artifacts. Pamela Headrick drew the specimens shown in Figure
8.1. The specimens were photographed for TARL files by Daniel Julien. This work
