A Cultural Resources Survey of the Weaver
Property Cellular Tower Site, Flower Mound,

Abstract
Medina Consulting, Inc., San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower
in the city of Flower Mound in southern Denton County, Texas. The Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required,
but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on February 18, 2011 A thorough pedestrian survey of
the surface area was concluded before four shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed neither on the surface, or in any of the four shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Medina Consulting, Inc. be allowed
to oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.

Introduction
Medina Consulting, Inc. is the consulting
firm employed to acquire clearance for the
erection of a 100-foot monopole celluar
telephone tower to be constructed in a 40-x40-foot compound in southern Denton
County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Medina
contracted with Terras Antiguas to conduct
an archaeological investigation of the
proposed tower site. Although no public
funding was involved in the proposed
development of the property, the Federal
Communications Commission’s
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA;
47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such
an undertaking.

conducted an on-line review of the
Archaeological Site Atlas (Atlas) of the
Texas State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO). The purpose of this review was to
identify any listed or potential
archaeological resources within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE) .
A modern aerial photograph and eight
photographs were reviewed. These revealed
that with some possible overburden
introduced as fill, the immediate APE had
apparently undergone little impact during
the 20th century. In addition, a geological
map, and a USDA soils map of the
proposed project area were reviewed.

A preliminary review of the Texas Denton County.
Historical Commission’s Atlas indicated
that there were 14 recorded archaeological sites along the same drainage within one mile of the
proposed tower site. Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommended that an on-site surface survey and
shovel testing would be an adequate and appropriate method for further evaluating the APE, and
for determining the existence of cultural materials within the project area.

On February 20, 2011, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of the
footprint of the proposed impact area as well as the proposed right-of-way access into the tower
site from Enterprise Drive. In addition to the surface survey, Tierras Antiguas excavated four
shovel tests. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and the Texas State Historical Preservation
Office (SHPO). Although no Texas Antiquities Permit was required, this report of findings was
reviewed by the (SHPO).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to (1)
locate and record any cultural artifacts
in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology, (2) quantify site
size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts
within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the
area to be impacted had been staked
with survey stakes, thus clearly
delineating the area to be further
disturbed. In Accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Archaeology Survey Standards, a
systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of
the delineated tract was conducted. The Figure 3. Locations of shovel tests.
APE is located directly in the
southwest corner of an open rural area, but surrounded by increasing encroaching commercial
and industrial development properties. Particular surficial attention was paid to the eastern and

northern edges of the tower footprint site
where evidence of mixed fill matrices, with
large chunks of concrete and brick
fragments were extruding from 1 to 3meter cutbanks.

Enterprise Drive; this surface represents 1 to 2
meters of fill; facing west.

Following the pedestrian survey, four
shovel tests were excavated in the area to
be impacted (Figures 3-5). Shovel tests
were dug in 20-cm levels, to 60 cm below
the surface, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In
accordance with a designed research plan,
all redundant artifacts recovered from
shovel tests were not to be collected, but
were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the
backfilled shovel test.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate area of the monopole 40x40-foot area is relatively undisturbed. However, two
shovel tests placed in the entrance right-of-way indicated that the immediate area has been filled
with a matrix of road base and mottled yellowish brown clay. Although surface visibility ranged
from 60-100 percent, no cultural material was observed. Nor was any cultural material found in
any of the four shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the
project area was conducted, and four shovel tests were excavated to as deep as 60 cm below the
surface, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
