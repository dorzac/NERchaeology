ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey was conducted by Dixie Environmental Services,
CO., LP (DESCO) and Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in Bossier Parish,
Louisiana for Global Geophysical Services, Inc. (Client). The name of the project is the
Elm Grove 3-D Seismic Survey, and the field survey was designed to investigate source
point locations marked in the field by the client. The size of the entire seismic survey is
511 square miles (327,040 acres or 132,348 hectares), but the archaeological survey
was only conducted on lands owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Vicksburg District. The USACE owns a total of 2028 acres (821 hectares), of
which only 1791 acres (725 hectares) will be affected by the proposed seismic activities.
This project was conducted under an ARPA permit issued to BVRA on September 30,
2009. The ARPA permit number is DACW38-4-09-140. The investigation also included a
file search for known sites within the project area and those within one mile of the
project area. This task was conducted prior to the field survey. The field survey
consisted of visual inspections in the field and shovel tests at pre-determined source
point locations. Seven previously recorded cultural resources (16BO295, 16BO296,
and 16BO299 – 16BO303) are present in the project area, and a thirty-meter buffer was
established around their boundaries. The current survey recorded two previously
unrecorded sites and an isolated find. Site 16BO627 is a probable house site that dates
to the 20th century based on artifacts typical of this type of site and domestic plants.
This site was determined to be in poor condition and typical of a number of similar
historic sites in the area. Therefore, it not eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. Site16BO628 is a prehistoric site that appears to have two components
based on the presence of an Archaic projectile point identified as Palmer and four
ceramic sherds that date to the Late Prehistoric period. Intact Archaic sites and
components are usually regarded as significant, and it is recommended that this site be
evaluated for its research potential prior to future disturbance in this area. Its status in
regards of its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places is considered
to be undetermined pending further research. Both sites and the isolated find were
avoided by the proposed seismic activities through the establishment of a thirty-foot
buffer. The isolated find consisted of a single undecorated ceramic body sherd found in
a shovel test. All artifacts and records were transferred to the Louisiana Division of
Archaeology in Baton Rouge for permanent curation.

INTRODUCTION
Global Geophysical Services, Inc. is the client and is conducting a 3-D seismic
survey that encompasses 511 square miles in Northwest Louisiana. The project area
involves lands owned by the USACE and consists of thirty-seven tracts of land
comprising 2028 acres (821 hectares) (Appendix I) that are located in various parts of
southern Bossier Parish (Figure 1). The purpose of the seismic survey is to provide a
high-resolution image of the subsurface geological features that will allow the client to
effectively evaluate the hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area. The survey
requires the deployment of motion sensing devices (receivers) at regular intervals along
receiver lines as well as the incorporation of energy sources at regular intervals along
source lines. As proposed, there are 351 source points on twenty-one of the land tracts
comprising 1791 acres (725 hectares) of the 2028 acre project area. The client
contracted with DESCO to provide the staff and resources necessary to provide direction
of field survey efforts and prepare a report that will satisfy the USACE and the SHPO for
Louisiana. BVRA was selected as a sub-contractor to obtain the ARPA permit and be
responsible for the report preparation. The current archaeological investigation was
designed to identify all previously recorded sites for avoidance and record any new sites
found during this study. Site 16BO627 is not eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places, and the eligibility of site 16BO628 is described in this report as
“undetermined.” The field survey began on April 16, 2010 when the first shovel test was
excavated and was completed on August 6, 2010 when the last site was delineated and
recorded.
The current project area consists of lands owned by the USACE and is depicted
on three 7.5’ United States Geological Survey topographic quadrangles. They are
Bossier Point (3209345), East Point (3209353), and Sligo (3209336). A drafted map
depicting the various areas investigated and their location within the three quadrangles
appears as Figure 2. The areas investigated during this survey are depicted on the
relevant 7.5’ United States Geological Survey topographic quadrangles (Appendix II).
There are thirty-seven parcels of land under USACE jurisdiction in the current project
area. Table 1 provides a list of these parcels and includes additional information such
as Section, Township, Range, and number of acres for each parcel.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information was taken from a report of Land Resource Regions and
Major Land Resource Areas of the United States by the United States Department of
Agriculture (2006) and a report by R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc. (Markell
et al. 1995). The project area is located within Major Land Resource Area 133-B as
defined by the United States Department of Agriculture and is part of the West Gulf
Coastal Plain Section of the Coastal Plain Province of the Atlantic Plain. This area
consists of level to steep uplands that are intricately dissected by streams, some of
which have broad floodplains. The average annual precipitation in this area is 39 to 63
inches, and most of the rainfall occurs in late summer and fall. The average annual
temperature is 61 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, and the frost-free period averages 270
days. Water is generally abundant in the area due to frequent precipitation, perennial
streams, and a dependable supply of ground water. Bedrock aquifers are the main
source of ground water. According to an archaeological investigation in a portion of the
project area near Loggy Bayou (Markell et al. 1995), this area consists of floodplain
deposits associated with the incised valley of the bayou and the adjacent portion of the
Red River Valley. Much of the area is described in this report as containing slack water
or riparian lakes, backswamp, and lacustrine plains.
Until the second half of the nineteenth century, much of the project area was
covered by slackwater or riparian lakes. Named streams and waterways include Brushy
Bayou, Loggy Bayou, Red Chute Bayou, Flat River, and Swan Lake. Online soil survey
information * was checked to determine soil types in the project area. Twenty-one soil
types present including Armistead clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (ArA), Bistineau very fine
sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (BhC), Bossier clay, frequently flooded (BmA), Buxin
clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (BuA), Buxin clay, occasionally flooded (BwA), Buxin clay,
frequently flooded (BxA), Forbing silt loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (FoC), Forbing silt
loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes (FoE), Gallion silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (GIA),
Gore silt loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (GoC), Gore silt loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes
(GoE), Guyton-Ouachita silt loams, frequently flooded (GYA), Kolin silt loam, 1 to 5
percent slopes (KoC), Latanier clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (LaA), McKamie very fine
sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (McC), McKamie very fine sandy loam, 5 to 15
percent slopes (McF), Moreland clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (MoA), Moreland clay,
occasionally flooded (MaA), Moreland clay, frequently flooded (MsA), and Yorktown
clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded (YOA).

CULTURE HISTORY - PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction
According to a report published by Espey, Huston & Associates (EHA), Inc.
(1983), the cultural history of northwestern Louisiana may be divided into at least four
broad temporal time periods referred to as periods or stages. These are Paleo-Indian,
Archaic, Neo-Indian, and Historic. The following discussions were taken from the EHA
report and documents by other archaeologists. One of the early reports to discuss the
prehistory of the Red River Basin is entitled Archeological and Historical Resources of
the Red River Basin (edited by Hester A. Davis 1970). The report contains chapters by
archaeologists familiar with the four states that comprise the basin.
Paleo-Indian Stage
It is believed by most archaeologists that human populations may have entered
North America as early as 10,000 B.C. There is archaeological evidence that large,
now-extinct animals such as mammoth and mastodon were hunted in other parts of
North America by Paleo-Indians using distinct projectile points that are known today as
Clovis and Folsom. When examples of these types are found in northwestern
Louisiana, they are usually recovered as surface finds from eroded surfaces or areas
with no firm context that can associate them with other artifacts. According to Gagliano
and Gregory (1965), most Paleo-Indian sites in Louisiana are found on Pleistocene
terraces where erosion has exposed surface remains. They state that surface materials
at these sites are generally sparse, suggesting limited use and short-term occupations
compatible with a hunting and gathering life style. According to Cockrell and Bergstrom
(2008), sites dating to this period are few in number but some have been identified on
lands owned by the National Forest. No Paleo-Indian sites have been recorded in the
vicinity of the current project area. Another point type often associated with the PaleoIndian period is San Patrice. This type has been found at sites with good context and is
believed by some archaeologists to belong to the Early Archaic Period or a transitional
period between Paleo-Indian times and the beginning of the Archaic Period. At site
16GR58 in Grant Parish, Keller (1981) found a grinding stone and a San Patrice point in
what appeared to be a direct association. Other diagnostic artifacts of the Paleo-Indian
period in Louisiana are the Dalton point and Albany scraper (Cockrell and Bergstrom
2008). This period may have lasted until circa 8000 B.C.

10

Archaic Stage
The Archaic period began in Louisiana circa 8000 B.C., and it represented a time
when the environment was changed by post-glacial weather conditions. Also during this
time populations increased in size, even though groups remained small in number.
Caldwell (1958) believes that a pattern of shifting occupation and specialized resource
utilization based on seasonal availability occurred during the Early Archaic. He refers to
this as “primary forest efficiency.” For a long time, the Archaic Stage of this area was
known only from surface finds (Davis 1970:37).
Artifacts associated with the Archaic period in Louisiana include ground stone
tools such as celts, grinding stones, nutting or pitted anvil stones, drills, abraders, and
stemmed projectile points made from local materials (Cockrell and Bergstrom 2008).
Perino (1985) reports points identical to the Palmer type have been found at sites in
Louisiana. The Early Archaic Period lasted from circa 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. No Early
Archaic period sites have been reported in the current project area.
The Middle Archaic lasted from circa 6000 B.C. to 3000 B.C. and is best known
in Louisiana in the southern and southeastern areas of the state, mainly along the
central coast and the Amite River. This period is typified by the beginning of mound
construction and stone artifacts such as celts, atlatl weights (banner stones), and axes.
Projectile point styles included corner-notched and stemmed types (Evans, Williams,
and Lange). No Middle Archaic sites have been reported in the current project area.
The last manifestation of the Archaic in Louisiana (Late Archaic Period) began
circa 3000 B.C. and ended about 1500 B.C. This terminal Archaic period is best
represented in Louisiana in the extreme eastern portion of the state. Artifacts typically
associated with this period are steatite (soapstone) vessels, and projectile point types
such as Gary, Kent, Ellis, Ensor, Motley, Marcos, Morhiss, and Palmillas. Site 16BO43
is in the general area, and it is described on the site form as possibly dating to this
period. This inference is based on projectile points, but they are not described on the
site form by type.
Neo-Indian Stage
This period of prehistory began with the beginnings of agriculture (also referred
to as horticulture). During this time, local groups became less nomadic and gradually
evolved into a sedentary lifestyle. Low ceremonial earthworks were constructed, and
some archaeologists argue that the earthworks attributed to this period are an indication
that social organization became more complex. The addition of ceramics and the bow
and arrow to the inventory of material culture usually coincides with the end of the
Archaic and beginning of the Neo-Indian or Late Prehistoric period. Davis (1970) refers
to this time as “pre-Caddo Formative.” Doehmer and Larson (1976) use the term
“Transitional Stage.” From the end of this period, the Neo-Indian Stage in northwestern
Louisiana is dominated by the Caddo.
11

Caddo Culture
One of the first archaeologists to define Caddo culture in Texas and Louisiana
was Alex D. Krieger (1946). He developed a chronological framework based on the
Midwestern Taxonomic System created by W. C. McKern in the early part of the 20th
Century that was designed to express or explain the developmental stages within the
Caddoan culture area. His framework divided Caddo sites into the earlier Gibson and
later Fulton aspects and these were subdivided into local or chronological foci. Even
though this system is still used by some archaeologists, an alternate approach was
proposed in 1968 during the 11th Caddo Conference.
This new system was believed by many researchers to better reflect the real
historic development of the area by the Caddo (Davis 1970:40). The first two parts of
this five-part sequence correspond to the Gibson Aspect as defined by Krieger, while
the latter three are included within his Fulton Aspect. The five parts are Caddo I (Alto
Focus), Caddo II (Haley Focus), Caddo III (Bossier Focus), Caddo IV (Belcher Focus),
and Caddo V (Historic Caddo). In-depth discussions of these stages can be found in
the writings of Krieger (1946), Newcomb (1961), and Davis (1970), among others.
Swanton (1942) compiled information on the history and ethnology of the Caddo,
and his work is still considered a valuable source for researchers. The Caddo lived in
hamlets along major water sources and practiced agriculture. Their crops consisted of
several varieties of corn, tobacco, and sunflowers. Wild game supplemented their diet.
Their houses were often dome shaped structures of pole and thatch (Wilmsen 1959).
Burned clay daub is common at most Caddoan sites, and this material was probably
used as a form of “chinking.” In a personal communication from Clarence H. Webb to
the authors of the 1983 report by Espey, Huston & Associates, circular or oval houses
with upright walls of posts and wattle and daub were more frequent in the Red River
area of Louisiana and Arkansas. Clothing consisted mainly of tanned deerskin
decorated with small white seeds until glass beads and other items were introduced by
Europeans (Newcomb 1961:290-291).
The Caddo culture began in the northwestern part of Louisiana about A.D. 900,
lasted until historic times, and is marked by the emergence of a decorative style of
pottery such as globular wares with dark, polished surfaces and angled rims. Exteriors
were decorated with engraved curvilinear designs. Ceremonial centers with mounds
and central plazas that had emerged during the Coles Creek Period continued in
Caddoan Culture (Cockrell and Bergstrom 2008). Caddoan cultural development
appears to have been one of complex changes characterized by the oscillation of
chiefdoms that apparently reintegrated in tribal confederacies by historic times (Cantley
and Kern 1984). However, there is debate as to how Caddoan culture developed and
under what influence. Caddoan settlement patterns in the Red River bottom area
tended to consist of villages along secondary streams with clusters of smaller sites
located in peripheral floodplain settings (Girard 1997).
12

Research at Fort Polk suggests that the Caddoan settlement pattern in the Red
River Valley did not occur in the upland settings of the Fort (Thomas, et al. 1982).
Present evidence suggests that small bands of Caddo, probably represented by nuclear
family or extended family groups, lived along the larger interior drainages (Cockrell and
Bergstrom 2008). Site 16BO295 is in the project area and is believed to be a Caddo
village based on ceramics with decorations similar to known Caddo vessels and arrow
point types Alba and Hayes. Other sources that provide information on the Caddo are
The Caddo Nartion (Perttula 1992), Caddoan Prehistory:The Bossier Focus (Webb
1948), The Caddo Indians of Louisiana (Webb and Gregory 1986), and The Aboriginal
Location of the Kadohadacho and Related Tribes (Williams 1964).

CULTURE HISTORY - HISTORIC PERIOD
Early Explorers
Hernando De Soto is regarded as probably the first European to reach the upper
Red River Valley in northwestern Louisiana, and the date of his arrival is presumed to
be 1640. His exploits took him to the Caddo area en route to the Mississippi River
where he was killed (Southern Publishing Company 1890:294). In 1641, Louis De
Moscoso assumed command and he engaged in a series of skirmishes with the Caddo.
Information compiled by Swanton (1942:319) suggests that the De Soto expedition may
have come in contact with one of the groups of the Kadohadacho Confederacy living to
the southwest of the present-day town of Shreveport. The next European in the general
area was La Salle. Although our research could not find where he was in the area now
referred to as Bossier Parish, Swanton’s (1946:142) report states that some members
of his expedition reported meeting the Kadohadacho along the Red River. In 1690,
Henri de Tonti encountered the Natchitoches, a Caddoan tribe, while searching for the
LaSalle Expedition in the area of the present town of Natchitoches in northwest
Louisiana (Webb and Gregory 1978). His exploration of the Red River Valley provides
historians with some of the earliest and best accounts of the area. Other historic Caddo
groups in Louisiana at the time of contact included the Adaes, Doustioni, Natchitoches,
Ouachita, and Yatasi who were primarily concentrated around the present towns of
Natchitoches, Mansfield, Monroe, and Robeline. The Natchitoches and other Caddoan
groups were visited in 1700 by Jean Baptiste Lemoine de Bienville who returned the
next year with Louis Juchereau St. Denis while seeking markets for trade (Swanton
1911; Gregory 1974). Bienville’s contacts led to French settlement and trade with
Caddoan and other groups in the following years. The Caddo survived the political and
economic conflicts between the French and Spanish, but American government Indian
policies after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 brought drastic changes, and they were
eventually removed to Oklahoma in 1835 (Gregory 1974).
Indian Wars
There were several confrontations between the settlers, soldiers, and local Indian
groups in the early part of the 18th century. In 1720, Diron Dartaguette (Inspector of
Louisiana troops) reported attacks by the Chicachas (Chickasaw) Indians on travelers
delayed at "Grand Rapid." Post du Rapides was established in 1722 at present-day
Pineville in order to protect travelers on their way to Natchitoches. However, the
greatest conflict between the French and Indians in this area occurred in 1729 when the
Natchez, enraged by French incursions in the Mississippi Valley, attacked Fort Rosalie
in present-day Natchez, Mississippi (Utley and Washburn 1977). The French and their
Choctaw allies retaliated and destroyed the Natchez village. The Natchez then fled into
Louisiana and were virtually destroyed outside Natchitoches by combined French and
Indian forces (Swanton 1952). The Natchez then broke up and dispersed into areas as
far away as the Carolinas (Milling 1969).
14

Early Settlement
Although the French had been in Louisiana since 1682, the first permanent
settlement in the state was established at Natchitoches in 1714. In an effort to counter
the French threat at Fort St. Jean Baptiste aux Natchitoches, the Spanish established
the presidio and mission Neustra Senora del Pilar de Los Adaes west of Natchitoches
(Bolton 1962). The arrival of Anglos drastically affected the local Indians in the area.
Unlike the earlier French and Spanish explorers and traders, it was the intention of
these settlers to exploit the land through farming. Forests were cleared, and their
activities resulted in the eradication of wildlife habitats that affected the Caddo who
relied on the animals in those habitats for their subsistence. They also introduced
diseases that further helped to decimate the Caddo. The Caddo finally ceded their
lands to the United States in 1835, and they were moved to Texas in 1840. The
Republic of Texas did not want them in their territory, and they were moved to
Oklahoma where they remain today (McLure and Howe 1937). White men had been
settling in northwest Louisiana for several years. It was not until Captain Miller Shreve
removed the Great Raft from the Red River that the area now known as Caddo and
Bossier parishes began to flourish. The raft was a jumble of piled timber, log jams, and
driftwood enmeshed in large masses in sections of the bed of the river. This mass was
estimated to be 160 miles long, and it caused the formation of several lakes including
Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish. When the river was cleared of obstacles, some of the
lakes were drained. The removal of the Great Raft made the Red River a Louisiana
highway second only in importance to the Mississippi River. This event spawned an
increase in population and commerce in this part of the state. As the settlers purchased
the government lands, they were developed into the large cotton plantations that dotted
the landscape throughout Louisiana.
Conflicts between European Powers
Disputes over territories in the New World resulted in military action by European
powers during the eighteenth century. France and England fought each other beginning
in 1754 during the French and Indian War. By 1756, the conflict had spread to Europe.
Spain became embroiled in the conflict toward the end of the war after agreeing to an
alliance with France. Despite Spain’s support, the French were forced to seek peace
with England because of mounting losses and costs. France ceded Louisiana to Spain
in 1762 by the Treaty of Fountainebleu as compensation for losses incurred during the
war, if not to rid her of a colony that posed economic strains on the French government.
The war ended in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris, and Spain ceded Louisiana back to
France with the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. The United States viewed any
foreign control of the Mississippi River as detrimental to its survival. Thus, the United
States initiated talks with France for the purchase of New Orleans. Negotiations lasted
for months until France unexpectedly offered to sell the entire Louisiana colony.

15

Statehood and Growth of the Area
The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 gave control of the Mississippi to the United
States while doubling its geographical area. During the early part of the 19th Century,
there was interaction between the United States Government and the Caddo. In 1804,
Indian Agent Jehial Brooks was appointed, and he was located in Natchitoches until the
agency was moved to the Sulphur Fork of the Red River in 1821. It was later moved to
the Caddo parishes in 1825 and closer to the Caddo Country along Bayou Pierre near
the present city of Shreveport (Hardin 1937:10). Bossier Parish was created from
Claiborne Parish by Act 33 of 1843, and it was named in honor of General Pierre
Evariste John Baptiste Bossier, who was elected to congress from this district the same
year Bossier Parish was created. General Bossier, who received his title as a general of
the Louisiana Militia, was born in Natchitoches in 1797 of a Creole family that was one
of the first to settle in this community. The first parish seat was Freedonia, and the
current parish seat is Bossier City. The first police jury was organized on June 19, 1843.
In 1850, the first official census was taken, and the population of Bossier Parish was
listed as 6952. Benton has been the parish seat of government since 1888 when the
courthouse at Bellevue was partially burned. Since Bellevue had no railroad, the parish
seat was moved to a place where transportation could be utilized to the best advantage
of the public. A rivalry emerged between Benton, Haughton, and Cane’s Landing (now
Bossier City) for their communities to become the parish seat. A courthouse was
erected in Benton in 1890, and this town served as the parish seat until it moved to
Bossier City. The existing Bossier Parish courthouse was constructed in the early
1970s. The population of the parish increased from 7000 in 1840 to approximately
100,000 according to the 2000 census. Bossier has long been regarded as the fastest
growing parish in the state of Louisiana.
Emergence of Plantations
Once the United States took possession of the Louisiana colony, the population
increased greatly. With the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 and the process of sugar
granulation, plantation agriculture became the dominant economy in parts of Louisiana,
especially in the south. By the early 1840s, plantations covering thousands of acres
were common on the alluvial plains of the larger rivers, and they formed the hub of the
economy and, in general, dictated the lifestyle of most of the people in the areas where
they thrived (Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). The development of the plantation
system necessitated the building of warehouses, stores, cotton gins, and sawmills. It
also brought many steamboats up the river. Virtually all goods that were bought and
sold in northwest Louisiana were transported by boat traffic on the Red River. Conzen
(1994:106) defines plantations as holdings large enough to be distinguished by the
family farm (generally over 25 acres), and they were operated for a profit and usually
relied on a single cash crop that was sold outside of the region where it was grown.
There was a division of labor and management consisting of an owner, an overseer,
and labor that often consisted of slaves.
16

In northwestern Louisiana, cotton was the main crop. Sugar cane dominated the
plantations in the southern part of the state, but it was not grown in Bossier Parish.
Often, plantations and farms co-existed. Sometimes farms evolved into plantations or
were absorbed by them. Key factors in determining the feasibility of establishing a
plantation were the availability of large fertile tracts of land and access to transportation
routes. In northern Louisiana, these conditions were most common along the alluvial
areas adjacent to the Red River.
Civil War
During the Civil War (1861-1865), the activities of the Union forces in the state
destroyed much of the local property as well as the general economy. Although the
parish avoided fighting on its soil, the nearby Red River was a major target of the Union
army because it served as a transportation route to the cotton fields of Texas that could
supply the idle mills in the north with much needed cotton. General Taylor concentrated
his forces around Mansfield (south of the project area) and engaged the Union army in
the Battle of Mansfield on April 8, 1864 on the Moss Plantation. As a result of this
encounter, the Federal troops retreated, and the Red River campaign ended (Plummer
1969:5). This was a time of turmoil for the South as many towns and plantations were
burned and looted by the Union Army during their march to the coast. Virtually no new
settlement occurred during this period, and no land was patented (Heartfield, Price &
Greene 1989). As a result of the war, the economy became stagnate and did not revive
until the 1890s when emphasis was placed on the lumber industry.
Reconstruction
The period of Reconstruction followed the war and lasted from 1865 to 1877.
This period was also a time of great turmoil for the South, as it took many years for the
region to regain its former prosperity. The residents of Louisiana found life under
Reconstruction unbearable, and three northwest Louisiana parishes (Bossier, Caddo,
and DeSoto) attempted to leave the state and join the neighboring state of Texas. In
spite of the oppression and hardships imposed by Carpetbag rule, the area prospered
and continued to grow. The population in some Louisiana parishes decreased in
number, and many of the former residents fled to Texas to escape the carpetbaggers
that governed Louisiana (Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). During this unstable
period, gangs of African-Americans and Anglo-Americans roamed the area, robbed the
settlers, and committed numerous murders and acts of terrorism. Sites dating to this
period probably exist within the project area, but it is difficult to identify specific site
locations based on late occupational debris. When the Civil War ended, the plantation
system remained intact for a period of time. However, the emancipation of slaves made
it impossible for the plantation system to survive.

17

Sharecropping
Although several options were tried in order to keep the plantation tradition intact,
the one that emerged and became successful was known as sharecropping. The owner
supplied the land, mules, implements, and housing. In turn, the sharecropper provided
the labor and shared in the profits. This method of exploiting the land remained strong
in the south until after World War II. Historic sites in and near the project area that
reflect this lifestyle consist of tenant shacks that were inhabited by sharecroppers. Two
such sites are 16BO588 and 16BO589. These sites consist of tenant shacks located
within one mile of the project area. Cozen (1994:125) states that the decline in the
practice of sharecropping was directly related to the development of mechanical means
to harvest cotton in the 1940s and the introduction of pesticides in the 1950s. Manual
labor was now obsolete. The ubiquitous sharecropper cabin or tenant shack virtually
disappeared from the landscape as areas were cleared of all obstacles to create new
and larger fields from the sharecropper plots. Tractor sheds replaced mule barns, and
cotton gins became larger and often served several producers. In those areas where
the plantations were not present, local farms were owned and operated by subsistence
farmers who cultivated numerous small fields interspersed with forest-covered areas
(Newton 1970, 1972). Thus, the economy of the project area was most likely a variation
of the activities discussed above.
The Discovery of Oil
All across the south, cotton was king, but the biggest boom to the economy of
northwest Louisiana came in 1901 when oil was discovered in the southwest part of the
state near the town of Jennings. In 1904, land was leased in adjacent Caddo Parish in
order to explore for oil. The area prospered and later became known as Oil City, and
this boost to the local economy also produced a positive affect on Bossier Parish. One
of the greatest booms to the oil and gas industry of today came in 1911 when the first
marine well in the United States was drilled on Caddo Lake in East Texas. This caused
all of Northwest Louisiana to prosper, and nearby Shreveport was fast becoming the oil
capital of the Arkansas-Louisiana-Texas region.
The Lumbering Industry
With the arrival of the railroad and the emergence of the lumbering industry, the
economy of the state was greatly improved, and this period of prosperity began in the
1890s and 1900s (Parker 1969; Burns 1981,1982). Prior to 1880, only the alluvial parts
of the region were well settled. The railroad provided access to markets outside the
region and created new markets for products manufactured from timber such as fuel,
crossties, bridges, railroad cars, and telegraph poles (Tottenham 1974). By 1900, large
corporate sawmills were decimating the large stands of longleaf pine. The remaining
hardwoods were being cut and decimated by crosstie operations and small sawmills
owned by individuals by the 1930s (Gregory and Curry 1978). The lumber industry was
a major contributor to the expansion of railroads in the state.
18

In 1907, there was a money panic among the Wall Street lumber interests,
resulting in a depression that was hard on the lumber industry. Due to the lack of
conservation practices by the railroad and lumber companies, much of the land stood
devoid of trees and many of the boomtowns became ghost towns virtually overnight
(Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. 1989). Burns (1981, 1982) states that this “cut-andget-out mentality” produced a migrant population that left small subsistence farms and
devastated eco-systems in its wake. By the late 1920s, many of the big companies had
exhausted their holdings, and they moved to other forests. The bottomlands had been
largely untouched because it was difficult to operate the skidder sleds in these areas
(Thomas et al. 1982). During the 1930s, the rise of unemployed laborers caused a
decrease in population in many areas of the state as they followed the lumber
companies as they moved to other parts of the country. Those who remained behind in
the uplands relied on farming, and they grew such crops as corn, cotton, and potatoes.
Following World War II, there because a boom in the economy that allowed more
people to purchase cars and other material objects that created a higher standard of
living.
The Modern Era
The country and Louisiana was prospering when the stock market crashed in
1929 and the Great Depression emerged. The discovery of the Rodessa gas field in the
early 1920s and the construction of Barksdale Air Field in Caddo Parish were two
factors that combined with other public construction projects helped the economy of
Northwest Louisiana at a time when the rest of the country suffered. In the 1950s, the
Shreveport area became the production and distribution center of natural gas for the
nation, and oil production and the demand for drilling equipment was at an all time high.
Lumber mills were in full operation, and cotton was still the major crop. However, in the
1960s modern technology and the introduction of synthetics rapidly replaced the need
for cotton and lumber and the oil companies began moving to other locations. This
resulted in economic diversification. No longer could northwestern Louisiana be
completely dependent on the future of one or two industries. Today, the economic base
of the general area consists of local manufacturing, petroleum, agriculture, product
distribution, and medical facilities. Although much of the above discussion is centered
on Caddo Parish, its effects have had a positive influence on Bossier Parish. Bossier
City is the main city in the parish and is adjacent to Shreveport. Therefore, the
development of Shreveport is directly related to Bossier City and the parish as a whole.
In 2000, the population of Bossier Parish was estimated to be 98,300 inhabitants. The
current economy in the parish is supported by the economic pursuits of its major towns,
agriculture, and tourism. Hunting and fishing are major sources of revenue, and much
of the tourism industry is tied to Lake Bistineau State Park. This information was taken
from the sources mentioned above, as well as an online search from the Internet
(http://www.caddosheriff.org/pr/releases/backgrnd/cadohist.htm that was accessed on
January 12, 2011).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Our research revealed that the majority of surveys in the area investigated small
areas and found no sites. The only recorded sites in the project area were identified by
archaeologists working for R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates in the area of Loggy
Bayou (Markell et al. 1995). This study was performed in 1993 and encompassed 830
acres. Eight sites were found and recorded, and seven (16BO295, 16BO296, and
16BO299 – 16BO303) are in the project area. Site forms for the sites were reviewed,
and this Information is summarized in Table 1. The location of these sites is depicted
on Map 3 in Appendix II. Nine of the sites found by Markell et al. (1995) are historic, and
it is believed that they date to the 20th Century. These sites are described on the site
forms as a hunting camp (16BO299), artifact or trash scatters (16BO296, 16BO300, and
16BO301), a barn (16BO302), and a trash dump (16BO303). One site (16BO295) was
considered by the recorders to be potentially eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places; however, the eligibility is unknown. This site is prehistoric and dates
to the Caddo I through Caddo III periods (A.D. 800 – A.D. 1550) based on the recovery
of Smith Plain, Kiam Incised, Dunkin Incised, Pease Brushed, Belcher Ridged ceramics,
and Alba and Hayes arrow points. The size of this site was estimated at 80 meters by
160 meters, and it is situated on the edge of a ridge overlooking the dry lakebed of Lake
Bistineau and Swan Lake. Previously recorded site 16BO107 was visited and assessed
(see Map 2 in Appendix II).
Eighteen prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded within one mile of the
project area. Site forms for these sites were reviewed, and they are summarized in
Table 2. Sixteen of these sites are in Bossier Parish, one is in Bienville Parish, and one
is in Red River Parish. They consist of six prehistoric sites and twelve historic sites.
The prehistoric sites are described on the site forms as artifact scatters and a Caddo
village or hamlet. The historic sites are described as a domestic occupation, tenant
shacks, trash dumps or scatters, a rural industrial site, a ferry landing, and cemetery.
Although the eligibility for some sites is described on the site forms as not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, they are considered in this report to be
“undetermined” in terms of their National Register eligibility.

Previous investigators have presented their hypotheses regarding probability
areas for site location. The only relevant theory regarding site potential relative to the
current project area was proposed by Markell et al. (1995) who stated that prehistoric
archaeological sites in this part of the state are probably located on the higher terraces
since the dissected uplands that wall the local valleys would have provided relatively dry
land suitable for long-term occupation. Two sites (16BO107 and 16BO295) found during
their survey were located in this topographic setting. Site 16BO295 is in our project
area. This survey confirmed their theory in part because prehistoric site 16BO628 was
found on a ridge at an elevation of 150 to 174 feet above mean sea level. The authors of
this report did not encounter any theories regarding probable settings for historic sites. It is
our assumption that sites dating to the historic period can be found on virtually every type
of topographic setting from floodplains to upland ridges.
Archaeologists working for Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. (Heartfield et al. 1984)
prepared an archaeological overview and management plan for the Louisiana Army
Ammunition Plant in Bossier and Webster parishes located within the Red River floodplain.
Although this research focused on an area that is in the floodplain of a major river (unlike
the current project), it does provide information regarding likely settings for prehistoric
sites, and this information was considered in the planning stages of the current project.
According to the management plan, early sites are probably located at elevations greater
than 200 feet above mean sea level. The later prehistoric sites occur at lower elevations,
and some may be found on low rises or terraces in floodplains.
High probability areas in northwestern Louisiana have been defined by other
archaeologists. According to a report by Ecology and Environment, Inc. (1992), areas of
high probability for prehistoric sites in this part of Louisiana are found on or near
definable geomorphologic features such as terraces, knolls, or the confluences of
creeks, streams, and rivers. Areas of high probability for historic sites are primarily
concentrated along transportation routes such as roadways and navigable waterways,
although isolated farmsteads may be found near any expanse of arable land. Medium
probability areas for prehistoric sites are defined by Ecology and Environment, Inc.
(1992) and include uplands with well-drained soils, large and small plateaus located
away from water sources, small raised “islands” within low marshes or swamps, and
certain segments of agricultural land that exist near old oxbows. Those areas with a
medium probability of containing historic sites include remote plateaus, hilltops, and
pasture lands located away from present farming and urban centers. Ecology and
Environment, Inc. (1992) states that low probability areas for prehistoric sites are “areas
in which archaeological sites are unlikely to be found because the environmental
character of the area was not conducive to settlement, or because the environment has
been altered to the extent that any original sites would have been destroyed or severely
disturbed.” Environmental factors typical of low probability areas are generally similar
for prehistoric and historic sites. These areas are usually wet or swampy or, to a lesser
extent, covered by very poorly drained soils or steep, unstable slopes greater than 10
percent.

METHODS
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to the commencement of the field survey, relevant maps, reports, and other
sources of information were reviewed in order to identify previously recorded sites in the
project area and vicinity, as well as areas that have been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. Site forms for all sites in the project area and those within one mile of
the project area were reviewed and summarized in tabular form in the section below
entitled Previous Investigations. Archaeologists associated with this project, and others
with professional experience in the area, were contacted in order to determine the
methods to be adhered to for this project. Chris Koeppel is the staff archaeologist at the
Vicksburg District of the USACE. He was contacted, and it was decided that the focus
of the work by the field crew would be the identification and documentation of cultural
resources in the project area. In addition, all previously recorded sites were to be
recommended for protection until they can be evaluated in more detail. The on-line
records of the Louisiana Division of Archaeology were checked for the presence of
standing structures. *

Areas marked by the State of Louisiana as being “Previously Surveyed” were not
resurveyed. All source points in areas not previously surveyed were inspected and
shovel tested when necessary. Shovel test fill was screened through ¼ inch hardware
cloth, and all shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Source points were shovel
tested unless they were found to be on a steep slope or in a low-lying area where
standing water was present. According to the guidelines established by the Louisiana
Division of Archaeology, all shovel tests were dug to a depth of 100 centimeters below
the existing surface, unless clay or water was reached prior to that depth. In some
cases, additional shovel tests were excavated in those areas where the survey crew
determined this to be appropriate. The locations of the shovel tests are depicted on the
project area maps that appear in this report as Appendix II. In all, 378 tests were
excavated during the course of this project.

Delineation of new sites involved shovel testing in four directions from any survey
shovel test that produced artifacts until two consecutive negative shovel tests were
excavated in each direction as well as in four directions from each positive test found
during the delineation phase. The shovel test interval was ten meters. Newly recorded
sites were documented by the use of site shovel test forms, Munsell soil color charts,
handheld GPS units, and digital photography. A map depicting the location of shovel
tests, topographic features, and observed cultural resource features (if any) was
produced. Artifacts were bagged by level, and an artifact catalog card was placed in the
bag. A sack log describing all cultural materials collected was maintained. Site forms
authorized by the Louisiana Division of Archaeology were filled out for each site. Each
newly recorded site was assigned a field number. Field numbers were assigned to new
sites until official state trinomials could be obtained. The seismic operatives were
informed of the location of each site during the field survey, and these areas were
avoided.
Previously Recorded Sites
Each previously recorded site in the project area was located in a previously
surveyed area. The seismic operatives were informed of the location of each site
before the field survey, and a thirty-meter buffer was established around the boundaries
of each site.
Artifact Analysis and Curation
William A. Dickens analyzed artifacts, and his results are discussed in the Artifact
Analysis section below. Rita D. McCarty prepared the artifacts and records for
permanent curation at the Louisiana Division of Archaeology in Baton Rouge. Copies of
the final report are housed at the office of the Louisiana SHPO, DESCO, BVRA, and
Global Geophysical Services, Inc.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
The prehistoric artifact assemblage from site 16BO628 consists of one Palmer
dart point, one broken dart point that could not be identified by type, four undecorated
ceramic sherds, seven flakes, one piece of non-cultural shatter, one piece of sandstone,
and an unmodified fragment of a carapace identified as box turtle. Each artifact was
found during shovel testing. The sherd found in Shovel test 9 was lost in the field. A
small sherd was found at Isolated Find 1 in a shovel test. It was discovered during the
artifact analysis that this specimen was missing.
Projectile Points
The Palmer dart point was found in Shovel Test 9 at 40-50 cm below the existing
ground surface. This specimen is complete, and the raw material is a reddish chert or
jasper. Palmer points are usually characterized by corner notches and straight edges
that are sometimes serrated. The stem on this specimen is short and expanding, and
the basal edge varies from straight to slightly concave. The shoulders are strongly
barbed. The blade has been retouched on one face, and this has resulted in a slight
bevel. Retouching reduces the size of the blade, and this technique is viewed by most
archaeologists as an attempt at re-sharpening. There is no indication that the point was
thermally altered, and no surface patina is present. It measures 42.9 mm long, 26.4
mm wide, and 9.1 mm thick at its mid-point. The juncture width (distance between
notches) is 19.4 mm and the length of the stem is 9.9 mm. Grinding and smoothing are
characteristics of early projectile point forms, and the lateral sides of the stem edges,
basal edge, and notches exhibit obvious grinding and/or smoothing. The range of
Palmer points is in the southeastern part of the United States from the Carolinas to
northeastern Texas and southeastern Arkansas. Although this type dates from the
latter part of the Paleo-Indian period through the Early Archaic period (circa 6000 B.C.),
it is probably associated with the Early Archaic period (Perino 1985:286; Turner and
Hester 1999:166). Figure 3 is a photograph of both faces of this point, and a drafted
illustration of the same specimen is depicted in Figure 4.
The possible projectile point was found in Shovel Test 17 at 0-10 cm below the
existing ground surface. It is made from an unknown raw material that is very grainy.
Analysis with a microscope revealed what appears to be minor flaking around the base,
but it is only conjecture at this time if this alteration is man-made. The surface is
described as degraded. The specimen is broken due to a transverse break or snap
fracture. Measurements and other primary data appear on a projectile point recording
form that is curated with the artifacts and records.

Debitage
The debitage sample consists of five flakes and one piece of shatter found
between 0 and 50 cm below the ground surface. Each specimen was analyzed for type
of material, size, presence or absence of cortex, type of platform, ventral characteristics,
and condition. Flake size is an important factor in determining the stage of manufacture
for lithic tools. Large flakes that retain large amounts of cortex are defined as having
been detached or removed during the initial or early stage of tool manufacture. Smaller
flakes and flakes with no cortex are viewed as indicators of late stage manufacture or
activities associated with tool maintenance. Platform type is important in understanding
how the raw material was prepared and flakes were removed. Ventral characteristics
are useful in determining the type of tools being made. These attributes are used to
provide a better understanding of site use and the various activities that occurred. Not
one of the flakes is made from a reddish chert. Therefore, no relationship between the
debitage from this site and the Palmer point made from a reddish chert or jasper can be
established.
The specimen recovered from Shovel Test 1 is a small flake made from yellowish
colored, fine-grained chert. It was measured as Size Grade 7 (less than 9.5 mm and
greater than 6.3 mm). It is defined as a complete secondary flake because it retains a
small amount of the exterior surface or cortex. The striking platform is natural (one that
has no modification), it has a slight bulb of percussion, and no platform tip is present on
its ventral surface. These attributes are typical of flakes that were removed using the
percussion method that involves use of a hard hammer, usually quartzite or another
form of stone harder and denser than the material being reduced. No evidence of
heating or other forms of thermal alternation was observed.
Two flakes were recovered from Shovel Test 2. The larger one is a complete
interior flake made from yellowish-brown chert with no cortex present. It is Size Grade 7
(less than 9.5 mm and greater than 6.3 mm). The platform is dihedral (two facets).
Other characteristics observed are no lip present, a bulb of percussion, and no grinding
anywhere on the specimen. The smaller specimen is a flake fragment made of
yellowish-brown chert. It is an interior flake with no cortex present, and it contains the
medial and distal portions of the original specimen. It is Size Grade 8 (6.3 mm or
smaller). No evidence of heating or other forms of thermal alternation was observed on
either specimen.

29

The specimen recovered from Shovel Test 4 is a very small flake made from a
grainy form of chert that is yellowish in color. It is Size Grade 8 (6.3 mm or smaller),
and represents the distal portion of an interior flake with no cortex present on its original
surface. No platform remains, but a slight bulb of percussion is present. This suggests
removal by light hard hammer percussion or through the use of a bone or antler billet
utilizing the soft hammer technique. The other attributes present in the complete flakes
are missing on this specimen. No evidence of heating or other forms of thermal
alternation was observed.
Two specimens were recovered from Shovel Test 9. The larger one is probably
shatter and is not considered cultural. It is made from a very grainy quartzite. There is
no platform or other ventral characteristics that are typical of a culturally removed flake.
The other specimen is a reddish-brown flake that is also made from quartzite that
appears to have been thermally altered. It is Size Grade 7 (less than 9.5 mm and
greater than 6.3 mm). The platform is missing, but the specimen appears to have a
diffuse (smooth) ventral surface that is common on flakes that were removed using the
soft hammer method.
Ceramics
One undecorated body sherd was recovered from Shovel Test 4 between 40 and
50 cm. It was lost in the field, but described by the surveyors as very small and most
likely sand-tempered. Two additional sandy-paste body sherds were found at 20-40 cm
in Shovel Test 25. The specimen found at Level 3 is also undecorated and appears to
be part of the bottom of a vessel. The specimen found at Level 4 is a plain sherd with no
evidence of decoration. These artifacts cannot be associated with a known type.
Conclusions
The only diagnostic artifacts present in the assemblage of prehistoric artifacts are
the dart point and ceramic sherds. These specimens suggest a range of occupation
from the Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic period through the Late Prehistoric period. Small
samples of debitage restrict what can be said regarding site function. However, they
are probably examples of tool maintenance activities such as re-sharpening and other
re-juvenation tasks. The raw materials that created the debitage and the projectile point
indicate that a wide range of materials were utilized. No definite statement regarding
the function of this site can be made based on a sample of this size.
Faunal Remains
One specimen that can be identified as faunal is a fragment of the carapace of a
common box turtle (Terrapend Carolina). This specimen consists of one marginal
scute (probably from a lateral edge) and two partial coastal scutes. It is highly eroded
from weathering and does not appear to have been modified.
30

Historic Artifacts
The historic artifact assemblage from site 16BO627 consists of brick fragments
(two may be hand-fired); fragments of brown, green, opaque, and clear glass; wire nails
or spikes, buckle fragment, one metal staple, pieces of wire, several unidentified pieces
of iron, whiteware sherds, a modern snuff bottle, a metal washtub, and fragments of a
large ceramic crock. The green glass and some of the clear glass fragments were lost
in the field. All of the historic artifacts except for the crockery fragments, metal washtub,
and the snuff bottle were found in shovel tests. Those artifacts found on the surface
were not collected. The presence of brick, possible window glass, and other domestic
artifacts suggest that this is the site of an abandoned house that was probably occupied
sometime during the 20th century. The presence of domestic flowers and a crepe myrtle
are additional evidence that 16BO627 was a domestic dwelling. The historic artifacts
are common items that are found at similar sites throughout the area, and they are not
considered to be significant.

31

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at the Louisiana Division of Archaeology revealed the presence
of seven previously recorded sites in the project area (Table 1). These sites are mainly
historic and date to the 19th and 20th centuries. Two new sites and one isolated find were
identified and recorded as a result of this survey, and they are discussed below.
16BO627
This is a historic site that is believed to represent the location of a house that was
probably occupied during the early part of the 20th century. According to a records
check at the Bossier Parish Courthouse, the land was sold to Hal Turner in 1916.
Census records document that he was an African-American who was engaged in
farming. In 1995, the USACE took possession, and the area that includes this site
became part of the Loggy Bayou Management Area. The results of the archival
research at the courthouse are presented in Appendix III. The function of this site as a
domestic dwelling is supported by the presence of artifacts typically associated with
houses such as glass bottles, nails, metal washtubs, and domestic plants. A small
sample of brick fragments may represent the remains of piers or a chimney. The
artifacts found at this site are described in the Artifact Analysis section above. Given
the rural setting, this site was probably a farmstead. Two pits were present, but their
function is not known. They are labeled on the site map as Pit 1 and Pit 2. There are
seven historic sites in the area that are described on the site forms as trash scatters,
refuse dump, and possible hunting camp. These sites date to the 19th and 20th
centuries. One chert flake was found at Level 5 (40-50 cm) in Shovel Test 53, and this
is the only prehistoric artifact recovered. Seventy-three shovel tests were excavated and
twenty were positive. Shovel test information is found in the shovel test log (Appendix IV).
Site 16BO627 is located on the edge of a finger ridge at an elevation of 186 to 220 feet
above mean sea level between Red Chute Bayou and Loggy Bayou. The nearest water
source is an unnamed tributary of Loggy Bayou 565 meters to the northeast. The soil at
the site is McKamie very fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (McF), and it is
discussed in the Environmental Setting section above. The artifacts were observed
scattered about the surface and from shovel tests at depths of 0-30 cm below the
existing ground surface. The size of this site is estimated at 100 meters north south by
90 meters east west (6211 square meters) based on the positive shovel tests and the
surface scatter of artifacts associated with the site. This site was located in an area
covered with thick woods (Figure 6). The location of site 16BO627 is depicted on the
7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle Bossier Point dated 1972, and a map of the site is
depicted below in Figure 7. The condition of this site is classified as destroyed. The field
number assigned to this site is ACN-01. It was identified by Anthony Clay Newton on
April 16, 2010 who excavated the first positive test, and it was delineated by various
members of the crew on April 16, 2010, August 5, 2010, and August 6, 2010. Site
16BO627 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and no
further work is recommended.

16BO628
This is a prehistoric site located on a finger ridge at an elevation of 150 to 174 feet
above mean sea level. There are several small ephemeral drainages in the area, but the
nearest source of water is an unnamed tributary of Loggy Bayou that is 212 meters to
the northeast. Loggy Bayou is the largest stream in the area, and it is 1720 meters to the
east. Red Chute Bayou is closer at 1350 meters to the west. No features were observed
at this site, and its function is not known. The presence of a Palmer dart point is an
indication of a late Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic occupation. A Late Prehistoric component
is represented by the presence of ceramics. The artifacts found at this site are discussed
in the Artifact Analysis section above. Forty-eight shovel tests were excavated, and ten
were positive. Shovel test information is found in the shovel test log (Appendix IV). The
vast majority of previously known prehistoric sites in the general area consist of lithic
scatters with few artifacts and no diagnostic artifacts present. When diagnostic artifacts
were found, they usually date to the Late Prehistoric or Ceramic periods. Based on the
existing data for prehistoric sites in the project area, the presence of an Archaic site is
viewed as significant. The soils at the site are Bistineau very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5
percent slopes (BhC) and McKamie very fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (McF),
and they are discussed in more detail in the Environmental Setting section above. All
artifacts found at this site were collected from shovel tests at depths of 0-95 cm below the
existing ground surface. Based on the number of observed artifacts (n=16), artifact
density is classified as low. The size of this site is estimated at 85 meters northeast
southwest by 65 meters northwest by southeast (3,771 square meters) based on the
positive and negative shovel tests and the landform on which the site is situated. This site
was located in thick woods (Figure 7). The location of site 16BO628 is depicted on the 7.5’
USGS topographic quadrangle Bossier Point dated 1972 (see Map 2 in Appendix II), and
a map of the site is depicted below in Figure 8. The condition of this site is classified as
unknown, and erosion is the only apparent form of disturbance. The field number assigned
to this site is ACN-02. The status of this site is “undetermined” in terms of its eligibility for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The presence of the Palmer point may
signal a very early site for the area, and it is recommended that this site be protected until
it can be evaluated. Anthony Clay Newton excavated the first positive shovel test on April
16, 2010. Site delineation began on the same day and continued on August 5, 2010 and
August 6, 2010 by various members of the crew.

Isolated Find 1
A small, undecorated prehistoric body sherd was found during shovel testing at a
depth of 20-30 cm. Eight shovel tests were excavated, and only one was positive. Shovel
test information is found in the shovel test log (Appendix IV). This area is viewed as an
isolated find, and no formal site number was assigned. A cursory inspection in the field
revealed that the temper of this sherd is probably sandy paste. This isolated find was
discovered by Jeffrey W. Hall on April 19, 2010, and he delineated it on the same day.
This find is located on a side slope at an elevation of 154 feet above mean sea level. The
nearest source of water is Red Chute Bayou 250 meters to the west. The soil in the area
is McKamie very fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes (McF), and this soil is
discussed in the Environmental Setting section above. The location of this find is
depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle Bossier Point dated 1972 (see Map 2
in Appendix II), and a map of the find is depicted below in Figure 9. Isolated finds are not
believed to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. According to
Rita D. McCarty, the sherd found at this source point is missing from the collection to be
curated.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The cultural resources survey identified two previously unrecorded sites and an
isolated find within the project area. Site 16BO627 and the isolated find are not eligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and site 16BO628 is undetermined
in terms of its eligibility. Both sites and the isolated find were avoided by the planned
seismic activities. No prehistoric or historic sites not mentioned in this report were
discovered during seismic activities.

APPENDIX III: LANDOWNER HISTORY FOR SITE 16BO627
Historic Documents Research
Landowner research for the site was conducted as part of the
archaeological investigation of 16BO627. DESCO archaeologists: Jenni Bivona,
Exa M. Grubb, Jeffrey W. Hall and Anthony Clay Newton collected documents
regarding landowners from public records at the Bossier Parish Courthouse and
historical documents on file at the Bossier Parish Historical Library.
Landowner Timeline (1916 – Present)
A review of the survey maps and tax documents, in relation to site
boundary coordinates, identified the legal land location of 16BO627 as Lot 17
tract 238-3 (E½ of the SE¼) in Section 12 of Township 15 north, Range 11 west
in Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The earliest record of Lot 17 is a Federal land grant
of the fractional east ¼ of section 12 sold to Hal Turner in 1916. Census records
from 1900 document that Turner was an African-American farmer and a resident
of Bossier Parish. World War II draft records indicate that one of his three sons
was born in 1884 in Poole, Louisiana at a railroad depot near 16BO627. Soon
after obtaining the patent in 1921, Hal Turner sold the complete property to
Gillum William Smith and his wife Minnie Wyche Smith. Smith is listed in the
1900 census as living in Haughton, Louisiana and working as a merchant. The
Hicks Company., Ltd., a company based out of Shreveport, Louisiana, bought
the land from the Smith family in 1931. In 1944, the property was by the Hicks
Company, Ltd. to M. L. Johnson and Robert A. Johnson. The Johnson’s heirs
married into the Buck, Lloyd, Pilkinton, and Dickson families, and they divided the
property into shares of interest, which they kept within the family. This continued
until 1995 when the parcel was sold by Markam A. Dickson, Jr., to the United
States Army Corps of Engineers (the current owner) to be developed as the
Loggy Bayou Management Area.

Landowners and Plat Maps Prior to 1916
Section 12 was first cultivated in the middle of the 19th century and,
regardless of legal ownership, it is highly probable that the site was occupied
prior to Hal Turner’s original land grant in 1916. Land descriptions prior to Hal
Turner’s federal land grant refer to the first official plat map (approved in 1839) of
township 15 north, range 11 west to specify their legal boundaries. This map has
the fractional east ¼, the entire site area, completely submerged under Lake
Bistineau. According to the swamp-land grant acts of Congress passed in 1849,
land could not be sold until it was surveyed as dry land, and approved on a plat
issued by the government (35 So. 976). James Houston bought the surveyed
land to the west of 16BO627 in 1857. His purchase included all of the land south
of a line, 33 chains and 90 links, from the south boundary of Section 12, covering
all of the south ¼ of the section. This was part of a land grant from the Louisiana
Land Office and, according to the law, the subsiding banks of Lake Bistineau
would have served as the east boundary for the parcel. By 1861, the section had
an updated and approved survey that officially extended the east boundary of
Township 15 north Range 11 west into the old bed of Lake Bistineau. The
survey used this ‘new’ land to carve out lots 7, 11, 12 & 17 for Section 12. The
surveyor also marks James Houston’s established cultivation of the landform by
naming Bossier Point “Houston’s Field.” This was a cleared field that extended
into the site area. The heirs of James Houston married into the Bosley, Jones,
and Sibley families and most likely were absentee landlords, given their out of
parish residencies listed in census records and conveyances. They would have
had access to cultivate the site area until Hal Turner claimed the land in 1916.
Site 16BO627 Depicted on Topographic Quadrangles
A review of historical maps for additional information uncovered one largescale map that focused on the communities and structures in the area. The
Ringgold, LA, 1956 15’ topographic quadrangle map shows that Bossier Point
was sparsely inhabited and did not have a structure at the site location. In
comparison to the Bossier Point, LA, 1972 7.5’ topographic quadrangle, it is
evident that the clearing to the east of the site was once larger. Markers of past
habitation on Bossier Point would be the unimproved road on the 1956 map that
ran north-south past 16BO627 and connected Fairview Church Road to Poole
Road. Also, the two-track road present on the Bossier Point 1972 map was
once a two-track running off of the unimproved road to the convergence of two
perennial waterways in the floodplain of Loggy Bayou. It is now a gravel road
leading to a well pad north of the site.
