Abstract
The Florence Community Park cultural resources survey was conducted as part of project design and
as a requirement of Texas Parks and Wildlife grant funding. The survey was performed under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5609 following the Texas Archeological Survey Standards. The survey covered
ca. 19.54 acres in the Central Texas Blackland Prairie along the headwaters of South Salado Creek in
preparation for the new park construction. The results of the intensive pedestrian survey were negative; no
new cultural resources were found.
Based on negative survey findings, Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) concludes that no
significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed activity and recommends that construction
proceed with no additional investigation. Lastly, APC recommends that if any unexpected historical or
archeological deposits are uncovered during construction, work should stop and APC should be notified. The
find should be evaluated by APC archeologists, in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission, before
construction activity resumes.

Florence Community Park

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMM ARY
The City of Florence (City) proposes to build a Community Park on public and private land in
Williamson County, Texas. Langford Community Management Services (Langford) is in charge of grant
administration for the project. Langford contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), to
conduct a cultural resources survey in order to identify any resources present. APC performed the survey in
accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and the State of Texas Archeological Survey Standards. Texas
Antiquities Permit 5609 was issued for the survey.
In all, about 14 acres make up the Area of Potential Effect (APE) where construction will take place.
The APE is situated in a Low Probability Area (LPA) for the presence of significant cultural resources in a
plowed field and frequently flooded stream flood plain. In addition, ca 5.54 acres of open space and wetlands
will be acquired on the east side of the creek, but will not be developed. The results of the survey were
negative. No new archeological sites or historic properties were found. No soils were encountered with the
potential to contain buried archeological deposits.
APC therefore concludes that no significant eligible cultural resources will be impacted by the
proposed activity and that no additional cultural resources work is warranted. APC recommends that
construction proceed with one condition. If any unexpected historical or archeological deposits are
uncovered, work should stop and APC should be notified. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists
in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) before construction activity resumes.

2.0 FLORENCE COMMUNITY PARK

INTRODUCTION
The City of Florence is located in Central Texas southwest of Temple and northwest of Georgetown
in northern Williamson County (Figure 1). The Florence Community Park development will be located at the
intersection of SH195 and FM970 in the southwest part of the City (Figure 2). The locale is upland setting
overlooking a wooded flood plain. The upland portion of the property is owned by a private foundation,
while the flood plain is owned by the City.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The proposed park is laid out along a tributary of South Salado Creek and will cover about 14 acres.
New construction at the park will include parking, pavilion (20 by 30 feet), a splashpad, a climbing boulder
playscape, a community garden, an open play area, a gazebo (18 by 18 feet), a viewing platform (10 by 15
feet), picnic table area with grills, a hike and bike trail (3000 feet in length), exercise stations, and horseshoe
pits (Figure 3). In addition, 5.54 acres of undeveloped flood plain on the east side of the creek at the north
end of the park will be used as open space and a possible wetland area.
The terrain is level to very gently sloping and cut and fill will be minimal. Limited subsurface
impacts are planned for the construction of the pavilion, gazebo, viewing platform, and picnic area. Drilling
for footings for the pavilion, gazebo, and grills will be between two to four feet deep. The hike and bike trail
will be six feet wide and will be built above ground and covered in crushed granite.

PROJECT AREA
The park location falls in side the Brazos
River basin. A tributary of South Salado Creek forms
part of the eastern boundary of the park. It flows
roughly north to south in the park area and exits the
park to the east, where the route turns east to west and
then empties into Salado Creek. The portion of the
creek along the park has been channelized; banks have
been sculpted and covered in concrete (Figure 4).
The terrain is very gently sloping to the creek
to the east. Elevation ranges from 965 to 970 feet
above mean sea level (Figure 5). The project area is
open land in an urban setting. It has been mowed and
plowed and visibility exceeded 40 percent (Figure 6).
The area climate is subhumid, warm, and
temperate (Miller and Greenwade 1992) with annual Figure 4. Photograph, Facing North, Showing
rainfall of about 19 inches (Werchan and Coker 1983). South Salado Creek.
The project is in the Kansas Biotic Province which is
dominated by mesquite-cedar-grasses and contains over 59 species of mammals (Blair 1950). It falls in the
Blackland Priarie vegetation and physiographic region of Texas (Biesaart et al. 1985). The open area contains
native grasses, forbs, and weeds. Dominant vegetation along the creek consists of willow, hackberry, mexican
plum, cedar elm, and mesquite with introduced invaders like wax leaf ligustrum, china berry, and catalpa
trees.
Clay soils derived from Cretaceous-aged limestone chalk and marl cover the locale. The transitional
area or foot slope where the park improvements will be built is between the uplands and the flood plain and
is mantled in Fairlie Clay, 1 to 2 percent slopes. Fairlie Clay, 0 to 1 percent slope, overlies the uplands and
plowed field adjacent to the park. Surface visibility was high and ranged from 50 to 90 percent in open areas,
with the exception of the flood plain, where visibility was 40 to 80 percent. The flood plain is lined in Tinn
Clay, frequently flooded, and recently deposited sediments.
The cultural history of the Central Texas archeological region, including Williamson County, is well
known. A chronological framework has been constructed that can be applied to the project area (Collins 2003;
Prewitt 1981; and Weir 1976) and are made up of the following periods: PaleoIndian (12,800-8000 B. P.),
Archaic (8000 B.P. to 1250 B.P/A.D. 1450), Late Prehistoric (1250-200 B.P. to 1450-1600 A.D.), and
Historic (1600-1850 A.D.).
The area was settled during the early 1800s and Williamson County was formed from Milam County
in 1848. By the 1890s, an agrarian economy based on small farms supported by gins and mills was
established (Griffith 1990). By 1912, diversified farms, ranches, and dairies run by English, Swedish,
German, Austrian, Swiss, Czechoslovakia, and Slavic groups were in operation (McCullough 1990). The
City of Florence was founded in the 1850s (Scarborough 1973). By the 1890s, the community possessed retail
stores, mills, churches, schools, hotels, a bank, a stone quarry, and a cheese factory. The population in 1900
was 350 and in 2000 was 1054.
No cultural resources surveys or investigations have been performed in the proposed development
area. Two compliance surveys were conducted in the vicinity of the proposed development along SH 195 and
northeast of the locale. No archeological sites or historic buildings were reported near the proposed park. Of
interest to researchers are two historic buildings located outside the park which are representative of Florence
history. The first is an early twentieth century cotton gin located across FM 970 from the park (Figure 7,

Top). The second is an unoccupied, nineteenth century historic residence, which may be a farmhouse
associated with the plowed field (Figure 7, Bottom). If this is the case, the proposed development locale may
part of a late nineteenth century farmstead. Both structures have been altered. The residence has add-ons in
the rear and the gin has been converted to residential and retail use. Neither building appears to be eligible
for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL.

3.0 SURVEY METHODS
The survey covered the Area of Potential Effect (APE), as shown on the proposed park general
layout provided to Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) on April 10, 2010, by Langford. The routine
cultural resources survey included a pedestrian walk over or inspection by archeologists of about 14 acres.
The survey was performed following Texas Archeological Survey Standards in preparation for new park
construction.
The purpose of the survey was threefold: (1) to identify any significant cultural resources present that
might be affected by the planned construction, (2) to formulate recommendations regarding cultural resources
present, and (3) to gather new information. The goal of the survey project was to produce a report for use in
managing cultural resources that also increases the knowledge of the cultural history of the area.
Before the survey, APC performed background research and obtained an antiquities permit.
Pertinent literature, site data, maps, and files were reviewed using the Texas Archeological and Historical
Atlas, the Texas State Library, and the APC library. Maps and indices were checked and it was determined
that no historic properties listed on the NRHP, SAL, and/or recorded sites inside or adjacent to the project
area.
For management purposes, the survey area was divided into High Probability Areas (HPAs) and Low
Probability Areas (LPAs) for the presence of cultural resources. The survey area contained marginal uplands
over looking the flood plain thought to be HPAs. Also present are the frequently flooded stream banks and
the proposed wetland area considered to be LPAs for the presence of cultural resources. The 5.54 acres that
will be acquired for open space and or wetlands in the flood plain was not visited because in will not be
developed and due to the fact that it was quite wet and overgrown at the time of the survey.
The intensive survey was conducted during April of 2010 following seasonal rains. The park location
was approached as a block. It was covered by parallel transects 20-30 meters apart. The survey rate for locales
judged to be HPAs was 15 acres per person per day. Subsurface investigations did not include systematic
shovel testing at regular intervals because of lack of soils and/or because of high surface visibility.
In all environmental settings, surface visibility ranged from 40 to 90 percent in the project area,
negating the need to shovel test while walking transects. Soils along the flood plain are recently deposited
and were wet, clays and were not shovel tested because they do not possess the potential to contain buired
archeological deposits. Archeological site recording was not performed, because no new sites were found.
No artifacts were collected because none was observed.

4.0 RESULTS, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMM ENDATIONS
RESULTS
The results of the Florence Community Park cultural resources survey were negative and showed that
no significant cultural resources are present that will be affected by the proposed activity. No evidence of
prehistoric or historic activity was found during the survey. Despite proximity to a nineteenth and early
twentieth century structures, no historic material was found. One modern man-made object was observed
and it was a golf ball.
The cultural resources survey added new negative data to the knowledge of area cultural history of
this portion of the South Salado Creek drainage. The locale was not selected by Prehistoric groups, who were
likely further downstream where more well-developed and better drained soils are present. Historic activity,
not surprisingly, was also located outside the area planned for construction due primarily to agricultural land
use and proximity to the flood plain.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on negative survey results, APC concludes that the construction of the Florence Community
Park will not affect any significant cultural resources. No potentially eligible archeological sites or historic
structures were found inside the APE. Therefore, APC concludes that no resources that are eligible or
potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP or as SALs will be impacted. In addition, APC concludes that no
further archeological or historical work is required.
RECOMM ENDATIONS
Based on the fact that no eligible or potentially eligible cultural resources are present inside the APE
that will be affected by the proposed activity, APC recommends that construction of the Florence Community
Park proceed, as planned, with no further work and with one condition. If any unexpected historical or
archeological deposits are uncovered, work should stop and APC should be notified. The find should be
evaluated by APC archeologists in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission before construction
activity resumes.
