ABSTRACT
During January through June 2008 the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline excavation was
monitored at two locations along the pipeline route. The first location was on the eastern
edge of the floodplain of the East Fork of the Trinity River (the East Fork). The second
location was on the western edge of the floodplain of the East Fork and included two
crossings of South Mesquite Creek.
The east location was monitored for a distance of approximately 225 meters along the
south side of the Gilkey Hill site (41DL406). During the monitoring, two hand-dug pits
associated with the prehistoric site were uncovered. Work was halted and measurements
and samples were taken from both features and it was determined that they had been
emptied or abandoned when the prehistoric site was last used. Subsequent erosion had
filled each feature with 99% soil with the remaining percent of the matrix being
composed of mussel shell, animal bone, fire-cracked rock, lithic debris, and charcoal.
After the above was completed, excavation was allowed to continue and no other features
were encountered. A sample of material from Feature 1 was sent to Beta Analytic, Inc for
a radiocarbon date. That sample (Beta 241788) yielded a Measured Radiocarbon Age of
790 +/- 40 BP. The 2 Sigma Calibration indicated a date of AD 1170 to 1280.
Once the pipeline crossed the slough of the East Fork monitoring ceased as ARC
determined that the chances for encountering any cultural materials in the recent
floodplain sediments were close to zero.
The west location was monitored for a distance of approximately 550 meters. The trench
was excavated to a depth of 6.4-6.5 meters allowing good exposure of underlying
sediments and soils. Analysis of the south wall profile revealed a remarkably stable land
form with a recent Entisol covering two well developed buried soils. The first buried soil
suggests a Late Holocene age, while the second buried soil indicates a Late Pleistocene
age. There was a potential for archaeological residues at the surface of the first buried
soil, but none were encountered.
Based on the monitoring results it is determined that the potential for buried remains is
high on the east side of the East Fork. The potential for buried remains in the west
location is low.

INTRODUCTION
After AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2006) tested the Gilkey Hill site
(41DL406), monitoring during construction was recommended where the proposed
Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route would cross the southern edge of the site, east of
the slough and where the pipeline would cross South Mesquite Creek. The US Army
Corps of Engineers and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
agreed with this recommendation. The pipeline will be installed near the northwest end of
Wiser Rd in Kaufman County then proceed west, crossing the floodplain of the East
Fork, cross South Mesquite Creek twice and will end at the City of Mesquite Waste
Water Treatment Plant east of Lawson Rd (Figure 1). In early January of 2008, AR
Consultants, Inc. began monitoring the excavation of the proposed pipeline route.

defined by the Texas Antiquities Code. In addition a nationwide permit authorization was
issued by the Corps of Engineers because the pipeline corridor would temporarily impact
waters of the United States. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission will review this report as part of the Antiquities Permit process and as the
Section 106 review agency for the Corps of Engineers.
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND) and adopted by the Archeology Division of the

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The Upper Trinity River Basin, of which the East Fork is a part, lies within North Central
Texas. The basin is located within the northern portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain, and has
developed entirely over Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. Hill (1901)
was the first to record the youthful nature of the Trinity River noting that it was younger
than the through flowing rivers of the Red, Brazos, Colorado, Cimarron, and Canadian.
Most Quaternary research of the Trinity River Basin has concentrated mainly on the Elm
Fork and portions of the West Fork. The most recent research of the geologic history of
the Upper Trinity River comes from investigations conducted by Ferring during the
construction of Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring, 2000, 1994). In contrast, little is known of the
geologic history of the East Fork, except for the seminal work of Thurmond (1967). His
was a balanced approach using topography, soil maps, subsurface data, and paleontologic
evidence, and correlated his work with previous investigators. He noted three welldeveloped terraces along the East Fork of the Trinity. The majority of his research
centered on the T-2 terrace with its rich Rancholabrean faunal record. Significantly, he
used borehole data, detailed stratigraphic descriptions, and two molluscan local faunas to
demonstrate that the T-1 terrace was aggraded from about 23 to 19 ka. Insightfully, he
noted that there was a period of down cutting at 10 ka followed by rapid aggradation and
a thick buried soil under the modern floodplain.
The Upper Trinity River Basin is in the Texan biotic province where sandy alfisols
support oak-hickory forests of the Cross Timbers and clayey mollisols and vertisols
support tall and mixed grass prairies on the Blackland and Grand Praries.
The site location is mapped as a Quaternary fluvatile terrace deposit and the adjacent East
Fork floodplain is mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1988). The soil association is Trinity-Frio (Coffee, Hill and Ressel
1980:General Soils Map). The soil within the East Fork floodplain is mapped as
frequently flooded Frio and the site location is mapped as Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3
percent slopes (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 49). The B horizon for the Lewisville silty clay is
described as being 15 inches below the ground surface (Coffee et al. 1980:63).
Much of the floodplain has been farmed for the past hundred years but previously it was a
bottomland hardwood floodplain forest that would have provided a variety of plant and
animal resources from both the forest and the riparian settings in and adjacent to the East
Fork. As with most floodplain settings in large river systems, and the East Fork falls into
that category, there is annual flooding where large parts of the bottomland are under
water. This inundation can be for only a few days or flooding can last for weeks. Indeed,
inundation for longer than a few days occurred in 2007 when the area around the Gilkey
Hill site was flooded.

floods. As an
example, during the flooding of 2007, the water was in place long enough to leave
distinct high water marks on all the tree trunks in the floodplain (Figure 2). This site was
above that flooding episode. Immediately to the west of the site is an active slough that
was likely flowing when the site was occupied.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE
GILKEY HILL SITE INVESTIGATIONS
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2001) conducted an archaeological survey of a proposed
pipeline route across the floodplain of the East Fork. During the survey, a site initially
designated the School Desk site and numbered 41DL406 was recorded. Subsequent
archival research indicated that the site was actually the Gilkey Hill site which had been
recorded by R. King Harris (Harris 1942) as being in Kaufman County.
Harris (1942) referred to the site as the Gilkey Hill pottery site. He found several cooking
pits and middens containing flint chips, burned projectile points, bone and shell. Some of
the artifacts were noted on the surface. Lithic tools recovered included arrow and dart
points, drills, knives and scrapers. Polished stone artifacts include a boatstone fragment,
gorgets, a net sinker, and a grooved axe. Several deer flaking tools along with bone
needles and a mussel shell hoe were also found. In addition, several East Texas pottery
sherds were collected. Importantly, three burials or parts of burials were recovered. An

adult male skeleton and the skeleton of an individual that was possibly between 12 and
18 years old were recovered. A skull was also found.
The site covered approximately 15 acres in two locations. The larger portion of the site
consists of about 14 acres, was nearer the river and located on a small rise which extends
to the bottoms. The smaller portion of the site is about 1 acre and is located on top of the
high hill which overlooks the river and the larger portion of the site. The portion of the
site on the high hill is probably Archaic and the rest of the site appears to be Late
Prehistoric in age. Harris also mentions the presence of cooking pits and burials at the
lower site. Harris collected 292 artifacts from the site including such items as pottery,
dart points, arrow points, bone tools, metate, bifaces, a gorget, etc. from along the ridge.
Dart points consist of Gary, Ellis and Yarborough and arrow points include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno and Washita. Also, 119 pottery sherds were
recovered from the site.
In 2006, AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2006) conducted testing and backhoe
trenching at that part of the Gilkey Hill site immediately adjacent to an active slough at
the eastern edge of the East Fork floodplain. Five backhoe trenches were excavated
within the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route and 3 north of it. No burials or
cultural features were found in the trenches. In addition, 16 50x50 cm test units, 4 of
which were in the Buffalo Creek Interceptor pipeline route, were excavated. A total of
1,562 artifacts were recovered from the test units. Approximately 75 percent (1,172) of
the artifacts were recovered from the upper 40 cm which, according to a radiocarbon
date, was less than 500 years old.
Only five diagnostic tools were recovered. Three dart points (a reworked Gary, a
Yarborough that was broken during manufacture and a Keithville variety San Patrice or a
Keithville), the base of an untyped triangular arrow point and a cobble hammerstone were
found. A punctuated sherd was recovered that is similar to Caddoan sherds was the only
other diagnostic artifact recovered. One result of the testing was the discovery of charcoal
that was thought to be from a feature. Included with the charcoal were mussel shell and
some lithic debris. Further excavation and analysis determined that the charcoal was from
a burned tree and the cultural material, the mussel shell and lithic debris, had been
washed into a natural depression, along with the charcoal. These materials were collected
at approximately 35 cm below the ground surface. Testing yielded a radiocarbon date of
290+40 BP (AD 1490-1660).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Little is known about not only the geology but the cultural history along the East Fork of
the Trinity River. Since AR Consultants, Inc. already had trenched most of the proposed
pipeline route across the Gilkey Hill site, attention was focused on the area around the
slough, which may be a paleo-channel of the East Fork.

No studies of areas adjacent to and across a drainage from a site have been done in the
East Fork’s floodplain. Our contention was that work/midden areas possibly could exist
on the west side of the slough although we had no evidence to draw this conclusion.
Based upon previous experience along the East Fork (Skinner et al. 2002; Skinner and
Todd 2006; Todd 2006), it was felt that work/midden areas would be buried at least a
meter below the present ground surface of the floodplain and not on the terrace where the
site is located.
Since the proposed pipeline will come in close proximity to the part of the Gilkey Hill
site immediately adjacent to an active slough, monitoring was done on that portion
closest to the floodplain. Testing along the route east did not encounter the other part of
the site where it is thought the Archaic component is located. That part of the site has yet
to be relocated and tested and is not part of the monitoring.
Methodology
Due to the potential of encountering buried cultural deposits along those portions of the
pipeline immediately adjacent to the Gilkey Hill site on the east side of the East Fork and
along the sections of the pipeline that crosses South Mesquite Creek on the west side of
the East Fork, the authors began monitoring the excavation for the proposed Buffalo
Creek Interceptor on the east side, the 7th of January, 2008 and proceeded west for
approximately 225 m or 740 ft until the 23rd of January, 2008. Monitoring for the west
side began the 27th of February until the 6th of June and proceeded west and east for a
approximately 550 m or 1805 ft.
A perched water table caused numerous wall collapses, which slowed progress. Every
morning the first job was to empty the trench of the water that had accumulated during
the night. This involved using the trackhoe to bail the water out. In addition, at least one
pump was running the entire day to keep the water within the trench at a minimum. The
excavation of the trench, in preparation for installing the pipe, was 2.5-3 m wide. A steel
trench box was placed inside the trench to prevent the collapsing walls from hindering
installation of the pipeline. Approximate maximum depth along this section of the
pipeline was 4.2 m (14'). The trenching for this pipeline is deeper than the trenches ARC
excavated in 2005/2006 by approximately 1.5 to 2 m. This provided more data on the
subsurface geology at and around the Gilkey Hill site and the section where it crosses
South Mesquite Creek.
The potential area-of-effect for the proposed pipeline routes is the 60 foot wide corridor,
30 feet on either side of the centerline. The Buffalo Creek interceptor pipeline is to be 36
inches in diameter and buried from 7 to 14 feet below the ground surface. The
archaeologists monitored the trench excavation, took photographs and notes and
examined spoil piles.

at
various depths with the shallowest being 32 cm. These soils had massive amounts of
calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The excavation for the pipeline penetrated below that
yellowish brown horizon and found a layer of medium coarse sandy clay approximately
3.6 m below the surface. The sandy clay extended to about 4.2 m (14') where a layer of
shale was encountered. The shale caused water that was percolating down to become
trapped and move laterally. This perched water table meant the trench walls were
unstable and examining the trench from within was not possible. In the afternoon of the
eighth of January, Feature 1 was exposed during excavation (Figure 4).

Feature 1 exposed in the north wall of the pipeline trench. View north.

This feature is a hand-dug pit that was exposed on the north side of the pipeline trench.
Work was halted so measurements and samples could be taken. It is rectangular in profile
and measured 133 cm deep by 93 cm wide. The feature had been dug into the yellowish
brown, calcium carbonate rich soil zone and was very distinct. From the few artifacts that
were noted within the soil matrix inside the feature, it appears that it was empty or
emptied prior to or after the site was abandoned. It is estimated that less than ten percent
of the contents of the feature were cultural and were washed in. Once the feature was
measured, it was bisected with a trowel to determine its northern extent and to gather
more samples. The feature extended 33 cm to the north and it appeared that excavation
for the pipeline cut it almost in half. After measurements and samples were taken,
trenching continued, only after the construction crew was instructed to do their best to
preserve the feature in place when backfilling.
A sample of material from Feature 1 was sent to Beta Analytic, Inc for a radiocarbon
date. That sample (Beta 241788) yielded a Measured Radiocarbon Age of 790 +/- 40 BP.
The 2 Sigma Calibration indicated a date of AD 1170 to 1280.
After trenching only four meters west of Feature 1, another feature was encountered
(Figure 5). This hand dug pit (Feature 2) was bell-shaped and was 100 cm deep by 83 cm
wide. Its contents mirror those of Feature 1, i.e., less than ten percent is cultural material.

Feature 2 did not have samples sent for dating due to proximity and equal depth to
Feature 1.
Thus the contents of both
features had been removed
when the site was abandoned.
Feature 2 was bisected to
determine its depth to the
north. The bisecting revealed

As the pipeline trenching
approached the slough, there
was a distinct change in subsurface geology. The medium

stopped. In their place were

as a whole, but sections were. Yet the deposit(s) have not been stable enough for CaCO3
or slickensides to form. The lack of CaCO3 and slickenside formation implies sediments
of recent origin (Frederick, Trask, and Skinner 2006:34). This type of soil continued until
almost the present location of the slough. Based on the soil change it appears that the path
of the slough was more sinuous than it is today and at one time it curved around the south
side of the site.
As the pipeline trench crossed the slough, their trenching revealed discernable sections of
flood sequences (Figure 6). The deposits had no breaks, such as if another channel
bisected it or the water flow was interrupted allowing soil formation. Again, the lack of

CaCO3 or slickenside formation indicated that the deposits on the west side of the slough
are of recent origin as well. Monitoring continued for another 50 m west of the slough
then was halted due to lack of any cultural remains in the recent sediments.
South Mesquite Creek Section
The pipeline monitoring began on the 27th of February, 2008 and was completed on the
6th of June, 2008. This section of the Buffalo Creek Interceptor, on the west side of the
East Fork monitored the installation of the pipeline before it crosses South Mesquite
Creek at two locations (Figure 7).

Figure 7.

Portion of the Seagoville, 7.5' USGS map showing monitoring area.

Pipeline installation between the two creek crossings was also monitored. The monitoring
is described below in two parts. The first part discusses that part of the pipeline on the
east side of South Mesquite Creek as installation proceeded north northwest then west
towards the creek. The second part discusses that part of the pipeline as it crosses a large
meander of South Mesquite Creek proceeding east to west between the two creek
crossings.

The pipeline proceeds west from its crossing of the East Fork and just before the
channelized part of South Mesquite Creek, it turns to the north northwest (Figure 7). At
that turn the pipeline was installed on the east side of an existing pipe. Thus, the soil was
disturbed in many locations. In spite of the above disturbance(s) there were still
opportunities to examine undisturbed parts of the trench along its west side.
Observations of the soils revealed recent deposition of sediments that approached depths
of two meters. From the surface to the two meter mark the soils showed little or no
development. Below the two meter mark the soils exhibited CaCO3 development along
with Stage I slickenside development. Both of these are indicative of soil development.
Based on the above, the soil that is exhibiting development was at one time an exposed
surface soil and was in an environment where flooding was infrequent and the sediments
were in place long enough to begin development. The soil development was arrested
some time in the past when the there was a change in the floodplain environment that
facilitated frequent flooding and subsequent deposition of material to bury the soil under
two meters of sediment. This buried soil, as noted above, was stable long enough to
exhibit development, and the banks of the creek would have been a setting where
prehistoric inhabitants of the area could have utilized the resources in and around the
creek.
The monitoring of the two pipeline crossings and the floodplain began just east of the
waste water treatment plant. The pipeline was laid in a trench five meters wide and six
meters below the surface for a distance of 200 meters. Each segment of the pipe was 6.6
x .9 meters, and all but 30 meters of the pipeline were encased in cement. The south wall
of the trench contained intact soils, but the north wall had been completely destroyed by
previous pipeline construction. As the trench was excavated, the south wall was closely
monitored for soil changes and archaeological remains. Each trackhoe bucket of
sediments was visually inspected during dumping and spoil piles were inspected. Field
notes, photographs and profile descriptions were made. The profiles revealed a
remarkably stable landform with two deeply buried soils covered by a distinct Entisol
[defined as a soil that does not show any profile development] or recent soil.
Profile descriptions of the east cut bank of South Mesquite Creek and the south wall of
the trench are shown in Figure 8. The cut bank contained three buried soils, while the
south trench wall contained two buried soils. Table 1 provides descriptions of the
profiles. The Entisol covering the buried soils has all primary structure obliterated, it is
2.4 meters thick, and has been in place long enough to have an accumulation of calcium
carbonate and is defined as having an Ak horizon, with “k” being nomenclature for
calcium carbonate. While caution should always be used in assigning an age to soils with
high clay content, a minimum age of two to three hundred years is a reasonable
assumption but the soil could be older. Inspection of adjacent areas of the meander
revealed fence remnants made from split bois de arc, hog wire, barbwire, and telegraph
wire. Only the bottom three inches of the fence remnants were covered with recent
sediments, indicating that there has not been a large magnitude flood during the last 50
years. Thus, slow accumulation of sediments at this location could account for the deep
burial of the buried soils and the well-developed Entisol.

meters. In contrast, the buried soil at Profile I is between 2.5 and 2.7 meters in depth.
This increase in soil depth indicates that this soil is more cumulic than typic meaning that
sediments are accumulating at the same rate as pedogenesis. Due to safety issues, detailed
subdivision of the buried soil could not be accomplished and it is discussed as a single
unit. However, visual inspection of the trench wall indicated a distinct band of carbonate

concretions 1.5 meters from the top of the buried soil and lighter colored materials below
this band of concretions.
The vertic quality of the Akcb1 is evidenced by large crack infilled by the overlying Ck
materials. Additionally, all snail shells of Rabdotus and Polygyra have been completely
crushed. The upper portion of this profile has been heavily bioturbated by crayfish
burrows. As a result, if intact archaeological materials had been present at this location
they would have been shallowly buried in the Akcb1 horizon or just at the surface, but
turbated materials could have been found anywhere within the profile. As a result, the
contact between the buried surface and the overlying Ck horizon was closely monitored
and well as all dumped materials from this soil.

Two samples were taken from the upper surface of this buried soil. The locations of these
samples are shown in Figure 9, a cross-section of South Mesquite Creek floodplain.
Sample 1 was a collection of bone located 35 meters east of the east cut bank of the
creek. Excavation was briefly stopped, samples were taken, and work continued since no
associated archaeological materials were recovered. After the trench box was moved a
small amount of highly weathered rib fragments were found in situ 4 cm below the upper
boundary of Akcb1. Sample 1 consisted of a moderately weathered humorous with
longitudinal cracks that had removed a portion of the shaft and the distal end, and highly
weathered vertebrae, innominate, and rib fragments that were not diagnostic to species.
The bones are either bison or cow, if the overlying Entisol is at least three hundred years
old then bison is most likely. Sample 2 was a burned feature 10 meters east of sample 1
and 75 meters east of the cut bank, both samples were 35 meters south of South Mesquite
Creek. The feature was noted in the south trench wall and excavation was stopped. Since
the trench had been dug to depth, the excavation crew would not allow close inspection
of the feature due to safety concerns. The track hoe operator cross-sectioned the feature
and dumped the materials for close inspection. No fire-cracked rock, debitage, mussel
shell, or bone was associated with the feature. The feature was 30-40 cm wide and length
could not be determined since it extended into the trench wall. In the absence of
archaeological residues, it was determined that the feature may have been a naturally
burned log. Notes, samples, and photographs were taken and trenching was allowed to
continue.
Parent material for the Akcb1 soil is derived from two sources both of which are alluvial
deposits of the East Fork. To the west, South Mesquite Creek and two of its tributaries
have dissected T2 terrace formations (Thurmond, 1967) creating fairly well developed
floodplains throughout the drainage. At the large meander location of the pipeline recent
East Fork alluvial floodplain deposits have been reworked down to a deeply buried
surface (Bkcb2, Profile 2). However, the deepest buried surface may represent basal
deposits of the T-2 terrace formation.
In the absence of radiometric dating of sediments or artifacts, caution is exercised in
assigning an age to the buried Akcb1 horizon. However, using Ferring’s (1994) research
of the Upper Trinity River Basin some comparisons can be made with the West Fork soil.
Since this is a thick cumulic soil on the floodplain, sedimentation probably began in the
Late Holocene, approximately 4,500 years ago, during a period of moderate to rapid
alluviation of streams through out Texas as the result of increased precipitation. This
period of alluviation was followed by a period of stability leading to soil formation
approximately 2,000 years ago. Based on Ferring’s model and the characteristics of the
buried soil itself a minimum age of 2,000 years is reasonable, but the soil could be much
older based on the degree of development and deep burial.
The deepest buried surface, the Bkcb2 horizon (Figure 8) most likely dates to the
Terminal Pleistocene, 14-11 thousand years ago. This hypothesis is based on deep burial,
soil development, and comparison with the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001). The
Terminal Pleistocene was a dry period with extensive surface stability that allowed for

extensive soil development. The buried soil is a truncated Bkcb horizon based on
structure, color, and presence of large CaCO3 and FeMn concretions. It is extremely well
developed especially in terms of structure, peds range from 10-20 cm with thick
slickensides and translocated clays in ped interiors. It is mottled 10YR6/1 and 10YR7/8
indicating a fluctuating water table prior to deep burial. The Clovis surface at Aubrey is
7-9 meters below the current floodplain, and Bkcb2 horizon is buried 6 meters below the
current flood plain. Excavation of this soil horizon was closely monitored for faunal
remains that would support a great age for these deposits, none were observed.
CONCLUSIONS
The lack of features, artifact concentrations, and diagnostics means the pipeline was
installed at the far southern edge of the site. Although there is no data as to where other
features or associated artifacts could be found, it is likely that the Gilkey Hill site does
not extend further south than the two features found during this excavation. Considering
that this site is fairly extensive, based on the work by Harris (1942), this site is potentially
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. If other pipelines are to
be installed within the easement they should be monitored by an archaeologist because of
the potential for encountering more features and possibly burials.
The South Mesquite Creek segment contained no archaeological remains and no further
investigation is warranted. The effort did contribute to the understanding of the geologic
history of a small tributary to the East Fork. The geologic history revealed a remarkably
stable land form from the Terminal Pleistocene to the present.

RECOMMENDATIONS
This project was to monitor the excavation of a pipeline as it crossed the southern edge of
the Gilkey Hill site on the east side of the East Fork and where the pipeline crossed two
sections of South Mesquite Creek on the west side of the East Fork. It is recommended
that if any other pipelines be installed on the east side of the East Fork that they be placed
south of the new line in the vicinity of the Gilkey Hill site if at all possible. Since
construction is planned within the current easements of this pipeline, additional testing
and monitoring will be required in this area north of the new pipeline in the vicinity of
the Gilkey Hill site.
Additionally, there should be no further impact of any kind in and around the site proper
because of the potential for disturbing artifacts and features associated with the Gilkey
this site. This site is also potentially eligible for inclusion into the National Register of
Historic Places. Further archaeological work in the form of non-disturbing activities such
as magnetometer or ground penetrating radar is recommended as their use could help
define site boundaries and locate features. No additional investigation is warranted within
existing NTMWD easements west of the East Fork.
