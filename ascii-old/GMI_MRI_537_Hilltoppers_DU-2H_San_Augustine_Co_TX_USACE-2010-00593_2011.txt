EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Hilltoppers DU
#2H well pad and associated lease road, approximately 3.7 miles southeast of Chireno in western
San Augustine County, Texas. This cultural resources investigation was conducted by GeoMarine, Inc., under contract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc.
The purpose of this document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources
in partial fulfillment of obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended, and other cultural resources legislation.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
screened shovel tests. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 23 November and 21
December 2010, and 17 January 2011. One prehistoric archeological site, 41SA312, was
identified. The site extends beyond the project area; however, the portion of the site within the
project area is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places. Construction of the Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad and its associated lease road will have
no adverse effect any significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as
proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended. In the unlikely event
that any cultural materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction, use,
or maintenance of the well pad, all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical
Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should be notified of the discovery.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (project
number 30563.02.09), under contract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO
Energy, Inc., for the proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad location (U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers [USACE] Project No. SWF 2010-00539). The proposed site is located on a terrace of
the Attoyac River in western San Augustine County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed well pad
will be constructed 0.3 mile (mi; 0.5 kilometer [km]) east of Farm to Market Road (FM) 1196,
approximately 3.7 mi (6 km) southeast of Chireno, Texas. The Hilltoppers DU #2H project area
consists of a 5.4-acre well pad and approximately 720 feet (ft; 220 meters [m]) of lease road
right-of-way (ROW). The landscape encompassing the proposed project area consists of private
property supporting second-growth mixed-hardwood forest, areas of managed silviculture, energy
resources extraction infrastructure, and pasture.
The purpose of these investigations was to assist Titanium Environmental Services with the
management of cultural resources as delineated under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; and the
Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. Initial
fieldwork for this project was conducted on 23 November 2010 by Geo-Marine Project
Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Bethany Oliver. Additional
fieldwork was conducted on 21 December 2010 with the assistance of Erin King and 17 January
2011 with the assistance of Brett Lang to more adequately assess site 41SA312. Melissa Green
served as the project Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The proposed project area is located in western San Augustine County in East Texas, situated in
the Southern Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). The soils of the
region are derived from in situ weathering of the underlying Wilcox Formation (Griffith 2006).
This area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943). Often
referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960), this region once supported a diverse variety of
flora and fauna.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
San Augustine County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas.
This region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the stratified shales and
sandstones of the Wilcox Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is
located within the Southern Tertiary Uplands subregion of the South Central Plains in the Neches
River Basin. The proposed project area is situated on terrace above the Attoyac River (Figure 2).
The elevation of the project area ranges 63 to 64 m (207 to 210 ft) above mean sea level with
slopes of 0â2 percent.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is within the Neches River basin, on a terrace of Attoyac Bayou. Numerous
unnamed, small-order drainages flow from the uplands along Attoyac Bayou. The proposed
project area is located on a terrace between an unnamed tributary of Curry Creek to the northwest
and an unnamed tributary of Granberry Branch, both tributaries of the Attoyac River, to the south
(see Figure 2). The Hilltoppers DU #2H project area is located approximately 806 km (5.5 mi)
from the current flood pool of Sam Rayburn Reservoir and approximately 22.5 km (14 mi) from
the confluence of the Attoyac River with the Angelina River.

SOILS
The area is situated across one soil series and one soil complex (Table 1, see Figure 2). The soils
mapped in the project area are primarily moderately permeable fine sandy loams. Soil textures
range from loams to fine sandy loams. These soils are derived from in situ weathering of the
underlying clastic and carbonate bedrock of the Eocene-age Wilcox Formation. All information
regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized and summarized from information
supplied by the Soil Conservation Service (Griffith 2010) and the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (2010).

Fine sandy loam to loam, well drained, moderately permeable

Bernaldo Series
Bernaldo soils are classified as fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Glossic Paleudalfs.
These soils are well drained, formed in loamy alluvial deposits. The surface layer typically
consists of a brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, underlain by an E horizon of pale brown
(10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam to a depth that varies from approximately 15 36 centimeters (cm;
6 14 inches [in]). The E horizon is underlain by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam Bt
horizon with few redoximorphic features.

Alazan-Besner Complex
The Alazan-Besner complex consists of areas of comingled soils composed primarily of the
Alazan series and the Besner series. Both series are loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aquic
Glossudalfs; however, the Alazan series soils tend to be more fine-grained (i.e., loam), and
Besner series soils are slight more coarse (i.e., fine sandy loam). This complex tends to have a
brown (10YR 4/3) to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) A horizon over a brown (10YR 5/3) to pale
brown (10YR 6/3) E horizon underlain by a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) or reddish yellow (7.5YR
6/8) Bt/E horizons.

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine, Angelina, and Neches rivers
support a diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous
5

aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae) and 104
species of freshwater fish (Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or
historically, include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus
scrofa), black bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Elmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Shortleaf (Pinus echinata), longleaf (P. palustris), and
loblolly pine (P. taeda) are the three native species of southern yellow pine. Uplands may harbor
certain hardwoods, such as post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
Bottomlands near rivers and other major drainages are most often dominated by native
bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q. nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q.
nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N.
sylvatica), and sweetgum. Dense understory growth may often be found in forest areas in the
form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica
cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum
rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive species such as Chinese tallow (Triadica
sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), and soda apple (Solanum viarum) have
become well established throughout the Pineywoods as well. Much of the general area is
managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 123 cm (48 in), primarily as rainfall
distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature recorded in nearby
Nacogdoches, Texas, is around 25 degrees Celsius (Â°C; 77Â°Fahrenheit [F]), and the average
winter temperature is 13Â°C (56Â°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0Â°C (32Â°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The following chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native
American cultural chronology and Euro-American history of Northeast Texas. Given the size of
the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this
chapter must necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the
information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas
provides a historic context for the evaluation of site 41SA312. This synopsis draws from
previous summaries by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985, 1990),
and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). A generalized cultural sequence for the Northeast Texas
culture area is outlined in Table 2.

Paleoindian (Â±10,000â7000 B.C.)
Evidence suggests human migration into the northeastern Texas region by approximately 10,000â
9500 B.C., although the exact timing and nature of the arrival is the subject of some dispute. In
Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile point styles, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988:17). Unfortunately, however, few Paleoindian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and those that have
received any sort of systematic excavation are scarce.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation,
drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. The people of this period are often characterized as living in small bands of highly mobile
hunter-gatherers, specializing in the hunting of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. For instance,
a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the broad

distribution of Paleoindian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal
lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story
1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna by Paleoindians in
the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar species in Northeast Texas
between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has
resulted in the popular conclusion that âbig game huntingâ was part of the Paleoindian
subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association between a Clovis point
and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support this likelihood,
increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that Paleoindian
groups were less dependent upon âbig game huntingâ than has been assumed in the past. A more
accurate view of Paleoindian life likely includes use of a much wider array of resources (Ferring
1989).
The late Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate point styles that appear to be part of a
more western or âplains-derivedâ subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes
Dalton and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389â391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed âheavy, woodworking tool,â to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleoindian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
8

in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic (Â±7000â200 B.C.)
With the end of Pleistocene glaciation, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop
into populations of efficient hunter-gatherers exploiting localized resource bases. This period,
and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become termed the âArchaicâ period.
Representing a significant period of time (approximately 6,800 years), this period is characterized
by gradual changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. Archaic
populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and gatherers with more limited
geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples. At the present time, there is no
evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic period in Texas, although this
is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates on
the basis of cross-correlation with more confidently dated and stratified sites in surrounding areas.
Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this
portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985,
1990). Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later
material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981). General trends have been proposed that characterize
the Archaic period in Northeast Texas as (1) increasing development of complex settlement
system, (2) increasing population size and density, (3) increasing sedentism, and (4) development
of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988:17; Story 1985:52). Despite these changes, however,
no evidence of any level of horticulture has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site
(Perttula 1988:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food
production were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347â349; Watson
1988).

Early Ceramic/Woodland (200 B.C.âA.D. 800)
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.âA.D. 800)ârepresenting the introduction of ceramics into
the Northeast Texas regionâis generally not well defined and is largely identified by similarities
in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche Maline tradition north of the Red River
(recent overviews that provide good information for this period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic artifacts consist of coarse plainware
ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile points. The ceramics
generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the wide range of temporal and
spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or more undefined varieties of
that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the remains of the Early Ceramic
period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to Schambachâs (1982:188) Fourche
Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities to Fourche Maline, however, no Early
9

Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas portion of the Great Bend. The few that
are known in East Texas occur in the southern Sabine and Neches river basins around the Toledo
Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story 1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48;
on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana) and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites
(Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of such evidence in Northeast Texas
leaves open the question of whether or not this area was undergoing the same processes of
cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development of burial mound use elsewhere
(see Perttula 1988:18; Story 1990).

Formative (A.D. 800â1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000â1200)
The Formative (A.D. 800â1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000â1200) periods in the Great BendNeches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Conversely, in the Cypress Creek region, Caddo
occupation of the area is well documented from ca. A.D. 800 to the period of historic contact. For
detailed cultural and chronological information, consult Thurmondâs (1990) treatise on the
archeology of the Cypress Creek Basin.
The Formative and Early Caddo periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from the Coles Creek culture to the
east and appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new
characteristics (Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan
arrow points), new ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode
of vessel decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize,
led to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during those periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988:18â19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas,
including the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
known as Hudnall-Pirtle, site 41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site
with six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddo
component of this site likely indicates an immigrant group from the middle Sabine River area,
possibly the Bivins-Flanagan area, arriving prior to ca. A.D. 900 (Story 1990:325).

10

Middle Caddo (A.D. 1200â1400)
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200â1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data largely from C. B.
Mooreâs excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities from
the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who were
accompanied by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26). This phase was centered
in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas also fall
within its peripheral influence. Haley phase components are recognized at the Hatchel site in
Bowie County (Davis 1970:44). Other Haley components, including the Cabe Mounds site
(Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site (Cliff et al. 1997), are known in the area. Coker
Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based on radiocarbon dates and a
reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula et al. 1997:17â20). Despite its
presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was apparently most fully elaborated in the
Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Perttula and
Rogers 2007), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, and Tyson (41SY92) in
the Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the
EarlyâMiddle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24â25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
burial sites, and the larger centers were important civic-ceremonial areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granary structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex sociopolitical extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to the late A.D. 1200s, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the eastâwest Caddo Trace and the
northâsouth Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to the George C. Davis site, which was essentially
abandoned by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24â29).

Late Caddo (A.D. 1400â1680)
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400â1680) includes the conclusion of the prehistoric period and
the initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish entrada
apparently entered Northeast Texas ca. 1542, and the latter part of this period appears to have
overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and traders
into northeastern Texas. Numerous archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, several of which overlap their spheres of influence into the Sabine River. The
Bossier phase, though centered on the Great Bend region of Arkansas, has been identified in the
Sabine River valley (Dieste et al. 1985:2â20; Gadus and Howard 1988:31). The Titus phase
appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast Texas Pineywoods
and post-oak savanna. The Bossier, Titus, and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by
small hamlets or farmsteads that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting
agriculturalists. These farmsteads are apparently characterized by a limited number of structures
11

and a small family cemetery (see Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks
1961; Perttula 1988; Wormser 1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more
permanent suprahousehold sites, including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which
served to integrate the scattered households into a unified social group.

Historic Native American Period (A.D. 1680â1860)
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680â1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding, by
RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, of the short-lived French colony Fort Saint Louis on the
Texas coast and ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing
decades of the seventeenth century, French explorers, such as Henri de Tonti, Jean Baptiste Le
Moyne de Bienville, and Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, traveled through the upper Red River
valley and made contact with the Native Americans residing in the area. The primary Native
American groups inhabiting the Great BendâNeches/Angelina region at that time consisted of
Caddoan speakers, presumably descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far
back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan populations were divided very generally into the Kadohadacho
in the Great Bend area north of the Sulphur River and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina River
region south of the Sabine River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groupsâthe Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoches, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo TerÃ¡n de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the earlier Hernando de Soto entrada (cf., Smith
1989).
The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainai,
Nabedache, Nacogdoche, Nasoni, Nadaco, Neches, Nacono, Nechaui, and Nacao, but
membership apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization
pertaining especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a
relatively weak social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate
chiefs of each tribe and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males
inherited these offices, females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the
female line.
RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. By the late 1600s, a
regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In 1690, the Spanish
established missions in the Hasinai areaâSan Francisco de los Tejas and SantÃ­simo Nombre de
MarÃ­aâbut abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to comply with Spanish
attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46â49). In response to St. Denisâs 1714
French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were established in 1716âa
12

second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River, and two in the main
villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n, likely on the Angelina River)
and the Nacogdoches (Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La NaÃ±a) (Swanton
1942:46â49). In 1779, a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River moved into the
Nacogdoches area, and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the Deshazo site.
These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to emigrate westward to the
prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control of Louisiana,
only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase. The area
was now open for American immigration, which effectively forced the remaining Hasinai to
move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in
1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71â88).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American settlement and development of Northeastern Texas is discussed extensively in
other sources and will therefore not be summarized in this report. For more extensive treatments
of this period in North Texas, see works by Peter and Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and 7), Peter et al.
(1991:Appendix J), and Freeman (1990).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
proposed project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and shovel test excavations undertaken using the field methods
described in this chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on
National Register of Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Â§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the THC was consulted. Review of THC records indicated
that two previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius
of the project area. G. E. Arnold, a research archeologist at the University of Texas at Austin,
conducted early archeological reconnaissance surveys of large portions of East Texas under the
auspices of the Works Progress Administration from 1930â1941, including the Attoyac valley in
1940. Later archeological reconnaissance survey in 1948 by R. L. Stephenson for the National
Park Serviceâs River Basin Survey revisited may of the sites along the Attoyac River that Arnold
had previously recorded (Stephenson 1948). Although numerous sites have been recorded along
the Attoyac River, only one site is within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the Hilltoppers DU #2H project area.
Site 41SA61, a probable late prehistoric habitation site initially recorded by Arnold in 1941, is
located on a terrace adjacent to the Attoyac River approximately 1.4 km (0.8 mi) from the
proposed project area. A site revisit by Stephenson in 1948 indicated that, although prehistoric
ceramics and lithic debitage were evident across the surface of the site, no temporally or
14

culturally diagnostic artifacts were found. Based on the results of previous surveys in the Attoyac
River drainage, the project area was considered to have a moderate to high probability of
containing prehistoric sites.
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These materials include
historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record cultural resources
such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of
these historic records and previously recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the
area has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records,
however, indicates that the substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of
the historic landscape. Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the
nineteenth century, but settlement increased markedly in San Augustine County during the
twentieth century. The Antioch Church and cemetery are located on the eastern side of FM 1196
approximately 1.6 km (1 mi) north of the proposed project area; however, few other structures or
features are evident on historic period maps and aerial photographs. Therefore, the project area
was considered to have at a moderate probability of containing historic sites.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad project area had a moderate to high probability of containing
cultural materials. Given the amount of groundcover, the recent silviculture, and the nature of
archeological sites in the region, it was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would
not be conducive to visual inspection, and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be
necessary to adequately survey the area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30â40 cm (11.8â15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated systematically across the proposed
project area to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft), to the extent of Holocene deposits, or until an obstruction
such as the water table or fragipan was encountered. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXTâ¢ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process. Areas that were inundated, waterlogged, or completely disturbed by features
such as roads, stock ponds, or other construction were systematically investigated and
documented, but not shovel-tested. Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g.,
cutbanks), were also examined for cultural materials as they were encountered during survey.
This cultural resources survey resulted in the investigation of approximately 6.1 acres for this
project.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The definition of a âsiteâ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural artifacts or features of at least
two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2area [0.1 acre]); the extent of the surface material is then defined as the site boundary. When
artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally
positive excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation
shovel tests are excavated to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and
delineate a site are typically placed at intervals of 5â10 m (16.4â32.8 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in
each of the cardinal directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or
the project area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are
encountered and contain at least five artifacts of at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is
then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests and, if present, surface artifact scatter.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas
Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL)
for a site trinomial designation and to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
database. Conversely, the discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are
considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location
and content; likewise, modern material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not
considered a site, with only location and content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Isolated artifacts are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of
their failure to meet site definition and their lack of significance in contributing important
information to the archeological record.

Artifact Treatment and Analysis
All artifacts recovered during this survey were briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by
provenience in the field. Upon arrival at the Geo-Marine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas,
artifacts were cleaned, inventoried, analyzed, and catalogued (see Appendix A). Each artifact
was thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its function or
role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [aâd]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a âhistoric
16

property.â âThe term âeligible for inclusion in the National Registerâ includes both properties
formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet
National Register listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2 [e]). Subsequent to the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions, the following four criteria for eligibility
are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present
in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent
the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR Part
60.4 (aâd)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management
considerations and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the
final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that two previous cultural resources investigations have been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. One prehistoric archeological site,
41SA61, has been documented within the search radius, and the Antioch Church and cemetery
are located approximately 1.6 km (0.8 mi) northeast of the proposed project area. Archival
research focused on the historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the project area.
Examination of the 1937 Angelina National Forest 1:126,000-scale topographic map, the 1942
USACE Chireno 1:125,000-scale topographic map, the 1958 United States Geological Survey
(USGS) Broaddus topographic map, and USGS aerial photography do not indicate any historic
period structures in or near the proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H project area.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad location was intensively investigated to determine
the presence of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual
reconnaissance and the excavation of screened shovel tests. All areas not intensively investigated
due to prior disturbance were documented. Approximately 6.1 acres were investigated and 59
shovel tests were excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3). These 40-cmdiameter (15.8-in) screened shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels across the
proposed project area, with the final location of each excavation situated to avoid low-lying,
inundated, or disturbed areas and in favor of microtopographic rises and undisturbed contexts,
when possible.

18

The Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad location is situated on a terrace of the Attoyac River. The
topography of the project area is generally level, with some undulations, yielding
microtopographic rises (Figure 4) and low-lying, seasonally inundated areas (Figure 5).
Vegetation consists of areas of managed pine silviculture, second-growth forest of mixed
hardwoods and coniferous species, and pasture (see Figure 3). The northern portion of the
proposed well pad and the southern portion of the proposed lease road consisted of wetland areas
and were therefore not intensively surveyed. Soils within the project area typically consisted of a
thin (5â20-cm [2â8-in] thick) brown (10YR 4/3â5/3) silt loam surface layer overlying yellowish
brown (10YR 5/6) to brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sandy loam. A strong brown (7.5YR 4/6,
5/6, or 5/8) clay loam was usually encountered at a depth of 60â80 cm (23.6â31.5 in). Positive
shovel tests were encountered along the northern portion of the proposed lease road (see Figure
3). Artifacts were recovered in a total of 23 shovel tests. These shovel tests yielded artifacts
indicative of a prehistoric camp or short-term habitation site. Based on the recovery of these
artifacts, site 41SA312 was recorded.

SITE 41SA312
Site 41SA312 consists primarily of chipped stone artifacts recovered in 23 shovel tests along the
proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H lease road (Figure 6). The site occupies a subtle rise on a gently
undulating terrace of the Attoyac River (Figure 7). Site 41SA312 encompasses approximately
0.76 acres, measuring roughly 155 m (506 ft) northeast-to-southwest by 85 m (279 ft) northwestto-southeast at an elevation of approximately 64 m (210 ft) amsl. The site is covered by managed

pine silviculture with little surface visibility. An existing access road and drainage culvert
intersect the northwestern portion of the site (Figure 8). Limited shovel testing was conducted to
the northwest of the existing access road to determine if the site extended in that direction.
Positive shovel tests were encountered northwest of the existing access road, but the site
boundary was not fully delimited in that area because it was beyond the extent of the Hilltoppers
DU #2H project area. Recent construction of the Blue Raiders DU #1H well pad precluded fully
defining the site boundary to the east.
Soil profiles examined during shovel testing indicate that the site is situated on an area of dark
yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) to brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam overlying strong brown (7.5YR 5/6)
to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam (Figures 9 and 10). A reddish yellow (7.5YR
7/6) mottled with a strong brown (7.6YR 5/8) fine sandy loam layer was common along the
margin of the landform, while a very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam layer was more
prevalent on the landform proper. A reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) clay loam was usually
encountered by a depth of 60â80 cm (23.6â31.5 in).
The prehistoric artifact assemblage encountered at site 41SA312 (n=40; Table 3) consists
primarily of chert and silicified wood debitage (n=37) from the manufacture and maintenance of
chipped stone tools. One large fragment of silicified wood recovered from a depth of 30 cm (11.8
in) in ST 8 appears to have served as a core but also displays limited evidence of use as a
pounding implement, perhaps from use as a hammerstone. A large piece of silicified wood
debitage in ST 46 shows evidence of retouch along one margin, perhaps from use as an expedient
cutting or scraping tool. One symmetrical sandstone grinding or pounding tool was also
recovered from a depth of 42 cm (16.5 in) in ST 46. This artifact most likely represents a

hammerstone for stone tool manufacture. The majority of artifacts recovered from site 41SA312
were within the upper 20 cm (8 in) of the surface (n=22; 55% of the total assemblage). A lesser
amount of the total artifact assemblage (n=9; 23%) was recovered between 20 and 40 cm (8 and
16 in) below surface (bs). Few artifacts were recovered below a depth of 40 cm (16 in), with five
artifacts (12%) recovered between 40 and 60 cm bs (16 and 24 in bs) and four artifacts (10%)
recovered between 60 and 80 cm bs (24 and 32 in bs). A single historic artifact, a piece of amber
bottle glass recovered between 0 and 20 cm bs (0 and 8 in bs) in ST 39, is considered intrusive to
the site and does not represent a substantial historic period component. No culturally or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered at site 41SA312, nor were any significant
artifact concentrations, intact features, or organic-rich deposits.
25

Site 41SA312 likely represents a short-term or intermittently occupied camp. Given the siteâs
minimal, fragmentary, and redundant artifact content, and the lack of culturally or temporally
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features, the portion of site 41SA312 within the project area is
considered to have little research potential. As such, this portion of the site is not likely to
preserve information important to understanding prehistoric settlement and subsistence strategies
in the Pineywoods of East Texas. Thus, it is recommended that the portion of 41SA312 within
the Hilltoppers DU #2H project area is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The site has been documented and recorded with TARL. No further
investigations are recommended for the portion of site 41SA312 within the project area as it is
presently defined.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within
the proposed Hilltoppers DU #2H project area and to provide adequate and relevant information
for use in the management of cultural resources. One previously recorded archeological site,
prehistoric site 41SA61, is located approximately 1.4 km (0.8 mi) north of the project area. The
Antioch Church and cemetery are located on the eastern side of FM 1196 approximately 1.6 km
(1 mi) north of the proposed project area. The proposed project will have no adverse effect on
41SA61 or the Antioch Church and its associated cemetery. This intensive pedestrian survey
resulted in examination of 6.1 acres and the excavation of 59 shovel tests. Through the course of
these investigations, site 41SA312, a prehistoric hunting camp, was located and documented.
Site 41SA312 has been adversely affected by ground-disturbing activities associated with modern
silviculture and road construction. The artifact assemblage associated with this site is sparse and
not diagnostic to any specific prehistoric cultural group or temporal period. Given the minimal
information potential associated with this site, it is unlikely that it will provide any additional
information relevant to understanding prehistoric settlement and subsistence patterns in the
Pineywoods of East Texas. Thus, the portion of site 41SA312 within the Hilltoppers DU #2H
project area is recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under criteria
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The portion of site 41SA312 outside of the project area is of
unknown eligibility because it was not fully investigated. The location of this site has been
recorded with TARL. No further investigations are recommended within the proposed project
area at this site. Given the lack of significant cultural resources in the proposed project area, it is
recommended that construction of the Hilltoppers DU #2H well pad be allowed to proceed. No
historic properties (i.e., cultural resources eligible for inclusion in or listed on the NRHP) will be
affected by the construction of this well pad or its associated lease road. Provided the project is
carried out as proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended within the
proposed project area. In the unlikely event that any cultural materials are inadvertently
discovered at any point during the construction, use, or maintenance of the Hilltoppers DU #2H
well pad, all work should cease immediately and the THC and Fort Worth District of the USACE
should be notified of the discovery.
