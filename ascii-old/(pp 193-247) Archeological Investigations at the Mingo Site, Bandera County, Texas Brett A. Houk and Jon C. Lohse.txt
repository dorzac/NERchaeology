Archeological Investigations at the Mingo Site,
Bandera County, Texas
Brett A. Houk and Jon C. Lohse

ABSTRACT
In the summer of 1990, members of the Texas Archeological Society
conducted excavations at the Mingo Site (41BN101) in the S abinal Canyon as part
of their summer field school. An initial survey of the site during the previous
summer (Maslyk 1990,1993) indicated the presence of Transitional Archaic to
Late Prehistoric occupations associated with a small bumed rock midden. Excavations confirmed a Late Prehistoric component and provided evidence of an
earlier Transitional Archaic component. The artifacts recovered, including Late
Prehistoric Sabinai, Edwards, and Scallom arrowpoints, as well as Transitional
Archaic Frio and Fairland dart points, supported the preliminary conclusions.

DEDICATION
This paper is dedicated to the memory of Kenneth Mingo (shown below with
Mrs. Mingo in a photograph by the authors). His enthusiasm and daily presence at
the excavations enriched the field school experience of everyone working at the
Mingo site (41BN101). He will be missed.

INTRODUCTION

During the 1989 Summer Field School of The University of Texas at Austin,
Paul Maslyk led a student survey team that recorded and mapped the Mingo site
(41BN101), about 2.5 km (1.5 miles) from the junction of Mill Creek and the
Sabinal River in southern Bandera County. The team made an inventory of the
landowners’ surface collection, which included chipped stone artifacts, several Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints, and Late to Transitional Archaic dart points. Because there
was apparently a Late Prehistoric component associated with the midden, the site,
which is a small burned rock midden, was excavated during the 1990 Texas
Archeological Society Summer Field School.
Under the direction of Dr. Thomas R. Hester, who was assisted by several
graduate students from The University of Texas at Austin, the field school crew
excavated several prehistoric and historic sites, and recorded and mapped other
sites in their general survey of the valley. Excavations at the Mingo site were
directed by the authors, Houk and Lohse; Roy Dickinson, of the Texas Archeological Society, was area supervisor.
ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
A great many prehistoric sites have been recorded and excavated in the Sabinal
River valley, a large number of which have one or more burned rock middens. For
most of these, including the Mingo site, the typology-based Central Texas chronology established by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954) provided the temporal framework. This chronology has undergone revisions and additions (Suhm and Jelks
1962; Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981; Turner and Hester 1985), including division into
categories based, in part, on technological changes made by the indigenous
population as they adapted to their environment. These categories are the Paleoindian
period, which lasted roughly from 9200 B.C. to 6000 B.C.; the Archaic period,
which is further divided into Early (6000 B.C.-2500 B.C.), Middle (2500 B.C.1000 B.C.), Late (11300 B.C.-300 B.C.), and Transitional (300 B.C.-A.D. 700)
phases; the Late Prehistoric period, which lasted from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1600; and,
f’mally, the Historic period, which covers the time since European settlement
(Turner and Hester 1985). Prewitt (1974) has called the Transitional Archaic phase
the Terminal Archaic.
Within the past several years, many investigations of burned rock middens
in Central and South Central Texas have been made (see Prewitt 1991), and some
middens excavated in the Sabinal Canyon in Uvalde and Bandera counties have
helped clarify the formational processes of these enigmatic cultural features.
In the 1930s to 1940s, The University of Texas at Austin and the Works
Progress Administration (WPA) jointly excavated sites in the region, many of
which had Late Prehistoric components (files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory [TARL]). However, they drew few conclusions from this
work, except for Huskey’s classification of middens into types A and B,

Houk & Lohse ~ The Mingo Site

according to size and types of projectile points (Huskey 1935). Type B sites
yield Late Prehistoric arrowpoints ("bird points"), and each generally has only
one burned rock midden (Huskey 1935). In the vicinity of Sabinal Canyon the
Heard Schoolhouse site, 41UV86 (Goode 1991), and the Mingo site fall into
this category. Other burned rock midden sites, such as the Blue Hole site
(41UV159, Mueggenborg 1991), La Jim (Hester 1971; Huebner 1990), the
Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins 1990), and 41BN8, in southern Bandera County
(Patterson 1974) have both Late Prehistoric and substantial Archaic associations,
and some even have Paleoindian components.
The 1989 Summer Field School of The University of Texas at Austin and the
1990 TAS Field School, both under the direction of Thomas R. Hester, did perhaps
the most intensive work on burned rock middens in the area, at the Smith site
(41UV 132), La Jim (41UV21), and at other sites in the canyon (Hester 1990; Houk
and Lohse 1990; Maslyk 1990; Mueggenborg 1990, 1991; Smith and Hageman
1990). Not all the sites excavated were exclusively Late Prehistoric, but the
evidence from those that had Late Prehistoric components can add a great deal to
the understanding of the formation processes of Huskey’s (1935) type B sites
(Goode 1991).
GEOGRAPHICAL SE’IWING
The Mingo site (41BN101)is in southern Bandera County, just east of the
Sabinal River (Figure 1). The site is on an alluvial terrace formed by depositional
action of the Sabinal River and Mill Creek, one of its major tributaries some 200
meters to the south. The Sabinal River valley is in the southern part of the Edwards
Plateau, just north of the Balcones Escarpment (Mear 1953). The erosional action
of the Sabinal River has produced a fertile valley that has cut through the Cretaceous
limestones that cap the Edwards Plateau and into limestones of the Glen Rose
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1982; Mear 1953; Hensell et al. 1977).
In some places, the hills rise some 60 to 90 meters (200 to 300 feet) above the Sabinal
(Mear 1953).
This part of the Edwards Plateau is a well-dissected plateau where narrow
ridges and small mesas--remnants of the original plateau surface--remain
(Hensell et al. 1977). This diverse geographic region supports a wide variety of
flora and fauna. Blair (1950) includes the Sabinal River valley in the Balconian
biotic province, in which Mexican cedar (or juniper), Texas oak, and stunted
live oak trees abound. Other less populous species are interspersed in the generally thick undergrowth of the region, which includes prickly pear cactus, pecan, elm, and mesquite trees, and native grasses such as side-oats grama, hairy
grama, Indian grass, buffalo grass, and several varieties of wild rye (Maslyk
1993; Van Auken et al. 1981). Some of the animals seen near the Mingo site are
white-tailed deer, raccoons, opossums, jackrabbits, and many birds, rodents,
lizards, and snakes.

THE SITE
The surface of most of the Mingo site area (Figure 2) has been heavily disturbed
by the bulldozing of small cedar and oak trees and by the burning of the cleared
underbrush. The extent of subsurface disturbance resulting from these activities was
not precisely determined. Furthermore, the earth from a 10-to-30-cm-deep trench
excavated by a bulldozer before our work began was deposited in a single mound,
some 2 to 3 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters high (Figure 3). As a result of this
clearing, the plants in the immediate vicinity consist of only a few stunted oaks and
junipers, a single black walnut tree, and a carpet of native grasses.
Another probable contribution to disturbance at the site is a shallow seasonal
wash that runs along the west boundary of the site and drains into Mill Creek (Figure
4). According to the landowners, this intermittent gully carries water only every
three to four years, but may have been responsible for surface erosion of the site
since its abandonment.

EXCAVATION METHODOLOGY
Before the start of the TAS Field School in June1990, a crew of students
from The University of Texas at Austin mapped the site, using a transit, and
laid out north-south and east-west base lines for excavation units. The first units
laid out (Figure 5) were intended to determine the extent of the site and the
midden and to identify, if possible, the txansitional zone between its Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. All subsequent units were opened in
accordance with this excavation strategy.
A 2-by-2-meter grid was laid out; units were identified by the coordinates
representing the distance of the southeast comer of the unit from the datum point
(N100 W100). Each 2-meter unit was subdivided into quadrants, designated
according to location in the unit, e.g., N100/W100/NW, which allowed the excavators to maintain horizontal control. Further control in the units was assured
by measuring the distance of each significant artifact or feature from the north
and east walls of the unit, thereby establishing coordinates that indicated the
exact horizontal location of the artifact or feature in relation to the datum point.
Members of the TAS ;:Jeld School arrived at the site several days later and
started excavating units in arbitrary 10-cm levels, except for a 1-by-4-meter test

trench to the south, which was excavated according to natural stratigraphy in
order to determine the extent of the burned rock deposit. In order to maintain
vertical control, for each 2-by-2-meter unit a starting elevation was established,
which was tied into the site’s contour map by transit. The elevations of the unit
floors, as well as all significant artifacts and features, were measured from the
starting elevation of each unit. In this way it was possible to compare absolute
vertical proveniences of units regardless of their starting elevations.
All material excavated from the units was passed through a quarter-inch
screen; chert debitage and snails were saved and bagged according to unit and
level. Burned rocks were saved and weighed when work was fmished in the level
where they were found. Formal artifacts such as projectile points, and pieces of
chipped or ground stone that showed signs of use, were cataloged separately
and assigned unique item numbers (see "Artifacts," below).
STRUCTURE OF THE SITE
Excavation and surface inspection have shown that the burned rock midden is
small (Figure 2) and has less burned rock than have larger middens such as the Blue
Hole site (Mueggenborg 1991 ). In N92/W 120/SW the midden reached its maximum

thickness of 50 cm, with a burned rock density of nearly 600 kg/m3. A 4-by- 1-meter
trench was extended southward from this unit to determine the southern limits and
thickness of the burned rock deposit. The trench was excavated in natural levels;
Level 1 consisted of humus, Level 2 consisted of burned rock, and Level 3, directly
overlying the bedrock, consisted of brown clay. The midden’s thickness decreased
south of N92/W120/SW to about 30 cm. Two Edwards points and one ScaUom point
were recovered from the burned rock level of the trench; no artifacts were recovered
from Level 3.
The burned rock in units north of the N92 line and west of the W 120 line rested
on bedrock, with no intervening layer of clay. In the bulldozed trench, the burned
rock densities of all except the westernmost units were extremely low (see below).
The matrix in the trench was a hard-packed, sandy loam---directly above the
limestone bedrock--containing cultural material throughout.
In summary, the burned rock midden at the Mingo site is about 15m in dianaeter
and only as much as 50 cm deep. The original northernmost extent of ,’he midden
is unknown because 10 to 30 cm of material was stripped off ~ t~e bulldozed trench.
It is clear from the profiles that the midden did not extend to its north edge of the
trench. Diagnostic arrowpoints were found in the burned rock layer, but no internal
stratification could be seen in the midden.

FEATURES
Two features were noted below the bulldozed trench during the excavations;
no features were found in the midden.
Feature 1: From Level 3 of N98/W120/SE and N96/W120/NE, consisting of
two grinding slabs (Unique Items [UIs] 134 and 135). The largest (UI 135) was
centered in N98/W120/SE, Level 3 and the other (UI 134) lay in Level 3 on the
border between N98/W120/SE and NE (Figure 6). UI 134 is a roughly circular
limestone slab with one smooth face--presumably the result of grinding--and a
pecked circular depression on the other face. Incised lines in this depression are of
unknown origin. A Fairland dart point (UI 132) was directly beneath this grinding
slab.
Feature 2: N96/W122/SW, Level 1. Excavators noted an unusually high
concentration of chert debitage in the first 10 to 20 cm of this unit. Additionally, two
flake cores were recovered in situ, and two others were found on the screen. Eight
of the 13 cores recovered from the site were found in the 2-meter-square unit N96/
W122. The highest debitage count (477 pieces) came from all three levels of N96/
W122/SW and the second highest total debitage weight (1488.9 grams) came from
these levels. The highest debitage weight was recovered from N96/W122/SE.
These totals are somewhat misleading because they did not come from equal
amounts of excavated material. Conversion of debitage counts and weights to
densities for each unit makes a less biased comparison possible. The highest
debitage count density is 2,320 pieces/meted and the highest debitage weight
density is 12,425 g/meter3. Both are from N96/W122/NE. The southwest quadrant of N96/W122, where the feature was recognized during excavations, has
the second highest debitage count density at 1,590 pieces/meter3; the second
highest debitage weight density (5,279 g/meter3) is from the northeast quadrant
of the same 2-meter unit.
In summary, Feature 2 contains a large amount of chert debitage and many
flake cores. The feature probably was a flint-knapping location centered in the
area of N96iW122. Evidence for this is found in the comparatively high densities of chert debitage across the northeast, southeast, and southwest quadrants,
and in the number of cores found in the northwest (three) and the southwest
(five) quadrants of the unit. When debitage count density is correlated with
distance from the activity area, a negative correlation (r=-.65) results, indicating
an inverse relationship between debitage density and distance from the activity
area. Distance from the feature was calculated by measuring from the grid point
N97/W123 to the center of each excavation unit in a 14-meter radius.
MATERIAL REMAINS
The materials described here are chipped and ground stone artifacts (called
Unique Items [UI]), chert debitage, land snails, charcoal, bone, and fossilized
marine shell. As stated earlier, burned rock was not collected for further study, but
was weighed during excavation.

Artifacts
Both chipped stone and ground stone artifacts were recovered at 41BN101.
Based on form and, when understood, function, these categories can be further
subdivided, and each category and its subdivisions is discussed below. All bifacial
UIs have been identified and measured Fable 1).
Chipped Stone Artifacts
All of the chipped stone artifacts from the Mingo site are made of chert. The
quality of the chert is highly variable, ranging from very fine to coarse grained. Each
chipped stone artifact was measured along the following dim ension s (when present):
Length (L); Maximum Width (MW); Maximum Thickness (MT); Stem Length
(SL); Stem Width (SW); and Neck Width (NW); each specimen was also weighed.
All measurements are in millimeters, and all weights are in grams. For each
subcategory or type, the range of variation in each dimension is shown. Numbers
in parentheses directly following a dimension abbreviation (for example, L(3))
indicate the number of specimens used to determine the range. Numbers appear in
parentheses only when one or more specimens were excluded due to incomplete
measurements. Dimensions in parentheses--L:10.00-(20.00)--indicate that an
incomplete measurement from a damaged specimen was used to establish the range.
Bifaces
Chipped stone artifacts that have had flakes removed from both faces are
classified as bifaces. This category is further subdivided into arrowpoints, dart
points, and other bifaces.
Arrowpoints (45 specimens): The largest category of artifacts recovered.
Edwards (6 specimens: UIs 15, 36, 70, 87, 104, and 142; Figure 7, a, b): All
six of these specimens are essentially complete. The lateral edges range from
convex to slightly concave. All six specimens have deeply divided stems,
curving downward on all but U136. The stem ofU136 curves slightly upward.
The stem of UI 1 04 is nearly 2 mm wider than the blade of the point, suggesting
that the point was possibly reworked while still hafted. Two other specimens
(UIs 15 and 70) also show evidence of having been reworked. Although the
Edwards arrowpoints are generally among the largest, the specimens from the
Mingo site are small when compared to the range described by Sollberger
(1967) when he defined the type. The Mingo specimens are closely similar in
size to the Edwards points recovered at La Jita by Hester (1971).
Dimensions: L(3): 21-(31.75); MW: 12.85-(19.65); MT: 2.75-4.40; SL(5):
3.80-7.20; SW(1): 16.75; NW: 5.75-8.75.
Sabinal (2 specimens: UIs 5 and 120; Figure 7, d, e): The Sabinal arrowpoint
was first proposed as a new local type by Hester (1971) at the La Jita site.

Sabinal points have since been recovered at 41BN33, the Rainey site (Henderson
n.d.), a stratified sinkhole 3 km northeast of the Mingo site. The two specimens
from the Mingo site are triangular with concave lateral edges and heavy,
outward-flaring barbs that curve slightly upward. Neither of these specimens
is complete; both are proximal fragments, and one (UI 120) has a broken
shoulder barb. UI 5 has squared-off, bulbous barbs, but the one barb on UI 120
tapers to a point; both have expanding stems. The base ofUI 5 is convex, but
UI 120 has a straight base. The longest specimen (UI 120) is 30.50 mm long.
The specimen (UI 5) with both barbs intact is 21.65 mm wide. The other
dimensions are complete for each specimen.
Dimensions, MT: 2.95-3.20; SL: 5.85--6.20; SW: 6.50--6.90; NW: 5.10-5.60.
Scallorn (15 specimens: UIs 3, 27, 37, 47, 51,58, 69, 71,75, 79, 122, 130, 143,
146,and 166; Figure7,i-k): Eightoftheseareessentially complete specimens.
Seven specimens are proximal fragments. The lateral edges of the essentially
complete points range from slightly concave to slightly convex. The stems are
corner-notched, and most specimens have well-barbed shoulders. Three specimens (UIs 58,143, and 146) have serrated edges. The corner-notched stems are
all expanding. The bases vary from slightly convex to moderately concave (UI
143). UI 146 is only slightly worked on one edge. UI 122 is a crude, widestemmed specimen that may not be complete. One specimen (U147) is burned.
These specimens closely resemble the Scallorn points found at 41BL104 and
described by Sorrow, Shafer, and Ross (1967).
Dimensions, L(5): 22.20-34.90; MW(8): 10.05-18.80; MT: 2.20-4.40; SL:
3.60-(9.16); SW(10): 5.50-17.04; NW: 4.40-10.30. WT(2): 1.1-1.5.
Miscellaneous Arrowpoints (10 specimens: UIs 2, 9, 14, 25, 45, 52, 94,128,
139, and 144; Figure 7, l-p): These specimens have damaged stems, making
it impossible to accurately classify them into any of the above categories. Two
of these arrowpoints show evidence of having been reworked after their stems
were broken. U145 has been side notched above the original shoulders, and 13I
128 has been reworked at its base to form a narrow contracting stem. Two
specimens are serrated (UIs 9 and 94). Additionally, UI 94 has heavy,
outwardly flaring barbs reminiscent of Sabinal points.
Dimensions, L(5): (17.10)-29.90; MW(3): (23.90)-(28.00); MT(7): 2.203.40.
Arrowpoint Fragments (12 specimens): Two medial arrowpoint fragments,
one a partial stem and shoulder fragment (UI 40), were recovered. Ten distal
arrowpoint fragments were also recovered, all with straight to slightly convex
lateral edges.
Arrowpoint Preforms (21 specimens): Most of these specimens are similar
to the small "overall retouch bifaces" described by Lukowski (1987). They are
subdivided according to form.

Triangular (12 specimens: UIs 28, 30, 61, 81, 83, 92, 116, 119, 126, 133, 161,
and 163; Figure 8, a-g): Five of these are substantially complete; seven are
proximal fragments. The bases and lateral edges are straight to slightly convex,
and most---except for UI 119, which has been retouched only along the edges
on one side---have been substantially reworked by pressure flaking on both
surfaces. Three specimens (UIs 28, 30, and 81) closely resemble what others
have called Fresno points (Highley et al. 1978). Turner and Hester (1985:174)
believe that many points previously called Fresno may actually be preforms.

Pointed Ovate (4 specimens: UI s 10, 33, 103, and 152; Figure 8, i-l): These
four specimens have convex bases; their lateral edges vary from convex to

Miscellaneous Preform Fragments (5 specimens: UIs 22, 39, 129, 160, and
167): These five fragments do not fit into the previously described categories,
so they are described individually:
U122: A medial fragment with only part of its base; one side has only minor
retouch.
UI 39: This distal fragment of poor quality material is also only slightly
worked on one face. Its lateral edges are slightly convex.
UI 129: A slightly rounded, very small, roughly triangular specimen that
may be a reworked arrowpoint fragment.
UI 160: A proximal fragment with a convex base that has been retouched
on one face to form a steep angle.
UI 167: A distal biface fragment, classified as an arrowpoint preform
because of its small size. Its lateral edges are convex and meet to form a
point.
Dart Points (6 specimens)
Angostura (1 specimen: U! 12; Figure 9, f): This, the only Late Paleoindian
point from the site, is a proximal fragment, heavily patinated, with a s~aight
base and well-ground basal edges extending 19 mm up the edges. The point
has been recurved at the distal end, and the tip has been snapped off. The
point was possibly reworked into a drill and then broken (Thomas R. Hester,
personal communication, October 1991),

Frio (3 specimens: UIs 1, 24, and 86; Figure 9, a, c, e): All of these specimens
have been heavily reworked and have a great deal of variation in their bases.
All are side notched, but U186 has been substantially reworked so the stem is
4.80 mm wider than the blade. The lateral edges of UIs No 1 and 24 are concave,
forming a point on UI 1. UI 24 has been badly heat fractured, and the tip is
missing. The lateral edges of heavily patinated U186 are convex, and the distal
end is rounded.
Dimensions, L: 26.85-(36.70); MW: 11.50-21.30; MT: 4.80-5.95; SL: 5.857.30; SW(2): 14.70-26.10; NW: 11.10-21.30; WT(2): 2.1-3.7.
Unclassified Dart Point (1 specimen: U119; Figure 9, b): The final dart point
is a proximal fragment of an expanding stemmed dart point with a slightly
expanding stem, slightly convex base, weak shoulders, and straight lateral
edges--it does not fit into any previously described categories for the region,
although it is similar to the Darl type (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Wesolowsky et al.
1976).
Dimensions, L: (22.70); MW: 18.10; MT: 5.20; SL: 7.50; SW: 12.70; NW:
11.30.

Other Bifaces (19 specimens)
The remaining bifacial specimens, grouped here according to form, cannot be
classified into previously described artifact or tool types. Where forms are similar
to those used by Lukowski (1987), his names have been used.
Large Orates (1 specimen: UI 16): An ovate biface with convex lateral edges
and base, a section of which is broken off.
Dimensions, L: (45.50); MW: (44.00); MT: 11.90.
Large, Pointed Orates (4 specimens: UIs 34, 56, 59, and 91; Figure 9, g, i).
Three of these specimens are complete, and one (U134) is a proximal fragment.
All four specimens have convex lateral edges and bases; U156 is piano-convex
in cross section, and the other three specimens are biconvex. All four specimens
are relatively crude; U191 has the least retouch, and UI 34 has the most. The
ventral side of UI 59 is only partially retouched, and the dorsal face of UI 91
is almost completely covered by cortex. The first three specimens may be early
stage arrowpoint preforms (Thomas R. Hester, personal communication).
These three complete specimens range in length from 1.58 to 1.77 times their
widths.
Dimensions, L: 52.30-60.90; MW: 29.50-38.65; MT: 11.10-18.00; WT:
12.0-34.3.

Large Triangular (3 specimens: UIs 76, 101, and 136; Figure 9, j, k): All of
these specimens have convex bases. UI 76, which has slightly convex lateral
edges and is patinated, is probably a reworked dart point. Flake scars over the
patination suggest that the piece has been reworked. U1101 has slightly convex

Houk & Lohse m The Mingo Site

215

edges with numerous step and hinge fractures along their margins. UI 136 is a
much smaller specimen, exhibiting only minor retouching on its ventral face
and straight to slightly concave lateral edges. UI 101 may be a dart point
preform; UI 136 may be an early stage arrowpoint preform.
Dimensions, L: 40.00-73.05; MW: 32.55-34.70; MT: 5.75-15.55; WT: 7.529.5.
Miscellaneous Bifaces (3 specimens: UIs 29, 77, and 95; Figure 9, h): These
specimens do not fit into the previously described categories. UI 29 is a
stemmed biface that has been reworked, as evidenced by new flake scars over
patination. It has a contracting stem, a straight base, and convex lateral edges,
and most likely is a reworked dart point. UIs 77 and 95 are both secondary
flakes, retaining cortex on their bifacially retouched ventral faces.
Miscellaneous Biface Fragments (11 specimens): These specimens, which
cannot be placed in any of the previously described categories, are subdivided
into three categories: distal, medial, and unknown. No proximal fragments
were recovered.

Distal Fragments (4 specimens: UIs 97, 98, 148, and 159): All have
convex lateral edges. UI 98 has been burned, and one face of UI 148 is
lightly patinated.
Medial Fragments (5 specimens: UIs 17, 38, 65, 93, and 121): Two (UIs
65 and 121) have been burned, and U193 appears to have been reworked
at the distal end, possibly into a drill, then broken by a snap fracture.
Amorphous Fragments (2 specimens: UIs 53 and 57): These could be
classified as either proximal or distal fragments. U153 is an oval fragment
that was broken by end shock. It is characterized by generally crude
percussion flaking with some fine retouch and microflaking along its
edges, except for the one formed by the fracture. Both UIs 53 and 57 were
apparently broken by end shock, but UI No 57 has no fine retouch along
its edges.

Unifaces.
Five specimens with retouch on only one face were recovered from the Mingo
site.
UtilizedFlake.Blade (1 specimen: U121): A secondary flake that is more than
twice as long as it is wide. The lateral margins, except for several centimeters
that still have cortex, have been modified by use-wear.
Dimensions, L: 44.50; MW: 21.55; MT: 5.95; WT: 6.3.
Serrated Flake (1 specimen: U162): A triangular flake fragment serrated along
one lateral edge.

Dimensions, L: (22.05); MW: (19.65); MT: (8.80); WT: (1.9).

Utilized and Modified Flakes
The chipped stone assemblage at 41BN101 includes chert flakes that have
either been utilized or have had some sort of minor retouch or modification
along one or more of their lateral (cutting) edges.
Modified Flakes (6 specimens): UIs 7, 18, 48, 74, 102, and 113): For
reasons that are not clear, these specimens have been modified by retouch.
UIs 48, 72, and 113 appear to be fragments of larger unifaces. Since the
edge-wear was not analyzed, there is no basis for classifying them as
scrapers.
Utilized Flakes (24 specimens): Flakes that had use-wear along one or
more margins were classified as Unique Items. This category includes
seven secondary flakes, 15 tertiary flakes, and two flake fragments that
do not have bulbs of percussion or platforms. Three of the flakes--one
secondary and two tertiary--had been burned.

Cores
The 14 cores, made of chert of varying quality, can be classified into two
categories.
Unidirectional Prepared Platforms (2 specimens: UIs 49 and 150): Cores in
this category are described by Lukowski (1987) as having prepared striking
platforms from which flakes are removed in one direction. The platforms are
prepared by removing one or more flakes. U149 has multiple platforms, and UI
150 has a single platform.
Dimensions, ML: 71.05-71.10; MW: 58.45-2.45; MT: 31.05-65.10; WT:
149.4-561.4.
Multidirectional Platforms (12 specimens): These cores have multiple platforms from which flakes been struck in different directions. UIs 4 and 112
appear to be exhausted cores.
Dimensions, ML: 60.65-97.50; MW: 42.15-82.10; MT: 31.05-5.10; WT:
86.2-390.6.
Ground Stone Artifacts
Ground stone artifacts are the second class of artifacts recovered during
excavations at the Mingo site. All are of limestone. The dimensions for the mano
are in millimeters and grams; for the grinding slabs, in centimeters and kilograms.
Mano (1 specimen: UI 20): This artifact is a small limestone cobble, circular in
outline and oval in cross section. One surface is flat and shows evidence of
grinding.
Dimensions (in millimeters and grams), ML: 82.75; MW: 79.55; MT: 37.05; WT:
345.1.

Houk & Lohse m The Mingo Site

217

Grinding Slabs (2 specimens: UIs 134 and 135; Figure 10, a, b): Both were
associated with Feature 1 and are large slabs of limestone. UI 134 is roughly circular.
One surface has been smoothed slightly by grinding; the other has an oval
depression about 13 cm by 10 cm, presumably made by grinding or pecking. Small
linear grooves have been worn into the depression, running perpendicular to its long
axis; how these grooves, or cuts, were made is unknown. UI 135 is a broken
limestone cobble, slightly thicker and heavier than UI 134. Only one side has
evidence of use--a shallow, oval depression made by grinding. This area is about
16 cm by 7 cm.
Dimensions, UI 134 measures 29 by 27.4 cm, is 6.5 cm thick, and weighs 5.9 kg;
UI 135 measures 23 by 22.3 cm, is 7.5 cm thick, and weighs 5 kg.
Other Materials Recovered
Snails
Snail shells were collected from all units, and four species of snail were
recognized. The most common was Rabdotus (1,002 specimens); other species
were Helicina (526), Polygyra (36), and Euglandina (12). All but three of the
Euglandina specimens came from N90/W110/NW, Level 2. The distribution of
Rabdotus and Helicina is discussed below.
Faunal Remains
Only a single piece of burned bone was recovered from 41BN101; it is
tentatively identified as a long bone fragment from a deer, but is too small to be
classified conclusively. This virtual absence of faunal material could be due first,
and most likely, to the soil at the Mingo site, which is not conducive to good
faunal preservation, and second, to an absence of a significant amount of faunal
material at the site when it was occupied.
Fossilized Marine Shell

A single fragment of a fossilized oyster shell (species unidentified) was
recovered; it weighs 12.9 g, was recovered from N98/W120/SW, Level 3, and is
unmodified.
Charcoal
Three samples of charcoal and ashy soil were collected from units in the
bulldozed trench, but none of the samples was clearly associated with any features or artifacts, and no radiocarbon analysis was made. The samples were taken
from: N98/W120/NE, Level 3; N96/W122/NW, Level 3; and N96/W120/NW,
Level 2.

Debitage
The debitage that had been counted and weighed was sorted into flakes and
detritus, and totalled for each unit (Table 2). These categories were further
subdivided.
Chert Debitage
Chert debitage, which consists of flakes (pieces of material removed from a
larger mass of material by the application of force, each with a striking platform and

220

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

a bulb of percussion at the proximal end [Crabtree 1982]) and detritus (pieces of
chert that have neither platforms nor bulbs of percussion), was collected, counted,
and weighed from each unit and level in the buHdezed trench. In all, 4,105 pieces
were recovered during excavations at the Mingo site. A porfiGn of this debitage was
analyzed further.
Flakes
Primary Flakes result from the removal of cortex from a chert core. At least
75 percent of the dorsal surface of a primary flake is covered with cortex.
Secondary Flakes have more than I percent and less than 75 percent of their
dorsal surfaces covered with cortex.
Tertiary Flakes have no cortex on either surface.
Biface Thinning Flakes are flakes removed during the thinning of bifaces, and
are characterized by "lipped" striking platforms; they have been called "lipped
flakes" in other excavation reports (Hester 1971; Wesolowsky et al. 1976).

Detritus
Detritus is made up of chips (small fragments of flakes without bulbs of
percussion or platforms), burned chips (chips that have been heat-fractured or "pot
lidded"), and chunks (large pieces of chert with no bulbs of percussion or platforms).
The debitage from 26 levels, which was analyzed and sorted into the seven
categories (Table 2), totals 2,358 pieces, about 57 percent of all debitage collected.
The ratios between these categories differ little from level to level. When the levels

are translated into elevation ranges and each debitage category is converted to a
percentage of the total debitage for each range, this relationship becomes clear
(Table 3, Figure 11). The data for the deepest elevation range (98.7 to 98.6 cm)
represent a sample of only 117 pieces. The differing ratios reflected in this elevation
range may not be significant because of the small sample size.
The analysis of the debitage from the units in the bulldozed lrench makes it clear
that all stages of lithic reduction were being performed at the site. The low frequency
of biface thinning flakes may be due, in part, to the use of quarter-inch screens,
which do not retain small pieces of debitage.

222

Texas Archeological Society

The small number of primary flakes found in each level may indicate that initial
reduction of chert cobbles may have been done at the site of procurement.
Wesolowsky et al. (1976) reached similar conclusions for the Jetta Court site
(41TV 151) and the La Jim site (41UV21), based on the low frequency of primary
flakes in assemblages from those sites.
A comparison of the frequency of debitage categories between the units in the
vicinity of Feature 2 and the remaining units reveals some interesting differences.
The most notable differences (Figure 12) are the higher percentages of primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes from units not associated with Feature 2 and the
higher percentage of chips and chunks from units in the vicinity of Feature 2. The
higher proportion of chunks and chips, which, in many cases, may actually be core
fragments, may be related to the distribution of cores across the site. More than 60
percent of the cores recovered from the site were found in the four units of N96/
W122, the area of Feature 2. The large number of cores and the high percentages of
chips and chunks from N96/W122 leads to the hypothesis that secondary stages of
core reduction were performed in the area of Feature 2. The relatively lower
frequencies ofprimary, secondary, and tertiary flakes from the area of Feature 2 may
indicate that after these forms were struck from cores, they were moved to another
part of the site for further reduction or utilization.
Unfortunately, from this region there are no other Transitional Archaic or
Late Prehistoric sites for which a detailed debitage analysis has been done. This
makes intersite comparisons impossible.
DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS
The landowners’ bulldozed trench, which cuts through part of the site, makes
the discussion of distribution problematic. Because the top 10 to 30 cm of soil
was stripped off by the bulldozer, it is impossible to make meaningful comparisons of excavation levels in the trench with those outside the trench. Comparing
elevations is also problematic because the midden is concentrated on a slope.
Therefore, for discussions of distribution of materials, it is necessary to divide
the site into the units in the trench and the units outside the trench. Elevation
ranges can be used in discussions of the vertical distribution of artifacts for units
in the trench, but for units in the midden, where the starting surface elevations
varied according to the natural slope of the site, excavation levels rather than
elevation ranges must be compared (Table 4).
Distribution of Artifacts
Arrowpoints
The vertical distribution of arrowpoints in the trench (Figure 13) does not
suggest stratification by type. Edwards points are found in the deepest levels of
the units, but there is a great deal of mixing in the uppermost elevations. Edwards
points occur below, above, and at the same elevation as both Sabinal and Scallorn

points, although they should occur in deeper contexts than either of those point
types (Lukowski 1987). It can be concluded, therefore, that either the deposits
have been mixed, or all three point types were being used simultaneously.
The only identifiable point type found in the deepest levels of units outside
the trench is Scallom ~igure 14); the only Edwards specimen recovered there
was in Level 2, together with one Sabinal and three Scallom specimens.

Figure 15. Plan showing the horizontal distribution of arrowpoints in the trench and in the

In general, arrowpoints were found in units in both the trench and the
midden (Figure 15), although the most notable pattern is the concentration of
preforms in units in the trench. Of the 22 artifacts identified as preforms, 10 (45
percent) were recovered from N96/W122, the area of Feature 2. Twenty (91
percent) of the 22 preforms came from the trench. Not including preforms (Figure 16), 27 (60 percent) of the 45 arrowpoints were in the trench.
Dart Points

Six dart points were recovered (Figure 17). One, a reworked Angostura, is
not included in this discussion because it is clearly an imported artifact, out of
its temporal context. Of the other five points, four came from the highest level
of their excavation units. One Fairland point (UI 132) was found directly below
a grinding slab in Feature 1 and was only 2 cm above bedrock.

vicinity of Feature 2, in N96/W 122 (Figure 19). Another complete biface was found
in the bulldozed trench, and two were in units outside the trench. Ten biface
fragments were collected from units in the trench; seven of these from the vicinity
of Feature 2 (Figure 20). Seven fragments were found in units outside of the trench;
four from N92/W120/SW (Figure 21).
Cores
In the bulldozed trench, the concentration of cores between 98.90 and 98.80
meters elevation corresponds with the elevation of Feature 2. Horizontally (Figure
22), the concentration of cores is in the bulldozed trench; specifically in unit N96/
W122, the area of Feature 2.

Debitage

The highest concentrations of debitage are found in units in the bulldozed
trench. Figure 23 shows the horizontal distribution of debitage by density (number
of pieces/m3) for each unit.
Distribution of Burned Rock

The densest concentration of burned rock occurs in N90/W120/NW (Figure
24), where the average density for all the excavated levels is 724 kg/m3. The lowest
density occurs in N98/W120/SE and is 7 kg/m3.
The relatively high burned rock densities found in N96/W122 are surprising because they occur in the bulldozed trench in the vicinity of Feature 2. They
are two to three times as high as the burned rock densities in other units in the
bulldozed trench.

At the Blue Hole site, 41UV159, Mueggenborg (1991) noted an inverse
relationship between the amount of burned rock and the amount of debitage. A
similar analysis of the Mingo site data does not show any strong correlation between
burned rock density and either debitage count density (r=.024) or debitage weight
density (r=.066).
Distribution of Snails: Rabdotus and Helicina

There is an increase in Rabdotus density in units in the bulldozed trench,
and a similar trend is seen for Helicina snails (Figures 25, 26). However, Helicina
density does not correlate with Rabdotus density (r=.00967), and there is also
no strong correlation between burned rock density and either Rabdotus density
(r=-.097) or Helicina density (r=-.212).

DISCUSSION
Although units in the bulldozed trench accounted for only 33.63 percent of
the site’s excavated volume, they contributed 61.51 percent of the debitage, 64.79
percent of the unique items, and 91 percent of the arrowpoint preforms recovered. Units in the burned rock midden comprised 44.88 percent of the total
excavated volume but only 35.67 percent of the total debitage. The units in the
trench had a total of 152.6 kg of burned rock, but units outside the trench had
804.23 kg of burned rock. Two factors couVd account for these differences: first,
the sample is biased because the top levels in the trench, which may have conmined a significant amount of burned rock, were stripped off by the bulldozer;
second, the units in the trench differ fundamentally in their composition, indicating that different activities led to their formation. This second hypothesis can

be true only if the bulldozed trench corresponds with the northern extent of the
burned rock accumulation. In other words, this hypothesis can be proven only
if because they lie to the north of the midden and not beneath it the units in
the trench do not contain significant amounts of burned rock. It is likely that the
scatter extended over part of the trenched area because it can be seen in the south
profile. It does not, however, show up in the north profile, indicating that the
scatter terminated within the boundaries of the trench. The original extent of the
burned rock can never be fully known. Most units in the trench have little burned
rock, but the westernmost units have burned rock densities comparable to units
in the scatter.
CONCLUSIONS
The limited excavations carried out at the Mingo site by the TAS members
are an important contribution to our understanding of south central Texas pre-

history. At the time of excavation, the site consisted of a small burned rock
midden and an adjoining area containing two identified archeological features.
The site contained predominantly Late Prehistoric arrowpoints and several Transitional Archaic dart points. The exact relationship of the features to the burned
rock midden was not established due to the removal of an unknown amount of
the midden by bulldozer prior to excavation. It is hypothesized based on the
increase in debitage density in units in the bulldozed trench relative to the density in units in the midden, and also on the profiles of the trench walls--that the
midden did not extend completely across the trenched area.
All of the diagnostic arrowpoints recovered are from the Austin phase of
the Late Prehistoric period. No Perdiz points, ceramics, or bison bone were
recovered, suggesting that occupation at the site ceased prior to the Toyah phase.
Occupation at the site possibly began in the Late Archaic or Transitional Archaic, based on the presence of one Fairland and three Frio points among the
several diagnostic dart points.

The presence of diagnostic arrowpoints throughout the burned rock midden
and in each excavated level of the deposits in the bulldozed trench (Figures 13, 14),
suggest that the two areas of the site were formed contemporaneously. A purely
Archaic origin for the midden can not be ruled out without absolute dates, but it
seems unlikely that the formation of the midden began any earlier than the
Transitional Archaic (ca. 300 B.C.), with the greater part of the midden accumulating during the Austin phase (A.D. 700 to 1200) of the Late Prehistoric.
The discovery of two grinding slabs and one mano suggest that the processing
of plant material was an important part of the subsistence strategy of the occupants
of the site. Henderson (n.d.) proposed that the Austin phase inhabitants of the

Rainey Sinkhole also relied heavily on the processing of plant material for their
subsistence.
In form and in artifact assemblage, the Mingo site bears a striking resemblance to the Heard Schoolhouse site (41UV86) as described by Goode (1991).
Like the Mingo site, 41UV86 contained a small burned rock midden, 15 m in
diameter with a maximum depth of 60 cm (Goode 1991:72). More diagnostic
projectile points were recovered at 41UV86 than at the Mingo site, but the assemblages are remarkably similar. Both sites lacked Toyah phase arrowpoints,
and they contained Edwards, Sabinal, and Scallorn points in greater numbers
than they did dart points. At both sites, most of the artifacts were recovered north

of the midden. This may be a coincidence, or it may indicate that the sites are
examples of similar formational processes.
Goode (1991) identified a central hearth at 41UV86, but no such feature was
recognized at the Mingo site. Like the Mingo site, 41UV86 contained very little
faunal material, and Goode (1991) speculates that plant processing may have been
a significant contributing factor to the formation of the midden. The two grinding
slabs recovered at the Mingo site suggest that processing of vegetal matter took
place during part of the site’s occupation.
Unfortunately, the artifacts at 41UV86 and at the Honey Creek site (41 MS32),
which is apparently similar, have not yet been examined in detail (Goode 1991). In
a somewhat cursory examination of the dart points from 41UV86 and 41MS32,
Goode (1991:82) describes "a small side-dart point... [which]... resembles Frio
and Ensor and is the kind of point common in the Late/Transitional Archaic" from
41 MS32, and states that a similar point was recovered at 41UV86. At the B lue Hole

Houk & Lohse ~ The Mingo Site

site, Mueggenborg (1991) noted that of his four varieties of Frio~nsor points,
Group 2 was found almost exclusively in excavation levels containing Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints. Interestingly, Henderson (n.d.), although referring to them
as arrowpoints, describes two projectile points from the Rainey site that seem to be
very similar to the points discussed by Goode and to Mueggenborg’s Group 2 Frio/
Ensor points.
The Rainey site, 41BN33, is a sinkhole that was excavated by the Texas
Department of Highways and Transportation in 1978 (Henderson n.d.) and is
only 3 km northwest of the Mingo site. The site was well stratified and carefully
excavated, allowing Henderson (n.d.) to examine the stratigraphic relationships
of Edwards, Perdiz, Sabinal, and Scallom points. Henderson (n.d.:634) divided
the deposits into Lower Austin, Upper Austin, and Toyah phase occupations.
The Lower Austin phase zones contained only Edwards points, except for one
Sabinal point in the latest occupational lens and two expanding-stemmed
arrowpoints in the earliest lens. The Upper Austin phase zones contained Sabinal
and Scallorn points in the earliest lens, Edwards and Scallom in the middle lens,
and Edwards points in the latest lens (Henderson n.d.: 634).
The two expanding-stemmed arrowpoints found in the earliest lens in association
with an Edwards point appear to be similar, at least in outline and size, to the
Transitional Archaic dart points recovered at the Mingo site, particularly to Frio
points UI 1 and 24. Although Henderson (n.d.:514) states that the two points bear
"some resemblance to the Figueroa dart point type," the weak shoulders and
concave base of the outline of the one specimen that was included in a rough draft
of the Rainey site report looks more like a Fairland or Frio point. It is possible that
dart points and arrowpoints were coeval for some time during the Transitional
Archaic and/or early Late Prehistoric periods in Bandera and surrounding counties.
Zone VII at the Rainey site (Henderson n.d.), the Heard Schoolhouse site, the Honey
Creek site (Goode 1991), the Blue Hole site (Mueggenborg 1991), and the Mingo
site are examples of sites where this relationship may have existed. Henderson (n.d.:
630) notes that"it is tempting to suggest that a new phase be defined on the basis
of crude dart-point-like, expanding-stemmed arrowpoints and that this phase
represents the Ixansitional period between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric
Periods." Turner and Hester (1985:49) have recognized the Transitional Archaic,
beginning around 300 B.C. and ending with the advent of the Late Prehistoric in
A.D. 700. This period is marked by primarily Frio, Ensor, and Fairland dart points
in south-central Texas (Turner and Hester 1985). Excavation of small sites like
41BN33 and 41BN101 may make it possible to identify even more discrete periods
of time, such as one in which dart points and arrowpoints were being used
simultaneously.
The Edwards has long been thought to be perhaps the first arrowpoint type
to appear in the Edwards Plateau region of Central Texas (Sollberger 1967;
Hester 1978; Mitchell 1978, 1982); it is clearly the earliest arrowpoint at the
Rainey site, but the stratigraphic order of point types at the Mingo site is not
clear. Two Edwards points were the only identifiable arrowpoints recovered from

244

Texas Archeological Society

the deepest elevations in the bulldozed trench (Figure 13), but Scallorn points
were the only identifiable arrowpoints recovered from the two deepest levels of
the burned rock midden (Figure 14). Edwards, Sabinal, and Scallorn points were
found in Level 2 of the midden and between 98.8 and 98.7 meters in the bulldozed trench.
The Late Prehistoric component at Scorpion Cave (41ME7) in Medina
County included 88 Edwards points and only 16 Scallorn points (Highley
1978:150). Beasley (1978) reported on excavations at a site in northeastern
Bandera County that had a similar ratio of Edwards to ScaUorn points. At the
Rainey site, 11 of the 17 identified points were Edwards, and only four were
Scallorn points (Henderson n.d.). The ratio at the Mingo site is reversed: 15
Scallorn points and only six Edwards points were recovered. The implications
of the differences in these artifact assemblages are unclear, but might be clarified by further investigation of the stratigraphic relations and the geographical
distribution of the various Austin Phase arrowpoints.
Excavations of small sites such as 41BN101 should be an integral part of future
research in Central Texas. They may provide useful analogies for the identification
of activity components at larger sites (Dillehay 1973), and they may have discrete
temporal components. This in turn may allow for the refinement of local and
regional point type chronologies. Small burned rock middens with largely Late
Prehistoric arrowpoints, represented by the Mingo site, sites described by Goode
(1991), and sites excavated in the 1930s by Huskey (1935), may be manifestations
of a distinct cultural innovation that is currently poorly understood.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The authors thank Thomas R. Hester and the TAS for the opportunity to
excavate and report on 41BN101. The cooperation of the landowners, their
assistance, and their kindness were greatly appreciated. We cannot thank Mrs.
Mingo enough for her support, friendship, and generosity during our two weeks at
41BN 101, and our gratitude is also extended to Roy Dickinson for his assistance and
advice as the TAS area supervisor. Finally, we are indebted to the 25 participants
in the 1990 TAS Field School who made the excavations possible; their patience and
energy were invaluable.
