ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed drill site and access road in Smith
County, Mississippi was performed by Rita D. Fields as a subcontractor to Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA) and Dixie Environmental Services Company,
LLP. (DESCO) on May 23, 2008 under an Archaeological Resource Protection Act
permit issued by the Bienville National Forest. The area was investigated by a
surface inspection and shovel testing. One historic site (22-Sm-1337) was found
within the footprint of the well pad, and no cultural materials were observed along
the proposed access road. This is a house site or logging camp that dates to the
late 19th Century or early 20th Century based on artifacts recovered from shovel
tests and on the surface. In addition, two chert flakes were recovered through
shovel testing. Since isolated flakes can be found throughout the forest, the
presence of these materials is considered to be an isolated occurrence and not a
separate prehistoric component. The site area has been disturbed through
occupational disturbances. This site is located in Compartment 258. Because of
the amount of disturbance present, this site is not considered eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is warranted. Copies of
this report are on file at the Bienville National Forest, the Mississippi Department of
Archives and History (MDAH), DESCO, and with the authors. The artifacts and
records are housed at the Bienville National Forest.
The cultural resources survey followed the survey guidelines set forth by
the MDAH. The survey was performed in compliance with the Procedures of the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservations (36 CFR 800); the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL 89-665), as amended; the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (PL 91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231m 1970); the
Archaeological Resource Protection Act of 1979, and other appropriate cultural
resources legislation and guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the
Register of Professional Archaeologists.

INTRODUCTION
Sklar Exploration Company, LLC plans to construct the South Morton 12-2
well pad and access road within the Bienville National Forest (Section 12,
Township 4 North, Range 6 East), Smith County, Mississippi (Figure 1). The
project area is about four miles southeast of Polkville, Mississippi. Topographic
coverage is provided by the USGS Polkville 7.5’ quadrangle dated 1980 (Figure
2). The project area is located within Compartment 258 of the Bienville Ranger
District. The footprint of the well pad site is 350 feet x 350 feet (2.81 acres), and
the access road is 187 feet long by 30 feet wide (0.13 acre). The proposed
access road connects to a gravel road that leads to a drill site. The nearest
numbered Forest Service road is 538-J. Construction plans call for a well in the
center of the pad site that will be constructed above ground. Except for the drill
hole, the only subsurface disturbance will be some minimal scraping at the apex
of the landform to level the site for construction of the pad. An existing access
road will be used with no subsurface modifications planned. This site is on an
upland ridge approximately 750 feet east of Davis Creek, and the Strong River is
approximately 4500 feet to the east. The setting for the well site and access road
was viewed by BVRA as a high probability area for the presence of a prehistoric
or historic site because of its location on an elevated landform in close proximity
to a creek.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Morton South 12-2 well pad and access road are located in Smith
County within the confines of the Bienville National Forest. The Bienville National
Forest consists of 178,367 acres and is located in central Mississippi. The
Bienville National Forest is one of six national forests located in the state of
Mississippi and provides recreational opportunities as well as wildlife and timber
management plans. Smith County, Mississippi is located within the East Gulf
subregion of the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province as described by
Fenneman (1938). This area is characterized by a series of belts, with each belt
distinguished by a specific topography relating to various geologic structures.
According to an early 19th Century report by Goodspead (1891:242), the
physiography of Smith County is characterized as “partly rich bottom lands, partly
hill lands, free and productive…” The project area is also located in the
Central/Southern Pine Hills region that is bounded on the north by the Jackson
Prairie physiographic unit and on the south by the Coastal Pine Meadows of the
Mississippi Gulf Coast. In general, the Pine Hills region is characterized by
moderately high rolling upland ridges separated by V-shaped ravines containing
intermittent drains or springs and/or permanent streams and creeks. Elevation
varies throughout the Pine Hills. Moderate to high hilltops are not uncommon
with most of the area averaging between 300 to 500 feet above mean sea level
(Cross and Wales 1974). In a report by Moore and Fields (2007), the
environmental setting of the Bienville National Forest is discussed in more detail.
The two major drainages in the vicinity of the project area are Davis Creek to the
west and the Strong River to the northeast. The well site is located on a narrow
ridge that consists of mixed hardwoods and an understory of briars and vines
(Figure 3). Currently, there is no published soil survey for Smith County,
Mississippi. Therefore, the following information was taken from files at the
Bienville National Forest. According to an in-house soils map prepared by
forester John K. Lee of the Bienville National Forest, Ranger District Office, the
soils in the project area consist of Savannah fine sandy loam, 2 to 5% slope
(SaB). This is an upland soil that has a 0% chance of flooding. Artifacts made
from a wide diversity of raw material have been found at sites in the region.
Identified materials recovered from other sites in the forest include Citronelle
gravel chert, Fort Payne chert, Catahoula quartzite, Kosciusko quartzite,
Tallahatta quartzite, quartz, sandstone, and chalcedony. Rita D. Fields discusses
these materials in detail in a report by Moore and Fields (2007:7-10).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A number of previous surveys have been conducted in the general area,
and most of the work in the forest is associated with land exchange, timber sales,
and oil and gas leases. Copies of reports describing these surveys are on file at
the Bienville National Forest (Ranger District office) and MDAH.
Several cultural resource surveys have been conducted within a radius of
one-mile with the majority of these to the northwest. Within this area, two
investigations were carried out in close proximity to the current project area. Of
the two nearest investigations, the largest study was conducted in 1995 by
Robert Bryan (1995) for a timber stand sale and consisted of two separate areas
to the northeast and southeast in compartments 255 and 258. Five prehistoric
sites (22-Sm-652 – 22-Sm-656) and one historic site (95-264-SR-1-H) were
identified. The prehistoric sites are small, and they vary in size from 0.2 acre to
0.6 acre. Landforms on which the sites are located include upland ridges, a
hilltop, and a ridge bluff with elevations between 390 feet and 420 feet above
mean sea level. Artifact density was considered to be light at all five sites, and
artifacts recovered include flakes, biface fragments, shatter, and two projectile
points. The only site that can be assigned to a specific temporal period is 22Sm-653, where a Collins point was recovered. Based on the presence of this
diagnostic specimen, this site dates to sometime between the Middle and Late
Woodland periods (circa 100 B.C. – A.D. 1000). A reworked projectile point was
found at site 22-Sm-656. This projectile point was not assigned to a known type.
The function of these sites is not known at this time. The single (0.15 acre)
historic site is located on an upland ridge at approximately 450 feet above mean
sea level. It is described in the report as a house site or homestead that has
been disturbed, probably through logging activities. The date of this site is not
known, but the artifacts found at this site date mainly to the early 20th Century.
All six sites are not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
Immediately to the south, the Morton South 12-1 well pad and access road
was surveyed for cultural resources by BVRA in 2005 (Moore and Baxter 2005).
The project area is in Compartment 258 of the Bienville Ranger District. The well
pad footprint consisted of 3.67 acres, and the access road was.5 miles in length.
The soils in the area are Savannah fine sandy loam, an upland soil. In all, 23
shovel tests were excavated at the well pad site, and 25 shovel tests were dug
along the proposed access road. Soils in the area consisted of a shallow fine
sandy loam over clay. No gravels or raw materials that could have been used to
make stone tools were present. No sites were found, and it was recommended
that construction be allowed to proceed. This project was performed under an
ARPA permit issued by the Bienville National Forest.

Known prehistoric sites in the Bienville National Forest include permanent
campsites, temporary special use camps, and isolated occurrences of artifacts
and debitage.
Sites in the forest date to the Archaic, Woodland, and
Mississippian periods. No Paleo-Indian sites have been recorded. Historic sites
consist of homesteads, logging camps and features, and non-residential areas
such as roads and bridges. Most historic sites were constructed or occupied
during the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. The research potential for
most sites in the forest is unknown, and few sites have been determined to be
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Pre-Field Tasks
Prior to entering the field, Rita D. Fields conducted an archival background
check at MDAH. Site files were checked for the presence of known sites and
previous surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Smith County were reviewed in order to become familiar with
the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Field Survey
The area was investigated by Rita D. Fields on May 23, 2008. The entire
area was walked and visually inspected for surface indications of an archaeological
site. The subsurface was examined through shovel testing. At the time of her visit
the area was very wet from recent rains. Therefore, normal screening was not
possible. The wet, muddy soil was placed in a screen and examined by hand.
When possible, the soil was pushed through the quarter-inch hardware cloth.
Relevant shovel test data were entered in the field notes, and this information
appears in this report as Appendix I. Shovel test locations are depicted in Figure 4.
The initial three tests were excavated at intervals of 20 meters along the access
road. Next, shovel tests were excavated in a grid pattern over the well pad. This
grid began at the southwest corner with Shovel Test 4 and proceeded to the north
where it was terminated with the excavation of Shovel Test 7. In all, 16 tests were
excavated along the four transects that were spaced at intervals of 30 meters. On
the third transect, four wire nails were found in Shovel Test 13. Following the
completion of shovel testing along the grid, Ms Fields began the process of site
delineation. Fourteen shovel tests were placed in a grid pattern at intervals of five
meters in the four cardinal directions. The soil in this area was shallow and
disturbed. Because of the disturbance and the wet nature of the soil, the tests were
not dug in arbitrary levels. All artifacts were collected for analysis and cataloging in
the laboratory by Ms. Fields. The project was documented by field notes and digital
photography.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at MDAH and a discussion with Terry L. McClung at
the Bienville National Forest revealed that no sites have been recorded in the
project area, and the area had not been examined by a professional archaeologist.
Two surveys (see Previous Investigations above) had been performed in the
general area. Based on the proximity of the landform to Davis Creek and previous
work in the area, the possibility of an archaeological site in the project area seemed
high. This study located historic materials through shovel testing and on the
surface. These items consisted of modern nails; two cut nails; fragments of clear
aqua, and amber glass; bricks; sandstone; a nail spike; and one piece of window
glass. It is obvious that a structure was present, and the assumption is that this site
represents the remains of a house or logging camp that was occupied during the
late 19th Century and/or early 20th Century. In addition, two chert flakes were found
during the shovel testing phase of the survey. One is a late stage flake with 25%
cortex, and it is made from heat-treated citronelle gravel chert. The other is a late
stage flake with no cortex, and it is made from tan citronelle gravel. It is a late
stage flake with no cortex. Since flakes are often found as isolated finds throughout
the Bienville National Forest, these artifacts are viewed as an isolated occurrence
rather than a separate prehistoric component. In general, the area was disturbed
through the construction of an artificial terrace, push piles, and ruts. Site 22-Sm1337 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The
approximate site boundaries are depicted in Figure 4, and the artifacts recovered
are depicted in Table 1.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 22-Sm-1337 is not considered eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places due to the disturbance of the project area, and the
fact that historic homesteads dating to the 20th Century are very common in the
area. It is, therefore, recommended that Sklar Exploration Company, LLC be
allowed to proceed with drilling as planned.
