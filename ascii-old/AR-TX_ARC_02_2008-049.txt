ABSTRACT

The City of Fort Worth intends to construct the Westside Wastewater
Treatment Plant on approximately 35 acres north of and adjacent to Old
Weatherford Road in west central Tarrant County, Texas. Associated with
the proposed plant site are two pipeline routes. One route runs from the
plant east for about 0.6 miles and is to be placed adjacent to Old
Weatherford Highway. The second pipeline route runs north of the plant
site for approximately 3,300 feet. During early June of 2008, AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
of the above proposed projects for Alan Plummer Associates, Inc. which is
doing the environmental permitting for the City of Fort Worth. No cultural
materials older than 50 years were found on the ground surface or were
uncovered in 30 shovel tests. This lack of significant cultural resources is
attributed to the inhospitable upland setting where limited surface water
supported primarily grass cover that was hospitable to bison, antelope, and
cows. Prehistoric sites are more likely to be found along the drainages and
at permanent springs while historic farmsteads are wherever wells
produced water and had access to transportation routes.
The absence of archaeological sites mimics the survey results elsewhere in
the Fort Worth Prairie, and, based upon the absence of archaeological
sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and that the City of Fort Worth be allowed
to construct the wastewater treatment plant and pipelines. The Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be advised if buried
cultural deposits are uncovered during construction, and, if found,
construction should cease immediately in that area until proper
investigations can be carried out.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Worth intends to construct the Westside Wastewater Treatment Plant on
approximately 35 acres in western Tarrant County near the Parker County border. The
proposed water plant site is located north of and adjacent to Old Weatherford Highway
approximately 1,300 feet west of the intersection of Old Weatherford and Chapin roads.
The proposed raw water pipeline route begins approximately 2,110 feet west of the above
intersection and runs east for about 3,070 feet before terminating (Figure 1). During the
first part of June of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the proposed water plant site for Alan Plummer Associates, Inc.
which is doing the environmental permitting for the City of Fort Worth.
During the survey, Alan Plummer Associates, Inc. requested that AR Consultants
investigate approximately 3,300 feet of proposed pipeline route that runs north from the
northeast corner of the proposed plant site. AR Consultants contacted the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission on June 4, 2008 and the Texas Antiquities
Permit was amended so that the pipeline route could be surveyed.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources are
present within the proposed wastewater treatment plant site and to make
recommendations about their archaeological significance, how they might be impacted by
development and to place the discovered cultural resources in a regional context. A Texas
Antiquities Permit was required since the City of Fort Worth is a political entity of the
State of Texas and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4940 was provided by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission so that the archaeological
survey could be conducted.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report contains a brief description of the
natural environment and then a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the
area as known from published sources. This is followed by the research design and the
methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation constitutes the
major part of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie, in
which the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries of
the Clear Fork of the Trinity River.
Soils in the study area belong to the Aledo-Bolar-Sanger Association which are gently
sloping to moderately steep upland loams and clays that range from shallow to deep
(Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). A variety of soils are present and include Aledo
gravelly clay loam with 1 to 8 percent slopes, Aledo-Bolar complex with 5 to 20 degree
slopes, Bolar clay loam with 3 to 5 percent slopes, Purves clay with 0 to 3 percent slopes
and Sanger clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Ressel 1981:Sheet 34). The study area is
underlain by the Lower Cretaceous-aged Goodland Formation which consists of
limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects. Therefore, the database of
information to which new projects can be compared is limited. The following culture
history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J. Prikryl
(1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the historic
Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

AD 1800 to Present
AD 1600 to AD 1850

4,000 BC to 2,000 BC
6,000 BC to 4,000 BC
ca. 11,000 BC to 6,000 BC

The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles attributed to
this period (Bever and Meltzer 2007:76). Many of the points are made of exotic cherts
that are not native to North Central Texas. The Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957)
and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001) in Denton County and the Dickie Carr site in
Parker County (Byers 2007) are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region.
Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the
active floodplain. This was a period when large mammals became extinct, and their
extinction is attributed in part to a general drying of the environment.

During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71) can
not confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
The Dickie Carr site (Byers 2007) is the only site in the vicinity of the study area to
contain both Early and Middle Archaic occupations.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors as
evidence of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990:76).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late
Archaic, and quartzite continues as the common material used for chipped stone
projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Prikrly 1990:80-82).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play an
infamous if not important role in the history of that region. Very little archaeological
evidence, however, of historic Native American occupation has been found in the North
Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas, and one which has been
suggested is due to the inability of the Native Americans to adapt to the changing climate
(Skinner 1988).
The 1830s and 1840s were decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett
(1972:24), a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost
depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half".
According to tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into
the 1860s. Strategies for dealing with the illusive aboriginal population ranged from
armed confrontation and pursuit to across-the-table dialogue. Rising from a domestic
background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston,
realized rapprochement was preferable to direct confrontation. In the summer of 1843, a
council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes signed a

treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty provided the
needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North-Central Texas area.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80). The fort as a military post was relatively shortlived. Faced with the continual westward movement of the frontier, it was decided that
Fort Worth no longer commanded a strategic place in the line of defense for settlers. In
September of 1853, troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local
population.
The Civil War took its toll on Fort Worth's population, as most of the able-bodied men
left to fight for the Confederacy. The young town's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields and both fed the population and served as an
impetus for post-World War II industrial development. The Convair plant and Tarrant
Field (later Carswell Field) had played an important role during the war, and rather than
lose their jobs the employees were retained to work on a secret project, the B-36. Once
again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as she had for so many decades.
Previous Investigations
Archaeological surveys in the vicinity of the study area are plotted on Figure 2. The only
survey not conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. is of the wastewater treatment plant, a
portion of which was surveyed by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Hunt, Peter and Morrell 1996). Two
areas were surveyed adjacent to Mary’s Creek within the Westside Recycling and
Disposal Facility which is located south of the study area. No cultural materials were
found on the surface of approximately 12 acres or in 26 shovel tests that extended to
approximately 50 cm below the ground surface.

AR Consultants, Inc. has conducted several archaeological surveys in the area (Skinner
2002; Todd 2004a, b, c, d, 2005, 2007; Craver and Skinner 2008). During these surveys,
approximately 23 miles of pipeline route and about 458 acres of land were investigated.
Shovel tests were excavated along Little Mary’s Creek, Mary’s Creek, South Mary’s
Creek, Patterson Branch and three backhoe trenches each were excavated on the banks of
the Clear Fork of the Trinity River southwest of Aledo and Little Mary’s Creek southwest
of the study area. The result of these intensive investigations is that no prehistoric
archaeological sites were recorded and only one historic site, 41PR121, which is a
homestead, was recorded.
No archaeological sites were listed within or in the immediate vicinity of the study area
according to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2008) nor are any residences plotted on
the Sam Street’s 1895 map of Tarrant County. A residence, however, is plotted where the
proposed east-west pipeline route terminates on the 1955 Aledo, Texas USGS map.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design was to insure that fieldwork would make a
contribution to the better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in the area.
Two research problems are presented below.
There is low potential for prehistoric archaeological sites being found in
the upland prairie despite the excellent ground exposure due to the
absence of reliable water sources and knappable gravels along with the
unpredictable presence of hoofed mammals and the widespread presence
of grasses that were not a viable food source for hunters and gatherers.
and,
There is little likelihood of encountering historic sites in this level and
unsheltered upland area based on their absence as shown on the maps
mentioned above despite the proximity of Old Weatherford Highway
which was a major transportation route and the ability of historic settlers
to secure water from drilled wells.
An even more basic, research problem guided the survey; simply stated the question
asked
How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they
leave behind?
Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in response to this
more open-ended research question, which guides almost all archaeological surveys.
Methodology
In order to address these questions, an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the
plant site was conducted by walking north-south oriented transects spaced approximately
30 meters apart. The Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) recommends that 18 shovel
tests should be excavated within the plant area. This recommendation was followed and
slightly exceeded. Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 30 cm below the ground
surface since cultural materials would deflate onto the ground surface in this upland
setting. Shovel tests were not excavated in disturbed areas or areas with 30 percent or
better ground surface visibility. The clay matrices were not screened, but were broken
manually and visually inspected for cultural materials. The pit walls were examined for
cultural materials as well. Notes on the terrain, vegetation and other relevant material
were made and photographs were taken. The two pipeline routes have a right-of-way of
50 feet and the pipeline route adjacent to the Old Weatherford Highway was visually
evaluated while the north-south pipeline route was walked by the archaeologists spaced

15 meters apart and shovel tested. Shovel testing was done on a judgmental basis in the
upland setting as recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002).
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the upland setting and absence of a floodplain
where cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
The results section is divided into various parts. The survey of the plant area is discussed
first and followed by the evaluation of the proposed pipeline adjacent to Old Weatherford
Highway. Next, the north-south pipeline route north of the plant site is discussed.
Conclusions derived from the survey end the chapter. Shovel tests are described generally
in the text, but specific information is provided in Table 1. Shovel tests are plotted on
Figure 5. Mr. Tim Capps of Alan Plummer Associates, Inc. accompanied the
archaeologists during the survey.
Plant site survey
The terrain ranges from generally level to moderately sloping. A ridge that slopes to the
southwest is present in the eastern portion of the plant area. Vegetation includes mesquite
trees, prickly pear cactus, grama grasses, johnson grass, Indian paint brush, wine cup,
basketflower and other grass species (Figure 3). An intermittent drainage runs through
3the western portion of the plant area ranges from 1 to 1.5 m deep and ranges from 2 to 5
m wide. The drainage was dry and has a clay substrate containing limestone gravel and
cobbles. Ground visibility of the plant site ranged from less than 10 to 100 percent
(Figure 4). Interestingly, ground visibility was greater along the upper slopes instead of
on top of the ridge. Eye-height visibility was excellent.
Survey began in the southwest corner and went north. Twenty-six culturally sterile shovel
tests were excavated within the plant site. Either clay was encountered from 33 to 37 cm
bs or clay overlying bedrock limestone was uncovered at depths ranging from 5 to 28 cm
bs. Based upon previous experience in the area, it was expected that limestone bedrock
would outcrop on the ridge top; however, shallow soil was present. The soil must have
been more resistant to erosion than that on other ridges. No cultural materials older than
50 years were noted on the ground surface.
Pipeline adjacent to Old Weatherford Highway
The proposed pipeline route begins within the plant site and runs east for approximately
3,070 feet east of the plant site, crossing Old Weatherford once (Figure 1). As previously
mentioned, this portion of the route was evaluated. The pipeline right-of-way ranges from
2 to 5 m from Old Weatherford Highway and just inside fence lines through unimproved
pastures (Figure 6). No signature plants, cultural features, residential structures or
locations likely to contain prehistoric cultural materials were seen along the route until
the eastern end.

According to the 1955, USGS map, a historic residence would be present where the
pipeline route terminates. Only barn structures and concrete and metal water troughs
were found. No cistern, well, storm cellar, house foundation, signature plant or other
historic cultural features were found. The residence had been removed during the
construction of a petroleum pipeline route that runs north-south east of the proposed
pipeline route. No shovel tests were excavated due to the 50 to 100 percent ground
visibility.
North-south pipeline route
The north-south pipeline route begins at the northeastern corner of the plant site and is to
be placed approximately 40 feet west of an existing petroleum pipeline. Vegetation was
similar to that of the plant site except that occasionally a bois d’arc or hackberry tree was
encountered. Ground visibility was better than at the plant site on the ridge slopes. Eyeheight visibility was excellent. Four shovel tests (27-30) were excavated on ridges and a
slope along the route. Shovel tests 27, 28 and 29 encountered culturally sterile clay
overlying limestone bedrock from 5 to 12 cm bs. Shovel test 30 was excavated on a broad
saddle and uncovered 30 cm of culturally sterile clay. No cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface.
Conclusions
As predicted, no prehistoric archaeological sites were discovered in the upland setting
where the plant and pipelines are to be constructed. This result is similar to other
archaeological surveys in the area. The surrounding area is interesting for this reason.
One would expect that prehistoric sites would be present adjacent to Little Mary’s, South
Mary’s, and Mary’s creeks; however, intensive shovel testing and deep trenching have
not yielded buried cultural materials and none were noted on the surface. Although the
above drainages are mapped as perennial, and we have not seen them dry, the prehistoric
inhabitants may have preferred to camp at seep springs further upstream or along
drainages such as the Clear Fork of the Trinity River where water was present year round
and where a wider variety of animal and plant species grew.
Historic sites were not found although historic farmsteads are present scattered
throughout the surrounding upland. The plant site and pipeline routes apparently we used
as pastures despite the presence of the Old Weatherford Highway.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that the City of Fort Worth be allowed to construct the wastewater treatment plant and
associated pipelines without the need for further cultural resource investigations. We
further recommend that construction supervisors be advised that buried archaeological
materials could be uncovered during construction, although we deem it very unlikely. If
this situation should arise, work should immediately cease in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be advised of the
discovery.
