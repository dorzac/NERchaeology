ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the East and West Materials Management Sites (MMS) project located within the
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property in Dallas and Tarrant counties,
Texas. The proposed project pertains to the development of two construction materials
management pad sites. The direct APE for the project encompasses a total of
approximately 305.8 acres (ac) and is divided into two areas. The 182-ac East MMS
APE is situated between Runway 35R/17L and Runway 31R/13L; located approximately
0.5 mile (mi) west of the intersection of Valley View Lane and North Belt Line Road.
The 123.8-ac West MMS APE is situated southwest of Runway 13R/31L; located
approximately 0.35 mi east of the intersection of State Highway (SH) 360 Service Road
and Euless Grapevine Road. Approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to reflect the permanent
alterations on the DFW property. Since the ALP is considered a federal action, the
project will require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, as the DFW is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). This cultural resources
inventory survey was conducted by Principal Investigator Christopher Goodmaster,
Project Archeologist Anne Gibson, and Field Technician Pat Donahue on 30 November
2017, 05 and 06 December 2017, and 02 February 2018. All work conformed to 13
Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT,
and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8215. During the survey, one
previously recorded multi-component archeological site (41TR126) was revisited and
two new historic-age archeological sites (41TR310 and 41TR311) were documented
within the West MMS APE. No cultural resources were encountered within the East
MMS APE. Based on the degree of prior disturbance and lack of contextual integrity,
none of these sites are recommended to be eligible for listing on the NRHP or designation
as a SAL.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural
resources are encountered during construction, the operators should stop construction
activities, and immediately contact the project environmental representative to initiate
coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to resuming any
construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The
purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and
to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT; Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state
regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]). A description of the
proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical contexts, field and
analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the identified cultural
resources are provided in this document. Prepared in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the NHPA Section 106 and the ACT requirements of the
proposed project.

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for the DFW, IES performed an intensive cultural resources
survey for the development of the East and West Materials Management Sites (MMS). The proposed
project pertains to the development of two locations for the stockpiling, storage, and management of
construction materials within the DFW property in Dallas and Tarrant counties, Texas (Figures 1.1 and
1.2). Approval will be required from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport
Layout Plan (ALP) that will reflect the permanent alterations to the DFW property. Since this is
considered a federal action, the project will consequently require compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the NHPA. In addition, as the DFW is a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
This report documents the cultural resources investigations conducted in support of the proposed project.
The goal of this survey was to locate, identify, and assess archeological sites, buildings, structures, or
other cultural resources within the proposed APE that may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
designation as SALs. All investigations were conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26,
which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively.
This survey was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8215.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The direct APE for the project encompasses a total of approximately 305.8 acres (ac) and is divided into
two areas. The 182-ac East MMS APE is situated between Runway 35R/17L and Runway 31R/13L and
located approximately 0.5 mile (mi) west of the intersection of Valley View Lane and North Belt Line
Road. The 123.8-ac West MMS APE is located southwest of Runway 13R/31L, approximately 0.35 mi
east of the intersection of State Highway (SH) 360 Service Road and Euless Grapevine Road.
Although the final project designs were not available at the time of this report, preliminary plans call for
the development of two construction materials management locations and associated access roads.
Ground disturbances associated with this construction will include tree grubbing, vegetation clearing,
topsoil stripping, erosion control, and the stockpiling of soil, asphalt, and concrete rubble. While
subsurface impacts will occur as a result of these activities, it is anticipated that they will be restricted to
depths of less than 3 feet (ft).

Indirect APE
As the project will require approval from the FAA, an assessment of indirect effects is required to comply
with the NHPA. However, since elements of this project will remain at the ground surface, and no
historic properties are located near the proposed APE, it is not anticipated that any indirect visual impacts
would result from the proposed undertaking and were not assessed as part of this project.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Dallas and Tarrant counties are located in the north central portion of the State of Texas. This region has
a humid subtropical climate and an average annual rainfall ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches
(in; 89 to 102 centimeters [cm]). About half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with July
and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively
mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl
2008).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is irregularly
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries of surrounding streams. The periphery of the DFW
property contains more dramatic topography with incised drainages and named waterways, particularly
along the western, southern, and eastern limits. The transition of the gently sloping upland ridges to the
low-lying Big Bear Creek valley floor correlates to a transition from the more stable, clay-rich Blackland
Prairie soils to the more erosive, sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological region. The East MMS APE
is located on an interfluvial upland saddle between the headwaters of a tributary of Hackberry Creek to
the north and South Fork Hackberry Creek to the south of the APE (see Figure 1.2). Elevations within
the East MMS APE range from 500 to 540 ft (152 to 165 meters [m]) above modern sea level (amsl). The
West MMS APE is located along an upland escarpment above the Bear Creek valley. Several unnamed
tributaries of Bear Creek dissect the APE and extend southwest to Bear Creek (see Figure 1.2).
Elevations within the West MMS APE range from 520 to 580 ft (158 to 177 m) amsl.
Geology and Vegetation
The DFW property is located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the
Northern Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregions (McGowen et al. 1987). Variation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying regional geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The
Blackland Prairie occupies the Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) while the Woodbine Formation (Kwb)
underlies the Cross Timbers (Figure 2.1). The natural divide between these two geological formations
parallels Big Bear Creek, which extends from the northwest to the southeast through the western portion
of the DFW property.
The East MMS APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie of the Texas Blackland Prairie
ecoregion. This area is distinguished from surrounding regions by the gently rolling hills and finetextured, black clayey soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Vertisols dominate the Blackland
Prairie ecoregion and consist of high clay content that has significant shrink and swell potential (Ressel
1981). Most of the prairie has been converted to cropland, non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses
around Dallas, Waco, Austin, and San Antonio. Historical vegetation included little bluestem, big
bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, and tall dropseed. The East MMS APE is underlain by the Eagle Ford
(Kef) geological formation (McGowen et al. 1987; see Figure 2.1). The Eagle Ford Formation dates to
the late Cretaceous and is comprised of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone,
which grades upward into highly plastic clay (Coffee et al 1980, McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2017). It is
the westernmost and oldest geological group within the Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al 1987).

The West MMS APE is situated within the Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregion. The area was historically
characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills orientated along a north/south axis from
Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994; McGowen et al. 1987). This region contains
countless hills that were once heavily wooded consisting of oak, walnut, blackjack, and hickory trees that
grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the region as the Monte Grande (Grand
Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban expansion, agricultural development, and
other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become highly fragmented, and only a few large tracts
of undisturbed woodlands remain today (TPWD 2017). The West MMS APE is underlain by the
Cretaceous-age Woodbine Formation (Kwb; see Figure 2.1). The Woodbine Formation underlies the
Eagle Ford Formation and is primarily sandstone and contains a small percentage of siltstone, mudstone,
and clay.
Soils
As shown by the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas, and the Soil Survey of Tarrant County, Texas, there
are 15 mapped soil units within the APE (Coffee et al. 1980; Ressel 1981; Figure 2.2; Table 2.1).
Approximately 95.4 percent of the West MMS APE contains soils typical of upland landforms within the
Eastern Cross Timbers while 4.6 percent of the West MMS APE contains soils typical of fluvial settings.
Approximately 96.2 percent of the East MMS APE contains soils typical of upland settings within the
Northern Blackland Prairie. The remaining 3.8 percent pertains to frequently flooded soils near the South
Fork Hackberry Creek. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (USDA 2017).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC, indicates that 17 previous
professional cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the vicinity (i.e., 1 mi [1.6 kilometers
(km)]) of the East MMS and West MMS APEs (Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). In addition to these professional
surveys conducted for compliance purposes, one academic survey (Prikryl 1987; 1990) included a limited
archeological reconnaissance survey along Bear Creek in proximity to the APE. As a result of these prior
surveys, six archeological sites have been previously recorded in the vicinity of the East MMS APE and
23 archeological sites have been previously recorded in the vicinity of the West MMS APE (Table 3.2),
including one previously recorded archeological site (41TR127) within the West MMS APE (Table 3.3).
TASA records further indicate that no National Register properties, historical markers, or cemeteries are
located within the APE (TASA 2017).

In 1991, Greiner, Inc. conducted an archeological survey for the proposed DFW Runway 16/34 West
(Klein et al. 1991). Although the runway was not constructed as proposed, the survey area included the
western half of current West MMS APE. Of the four archeological sites documented during the 1991
survey, one historic-age site (41TR126) was documented within the current West MMS APE. Site
41TR126 comprises the former location of a farmstead occupied from 1860 to the 1940s and was
attributed to the Estill family (Klein et al. 1991:45). Additional fieldwork and archival research was
recommended to evaluate the NRHP-eligibility of the site (Klein et al. 1991:49â50). Based on the results
of the site evaluation, 41TR126 was recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation
as a SAL due to the nature of the potential features, dense artifact deposits dating to the late 19th century,
and potential of the site to preserve important information that could contribute the understanding of local
and regional history (Klein et al. 1992).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional resources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These resources included soil survey data
(Coffee et al. 1980; NRCS 2017; Ressel 1981), geological data (McGowen et al. 1987), the TxDOT
Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the National Archives and Records Administrationâs
(NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Dallas and Tarrant counties, the Texas Historic
Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, historic and modern aerial photography and satellite imagery, and
the results and recommendations of previous cultural resources surveys conducted within the vicinity
(Ferring 1994; Klein et al. 1991, 1992; Prikryl 1990; Shelton et al 2008).
Direct APE
Archeological Resources Potential
The TxDOT PALM for the Dallas and Fort Worth districts indicates that most of the West MMS APE
possesses a moderate to high potential for containing shallow prehistoric cultural resources and a low
potential for deeply buried cultural resources. The portion of the West MMS APE surrounding the
unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek contains a moderate to high potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric cultural resources. The southern corner of the West MMS APE features a low potential for
containing shallow and deeply buried prehistorical cultural resources.
Approximately 79 percent of the East MMS APE features a low potential for containing shallow and
deeply buried prehistorical cultural resources. Approximately 12 percent of the East MMS APE features
a moderate potential for containing shallow prehistoric cultural resources. These areas are clustered
within portions of the northern corner and the southern half of the East MMS APE. The remaining
portion of the East MMS APE features a moderate to high potential for encountering prehistoric cultural
resources. These areas correspond to portions of the APE surrounding the unnamed tributary of South
Fork Hackberry Creek.
In 2007 and 2008, ARC conducted intensive pedestrian surveys within 1,210 ac of the DFW property
(Shelton et al 2008). Through this study, three environmental zones were identified within the DFW that
contain varying degrees of cultural resources potential. The current APE will have ground disturbances
within all three zones (Figure 3.2). Zone 1 is comprised of the Blackland Prairie Uplands ecoregion,
which consists of mostly level clay or clay loam soils over a thin layer of limestone bedrock. Water
permeates very slowly to the water table causing slow surface runoff and high shrink and swell potential.
This setting has a low biotic diversity and is dominated by short grasses. Due to the limited resources
available within the area, it has a low probability for containing prehistoric archeological sites (Shelton et
al. 2008). The entire East MMS APE and approximately 1 percent of the West MMS APE are located
within the Zone 1 environmental region within the DFW. Zone 2 is typified by a wide range of well-

drained soil types ranging from those with high clay content to sandy loams located on uplands, ridges,
terraces, tributary streams, and valleys. Accordingly, these soils supported a wide range of vegetation and
dense stands of old growth trees during the prehistoric period. The upland soils are moderately well
suited for cropland, pastureland, or urban development and the area has been well utilized for agricultural
purposes since early historic settlement. Thus, Zone 2 is considered to have a high potential for
containing both prehistoric and historic sites (Shelton et al. 2008). Approximately 90 percent of the West
MMS APE lies within Zone 2. Zone 3 is a narrow band of alluvial floodplain adjacent to Little Bear
Creek, Big Bear Creek, and Bear Creek. Because the loamy soils in this zone are frequently flooded, the
land is mostly used as pasture. Cultural resources are low to nonexistent in the floodplain due to heavy
modification of top soils by agriculture over the past century and the lack of previously recorded deeply
buried prehistoric sites in the Bear Creek floodplain (Shelton et al. 2008). Approximately 9 percent of The
West MMS APE is within Bear Creek Floodplain (Zone 3) environmental region within the DFW.
Through a review of the previously defined environmental zones within the DFW property (Shelton et al.
2008), TxDOT PALM data, and previous land disturbance, it was determined that the majority of the East
MMS APE features a low potential for containing shallow or deeply buried prehistoric cultural materials.
A 6-acre portion of the East MMS APE along the southern boundary features a moderate potential for
containing prehistoric cultural materials due to the proximity to the unnamed tributary of South Fork
Hackberry Creek. Approximately 90 percent of West MMS APE features a moderate potential for
containing shallow prehistoric cultural materials. The remaining 10 percent of the West MMS APE
within the southern portion of the APE contains low to negligible potential due to extensive previous
ground disturbances.
Due to the previously identified site 41TR126 and previous archeological survey results, the northern
portion of the West MMS APE features a high potential for encountering historic-period cultural
resources. The remaining portion of the West MMS APE and the entire East MMS APE is considered to
have a low potential for encountering historic-period cultural resources.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
Based on a review of historic maps and aerial photographs, the APE was largely devoid of historic-period
structures. Aerial photographs illustrate that the APE was used primarily for agricultural and pastoral
purposes until airport-related development took place in the vicinity in the 1970s. Based on historic and
modern aerial photographs, there is a negligible potential for the presence of historic period standing
buildings or structures within the indirect APE.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
Prior to fieldwork, the IES staff conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine
previously recorded resources within the APE and within a 1-mi (1.6-km) radius of the direct APE (see
Section 3.1). IES staff also reviewed ecological, geological, and soils data, as well as historical and
modern topographic maps and aerial photography of the APE. The archeological survey for the East and
West MMS Project was conducted on 30 November 2017, 05 and 06 December 2017, and 02 February
2018. The methods utilized during this survey exceed the minimum archeological survey standards
requirements for field investigations recommended by the CTA (CTA 1996, 2001), as approved by the
THC.

4.1 Survey Methods
Due to the highly variable archeological/environmental zones within the East MMS APE and the West
MMS APE segments (as previously defined by Shelton et al. 2008; see Figure 3.2), this survey utilized
two survey methodologies. Areas within the APE that displayed high levels of disturbance were
photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation
methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
West MMS APE Survey Design
Since the 123.8-ac West MMS APE is located within Zones 2 and 3, the survey within the West MMS
APE consisted of a 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey. The survey consisted of a multiple transect
scheme that spanned the entire length of the APE. Pedestrian transect intervals were 30 m wide and
orientated in north/south or northeast/southwest orientations. Shovel tests were excavated semisystematically along the transects. CTA survey standards recommend that an APE of 123.8 acres,
displaying little to no disturbance, should have approximately 42 shovel tests (1 shovel test per 3 acres)
excavated during the pedestrian survey. During this survey, 112 shovel tests were excavated within the
West MMS APE.
East MMS APE Survey Design
For the approximately 182 acres of the East MMS APE, which is located within the Zone 1 (Blackland
Prairie) setting, the intensive pedestrian survey within the East MMS APE was limited to high probability
areas (HPA). To develop HPA for prehistoric archeological sites, areas containing moderate and high
potential identified within the TxDOT PALM were selected within the APE. For historic-period HPA,
structure locations identified within georeferenced historical maps and data provided by the DFW was
buffered to include a 1-acre area surrounding each identified feature. Final HPA limits were determined
by comparing initial probability data to current land use, past disturbance, previous survey limits, and the
combined historic and prehistoric HPA. For example, areas identified as containing historic-age
buildings through archival research, but presently located within a developed setting, were not considered
HPA within the final model. HPA did not denote the specific limits of a given survey but were expanded
or contracted depending on field observations. HPA identified for survey are represented within Figure
4.1. Areas outside designated HPA were assessed through pedestrian survey and/or aerial photography.
Representative photographs detailing the low potential for intact archeological deposits outside the
identified HPA were recorded.
Although the East MMS APE segment occupies approximately 182 acres, the identified HPA acreage was
only approximately 10.5 acres. Although HPA methodology is not discussed within the CTA survey
standards, using the standards as a guideline, two shovel tests were anticipated for each HPA acre.
However, shovel test numbers varied from this amount based on the exact limit of cultural material, the
level of disturbance, erosion, and steep slope observed during the pedestrian survey.

Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for preserving archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of
culturally sterile deposits, typically to the argillic (Bt) subsoil horizon. Shovel tests were at least 30 cm in
diameter and were hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness.
Excavated soil was screened using 0.25-in hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural
materials. When high clay content soils were encountered and could not be efficiently screened, material
was manually troweled and inspected for cultural deposits. Additionally, the physical properties of each
natural soil stratum were recorded. All shovel test locations were recorded and plotted using a Trimble
GeoXT handheld global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Investigators documented the results of each
test on standardized shovel test forms.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in, ft,
mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., cm,
m, km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.
Archival Research
Historic-aged maps and aerial photographs encompassing the direct APE and indirect APE were reviewed
to determine the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years old) structures. Deed/title research
was conducted for archeological sites that contained evidence of historic-period site components and
historic-period architectural resources. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons that were
possibly associated with any resource documented during this survey. Initial research was carried out by
examining deed and land title records from the Dallas County and Tarrant County Clerkâs offices. The
historic significance of identified persons associated with each resource were also researched using The
Handbook of Texas Online database and within various local history publications.
Site Recording
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources.
The recognition of a âsiteâ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent. Content may refer
to artifacts or cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or
other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal
spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more
artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically
a 400 square meter [m2] [0.1-ac] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts
and cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in
buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where
an excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test) yields cultural materials, additional delineation
excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of the site is defined
within the extent of positive excavations. Archeological sites may also be defined within the extent of
surface artifacts or features and culturally positive excavations when both are present.
Cultural remains, meeting these criteria, are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to TARL to be included in the TASA database. Conversely, discovery of
cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human
activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e., less
than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content documented. Depending on
depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
for designation as SALs. Cultural isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
or for designation as SALs because of their failure to meet the site definition and their inability to
contribute important information to the understanding of history or prehistory.

4.2 Site Evaluation
Each identified archeological site was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a
scaled site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and
potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as an SAL. When applicable, a variety of
data were used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety,
feature density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous
disturbance.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria for evaluating properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the
authority of the NHPA, as amended (36 CFR Part 60.4 [aâd]), and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate
that â[t]he term âeligible for inclusion in the National Registerâ includes both properties formally
determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register
listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is
included in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR Part 60.4(aâd)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural
resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D
is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,
document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs (9 TNRC 191). A SAL is an archeological site, archeological collection, ruin,
building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district that
is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. The State of
Texas considers all publicly-owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures to have some
intrinsic historic value, and the ACT provides some level of protection for those sites, buildings, or
East and West Materials Management Sites Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.052
Page 20

structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to currently yield data that will contribute important
information on the history or prehistory of Texas. Additionally, these publicly-owned archeological sites
and historic buildings and structures are protected from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or
destroy them, and information directly related to the specific location of archeological sites is restricted
from open records requests. However, not all cultural resources are equally significant to the history and
prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant longterm preservation or investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and
structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether
cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological
testing and data recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit
issuance, and rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. Archeological sites and historic buildings
and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political subdivisions of the state of Texas are
eligible to be designated as landmarks (9 TNRC 191.091 and 191.092). Also protected, under 9 TNRC
191.094, are specially designated landmarks on private property.
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the ACT
permit process:
Criterion 1:
Criterion 2:
Criterion 3:
Criterion 4:
Criterion 5:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
the siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1: the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents
a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive
director of the commission; and
Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the NRHP, either
individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as determined by the
Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission (13 TAC 26.19).

The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards and submitted for
curation.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
Background and archival research conducted in preparation for this cultural resources survey indicated
that at least 18 prior cultural resources investigations have taken place within 1 mi (1.6 km) of the
proposed APE. As a result of these prior surveys, six archeological sites have been previously recorded
in the vicinity of the East MMS APE and 23 archeological sites have been previously recorded in the
vicinity of the West MMS APE (see Table 3.2), including one previously recorded archeological site
(41TR127) within the West MMS APE. During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to
reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance was
conducted across the entire West MMS APE and portions of the East MMS APE to confirm the extent of
prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground surface
visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Intensive
survey with systematic shovel test sampling in staggered intervals was conducted across the portions of
the APE with the potential to contain archeological resources. During this survey, one previously
recorded multi-component archeological site (41TR126) was revisited and two new historic-period
archeological sites (41TR310 and 41TR311) were encountered within the West MMS APE. No cultural
resources were documented within the East MMS APE. Archival research and deed/title chains were
conducted to evaluate the historic-period sites and site components.

5.1 Archeological Survey
West MMS APE
Prior Ground Disturbances
A review of historic maps and aerial photographs, conducted prior to field survey, indicate that much of
the West MMS APE has been exposed to some degree of prior ground disturbance. These disturbances
are primarily related to past agricultural or pastoral use during the late-19th and early 20th centuries and
later 20th-century development of the DFW property. More significant disturbances were present within
the APE but were identified within smaller, relatively localized areas.
Aerial photography from 1942 illustrates that the APE contained fields, pastures, and small, undisturbed
land tracts dominated by mixed hardwood forest. Between 1942 and 1953, a pipeline was installed in a
north-to-south orientation across the southern half of the APE. In the late 1960s and early 1970s,
properties within and surrounding the APE were purchased for development of DFW. During this time,
several large farms were demolished and many of the fields and pastures fell into disuse and began to be
succeeded by dense, woody secondary growth.
By 1990, the airport had constructed Runway 13R/31L and an associated culvert and concrete drainage
channel along the northern and eastern boundaries of the APE. The DFW Fire Training Center and DFW
Fire Training Research Center, located south of the APE, were also constructed during this DFW western
expansion. At this time, several dirt roads were created by vehicular traffic and traversed the central and
southern portions of the APE. These unimproved roads appear to have been used to dump construction
debris within several discrete locations throughout the APE.
In 2008, a natural gas pipeline with an associated pad site and pond were constructed along the southern
and western boundary of the APE. No other significant disturbances have occurred since 2008. The APE
now consists almost entirely of dense, mixed, hardwood forest.
Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, 14 positive and 82 negative shovel tests were excavated within the West
MMS APE (Figure 5.1). Shovel testing was conducted within portions of the APE with the potential to
contain buried cultural deposits (Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 4). The remaining portion of the
APE was determined to have been significantly disturbed and contained negligible potential for subsurface

cultural deposits. Subsequently, these areas were visually assessed and photographed during transect
survey (Appendix A, Photographs 5 through 14).
Soils exposed within shovel tests within the APE revealed a profile that transitioned near the unnamed
tributary of Bear Creek. North of the unnamed tributary, soils were generally characterized as loose
sandy loam with gravel overlaying compact sandy clay loam. Soils ranged from a medium reddish-brown
(7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam near the surface to a compact, reddish-brown (7.5 YR 4/5 and 7.5 YR 4/6) clay
loam in the northern portion of the APE. South of the tributary, clay loam or sandy loam soils were more
commonly encountered. In the south part of the APE, the soils were a medium brownish-black (10YR
4/4) sandy loam surface layer overlying a compact reddish-brown (7.5YR 3/2 or 3/3) clay loam subsoil.
As a result of shallow Holocene-aged soils, the maximum depth of the shovel tests was approximately 40
cm below surface (cmbs) with the majority terminating between 20 to 30 cmbs. Because a portion of the
central and southern portions of the APE was previously used to stockpile soil, construction fill, and
modern debris, the area was heavily disturbed as indicated by the presence of push piles and disturbed,
mottled soils.
During the survey, archeologists encountered several small scatters of modern trash as well as metal or
concrete markers/signs denoting the location of buried cables or pipelines (Appendix A, Photographs 15
through 18). Near the DFW Fire Training Center, the fuselage of a Convair 640 Kitty Hawk Aircargo
airplane was observed north of an unimproved access road (Appendix A, Photographs 19 and 20). The
cargo plane had been stripped of its cockpit, wings, and tail section, and was used for training exercises at
the nearby facility until early or mid-2017.
East MMS APE
Prior Ground Disturbances
Historical aerial photography and topographic maps illustrate that most of property within the APE was
used as agricultural land and/or pastureland as early as 1942. However, it can be assumed that this land
use has persisted since at least the late-19th century. USGS topographic maps identify the South Fork of
Hackberry Creek extending along the southern boundary of the APE. Historical aerial photography
illustrates that the areas adjacent to the creek were relatively unmodified until between 1995 and 2001,
when the creek was channelized and a culvert was constructed adjacent to the APE.
In the early 1970s, the expansion of DFW began on neighboring tracts. During this time, large-scale
construction of Runways 31R/13L and 35R/17L, taxiways, fence lines, associated access roadways, other
components, and general vegetation clearing were conducted. Agricultural activities within the APE
ceased around this time with the exception of a field in the southern portion of the APE that was used
until the early 1990s.
During the 1970s, an electric substation was installed north of Valley View Lane and in the southeast
corner of the APE. Prior to the fall of 2007, a gravel road was constructed that extended along the eastern
boundary of the APE from the substation to a small pad site at the northern edge of the APE. In 2008, a
natural gas pad site was built along the gravel road and just north of the substation. At present, the
substation is still in operation, but the gravel road and pad sites are no longer in use.
Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, 17 negative shovel tests were excavated within portions of the APE that
featured high probability for containing buried cultural deposits (Figure 5.2). Shovel testing was mostly
conducted near the former location of a possible historic-aged structure and in areas determined to have
an elevated potential for prehistoric cultural materials (Appendix A, Photographs 21 through 23). The
remaining portion of the APE was determined to have been heavily disturbed and contained negligible
potential for subsurface cultural deposits. Subsequently, these areas were visually assessed and
photographed (Appendix A, Photographs 24 and 25). At the time of survey, the portion of the APE

within the northern and central HPA featured densely overgrown forest while the southernmost HPA
contained open grassland.
Soil profiles exposed in shovel tests excavated within the East MMS APE exhibited predominantly clay
and clay loam soils. A dark brownish black (10YR 2/2, 10YR 3/2, or 10YR 4/4) surface layer typically
extended to a depth of 30 cmbs. Light reddish brown (2.5YR 7/3) clay loam, beginning between 20 to 30
cmbs, was observed in a few shovel tests in the northern and southern HPAs. As a result of shallow and
disturbed Holocene-aged soils, the average depth of the majority of the shovel tests was approximately 30
cmbs. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures including animal burrows and disturbed patches
were examined. No cultural resources were encountered within the East MMS APE. Pedestrian and
intensive surveys conducted within the East MMS APE revealed that there are no soils suitable for
containing deeply buried cultural material within the APE.

5.2 Encountered Resources
41TR126
Site 41TR126, originally recorded in 1990 during a cultural resources survey for a proposed new runway
(Klein et al. 1991), was identified as a late 19th to early 20th century farmstead with a minor prehistoric
component. The site was evaluated for its NRHP-eligibility through subsequent fieldwork and was
recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP due to its potential to yield information important in
understanding regional history (Klein et al. 1992). During the IES survey, this previously recorded multicomponent site within the north central portion of the West MMS APE was revisited.
Previous Investigations
During the 1991 archeological survey for the proposed DFW Runway 16/34 West, site 41TR126 was
identified as the former location of a farmstead occupied from the 1860s to the 1940s and was attributed
to the Estill family (Klein et al. 1991:39, 44â46). One 1 m2 excavation unit and five shovel tests were
excavated within the site at the time of its discovery, which yielded materials that included historic-period
ceramic sherds (whiteware, ironstone, and yellowware), bottle and container glass (aqua, white, and
colorless), window glass, metal fragments, brick fragments, nails (cut and wire), and a wire staple at or
near the surface. Additionally, a single piece of prehistoric chipped lithic debitage was recovered during
the initial survey. The extent of the site, however, was not completely delineated at the time of its
discovery.
Based on the data recovered, field observations, and comparative studies of north central Texas
farmsteads, additional fieldwork and archival research was conducted at 41TR126 to evaluate the NRHPeligibility of the site (Klein et al. 1992). Previous archival research focused on developing a historical
context for the site, including Jefferson Estill and his immediate family (Klein et al. 1992:19â21). The
site evaluation fieldwork consisted of a proton magnetometer survey of a 20-m-by-60-m area and the
excavation of seven test units and a hand-excavated trench. The units were situated around the anomalies
identified by the magnetometer survey. Three of the excavation units (E45/S10, E45S15, E45/S20) were
placed at the location of the sandstone slabs. One excavation unit (E50/S45) was placed at the location of
the potential cellar. The remaining three excavation units were placed based on surface observations.
Cultural deposits ranged from 12 cmbs to 28 cmbs across much of the site, with deeper deposits that
ranged from 56 cmbs to 109 cmbs in the potential cellar area. A trench was then hand-excavated,
extending south from Unit E50/S45 to better define the margin of the possible cellar feature; however, the
edge of the feature was not located. Sterile soil was observed beneath the initial humus layer within the
trench and no cultural materials were observed throughout the trench, which is in sharp contrast to the
more than 3,000 cultural materials recovered within the Unit E50/S45. The excavation of Units E45/S10,
E45S15, and E45/S20 exposed a sandstone-lined well, initially suggested by the results of the
magnetometer survey, near the location of the large sandstone slabs on the ground surface. The well was
encircled by the remnants of a builderâs trench and was likely capped by the two large sandstone slabs.

Cultural Resources Survey Report

The well was empty to a depth of approximately 8 ft below surface; however, the crew was unable to test
the interior of the well. The westernmost unit (E30/S35) identified a buried historic sheet midden lens
that included a sparse prehistoric component. Prehistoric artifacts recovered within the site included a
projectile point, fire-cracked rock, and lithic debitage.
Based on the results of the 1991 evaluation of 41TR126, the site was recommended eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as a SAL due to the nature of the well and possible cellar feature,
artifact deposits dating to the late 19th century, and potential of the site to preserve important information
that could contribute the understanding of local and regional history (Klein et al. 1992:41).
Survey Observations and Shovel Testing
During the current survey, the site was revisited, more completely delineated, and thoroughly reevaluated. The site is situated near the summit of an upland ridge above an unnamed tributary of Bear
Creek. An abandoned roadbed and fenceline extend east-to-west, immediately north of the site, along the
northern portion of the West MMS APE boundary. An additional fence was observed extending north-tosouth in the eastern portion of the site. Much of the site area was densely overgrown with a variety of
woody and herbaceous understory species; however, four large oak trees were observed within the central
portion of the site (Appendix A, Photographs 26 and 27). These large trees were noted during previous
investigations and allowed for the prior excavation data to be generally georeferenced for use during the
current investigation. In addition, several roughly-shaped, generally rectangular sandstone slabs were
observed in the central portion of the site (Appendix A, Photograph 28). A square wooden stake was
also observed within the central portion of the site (Appendix A, Photograph 29). This stake is likely
related to the geophysical survey grid or excavation units conducted during the previous investigation.
A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated at 41TR126 by IES to more adequately delineate the site
boundary (Figure 5.3). Shovel tests (n=25) were generally excavated along a grid oriented to the cardinal
directions at 20-m intervals within the West MMS APE. An additional two shovel tests (CG18 and
CG19) were excavated adjacent to the well and possible cellar feature locations encountered during the
previous site evaluation to more adequately sample those areas. The shovel test grid was extended until
negative shovel tests were encountered in all directions within the APE. To maintain stratigraphic control
and monitor depths of artifact recovery within the site, an attempt was made to excavate site delineation
shovel tests in 10-cm arbitrary levels; however, loose, sandy surface soils made shovel excavation of
precise 10-cm levels difficult. Negative shovel tests were not encountered along the northern portion of
the site, which coincided with the APE boundary. Limited shovel testing (n=2) was previously conducted
north of the current APE during the 1991 archeological survey. Although the present site boundary
coincides with a fence and an abandoned road, the site has not been formally delineated outside of the
current APE boundary.
In total, 12 shovel tests encountered buried cultural materials within site 41TR126. Depths of artifacts
ranged from 0 to 40 cmbs. All positive s hovel tests included historic-period artifacts (Tables 5.1 and
5.2). Historic-period artifacts at the site (n=173) were comprised primarily of domestic food storage and
serving related items, including decorated and undecorated refined earthenwares, stonewares, and a
variety of container glass (including solarized manganese glass; 1880 to 1920), consistent with a late 19th
to early 20th century farmstead. Other artifact classes represented at the site included architectural items,
including cut nails (n=24; pre-1890), wire nails (n=5; post-1890), window glass (n=23), and hand-pressed
brick fragments (n=3). A single personal item observed at the site consisted of a painted bisque porcelain
doll head fragment. The majority (77 percent; n=128) of the historic-period artifacts encountered at the
site were recovered in three shovel tests (CG5, CG18, and CG19) located on the summit of the landform
in the center of the site, in proximity to a mature oak tree and the historic-aged feature locations
documented by Klein et al. in 1991. The features previously encountered at the site, consisting of a well
and a possible cellar, were not relocated. No additional cultural features were encountered during this
investigation.

In addition to historic-period artifacts, prehistoric artifacts (n=11) were recovered in three shovel tests
(CG5, CG11, and CG18; see Tables 5.1 and 5.2). All prehistoric artifacts were identified as secondary or
late-stage chipped lithic debitage, likely derived from the manufacture and maintenance of chipped stone
tools at an undetermined time in prehistory. No temporally-diagnostic prehistoric artifacts were
recovered at the site; however, one stemmed dart point recovered during the previous investigation
suggests a Late Archaic temporal affiliation. In all cases during the current investigation, additional
historic-period artifacts were recovered at depths greater than prehistoric artifacts.
Feature 1
Feature 1 pertains to several large, roughly shaped, but not formally dressed, sandstone blocks observed
within a slight surface depression (see Appendix A, Photograph 28). These sandstone blocks are
located approximately 3.6 m (12 ft) northwest of a large, mature oak tree in the central portion of the site

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.052
Page 30

(see Figure 5.3). These stone were noted by the previous investigators and were initially assumed to be
foundation stones (Klein et al. 1991:Plate 5.3, 49). Prior evaluation and NRHP-eligibility testing
determined that the stones were related to, and perhaps once capped, the stone-lined well associated with
the site (Klein et al. 1992:36). During the current investigation, two shovel tests (CG18 and CG19) were
excavated north and south of the surface depression associated with this feature (see Figure 5.3).
Artifacts recovered within these shovel tests (see Table 5.2) consisted of domestic and architectural items
consistent with the overall site assemblage encountered during the current and previous investigations at
the site.
Site Evaluation
Site 41TR126 occupies a previously disturbed and eroded upland landform. A buried cable extends
through the northeastern portion of the site (Appendix A, Photographs 30 and 31). Soil loss is extensive
in localized areas of the site, particularly in the western portion of the site near shovel tests CG10, CG11,
and CG14 where a mature oak tree was observed to be pedestalled approximately 3 to 4 ft above the
surrounding ground surface. The artifact-bearing sandy epipedon (A and E soil horizons) was generally
shallow and variable across the site, ranging from less than to 10 cm to 40 cm in depth. Artifacts from
widely different temporal periods were co-mingled, with historic-period artifacts found stratigraphically
below prehistoric artifacts in all cases. None of the subsurface features previously documented at the site
were encountered during this investigation. The site was recommended as potentially eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and designation as a SAL (Klein et al. 1992:41); however, the results of current
IES investigation do not support such a recommendation.
Site Summary
41TR126 is a multi-component site comprising a late 19th to early 20th century farmstead and a sparse
prehistoric lithic scatter. The site was previously recorded and evaluated in the early 1990s (Klein et al.
1991; 1992). During the current investigation, the site was revisited within the West MMS APE. A total
of 27 shovel tests were excavated within the APE to more completely delineate the site and provide an
updated evaluation of the site condition. The site occupies a generally level upland summit above an
unnamed tributary of Bear Creek. The site extends approximately 116 m (380 ft) east-to-west and 60 m
(190 ft) north-to-south, encompassing a 1.16-ac area, at an elevation range of 174 to 175 m (570 to 575 ft)
amsl. A moderate subsurface assemblage of late 19th to early 20th century artifacts were encountered at
the site, with a sparse comingled prehistoric site component. No intact cultural features were encountered
during this investigation.
41TR310
During this survey, a newly recorded historic-aged archeological site (41TR310) was encountered within
the central portion of the West MMS APE (Figure 5.4). The site is situated within a small natural
drainage approximately 30 m (100 ft) east of the unnamed tributary of Bear Creek that bisects the APE.
Through the pedestrian survey and site delineation, the site was ascertained to extend approximately 30 m
(100 ft) north-to-south and 50 m (164 ft) east-to-west, encompassing a 0.21-ac area, at an elevation
ranging from 165 to 168 m (543 to 550 ft) amsl. The site comprises a scatter of ceramic, glass, and metal
artifacts dating to the mid-20th century deposited in and along an erosional gully (Appendix A,
Photographs 32 and 33). No archeological features were observed.
Previous Ground Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs, dating to as early as 1942, illustrate that the site is located within what was
the northwestern corner of an agricultural field adjacent to a densely forested area. An unimproved road
or trail, extending west from a nearby farm to the drainage, is depicted in aerial photographs dating from
the 1940s to the 1960s. The agricultural field appears to have been maintained until the 1970s or 1980s
and subsequently covered with early successional vegetation. Since that time, the land within and
surrounding the site was left undeveloped and avoided significant artificial disturbances.

Survey Observations and Shovel Testing
During the site delineation, it was determined that the majority of artifacts associated with the site were
located on or just below the ground surface within an eroded setting. Investigators observed a scatter
characterized by colorless glass bottles, whiteware, stoneware, metal paint cans, corrugated metal
sheeting, oil drums, tires, and miscellaneous scrap metal (see Appendix A, Photographs 32 and 33).
Makerâs marks embossed on the bases of glass bottles observed at the site indicate most were made
between 1930 and 1980 (Table 5.3; Appendix A, Photographs 34 to 38). In addition to diagnostic
bottles, a dime dating to 1951 was also observed within the site.

Shovel tests revealed a layer of medium reddish brown (7.5YR 4/3 and 4/4) clay loam soil. Shovel tests
was terminated at a depth of approximately 30 cmbs due to compact soil. A shovel test (AG14) north of
the scatter and near a fence line was positive. The shovel test contained two glass shards between 5 to 10
cmbs, one clear glass and one stippled amber glass bottle base (post-1940; Appendix A, Photograph 39).
Three additional shovel tests (AG15, AG16, and PD6) excavated adjacent to the positive test were
negative for cultural materials. Shovel testing was limited during the site delineation due to the siteâs
location within an erosional gully.
Archival Research
41TR310 was located within the Richard Worthington survey (Abstract No. 1655), which was patented
on 19 July 1845 and comprised 320 acres. Using public deed records from the Tarrant County Clerkâs
Office, a chain of title for the property encompassing the historic-period scatter was generated (Table
5.4). According to deed records, the property on which the site is located was purchased by the
Thomasson family in 1946. None of the names associated with these families were listed in the
Handbook of Texas, the TXGenWeb.org website, or local history volumes.

Site Summary
Site 41TR310 is a newly recorded historic-period site that contained an accumulation of historic-aged
artifacts and modern debris within a natural drainage east of an unnamed tributary of Bear Creek. The
site comprises a scatter of ceramic, glass, and metal artifacts dating to the mid-20th century deposited in
and along an erosional gully. Shovel tests excavated within the site recovered two artifacts. No
archeological features were encountered within the site.
41TR311
A newly recorded historic-period archeological site (41TR311) was documented during this survey within
the south central portion of the West MMS APE (Figure 5.5). The site is situated in an upland setting
dissected by Big Bear Creek and its tributaries. Through the pedestrian survey and site delineation, the
site was documented to extend approximately 323 m (1,060 ft) north-to-south by 14 m (45 ft) east-towest, encompassing a 1.28-ac area, at an elevation range of 169 to 175 m (555 to 575 ft) amsl. The site
comprised a linear, discontinuous scatter of ceramic, glass, silverware, and oyster shells dating to the mid20th century exposed along a pipeline right-of-way (ROW) (Appendix A, Photographs 40 to 42).
Several concentrations of artifacts were observed; however, no intact archeological features were
identified.
Past Ground Disturbances
Historical aerial photographs, dating to as early as 1942, illustrate that the site is located within what was
a densely forested area during the early to mid-20th century. Between 1942 and 1953, a pipeline was
installed in a northeast-to-southwest orientation through the southern half of the APE. This pipeline
corridor has been maintained to the present and is occasionally used as an access road for work vehicles
associated with DFW. Dense woods covered the land adjacent to the corridor until 1963, when vegetation
was cleared for a pasture. After the property was bought by the City of Fort Worth in 1969, the area was
left undisturbed and gradually became overgrown with secondary vegetative growth.
Survey Observation and Shovel Testing
A shovel test (AG43) adjacent to the pipeline corridor was positive for cultural materials. The shovel test
yielded four clear glass shards and five whiteware sherds to a depth of 20 cmbs (Appendix A,
Photograph 43). Further inspection of the corridor revealed a diffuse and discontinuous surface scatter
of ceramic dining ware, glass, eating utensils, and oyster shells. Parts of plates, tea cups/mugs, and
serving dishes decorated with simple patterns of red, orange, black, or green annular bands around the
rims and art-deco inspired serving ware handle designs were observed throughout the site. Ceramics with
legible makerâs marks included items made by Syracuse China (with patterns that date to 1945 and 1948),
Onondaga Pottery Company (O.P.CO.); the Iroquois China Company (1905 to 1969); and Mayer China
(post-1881). Most of the glass artifacts within the site were undecorated clear glass. An amber colored
Owens-Illinois Glass Company bottle dating to 1949 and a few remnants of aqua and olive green bottle
glass were present within the site. The scatter included two silver-plated cocktail or oyster forks inscribed
with âTHE BAKER HOTELâ and the oval Baker Hotel Company (BHCo) logo produced in the Tiger
Lily Pattern by Reed and Barton between 1901 to 1925 (Appendix A, Photograph 44). One silverplated dinner fork, inscribed âTHE BAKER HOTELSâ and the oval BHCo logo was also observed at the
site (Appendix A, Photograph 45). Oyster shells were interspersed throughout the site with a higher
concentration in the southern part of the site. A similar scatter of artifacts including items associated with
the Baker Hotel were previously observed by DFWâs GIS analyst Stefan C. Hildebrand prior to the
construction of a stormwater outfall located at the northeast corner of the APE was noted. No artifacts
were encounter at that location during this survey and it is assumed that the scatter was removed or
covered during construction of the outfall.
Additional shovel tests were excavated along both sides of the pipeline corridor to determine if site
41TR311 extended outside of the corridor. The tests were situated approximately 5 to 10 m into the

adjacent wooded area. Shovel tests revealed a layer of medium blackish-brown (10YR 3/4 or 4/4) sandy
loam soils overlaying dark brown (10YR 4/5 or 7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam. Shovel testing was
terminated at a depth of approximately 30 cmbs due to the presence of culturally sterile soil. These
shovel tests were negative for cultural materials.
Archival Research
Site 41TR311 is located within the Richard Worthington survey (Abstract No. 1655), which was patented
on the 19 July 1845 and comprised 320 acres. Using public deed records from the Tarrant County Clerkâs
Office, a chain of title for the property encompassing the historic-period scatter was generated (Table
5.5). According to deed records, the property on which the site is located was purchased by the Turner
family in 1941 and sold to the Thomasson family in 1946. None of the names associated with these
families were listed in the Handbook of Texas or on TXGenWeb.org website.

The inscriptions on silverware observed at the site refer to the Baker Hotel, which was located in historic
downtown Grapevine. The hotel was built in the 1870s on Main Street and was moved in the early 20th
century to the corner of Worth and Jenkins streets (Grapevine Historical Society 2010). According to
Sanborn Fire Insurance maps for Grapevine, the building operated as a boarding house in 1921. Census
records for 1920 and 1930 verify this as the owner John H. Baker is listed with several boarders. The
1938 Sanborn states that the two-story building is a hotel. John H. Baker died in 1944 and his wife/exwife Sallie Baker in 1946. The hotel appears to have been inherited by a J. L. Seabourn, the widower of
John and Sallieâs daughter Claudia. In 1965, the hotel was sold to Ira E. Woods, the mayor of Grapevine
at the time, and was demolished shortly after (Tarrant County Deed Record Volume 4062, Page 93).
Research of the property histories of the site and the Baker Hotel offered no further information on the
connection between the two locations approximately 3 mi apart, nor a precise timeframe of when the
Baker Hotel artifacts were dumped at the site.
Site Summary
Site 41TR311 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the accumulation of historic-aged
artifacts within a pipeline corridor. The scatter was comprised of ceramic sherds, glass shards, metal
eating utensils, and oyster shells. Basal sherds of ceramic dinnerware generally dated to the mid- to late1940s. An inscribed oyster fork associates the site with the Baker Hotel in Grapevine, which changed
ownership in the 1940s and was demolished in 1965. No archeological features were encountered within
the site.

Isolate 1
Within the central HPA of the East MMS APE, five concrete support pads for an electric transmission
line support tower were encountered (Appendix A, Photographs 46 through 50). Three of the pads were
circular and approximately 20 to 24 in in diameter. One of the pads was polygonal and one was severely
eroded and amorphous. Several of the pads retained a portion of angled steel bar near their centroid,
likely the vestiges of the original transmission tower support. The electric transmission line corridor was
constructed between 1942 and 1958. After DFW purchased the property in the late 1960s, the
transmission line and associated infrastructure was decommissioned and removed by 1972. Based on a
review of historical aerial photographs, no other structures or features were situated near the towerâs
former location.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the intensive pedestrian survey, 129 shovel tests were excavated within the 305.8-ac survey area.
Through the survey, three archeological sites (41TR126, 41TR310, and 41TR311) were documented
within the APE.

Site Trinomial

Not Eligible

41TR126, 41TR310, 41TR311

41TR126 was a previously recorded multi-component site comprising a late 19th to early 20th century
farmstead and a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter. The site was previously recorded and evaluated in
1991. Through the 1991 evaluations, the site was recommended as potentially eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and designation as a SAL. The primary rationale for the potentially eligible
recommendation was based on the presence of possible 19th or 20th century cellar and well features
that could contain significant archeological data. The circumstances are not explicit within the survey
and limited testing reports, but it appears that the possible cellar feature was not fully delineated, nor
thoroughly catalogued. Due to the depth of the well, no archeological data was obtained pertaining to
the possible archeological deposits the well contained. Although these initial investigations
encountered artifacts from a discrete period during the 19th or early 20th centuries, there findings were
based on a very limited sampling methodology.
During the IES investigation, the site was revisited within the West MMS APE to re-evaluate the
potential NRHP/SAL eligibility documented in 1991. During the site delineation, 27 shovel tests were
excavated within the APE to more completely define the site boundaries and provide an updated
evaluation of the site condition. Through the investigation, several factors were encountered that
have significantly affected the potential significance of the site. First, the possible cellar feature was
not encountered through extensive pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing in proximity to its
recorded location. Second, the well (Feature 1) was completely filled with recent sediment.
Although the 1991 investigations indicated that potential significant cultural deposits could be located
at the bottom of the well, none were encountered during the previous investigations. If archeological
deposits are located at the bottom of the well, these would likely pertain to the last occupation phase
of the site as this was a source of water and would have conceivably been kept free of refuse during
its use. Third, erosion within the site was greater than initially indicated. Unlike the 1991
assessment, IES did not encounter any soils capable of preserving archeological deposits that
exceeded 40 cmbs. In addition, portions of the site have deflated to depths up to 1 m (3 ft) below the
level of the late 19th century ground surface. Fourth, during shovel testing, a clear mixing of
prehistoric and historic-aged components was observed across the site.
Based on the siteâs lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s) and the low
potential to yield significant archeological data, it is the recommendation of IES that site 41TR126 be
considered not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D nor considered for SAL
designation. No further work is recommended at this location.
41TR310 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained a scatter of artifacts dating to the mid20th century. During the IES investigation, an accumulation of debris was encountered within a
natural drainage south of an unnamed tributary. Based on the siteâs lack of association with a
significant historical event(s) or person(s) and the low potential to yield significant archeological
data, site 41TR310 should be considered ineligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D
nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this location.

41TR311 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained a scatter of ceramics, glass, silverware,
and oyster shells associated with the former Baker Hotel in Grapevine. The scatter was primarily
located within a pipeline corridor that has existed since at least 1953. Based on the siteâs lack of
association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s) and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, site 41TR311 should be considered ineligible for listing in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, C or D nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended for this
site.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the East and West MMS project be permitted to continue
without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources, other
than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the operators should
immediately stop construction activities in those areas. The project cultural resources consultant should
then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction
activities. In addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within this report are
to be impacted, additional field investigations may be required.
