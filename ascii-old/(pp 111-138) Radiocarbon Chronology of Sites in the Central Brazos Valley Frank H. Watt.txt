Radiocarbon Chronology of Sites in
the Central Brazos VaUey
FRANK H. WATT

ABSTRACT
Two sites in the Central Brazes Valley of Texas, Horn Rock
Shelters nos. 1 and 2, provide a stratigraphic sequence of projectile
point types and associated materials that is supported by radiocarbon dates. The earliest dated type is the Brazos Fishtail point,
associated with crude scrapers, with uncorrected radiocarbon dates
about 8000 B.C. Plainview points are higher, with uncorrected dates
about 7000 B.C. The Brazos Fishtail and Plainview assemblages
represent the first well-dated Paleo-Indian components in this area.
There follows a gap in the sequence, Pedernales points being next
with corrected dates about 2000 B.C. Above them are Marcos points,
about 500 B.C., and finally Perdiz points about A.D. 1300.

INTRODUCTION
This paper reports radiocarbon dates from components
ranging in age from earlier than 8000 B.C. to about A.D. 1400 in the
Central Brazos river valley of Texas. It provides the first firm
chronological evidence for Paleo-Indian occupation of the valley.
The Central Brazos is that portion of the valley between the
junction of the Clear and Salt Forks near Graham, forming the main
stream of the Brazos, and the mouth of the Little River below Waco
(Fig. 1). The Little River carries also the discharge of the Leon
River, in whose valley Paleo-Indian materials have been dated
(Watt 1961). The Leon was the main stream of the Brazos in the
Pleistocene Epoch, until the Clear Fork pirated its headwaters and
the Leon became a tributary (Lewand 1969).

THE SITES
Most of the dates reported here are from two sites, Horn Rock
Shelters nos. i and 2, below Whitney Dam on the Brazos River. Two
of the dates are from the Aycock Shelter and the Clark Midden,
farther down the river. The stratigraphy of the sites is reviewed
briefly here, with reference to the radiocarbon dates presented in
a later section.
Horn Rock Shelter no. 1. This site is numbered 39B5-48 in the
author’s records and 41 BQ 47 in the files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the Balcones Research Center of The
University of Texas at Austin. It is a recess in a bluff overlooking
the Brazos, and is about 50 feet long and 20 feet deep. Excavations
beginning in 1960 by the author and associates have explored 8 ft.
of stratified fill but have not reached the floor of the shelter.
The top three feet of sediments in the shelter were sterile red
alluvial sands. They lay on a surface, the top of a midden deposit,

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

113

In the lower part of the red alluvial sands was a lens of
cemented red sandstone, adhering to the bottom of which were
several Plainview points. Date #11 belongs stratigraphically to
this level.
Under the red alluvial sands was a deposit up to five feet
thick (and in places more), consisting mostly of gray roof spalls.
Dividing this stratum into upper and lower parts was a layer of
calcified limestone two inches thick. Dates #14 through #17 were
from the upper part of the gray cave fill, in which occurred
artifacts of the "Crude Scraper Culture" (described above in
connection with Horn Shelter no. 1), Brazos Fishtail points, and a
double burial in a rock-covered pit. Brazos Fishtail points (Fig. 7),
a new form described here for the first time, have wide lanceolate blades and short expanding stems with small rounded
ears. The bases are concave, and flakes have been removed
upward from the base, producing a peculiar fluting, The range
of dimensions is: length, 35 to 70 mm.; maximum width, 26 to 34
ram.; width of base, 22 to 26 mm.; maximum thickness, 6 to 7
mm.
In the lower part of the gray cave fill were several lenses of
red sand, in one of which was a fragmentary Folsom point. In
another such lens near the bottom of the unit (see Fig. 8) were
charred bones, dart points of an unidentified fishtail form (Fig. 4,
b) different from the Brazos Fishtail, and a stone discoidal of the
same material, three inches in diameter.
At the bottom of the gray cave fill were the bones of a large
testudinate turtle, probably Geochelone or Gopherus, from which
Date #19 was determined (see Fig. 8).
Below the gray cave fill was a 6-inch layer of washed river
gravels containing animal bone fragments and a human tooth.
The gravels overlay four inches of heavy red clayey sand that
rested on the floor of the shelter.
In terms of projectile point sequence, we can see five dated
horizons in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. From latest to earliest they
are: (1) Perdiz points in the upper red alluvial sands; (2) Marcos
points lower in the same sands; (3) Pedernales and Gary points
in the lower part of the same sands; (4) Plainview points in a
calcified red sand layer; (5) Brazos Fishtail points in the upper
part of the gray spall stratum. As will be seen, the radiocarbon
dates support this sequence. The points in the lower part of the
gray spall stratum are not dated, although the bone date from

on which the sample for Date #1 (see "The Dates," below) lay.
At a depth of approximately five feet the deposits were
uniform Archaic deposits. Dates #6 and #9 came from these
deposits.
A stratum of calcified sand, in which two Plainview points
were found, sloped southward from 50 to 90 inches below the
surface over a distance of 35 feet. It varied in thickness from six to
15 inches. Dates #12 and #13 apply to this stratum.
Below the Plainview stratum was the earliest occupational
stratum in the shelter, containing crude flake scrapers of blue-gray
chert with a greenish undertone and a grainy patina. The scrapers
varied in dimensions from about 4 x 6 cm. to 7.5 x 12.5 cm., the
maximum thickness being about 1.3 cm. The author has called this
scraper assemblage at Horn no. 1 the "Crude Scraper Culture"
(Watt n.d.). Date #18 came from this stratum.
Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. This is site 39B5-55 in the author’s
records and 41 BQ 46 in the files of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory. Like the near-by Horn Rock Shelter no. 1, it
is a recess in a bluff overlooking the Brazos. It is about 150 feet
long and 25 feet deep, with a ceiling about 13 feet high. Originally it
contained more than 25 feet of sediments. It has been under investigation since 1960 by the author and his associates.
Some 90 inches of the highest sediments in the shelter had
been removed during the past century in connection with the use of
the shelter as a residence by an Anglo-American. At the back of the
shelter a yellow clay deposit survived.
More than 48 inches of red alluvial sands made up the next
lower unit. Lenses of gravel and cemented red sandstone occurred within this stratum. From near the top came Date #2, at a
level also containing Perdiz points. Stratigraphically lower,
under a large slab of roof fall, were Dates #4 and #5, associated
with Marcos points. Still deeper were Dates #7 and #8, associated with Gary and Pedernales points and bone fishhooks.

~............

In much of the shelter the division between Paleo-Indian anff~ ......................
Archaic deposits was not sharp, but in one place there was an
eroded remnant of Paleo-Indian deposits, from the surface of
which came Date #10, representing the beginning of the Archaic
occupation. There were no diagnostic materials in association. In
terms of projectile point styles, there appears to be no Early
Archaic occupation of the site.

the bottom of the stratum suggests they are not much older than
those in the upper part.
Aycock Shelter. This site, now destroyed, is 39D4-12 in the
author’s records and 41 BI 28 at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory. It was in the Leon River drainage north of
Belton, about 50 miles south of the Horn Rock Shelters. It contained more than 40 unstratified burials of varying complexity
and age, laid on ascending rock ledges and covered by earth.
The author excavated many burials at this site in 1935 as part
of the first project of the Central Texas Archeological Society
(Watt 1936). Date #20 is from this site.
Clark Midden. This is site 39B5-25 in the author’s records
and 41 ML 39 at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
It was a midden stratum (now destroyed) about 1 ft. thick, below
16 to 20 inches of sterile alluvial sand, on a river terrace fragment in the Brazos Valley above Waco, some 20 miles below the
Horn Rock Shelters. The author found large animal bones, Perdiz
points, Canton Incised and Sanders Engraved sherds, and a fragment of a bone beamer, in a rock-lined hearth that was the only
feature at the site (Watt 1965). Date #3 is from this site.

THE DATING LABORATORIES AND
THEIR PROCEDURES
There are several methods by which radiocarbon assays are
determined, the most common being by proportional counting of
carbon dioxide or methane gas and by liquid scintillation
counting of benzene. Once dates have been determined, the
standard form for reporting them is to give (1) the sample number with a prefix indicating the laboratory; (2) the age of the
sample in years before A.D. 1950 (this is the age B.P., i.e. Before
the Present, and is calculated using a half-life of 5568 years); (3)
a plus-or-minus figure representing one standard deviation (the
one-sigma error) derived from the counting statistics.
This way of reporting dates is followed by all laboratories in
publishing their dates in the international journal Radiocarbon.
However, at the time many of the Central Brazos Valley dates
were determined, a number of laboratories had not adopted this
procedure, so that the dates given the author were not all in this
form.

116

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Three laboratories made the radiocarbon determinations
that are reported in this paper: the Magnolia Petroleum Company laboratory, later called the Socony-Mobil Oil Company
Laboratory; the Shell Development Company laboratory; and the
laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin. Their
procedures for dating and reporting varied, and are reviewed
here.
The Magnolia Petroleum Company laboratory, which dated
by proportional counting of methane gas, changed its name from
Magnolia to Socony-Mobil in 1959 when the parent company
changed its name. The laboratory is no longer active. Magnolia
sample numbers have the prefix "FRL RC-"; Socony-Mobil
samples have the prefix "SM-". The laboratory reported its
dates to the author as years before the year of measurement. In
the case of the Magnolia dates the year of measurement was
1956; with the Socony-Mobil dates it was 1964. Otherwise the
dates were reported in the standard manner. They have not
been published by the laboratory (H. F. Nelson, Mobil Research
and Development Corporation, written communication to E.M.
Davis, University of Texas at Austin; Bray and Burke 1960: 97).
The Shell Development Company laboratory, which also is
no longer active, dated by proportional counting of carbon
dioxide gas. The laboratory never published dates and has not
used a prefix for its sample numbers; "Shell Devel." is used in
this paper. This laboratory, in planning work on the Central
Brazos Valley samples, considered the feasibility of three different counting times: 12, 24, and 48 hours. A 12-hour count was
dismissed as resulting in too large a standard deviation, whereas
a 48-hour count was rejected because, although it results in a
small deviation and is thus more precise, it is prohibitively
expensive. A 24-hour count was decided on as being satisfactory
from the viewpoint of both deviation and expense (E. L. Martin,
Shell Development Compar~y, personal communication). This is
the usual counting time in most laboratories. The Shell
laboratory measurements were made in 1967, and were reported
as years before 1945, using a half-life of 5760 years and with a
plus-or-minus of two standard deviations (D. R. Lewis, Shell
Development Company, written communication to E. M. Davis).
The University of Texas at Austin laboratory dates by liquid
scintillation counting of benzene. The prefix for its sample
numbers is "Tx-". The Central Brazos Valley samples dated by

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

117

this laboratory were dated in 1974, with one exception, and
were reported to the author in the standard form. The exception
was the turtle-bone sample of Date #19, which was dated in 1978
and received special treatment, as discussed later in connection
with that date. The laboratory plans to publish these dates in a
future date list in Radiocarbon (E. M. Davis and S. Valastro, Jr.,
University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon Laboratory, personal
communication; Valastro et al. 1970: 249}.
Table 1 lists the Magnolia, Socony-Mobil, and Shell dates as
reported by the laboratories, with their conversion to the
standard form for use in this paper.

DATING ASSOCIATED SAMPLES OF SHELL
AND CARBONIZED MATERIAL
It is possible to speak of two kinds of association of radiocarbon samples. In the case of association in the broad sense,
different deposits in a site are associated in being parts of the
contents of that site; they have their individual characteristics,
and radiocarbon dates from different deposits in the site are
compared with that in mind. By contrast, association in the
specific sense refers to datable materials of different natures
that are intermingled within the same deposit, and that are
therefore demonstrably of the same age.
This second type of association was observed in four places
in Horn Shelter no. 2, the associated materials being snail shells
(Bulimulis} and carbonized material (woody charcoal and carbonized bone). Among the radiocarbon dates reported in this
paper are measurements on these four cases of specifically associated materials, in order to see how their dates migh compare.
These are Dates nos. 4-5, 7-8, 14-15, 18-17. To assure comparability in these cases, all the dating was done in one laboratory
(the laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin) and within
a relatively short time. In the field, the associated materials
were collected at the same time.
As will be seen, the snail shells always gave older dates
than the carbonized matter, although the differences are not
striking when the plus-or-minus is taken into account. The
greater age of the snail shell dates is due to the fact that in
building the calcium carbonate of their shells the snails incorporated some environmental lime, which because of its great
age has no radiocarbon left. Thus in the shell the contemporary
carbon, which is derived from the organic materials eaten by the
snail, has been diluted with the "dead" carbon from the lime in
the soil, and the shells give falsely old dates. This is a situation
which, in radiocarbon dating, must be checked anew for each
kind of mollusc and for each type of environment (Tamers 1970).
The snail shell dates also have smaller standard deviations
(the plus-or-minus) than the dates from carbonized material, but
this results from the sample size, not from the nature of the
material; the shell samples were larger than the carbonized
samples. In a radiocarbon date, the main determinants of the
"plus-or-minus" deviation are the age and size of the sample and

CENTRAL BRAZOS VALLEY

119

the length of the counting time. In these cases the ages of the
shell and carbonized samples were the same, since they were associated in the specific sense. The counting times in the
laboratory were the same. Only the sample sizes (and of course
the nature of the material in the samples} differed.

THE RADIOCARBON DATES
Data on the radiocarbon dates for Paleo-Indian and later
cultures in the Central Brazos River Valley are listed here in
order from most recent to oldest (except for the last date, #21,
which is a modern check sample}. The information includes the
site, sample number, material dated, date expressed in radiocarbon years B.P. (before 1950} and A.D.-B.C., the date corrected
by dendrochronology (where possible} according to Damon et al.
(1974} and rounded to the nearest five years, and a discussion of
the archeological context.

Carbonized wild onion seeds made up the sample (Fig. 2,a).
Sixty-five of the onions were found in a rounded mound of
charcoal and ashes resting on top of the midden deposit. They
were covered with an overburden of 36 inches of sterile red
river sands. No artifacts were associated. It may well be that a
meal was being prepared when flood backwaters came in and
covered the baking mound without disturbing it, but driving the
people away. This date applies to the last occupation of the
shelter, as the Brazos then built up the overlying 36-inch sterile
sands that sealed off the shelter from further use. After this,
only a narrow talus of red sand remained.

This sample came from red river sands lying mostly outside
the overhang of Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. Stratification was
clear. The sample came from the 58 to 60 inch level, and was associated with the earliest occurrence of Perdiz points at the site;
it thus dates the latest of the five dated projectile point horizons
in this shelter. This is the most recent date from the site.

large animal bones including a bone beamer, Perdiz points, and
Sanders Engraved and Canton Incised sherds (Watt 1965}. The
beamer is a trait that could represent Plains or Mississippian
contact. This was the first radiocarbon date determined from the
Central Brazos Valley and is the only date applying to a bone
beamer. The author has published it previously {Watt 1961: 3278; 1965: 103}.

The charcoal fragments and snail shells of these two

river sands, immediately underlying a large limestone slab that
fell from the roof. Such slabs occurred throughout the Archaic
deposits in this shelter (Fig. 4,a). Marcos points were in this part

This sample was made up of charcoal fragments scattered
in homogeneous Archaic deposits 56 to 64 inches below the
surface, without associated artifacts. A burial was within 24
inches laterally, eight inches vertically, of the fill from which the
charcoal fragments were recovered. The skeleton, tightly flexed,
was oriented east by 5° south. It was lying on the left side facing
south, the hands crossed in front of the face and the heels
touching the pelvis. Ten large rock slabs covered parts of the
burial (Fig. 5,a), the largest of which, weighing some 70 pounds,
had crushed the lower part of the skull and all the bones of the
torso. The hands and legs were in articulation. Measurement
from hip to knee was 17.5 inches. There was an extreme arthritic condition present, especially in the lower lumbar region.
The teeth were more worn and deteriorated than the author has
seen in any other burial in Central Texas.

contained bone fishhooks and Pedernales points. This is the third
of the dated projectile point horizons in this shelter. The bone

fishhooks are found from 102 to 120 inches deep in an area 10
by 15 feet. Both here and in Horn Rock Shelters nos. 1 and 3
(Coleman) they are present in various stages of manufacture in
the Archaic deposits. These fishhooks (Fig. 6) are of an eastern
type; the same materials and processes of manufacture have
been seen at Russell Cave in Alabama (Griffin 1974: 57) and elsewhere. This is their westernmost occurrence.

This sample was made up of charcoal fragments picked
from fill overlying a burial. Within one foot of the skeletal
material were three Bulverde points, one Pedernales point, two
small scrapers, two partial fishhooks, one small anvil stone, one
hammerstone, and an unusual number of small flint flakes.
Despite these indicators of Archaic age, the blade of what appeared to be a finely chipped arrowpoint was in the abdominal
area of the skeleton. It was 3.2 cm. long and 1 cm. in maximum
width, with straight, finely serrated edges terminating in a
needle-sharp tip. Lacking the stem, it is much the same as a
Perdiz point, and suggests that the burial might be deeply intrusive. Still, there are no other evidences of intrusion, and the
radiocarbon date together with the other artifacts clearly indicate an Archaic age. There was no visible indication of a
burial pit, although charcoal fragments and mussel shells were
more common than usual in this area.
The burial was partly covered with boulders. The largest
boulder, weighing some 40 pounds, extended from over the left
shoulder to over the mid-thorax. A thin triangular 15-pound rock
lay across the lumber region. Four smaller rocks lay alongside
the body and between the legs.
The skeleton lay on its right side, head northwest, facing
southwest. The arms and legs were partially flexed, the forearms parallel to the vertebral column and the right hand tightly
clenched. Much of the spine and ribs were disarticulated and
crushed by the weight of the overlying rocks. Evidences of ar-

These burned animal and bird bone fragments (Fig. 2,c)
were associated with a rock hearth lying on the eroded surface
of a remnant of deposits of Paleo-Indian age. No artifacts were
in immediate association, but the context is post-Paleo-Indian
and represents the beginning of the Archaic occupation in the
shelter. Gary and Pedernales points, bone fishhooks, and bone
pieces from which fishhooks were cut, were in the overlying
Archaic deposits.
Earlier, the Brazos River had deposited several feet of sediments of Paleo-Indian, and probably earlier, age. These sediments were then eroded away until only a small fragment
remained, cemented to the wall. A period of quiet ensued, before
the Archaic deposits began to build up, and the dated material is
from this time. Midway in the shelter, nine feet from the front at
a depth of 108 inches, was a rock hearth around which were
scattered numerous small fragments of animal bones, mostly
charred. Immediately in front of the hearth was a mixture of
limestone fragments, ashes, and bone fragments, in a lens six
inches thick and three feet square. Within this lens were 1100
charred bone fragments, 187 uncharted bone fragments, 200
snail shells, 80 fish vertebrae, and 70 gar scales. There were no
associated artifacts. The dated bones were from this concentration.

These snail shells were in the same stratigraphic position as
two Plainview points; thus, this is the fourth dated projectile
point horizon in the site. The points were cemented to the bottom
of a calcified red sand stratum varying from one to three inches
thick, the depth varying from 126 to 132 inches. There were
fewer than six snail shells in direct association with the Plainview points, so that it was necessary to utilize shells in the same
stratigraphic situation, as close as possible to the points. Since it
was not everywhere possible to distinguish the Paleo-Indian from
the Archaic deposits, only the shells nearest the Plainview points
were taken. The date is 900 years later than the Plainview assemblage date from Horn Rock Shelter no. 1 (Date #12, below},
but the points are different in form, and the variability inherent
in snail shell dating (Tamers 1970} minimizes the significance of
the difference.

As in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2, the Plainview stratum in
Horn no. 1 is a red calcified sand; it has been described in the
section entitled "The Sites", earlier in this report. There were
many charcoal flecks in the fill associated with a Plainyiew point
at 82 inches depth in this sand, but they were too small and
fragile to survive washing after collection. Accordingly, snail
shells were taken from the back dirt that had been dug from the
top 4 inches of the stratum; the distinctive red calcified sand
adhering to the shells readily identified their provenience.

of 66 to 72 inches at the high end of the stratum, 12 ft. from the
Zero datum line. A broken Plainview point was found about four
feet away near the 16-foot line, half at 58 inches depth and half
at 60 inches depth.

These specimens are from the upper part of the gray cavespall stratum, which contained Brazos Fishtail points (Fig. 7) and
scrapers of the "Crude Scraper Culture," as described earlier in
the section entitled "The Sites." This is the fifth and lowest
dated projectile point horizon in the site. The charcoal for Date
#14 was picked from the fill in Square 46 at depths from 150 to
160 inches; the snail shells of Date #15 came from the same
depth in Square 41.
Of particular interest in connection with these dates is a
double burial (Fig. 5,b) at 174 inches depth, at the bottom of the
stratum, resting on a thin layer of calcified limestone that
divided the upper from the lower gray cave spall strata. The
burial pit was 12 inches deep. This pit fill contained none of the
red sands of the Plainview stratum that overlay the 28 inches of
gray cave fill of the pit, and thus the pit must have originated in
the upper 16 inches of the gray fill, from which the materials
dated here were collected. The pit was covered with 19 limestone slabs of varying sizes.

These specimens are from the same upper part of the gray
cave fill stratum as Dates #14 and #15, and were collected and
dated to check those dates. The charcoal was picked out of the
fill in Square 47 at depths of 156 to 162 inches, and the snail
shells came from the same depth in Square 42. As can be seen,
the dates agree well with Dates #14 and #15.

These shells came from depths of 72 to 84 inches in Horn
Rock Shelter no. 1, beneath the Plainview level that produced
Date #13. The present date is appropriately older. The artifacts
at this level were scrapers of the "Crude Scraper Culture," as
described earlier. At Horn no. 2, these scrapers are associated
with Brazos Fishtail points and with Dates #14 through #17,
which agree with the present date. As noted in the site description, this is the oldest stratum at Horn no. 1, although at Horn
no. 2 there are earlier deposits.

Turtle bones (Geochelone or Gopherus)

8200 ± 120 BC
Too old for correction

These bones of an extinct form of large turtle were at the
bottom of the gray cave spall stratum, resting on the surface of
the underlying washed river gravels. Thus, they were earlier
than the gray spall stratum, and were stratigraphically below
dates #14 through #17, which are much the same as this date.

132

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Judging from those dates and this one, the gray cave spall
stratum as a whole is around 10,000 years old.
Bones present special problems in radiocarbon dating, and
The University of Texas at Austin Radiocarbon Laboratory spent
extra time on these specimens (S. Valastro, Jr., L. S. Land, and
E. M. Davis, personal communication). The bones were inspected
by X-ray diffraction to insure that the chemical pre-treatment
was adequate and no contaminants (calcium carbonate in the
form of caliche) remained that might affect the dating. In addition, this inspection seemed to indicate that there had been no
recrystallization of the apatite fraction of the bone; recrystallization would make the date falsely young (however, apatite recrystallization is not well understood and is still being studied).
Mr. Valastro, who is in charge of technical operations at the
laboratory, prefers to date both the collagen and the apatite
fractions in bone, as checks on each other. In this sample, unfortunately, there was too little collagen (0.01 gin.) to date. The
apatite fraction also was small, but the date was obtained by
counting for three days. In addition a ’3C/’2C ratio was determined by mass spectrometry and a correction made for fractionation.
Dr. Ernest L. Lundelius, Jr., of the Laboratory of Vertebrate
Paleontology, Balcones Research Center, University of Texas at
Austin, identified the bones. He has been making a study of these
extinct large turtles, and he notes (personal communication) that
up to now the weight of evidence was that they became extinct
long before 10,000 years ago. This suggests that the bones were
actually considerably older than their radiocarbon age, a
possibility also suggested by their stratigraphic relationship to
dates #14 through #17. However, Dr. Lundelius also feels that
because of this date and other recent evidence, there must be a
reexamination of current ideas on the time of extinction of the
large tortoises in this region. In other words, if this date is
falsely young the error is not necessarily very great.
It is unfortunate that a larger sample, which would have
permitted more definitive dating, was not available at this level
in Horn Rock Shelter no. 2. Nevertheless, even as it stands this
date is significant in supporting the 10,000-year age of the gray
cave spall layer, and in presenting the possibility that large
turtles became extinct in this area more recently than has
previously been thought.

Aycock Shelter

Charcoal

More than 10,000 years

This specimen was woody charcoal from burials excavated in
1935 at Aycock Shelter in the Leon River basin (Watt 1936; see
the description in "The Sites" section of this paper.) The date
has been published previously (Watt 1961: 327). The Magnolia
Laboratory reported that this specimen contained too little
carbon to give a reading, but this it appeared to be more than
10,000 years old. Based on this judgement and recent studies of
the Leon River Basin (Lewand 1969), the author suggests a minimum age of approximately 11,000 years. Evidently the site was
used as a burial ground for a very long time, as other burials in
the shelter were more recent, as Suhm (1960: 90) has also noted.

Modern snail shells (Bulimulis)

Ultra-modern

The author collected these live snails from fields in the
vicinity of Horn Rock Shelter no. 2 in the summer of 1974. The
snails were in a hot-weather inactive period and were on small
semi-leafless bushes, six to 18 inches above the ground, exposed
to sun and wind. The University of Texas at Austin laboratory
found that the radiocarbon content of the shells was higher than
the normal modern amount (~’~C = + 286.38_+ 3.6%o). This indicates that the carbon in the lime of the shells came mainly
from organic food (and ultimately from the atmosphere) and not
from environmental limestone, and reflects the fact that atomic
and hydrogen bomb explosions have increased the normal atmospheric ’4C/’2C ratio. This evidence strengthens the validity of
the snail shell dates from the archaeological components at Horn
Rock Shelter no. 2, although the dated charcoal-shell pairs indicate that the shell dates are probably a little oder than the
true ages, as already discussed.

SUMMARY
Horn Rock Shelters nos. 1 and 2 provide a stratigraphic
squence (Fig. 8) of projectile point styles and associated
materials as recent as Perdiz points and as old as the Folsom
point and Brazos Fishtail points deep in Horn Shelter no. 2. The
radiocarbon dates reported here verify this sequence.
The stratigraphically deepest date from the two shelters is
the turtle bone date from Horn Shelter no. 2, Date #19, approximately 8200 B.C. This date does not apply directly to any
projectile point type, being deeper than fishtail points that are
different from Brazos Fishtail points, and than a fragmentary
Folsom point. This date may be falsely young, since the specimen
was stratigraphically below Dates #14 through #17, which are of
approximately the same radiocarbon age.
The oldest dates that apply to artifacts are Dates #14
through #18, which are associated with Brazos Fishtail points
and the "Crude Scraper Culture." Two of these dates are on
charcoal and three on snail shells. The dates are too old for
dendrochronological correction. Assuming the charcoal dates to
be the more accurate, this context dates (in uncorrected radiocarbon years) about 7500-8000 B.C. The shell dates are a few
hundred years older than the charcoal dates; this is to be expected in view of what we know about dates on snail shells in
limestone environments. The shell dates, and their support by
the check-date run on modern snail shells from the vicinity of
Horn Shelter no. 2, reinforce the case for the antiquity of this
horizon. These dates refer to Paleo-Indian times in this area, and
for this reason the double burial in Horn Shelter no. 2 is of
particular interest since documented human skeletal remains of
this age are exceedingly rare in the Western Hemisphere. The
tentative date of more than 10,000 years ago from burials in the
Aycock Shelter may mean that some of those burials also date
from Paleo-Indian times, although field evidence indicated that
most of the burials in the site were later.
More recent in the Horn Shelters are Plainview points, associated in both sites with a layer of red calcified sand. The uncorrected dates (again, these dates are too old to be within the
range of correction) are nearly as old as those for the Brazos
Fishtail points--7500 B.C. on snail shells and mussel shells in
Horn Shelter no. 1 (Dates #12 and #13} and 6500 B.C. on snail
shells in Horn no. 2 (Date #11}.

There is a gap in the sequence between the Plainview
horizon and the next projectile point horizon above, indicated by
three pieces of evidence: the absence of Early Archaic points in
the sequence, a considerable gap in the radiocarbon dates, and
the erosion seen in the vicinity of Date #10, about 5100 B.C. (uncorrected), which rests on an eroded surface.
The next higher dated point horizon is characterized by
Pedernales points, and the dates (#7, #8, #9) are roughly from
1800 to 2500 B.C. These are dendrochronologically corrected
dates.
Above this are Marcos points, in Horn no. 2, with corrected
dates about 500 B.C. (Dates #4 and #5}.
Last and most recent of the dated point associations are the
Perdiz points in Horn no. 2, about A.D. 1300 (corrected; Date #2),
agreeing with the date for Perdiz points in the Clark midden
(Date #3).
The radiocarbon chronology presented here agrees with
previously published chronologies from other sites in Central
Texas (e.g., Sorrow et al. 1967: 142}. Thus, we have established
in the Central Brazos Valley a dated sequence of projectile point
styles extending from Paleo-Indian times to the final stage of
local prehistory.
