ABSTRACT
The City of Arlington intends to construct a 2500 foot, 16” diameter reuse
waterline between Brown Boulevard and North Cooper Street in
Arlington, Texas. An archaeological survey was conducted to determine if
any cultural resources were present, and if so, how they might be impacted
by the installation of the waterline. No prehistoric or historic sites were
encountered during the survey, and the absence of cultural resources is
attributed to the topographic setting which would not have been ideal for
prehistoric or historic occupation. Based upon the absence of cultural
materials and the existing modifications and previous disturbances within
the study area, ARC recommends that no further investigation of the
Arlington Reuse Waterline Route is warranted. However, if cultural
materials are encountered during construction, work in the area should halt
immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be contacted to assess the significance of the
discovery before work proceeds.

INTRODUCTION
Alan Plummer Associates, Inc. has retained AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to perform an
archaeological survey of the proposed Arlington Water Reuse Waterline in Arlington,
Texas (Figure 1). The proposed 16” diameter, 2500 foot waterline will be installed in an
existing utility corridor that connects Brown Blvd. and North Cooper St. The maximum
installation depth will be 58”, accounting for 42” of cover over the 16” waterline. Crown
Colony Dr. crosses the proposed route at its approximate center. The location is 1.2
miles south of the West Fork of the Trinity River -0.45 miles into the upland- and one
mile north of Interstate 30, putting it within a residential area. The eastern portion of the
proposed route crosses two unnamed drainages that flow north into the West Fork.
The survey was necessitated because the City of Arlington is a political subdivision of the
State of Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation and the
Texas Historical Commission will act as the State Review Agency. Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5444 was issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this
survey was to locate cultural resources if present and to make recommendations about
how these resources might be impacted by construction. Relevant federal legislation
includes a Section 404 Permit of the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended
(PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment,” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by a
description of the research design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of
the investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents
recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the
report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area lies in the Eastern Cross Timbers of North Central Texas, just east of the
Fort Worth Prairie (Dyksterhuis 1946, Figure 1). The Eastern Cross Timbers is a northsouth trending physiographic region, which is dissected by drainages that flow into the
West Fork and the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. The study area is located on the
Woodbine formation, which consists of an approximately 175 to 250 foot thick layer of
Cretaceous-era sandstone, clay and shale (Bureau of Economic Geology, 1988).
The project area lies within the Crosstell-Urban land complex soils, which consist of
moderately well drained upland soils with slopes of 1 to 6 percent (Ressel 1981, General
Soils Map). These soil complexes are composed of highly permeable sandy loams
overlaying strongly acidic clay. The B Horizon for the Crosstell series can lie at a depth
ranging from 4 to 41 inches below the ground surface (Ressel 1981:90).
These soils permit efficient water infiltration, allowing tree roots to penetrate easily, and
provide more moisture to plants (Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999:46). Due to
these characteristics, the Eastern Cross Timbers physiographic region area is biotically
diverse. In addition to blackjack and post oaks, the area has other woody species like
cedar elm, hackberry, pecan, juniper and mesquite trees. Woody trees are not the only
vegetation in this thin band of forest surrounded by prairies; there is also a diverse
selection of plants that contribute to the dense brush and open savannahs and provided
many resources to early inhabitants (Diggs et al. 1999:46). The climate of Tarrant County
is typically mild and is characterized as warm and humid. The average high temperature
is 96˚ in July and the average low temperature is 35˚ in January (Texas Almanac
1999:264). Tarrant County also averages around 32 inches of rain per year and has a
growing season of 230 days (Texas Almanac 1999:264).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the various forks of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area most
of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall and along tributaries
during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
time period are typically located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major
tributaries (Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.

SURVEY OF THE ARLINGTON WATER REUSE WATERLINE ROUTE
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird’s Fort, established around
1849, Lonesome Dove and Johnson Station, which were both settled in 1845. Lonesome
Dove, located near present day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlment in Tarrant
County (Garrett 1972:55). Tarrant County itself was organized in1859, but it was not
until 1860 that Forth Worth was officially named the coiunty seat, that designation
having been transfeered from Birdville (Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been
steadily arriving in the county during those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of
Peters Colony land grants, although 160 families and single pioneers took adavantage of
the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. The county's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. The railroad reached Dallas in the
early 1870s, and by 1876, it had reached Fort Worth. It was also in 1876 that Arlington
was founded, halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth at a location just north of
Johnson’s Station (Joyner 1976: 80)
Previous Investigations
Previously discussed sites and surveys from the Culture History are not repeated here. All
non-referenced data are from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2009).
Two historic maps were used in the assessment of this project. The first is an 1893 Sam
Street’s Tarrant County map; the second is a 1920 soil map of Tarrant County. The map
by Sam Street shows a landscape a world apart from that which we see today. The
relatively undeveloped country is dotted here and there with houses and few roads
bridged the West Fork. Neither the Sam Street’s map nor the 1920s Soil Map show any
owner or tenant houses plotted near the proposed Arlington Reuse route, but the area
encompassing of the route is totally developed today.
Extensive archaeological investigations have been conducted within the floodplain of the
West Fork of the Trinity River between Fort Worth and Dallas over the past twenty years
(Peter 1987; Largent, Hunt and Peters 1991; Ferring 1994; Shuanessy, Jurney and
Yedlowski 1994; Ferring and Byers 1996; Ellis 1998; Burson, Hunter, Peter and
Shanabrook 2000; Todd and Skinner 2002, 2003). During these investigations sites
ranging from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric have been recorded. Prehistoric site
assemblages consist mainly of mussel shell and burned rock concentrations that are
buried less than a meter and up to 4 meters below the surface. These findings demonstrate
that the potential for finding buried prehistoric sites within the West Fork floodplain is
relatively high.
River Legacy Park is a City of Arlington park that extends west from SH 157 (Collins
Street) almost to Greenbelt Road and is situated along the south side of the West Fork
channel. Ferring's survey of the park area (1994) located four prehistoric sites (41TR143146) exposed in the riverbank. He also described the Old Bridge Geologic Section from

SURVEY OF THE ARLINGTON WATER REUSE WATERLINE ROUTE
the south bank of the West Fork to just east of the Rough Green site (Skinner and Caran
1997; Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999). The Old Bridge section includes four units (A-D).
Unit A consists of laterally accreted sands and silts and is related to the Sanger Allo
formation, which is mid-Holocene in age (10,000 to 5,000 B.P.). A moderately developed
soil with a thick A-horizon is present at the top of Unit A. Unit B consists of calcareous
silts and clays with a prominent buried soil on top of the unit. This has been termed the
West Fork Paleosol. All of the recorded river bank sites are contained in this unit from
near its top to four meters below the surface. Unit C consists of discontinuously exposed
younger channel fills that are inset onto Units A and/or B. Unit D consists of recent
alluvium that covers all exposures of units B and C.
Two prehistoric sites were located during the survey of a pipeline that crossed the
western part of River Legacy Park and continues north across the river before connecting
with a Trinity River Authority (TRA) pipeline (Skinner and Caran 1997). The Rough
Green site (41TR162) was discovered by shovel testing and was defined using augering
and backhoe trenching. The site is a massive shell midden that contains the only recorded
post hole along the West Fork. A deeply buried prehistoric site, 41TR164, was located by
backhoe trenching. Extensive testing at Rough Green (Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999)
found Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric occupations situated along the overbank
levee paralleling Walker Branch before the West Fork absorbed the headwaters of the
creek. It was concluded that the primary function of the site was to collect bur oak acorns,
although evidence of hunting deer and other mammals and gathering freshwater mollusks
was found in the site deposit.
Geo-Marine, Inc. (Tiné 2002) investigated approximately 33 acres west of SH 157
(Collins Street) and north of the West Fork, and in 1990, CMTA investigated a small area
west of Collins Street and south of the railroad track. No archaeological sites were found
in either survey. Approximately 315 acres were surveyed for the Texas Department
Water Resources south of Trammel Davis Road and west of Greenbelt Road in 1983 but
no sites were recorded. Northeast of the study area, AR Consultants (Whorton and
Skinner 1995) investigated 275 acres for a golf course and sports complex. During the
survey a historic site, the Tom Coble homestead (41TR153), was recorded.
Sites 41TR139 and 41TR140, west of Collins Street, were recorded during the
Mercyhurst College archaeological survey (Shaunessy, Jurney and Yedlowski 1994).
Located in the uplands, site 41TR139 consists of a surface lithic scatter that contained
dart points, performs and bifaces that were Archaic in age while site 41TR140 contained
Archaic-aged flakes, dart points, bone and mussel shell buried approximately a meter
below the ground surface.
Site 41TR161 is in the floodplain east of the study area on the north side of the West Fork
(Skinner and Caran 1997:22-23). The site was located 2.55 meters below the surface
during trenching and consists of a burned limestone and sandstone rock hearth. A block
of earth was removed and screened for artifacts but none were found. The site was found
during the placement of four trackhoe trenches along the northern border of the study
area.

In the fall of 2008, ARC conducted a block survey of 105 acres that abut the eastern
terminus of the pipeline, in an area that is now part of the Arlington Landfill (Todd
2008). During the survey, 25 backhoe trenches and 28 shovel tests were excavated. The
survey resulted in the recording of three prehistoric shell lens middens and hearth sites
(41TR227, 228 and 229).
Sites 41TR70 and 41TR168 are both located on a fluviate terrace of the West Fork
floodplain northeast of Walker Branch. Site 41TR70 consists of a surface base camp that
ranges in age from the Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric times although most of the
artifacts found by local collectors dated to the Late Archaic. The site is remarkable in that
a large amount of manos and metates were present. Site 41TR168 consists of a surficial
lithic scatter with fire-cracked rock and ground stone fragments. Its time frame is
unknown. Both sites were revisited during the ARC 2008 archaeological investigations of
the Arlington Landfill. The surface area mapped for both sites south of the railroad track
had been extensively disturbed and eroded by motocross activities (the area once had a
former motocross track). Also, extensive mining had destroyed eastern third of 41TR70
and few surface artifacts were identified.
Most recently ARC conducted linear surveys of two other TRA WF interceptors north of
the Trinity River along Walkers Branch (Lang, Coleman and Shelton 2009). Despite 12
shovel tests and 3 backhoe trenches, no cultural resources were identified during the
study.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The Arlington Reuse route is located in an upland area crossing two intermittent
drainages in the watershed that flows into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Despite the
upland setting away from permanent water sources, the area had potential for both
prehistoric and historic cultural resources. Two research questions below were developed
to examine the archaeological potential of the study area.
Although previous investigations show that the majority of sites recorded in the area are
concentrated in the deep alluvial deposits along the West Fork, prehistoric sites are
known to exist in an environmental setting similar to that of the proposed reuse waterline
location. Upland sites are usually recorded near or around freshwater drainages or on
knolls above these drainages. The presence of both elements in and near the study area
indicates that there is potential to find prehistoric archaeological sites. Due to the size of
the water drainages, sites are expected to be temporary hunting camps and would consist
of surface artifact or lithic scatters, as is the case for sites surrounding the area.
Historic sites exist in the near vicinity of the project area and mapped structures from
historic maps show that the area was inhabited in the late 19th century. Recorded sites
consist of historic structures and trash scatters. Because the area has been urbanized since
the creation of the maps, historic structures are likely no longer present. If sites are
found, they are likely to be historic artifact scatters associated with agriculture.
Methodology
In order to conduct the archaeological survey, the surveyors first reviewed the
information about the study area found on TASA. In addition, the 1920 soils map of
Tarrant County published by the USDA and the Sam Street’s Map of Tarrant County
from 1893 were examined determine if structures were mapped in the study area. Neither
map showed any structures near the alignment. The field team walked two parallel
transects spaced 15 meters apart and made notes about the ground exposure, soil types,
and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route
using a 2.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on an average of
every 100 meters, in accordance with THC guidelines (n.d.). Shovel tests were excavated
to the subsoil in the upland setting. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and the clay
was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. The sandy loamy soils from the shovel tests were screened
through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of texture
and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors ant
the shovel test locations were determined with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. Shovel tests will be described briefly within the text. The
conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The proposed route is located within an existing utilities corridor. The two drainages
were deeply incised, three to five meters, cutting well into the underlying bedrock. One
to three feet of water flowed through each. The western drainage is mapped as a
perennial creek, while the eastern drainage is mapped as intermittent. East of the
drainages fenced residential lots flank either side of the route, creating a 25 meter path
within the neighborhood. West of the drainages are larger, unfenced lots. Oak trees,
green briar, and various grasses populate the area.
A two-phase power distribution line is in place along the northern side of the corridor.
Waterline caps east and west of the drainages attest to previous disturbances. A
petroleum pipeline crosses the proposed route in a northeast-southwest direction at
Crown Colony Dr.
Survey Results
Investigation of the proposed reuse waterline route began at Brown Blvd. and ended at
North Cooper St. Fallen leaves and thick grass obscured the ground surface the majority
of the study area. Within the 2500 foot route, six shovel tests locations were placed
relatively level areas above the drainage slopes. Areas not tested were the first hundred
feet of the eastern end of the route which once had been paved with asphalt and the area
between the two drainages which had been severely eroded. The banks of the drainages
were clearly exposed and examined for cultural material. The shovel tests were excavated
within the corridor to explore for subsurface cultural deposits (Figure 2); the results of
these tests were as follows:
Shovel test 1 was placed 50 meters west of Brown Blvd., where it was excavated to a
depth of 40 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The material was a heavily mottled clay
loam of red, yellow, and grey. Additionally, decaying concrete and mortar were found at
approximately 30 cmbs. This material may well be fill dirt or sediments pushed aside
during construction of a utility road in the corridor. Shovel test 2 was placed 100 meters
west of Shovel test 1 and excavated to a depth of 31 cmbs. Dark yellowish brown loam
was found on top of a layer of brown loamy sand, which was underlain by red sandy clay.
Less than 5 percent gravel was in the matrix. Shovel test 3, another 100 meters west,
contained brown loam underlain by red clay to 36 cmbs. Decaying bedrock was evident
in the red clay matrix. Shovel test 4 was placed 25 meters west of Crown Colony Dr.,
excavated to 56 cmbs. Dark yellowish brown loam covered a layer of brown sandy loam.
Beneath these two strata was the red sandy clay subsoil. Some modern trash –glass,
plastic, and pieces of metal- was encountered in shovel test 4. Shovel test 5, 20 meters

east of the drainages and 10 meters east of the waterline cap, was excavated to a depth of
34 cmbs. The matrix consisted of a black clayey loam underlain by dark yellowish
brown loamy clay. Shovel test 6 was placed on a narrow bench 40 meters west of the
westernmost drainage. Dark brown sandy loam covered a thick deposit of strong brown
sandy loam. Bedrock was encountered at 64 cmbs.

Shovel test locations shown on a section of the Euless, TX 7.5’ USGS
map.

Examination of the creek banks (Figure 3, 4) was undertaken to search for any
anthropogenic features through which the creeks may have cut. The eastern creek was
examined at the point of the proposed water reuse waterline crossing with negative
results. 220 meters of the western creek’s bank (from E. Beady Rd. to the project area)
was examined while accessing the location of shovel test 6. Here also, no anthropogenic
features or cultural materials were observed.

SURVEY OF THE ARLINGTON WATER REUSE WATERLINE ROUTE
Large broken pieces of asphalt and concrete were observed intermittently along the
southern side of the utility corridor for a distance of approximately 200 meters west of
Brown Blvd. This suggests an old road might have existed in this portion of the study
area; however, no such road is recorded on the USGS map.
Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were encountered during the survey process.
Several potential explanations exist for such an outcome. First, it was expected that
prehistoric sites would occur on or near knolls above the drainages. These knolls,
ostensibly more attractive for temporary occupation, are found near, but not within, the
project area. This in and of itself does not preclude the project area from having potential
for prehistoric cultural resources, but, based on our findings and those of previous
investigations, does appear to diminish that potential. Further, the model developed for
settlement patterns, and, by proxy, associated site types, predicts that sites in this setting
would manifest as surface scatters representing temporary hunting camps. If prehistoric
scatters once existed within the project area it is conceivable that erosion processes
and/or historic disturbances have destroyed them.
Finally, the absence of historic artifact scatters or other historic cultural resources is
attributed to two factors. The study corridor follows a low area between two drainages,
and would have not been ideal location for a structure due to its propensity to hold water
during flooding events. Also, the urbanization of the area and the development of the
residential neighborhoods adjacent to the waterline route would have most likely
removed trash scatters or cultural material associated with farming in the area.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the absence of cultural materials and the existing modifications and previous
disturbances within the study area, ARC recommends that no further investigation of the
Arlington Reuse Waterline Route is warranted. However, if cultural materials are
encountered during construction, work in the area should halt immediately and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be contacted to assess
the significance of the discovery before work proceeds.
