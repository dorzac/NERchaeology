MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Archeological Survey of the City of Laredo’s Proposed Old Milwaukee
Outfall Pipeline, Webb County, Texas
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with backhoe trenching of the approximately 1,560-foot long proposed Old
Milwaukee outfall pipeline in the City of Laredo, Webb County, Texas. The survey was conducted at the
request of the City of Laredo to determine if the proposed construction would have any effects on
potentially important archeological resources.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is in east Laredo near the southwest corner of the Old
Milwaukee colonia just south of SH 359. The area is located on the Laredo South, Texas, USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 1.8 acres.
DATE OF WORK: January 16, 2008.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the City of Laredo in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4761
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Intensive archeological survey of the proposed Old Milwaukee outfall pipeline found no
archeological deposits. It is the opinion of Blanton & Associates that the proposed construction would
have no effect on any archeological historic properties eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
or sites eligible for formal State Archeological Landmark designation. Given these conditions, Blanton &
Associates recommends that the project should be granted archeological clearance without the need for
additional investigations.

INTRODUCTION
On January 16, 2008, Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of the City of Laredo, conducted
an intensive archeological survey of the approximately 1,560-foot long proposed Old Milwaukee outfall
pipeline in the City of Laredo, Webb County, Texas. The project area is located in east Laredo near the
southwest corner of the Old Milwaukee colonia just south of SH 359 (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed
wastewater pipeline easement is between an adjacent existing pipeline on the west and the southwestern
corner of the colonia. The majority of the proposed route occupies an existing dirt road and has an overall
Area of Potential Effect (APE) approximately 50 feet wide and 1,560 feet long that encompasses
approximately 1.80 acres.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by a political subdivision (City of Laredo) of
the State of Texas and funded by the Texas Water Development Board, the proposed project is subject to
the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The ACT, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of
the Texas Administrative Code, defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this state, including a city,
county, school district, or special district created under the Texas Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or
(2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must identify potential SALs through survey of
public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
Additionally, the planned construction would be funded in part from funds made available by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, so the proposed project is also subject to the provisions of Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the NHPA is to consider cultural
resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on
federal property. The act, which created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the
Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to
comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected
by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal agencies. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60.
Field investigations were designed to comply with appropriate archeological field methods as defined in
the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA n.d.). The primary intent of the
survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the study area, evaluate
their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation and, should archeological
historic properties or sites be located, make recommendations for future management options such as
avoidance and preservation or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is located in the Western Gulf Coastal Plains section of the Coastal Plains of Texas
(Jordan et al. 1984). Upland topography ranges from nearly level to gently rolling and vegetation is a
sparse mixture of grasses and “brush” species. The climate is semiarid, with precipitation averaging
19 inches per year and is characterized by hot summers and warm winters.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The underlying geology of the proposed project area consists of the “Uvalde Gravels”, an upland divide
formation characterized by pebble to cobble sized chert gravels of about 20 feet in thickness (Barnes
1987).
Soils are mapped as Copita fine sandy loam, one to three percent slopes. These are deep, well drained
loams that formed on loamy sediments or residuum over sandstones. As two very small stream channels
are crossed by the proposed project, it seems likely that Tela sandy clay loam, frequently flooded, is also
present, but unmapped due to scale. These are deep, well drained loamy soils of narrow upland valleys
and reach depths of 63 inches or more (Sanders and Gabriel 1985). Both of the stream channels are
intermittent tributaries of Chacon Creek, flowing northwesterly from the project area.
VEGETATION
The proposed project is located in the South Texas Plains vegetational area (Gould 1962). The orginal
vegetation was a brushy-chapparal grassland in the uplands with oaks (Quercus spp.) and mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) and other brush species forming dense thickets on ridges.
Vegetation within the project limits at the time of the survey was limited. Much of the vegetation east of
the Chacon Creek tributary and south of Old Milwaukee colonia had been removed by recent subdivision
development or long term use as a gravel roadway. West of the Chacon Creek tributary the easement was
characterized by bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and bufflegrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) interspersed with
poverty weed (Baccharis neglecta)

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and information
available on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the
presence of any previously recorded sites or previous project areas in or adjacent to the APE. The review
indicated that at least two other water utility related surveys have occurred near the proposed project
(Miller 1995, Miller and Houk 2000). As a consequence, several sites have been defined in the uplands
surround the project area, the most proximate of which are 41WB446 and 447, each of which is within
500 meters of the proposed APE. These prehistoric sites are defined as very shallow to surficial multiple
use and that were exploited by the aboriginal inhabitants. Most of the remains identified were lithic
debitage from tool manufacture. Neither of these sites was recommended for further investigation.

METHODS
The pedestrian archeological survey involved surface and subsurface investigations of sufficient intensity
to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered archeological
resources. Surface investigations consisted of an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project
area while systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. All investigations were
subject to photographic documentation.
The proposed pipeline route is shown on an aerial photograph in Figure 3.
Subsurface investigations involved the excavation of two backhoe trenches on the western bank of the
tributary of Chacon Creek. The two backhoe trenches were approximately five meters (16.4 feet) long,
one meter (3.3 feet) wide, and approximately two meters (6.5 feet) deep. Following excavations,
archeologists cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, features, and/or soil
anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units were documented on an appropriate B&A geologic
profile form, photographed, and plotted with a submeter global positioning system (GPS) receiver. The
backhoe trench locations are shown on Figure 3.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Intensive survey of the proposed pipeline route found no cultural remains (Figure 3). The majority of the
pipeline route is within a recently disturbed area or on an existing dirt road, ground surface visibility was
essentially 100 percent, except for the western bank of the tributary. A narrow, circa 5 meters wide, area
of alluvium is present on the east side of the creek but was saturated at the time of the survey by overflow
from the stream. The project area east of the tributary has essentially been stripped to clay by recent
development or is located within a small section of gravel road (Photos 1 and 2 in Appendix A).
Remnant soils adjacent to a fence line north of the pipeline route indicate that deflation has occurred
throughout this area.
West of the tributary soils were obscured in most areas by dense grass. Mounds of dirt and construction
debris found scattered throughout this area indicated potential disturbance of at least the upper soil layers.
Therefore, the banks of a small retention pond were examined in this area and two backhoe test trenches
were excavated (Photo 3). None of these activities produced cultural remains. Backhoe trench 1 found a
seemingly intact profile but no cultural remains. From the surface to approximately 30 centimeters was a
dark brown sandy loam “A” horizon. Between 30 centimeters to the maximum depth of the trench at
1.65 meters was a loamy sandy clay to sandy clay that began as a medium to light brown sandy, loamy
clay in the upper portion of the profile and became lighter in color with depth. Clay content also increased
with depth, but there were no clear or abrupt changes in the profile in terms of color, boundary, or clay
content. The profile of backhoe trench 2 indicated substantially disturbed soils to a depth of
approximately 1.8 meters that may have been the result of pipelines extending to the detention pond as
gravels were encountered at the bottom of the trench.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts for the proposed Old Milwaukee outfall pipeline found no
archeological materials. Surface and subsurface investigations revealed that the APE has experienced
substantial surface and subsurface disturbances from clearing, road construction, drainage improvements
(including a detention pond), and disposal activities. Additionally, soils in most of the APE consist of
upland soils that developed in situ and therefore have little to no potential for containing buried intact
archeological deposits. Backhoe tests in areas of deeper soils found no cultural remains.
Therefore, B&A recommends that the proposed construction should have no effect on archeological or
historic resources and that the project be allowed to proceed without further investigations.
