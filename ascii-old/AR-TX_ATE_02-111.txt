Abstract
In January and August of 2015, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey on behalf of Harris County, Texas and Klotz Associates, Inc.
The survey was conducted in advance of the Treaschwig Road expansion whose limits extend
from 1,000 feet west of Aldine Westfield Road to 1,500 feet east of Birnam Wood Boulevard.
The total project length is approximately 1.5 miles or about 27.1 acres, of which 10 acres
are proposed new Right-of-Way (ROW). Field investigations took place from January 28–30,
2015, and again on August 26, 2015. In 2017, Harris County moved a proposed detention pond
to a 57.9-acre parcel adjacent to Treaschwig Road, where they also propose to develop a park.
AmaTerra surveyed the proposed park and pond area with a permit modification in February
2018.
The project area is located on both Harris County ROW and private land. It will be funded
using local bonds and taxes. Therefore, the work is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas. AmaTerra conducted the cultural resources survey under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 7084.
Cultural resource investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey, the manual excavation of
110 shovel tests, and the mechanical excavation of eight backhoe trenches throughout the
project area, which is defined as the footprint of the proposed improvements and all new ROW.
AmaTerra documented two new archeological sites, 41HR1212 and 41HR1213 within the
57.9-acre park area, revisited previously recorded site 41HR372, and recorded one twentieth
century debris locale. Site 41HR1212 is a Woodland period archeological occupation site;
41HR1213 is a twentieth century bottle scatter; and 41HR372 was recorded in 1978 as an
Archaic to Woodland period site based on artifact collections from a fairly widespread area on
the south/west bank of Cypress Creek. Of these resources, Sites 41HR1213, 41HR327, and A
twentieth century debris locale are recommended as not eligible for the listing in the National
Register of Historic Place (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). Site 41HR1212
is of undetermined eligibility and AmaTerra recommends avoidance for the site, or further
testing if avoidance is not possible. Additionally, at the request of Harris County, AmaTerra
documented nine historic-period buildings located outside of the construction footprint. None
of these buildings are recommended as eligible for listing to the NRHP or as SALs. This survey
recommends no further work for any portion of the project area except Site 41HR1212, where
avoidance is recommended. If avoidance is not feasible then AmaTerra recommends testing to
determine NRHP/SAL-eligibility.
The results of initial work conducted in 2015 are documented in the main body of this report.
The results and recommendations for the 57.9-acre park surveyed in 2018 are presented in
Appendix B of this report. This was a no-collect survey. All records will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

Introduction and Project Description
In January 2015, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), on behalf of Harris County,
Texas and Klotz Associates, Inc., conducted an archeological survey in advance of the
proposed Treaschwig Road expansion project in Harris County, Texas. The project extends
for approximately 1.5 miles from 1,000 feet west of Aldine Westfield Road to 1,500 feet east
of Birnam Wood Boulevard. The expansion project will involve the widening of an existing
roadway, a bridge over Cypress Creek, and a 4–5-acre detention basin near Cypress Creek.
The detention pond was originally planned for Sandpiper Park, on the north side of Treaschwig
Road, east of Cypress Creek. However, it was later moved to a private property on the south
side of Treaschwig Road. AmaTerra surveyed both locations (Figure 1-1).
The proposed project is being funded using local bonds and taxes and will occur within existing
Harris County ROW and on private property that will be purchased for new ROW. Thus, the
proposed project is subject to the rules and regulations outlined by the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed project does cross an active waterway, Cypress Creek;
thus, a Section 404 permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) might be
required, triggering Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
(Section 106). Therefore, AmaTerra’s work conformed to the guidelines under 13 TAC Chapter
26 and 36 CFR Part 800, which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT and Section
106 respectively.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for cultural resources under the Antiquities Code of
Texas is defined as the footprint of the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact(s),
including all easements, and project specific locations. Thus, the APE encompasses 10 acres
of proposed new ROW and 17.1 acres of existing ROW for a total of 27.1 acres. However,
Section 106 considers indirect effects to cultural resources such as visual impacts to standing
structures. Therefore, the APE under Section 106 is more broadly defined. For purposes of
this investigation AmaTerra inventoried all buildings greater than 50 years in age within the
footprint or on adjacent parcels (Appendix A).
Cultural resource investigations consisted of a thorough pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and backhoe trenching where access was available within the project footprint. AmaTerra had
access to 100 percent of existing ROW while access was more restricted for some of the
parcels where proposed new ROW will be acquired. However, these parcels where access was
denied consisted of disturbed, artificially levelled, and/or paved surfaces. Thus, the potential
for archeological materials on them was deemed low. As a result, archeologists focused their
efforts in areas where access was available and in areas where the potential for archeological
materials was inferred to be high relative to other areas within the project area. Investigators
manually excavated 38 shovel tests and mechanically excavated eight backhoe trenches: four
within the original detention pond location on the north side of Treaschwig Road on the east

bank of Cypress Creek, and another four within the relocated detention pond on the south side
of Treaschwig Road. No NRHP/SAL-eligible cultural resources were observed and no new
archeological sites were recorded during field investigations. However, AmaTerra documented
nine buildings greater than 50 years in age on parcels adjacent to the construction footprint
(Appendix A). None of them are recommended as eligible for NRHP-listing. No additional
cultural resource investigations are recommended for the proposed APE.
Field investigations took place under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7084 from January 28-30,
2015, and then again in August 2015 after the detention pond location was changed. Rachel J.
Feit acted as Principal Investigator, Julian A. Sitters served as Project Archeologist, and Bruce
A. Darnell assisted with field investigations. A total of 48 person hours were expended in the
field in support of this project. Weather conditions were good and archeologists encountered
no difficulties in completing the investigations.

1.1

2017 Project Area Modifications

In 2017, Harris County changed the location of the detention pond again, relocating it within a
57.9-acre parcel on the south side of Treaschwig Road, west of Cypress Creek (Appendix B).
The County proposes to develop the entire 57.9-acre property as a public park and requested
that AmaTerra survey this property in conjunction with the Treaschwig Road survey. AmaTerra
conducted this work in February 2018. James (Josh) Hill served as field lead for these
investigations with Josh Zatopek and Amy Goldstein assisting with field investigations. A total
of 80-person hours were expended in the field to survey the park property. Investigators excavated
72 shovel tests and documented two new archeological sites: 41HR1212 and 41HR1213. Site
41HR1212 is a Woodland period occupation site, while Site 41HR1213 is a twentieth century
domestic bottle dump locale. One previously recorded prehistoric site 41HR372 was revisited
and no evidence of it was found, although investigators did document extensive large concrete
and structural debris dumped at this locale, likely to stabilize banks within a natural erosional
gully. Finally, another construction debris dump locale was recorded on the 57.9-acre property.
Of these resources none are recommended as eligible for the NRHP or as a SAL except Site
41HR1212. This site contains a diverse assemblage of lithic and ceramic debris and is buried
from 20–80 cmbs. AmaTerra recommends avoidance for Site 41HR1212 and if avoidance is
not possible, then formal NRHP/SAL-eligibility testing is recommended.
The body of this report documents the results of the survey efforts undertaken in 2015. The
conclusions presented in Chapter 6 relate to the project area as defined in September 2015. The
results of work undertaken in February 2018 are presented in Appendix B. Specific details and
recommendations for Sites 41HR1212, 41HR1213, and 41HR372 are presented at the end of
that section.
No artifacts were collected during the field investigations in 2015 or 2018. All notes and records
from the survey will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin.

Project Background
2.1

Environmental Setting

The APE is situated within the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes vegetative region (Stahl and
McElvaney 2012). More specifically, the APE falls within the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal
Prairies ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2013). This region is characterized by its grassland
potential and relatively flat topography. The regional climate is described as mild with hot to
warm summers and cool winters. Annually, the APE receives approximately 46 to 52 inches of
precipitation and has a mean annual air temperature of 69 degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS
2015).The closest permanent source of water is Cypress Creek, which the project crosses
approximately 1,700 feet to the southwest of Birnam Wood Boulevard. Topographically, the
APE is located on a coastal plain with elevations ranging from 75 to 95 feet above mean sea
level.
Historically, natural vegetation was dominated by grasslands with a few clusters of oak mottes or
maritime woodlands. Grasses include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium var. frequens),
yellow Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), brownseed paspalum (Paspalum plicatulum), gulf
muhly (Muhlenbergia capillaries), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (Omernik and Griffith
2013; Gould 1978). Trees common to this ecoregion include live oak (Quercus virginiana),
southern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana var. silicicola), and the Durand white oak (Quercus
sinuate). In low-lying areas near rivers and creeks trees include sugarberry (Anaqua; Ehretia
anacua), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and gum bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum). Today,
invasive species consist of the Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum) and Chinese privet
(Ligustrum sinese) (Texas A&M 2015; Stahl and McElvaney 2012).
Geologically, this portion of the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies ecoregion is characterized
by Quaternary-age deltaic sands, silts, and clays of the Lissie Formation (Ql; BEG 1992). Soils
are often described as light in color, mostly Alfisols with a sandy clay loam surface texture
(Omernik and Griffith 2013). According to the United States Department of Agriculture –
Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2015), soils within
the APE include Aldine very fine sandy loam (Am), Atasco fine sandy loam (AtaB), Gessner
fine sandy loam (Ge), Voss (Vs), and Wockley fine sandy loam (Wo; Figure 2-1;Table 2-1).
Today, the natural vegetation within the region has been mostly replaced by agricultural fields,
livestock grazing, and suburban development. Investigators observed oak and pine trees, short
to tall grasses, and vines within the project area. Surface visibility ranged from 20 to 90 percent
across the APE. Disturbances observed within the APE included roadside drainage ditches,
artificially leveled and raised surfaces, buried utilities, and paved surfaces. Land uses include
residential and commercial development, a horse pasture, park space, and undeveloped land.

Regional Chronology and
Cultural Background
Compared to other regions of Texas, little is known regarding much of the cultural prehistory
along the upper Texas coast which forms a part of the Southeast Texas archeological region
(Perttula 2004). Even less is known about cultural groups and patterns for inland sites in
the Southeast Texas archeological region, which spans from the Sabine River to the Brazos
Delta, and extends inland on the coastal plain for approximately 200 miles. The majority of
knowledge archeologists have about the prehistory of the region comes from sites along the
coast and sites near and within major metropolitan areas. Several key sources of literature
have been produced that have helped identify the prehistoric chronology in southeast Texas
and Louisiana, including: Aten (1979, 1983); Ensor (1991); Kidder (2002); and Ricklis (1994,
2004).

3.1

Paleoindian (ca. 11,500–8000 Years Before Present [BP])

Traditionally, the Paleoindian Period is the earliest recognized occupation in North America. The
initial occupants of Southeast Texas followed now extinct Pleistocene megafauna across vast
tracks of land from approximately 12,000–7000 BP (Moore 1994). Although the Paleoindian
archeological record along the Southeastern Texas coast is known only through isolated finds,
a few patterns can be discerned. First, the use of high-grade lithic material in Paleoindian
lanceolate point production indicates a non-geographically tethered and highly mobile lifeway
as with other parts of Texas. Paleoindians manufactured distinct, large lanceolate points that are
commonly fluted. These points include Clovis, Plainview, Golondrina, Meserve, Scottsbluff,
and Angostura projectile points. Archeologists generally assume that Paleoindian lifeways in
Southeast Texas mirrored those of Paleoindian groups in central Texas. Based on data from
sites like Kincaid Shelter and Horn Shelter No. 2, archeologists assume that big game hunting
activities were predominant and that the Paleoindian diet was supplemented by smaller game
(Peyton 2007; Ricklis 2004; Texas Beyond History 2012a). Second, based on the current data,
it appears Paleoindian cultures preferred locations along major streams and likely Pleistocene
coastline settings. Since the Pleistocene/early Holocene sea level was approximately 100 meters
lower than present day, many intact Paleoindian sites would now be submerged (Bousman et
al. 2004; Ricklis 1994, 2004).

3.2

Archaic (ca. 8000–1500 BP)

As with the Paleoindian components, few well-stratified sites dating to the Archaic Period
have been excavated in Southeast Texas, which has left the archeological record incomplete.
Archeologists believe that the altithermal drying trend became entrenched around 6950 BP
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 3

(5000 BC) and as a result aboriginal groups drastically reoriented their lifeways across North
America. Although far less pronounced than in other regions, this drying trend denotes the
onset of the Archaic Period within Texas that lasted to approximately 1850 BP (AD 100)
(Brownlow 2003).
Archeological data for the Archaic in southeast Texas and coastal settings is scarce. Nonetheless,
the Archaic is “generally defined by pre-or non-horticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic and
pre-bow-and-arrow hunting technologies” (Ricklis 2004:184). Based on data obtained from
regional comparisons, Archaic Period groups relied on diverse subsistence strategies that were
practiced along a migratory seasonal round focused on procuring locally specific flora and fauna
along coastal areas and inland riverine settings (Brownlow 2003; Ricklis 1994). Traditionally,
the Archaic Period is broken into three sub-periods: Early, Middle, and Late.

3.2.1 Early Archaic (ca. 8000–6950 BP)
Early Archaic groups adapted to the altered climate by expanding their tool kit. Compared to
the Paleoindian period, the Early/Middle Archaic assemblage is dominated by smaller points
that Ensor (1991) classified as being within the expanded haft cluster. This “cluster” of points
spans 4,000 years from approximately 5000–1000 BC (6,950–2,950 BP) and include points
like Yarbrough, Trinity, Carrollton, and Late to Middle Archaic Palmillas.

3.2.2 Middle Archaic (ca. 6950–2950 BP)
During the Middle Archaic, it is believed that population levels began to rise from relatively low
densities during the Early Archaic due to the change from a cold and moist climate to a warmer
and drier climate. Middle Archaic groups intensified efforts to capitalize on marine resources;
in particular shellfish and fish. Numerous coastal shell midden sites have been discovered
along with fishing implements including bone fishhooks, plummets, and net sinkers (Aten
1983). Axes, nutting stones, and grinding tools from more inland sites indicate that Middle
Archaic groups were also well suited for utilizing hardwood forest resources as well. Points
from this period include Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent, Elam, and Carrolton (Brownlow 2003).

3.2.3 Late Archaic (ca. 2950–1550 BP)
Beginning in the Late Archaic (1000 BC–AD 400 or 2,950–1,550 BP) the climate began to
stabilize and modern sea levels were attained, which likely aided the apparent population
density increase across Texas. The greater population densities may have also facilitated
long-distance trading between regions, including the Lower Mississippi Valley. Subsistence
economies established earlier in the Archaic Period continued during the Late Archaic and
relied on repetitive exploitation along a seasonal circuit. Late Archaic points include Ensor and
Godley types (Brownlow 2003; Driver 2009; Ensor 1991; Ricklis 2004).

Woodland Period (1500–1250 BP)

The introduction of ceramics into the Archaic tool kit signaled a transition to what several
archeologists have called a “Woodland” occupation in southeast Texas. The Woodland tag
placed by earlier archeologists like Aten and Shafer was to illustrate affinities to the cultural
material observed in the southeastern United States, in particular the Lower Mississippi
Valley (Moore 1990, 1995; Perttula 2004). Aten and Shafer use the Woodland term to identify
indigenous occupations not only prior to Mississippian or Caddoan cultures, but through
historic times. However, Dee Ann Story argued that there are too many differences between
southeast United States Woodland groups and those occupying the Texas coastal region at the
same time. Thus, Story coined the term “Mossy Grove” to describe the Woodland period of
occupation along the coast and inland within southeast Texas (Story 1990). According to Story
(1990:256) “Mossy Grove can be viewed as both a general and cultural pattern, as well as a
regional tradition that partly parallels development of the Caddoan tradition to the north. And,
like the Caddoan tradition/culture, it encompasses the archeological remains of what were
surely different ethnic (and possibly even linguistic) groups.”
Although occupation along the upper Texas coast and inland portions has been further divided
into more regional specific areas, several general trends during the Mossy Grove occupation can
be identified. First, ceramics are commonly associated with Mossy Grove sites. Although the
manufacturing of pottery did not appear uniformly across the region (on the Texas–Louisiana
border around 20 BP, Galveston Bay at about 1850 BP, and the western coastal margin around
1650 BP along the coast near Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake) it appears that the earliest
appearances of ceramics within southeast Texas coincide with early ceramic periods in the
Lower Mississippi Valley. From these areas, Tchefuncte, grog–tempered Baytown Plain, and
Marksville Stamped are common in Early Ceramic assemblages (Peyton 2007). Based on the
current data, Goose Creek ceramics first appeared near the Lake Conroe area around AD 500–
600 or 1450–1350 BP (Moore 1990; Story 1990). The Goose Creek Plain variety is considered
a utilitarian ware that dominated the archeological ceramic record during this period. Initially,
Goose Creek ceramics were constructed using a sandy paste, with little to no additional temper.
Later in the period, grog and bone tempers were added.

3.4

Late Prehistoric (1250–422 BP)

Technological change and stylistic modifications in ceramics mark the change from the
Archaic and Ceramic Periods to the Late Prehistoric Period. Eastern influences in pottery
making such as grog and bone tempering, as well as elaborate decorations become apparent
(Ricklis 2004). Eighteen different styles of ceramics, based on temper, paste, and design, have
been documented along the Texas coast in a Late Prehistoric context (Aten 1984). The Late
Prehistoric Period in Texas brought intensified group dynamics across the state. Additionally, it
appears that after the bow and arrow was introduced around 1450 BP, the atlatl did not leave the
archeological record, but overlapped until the Historic Period. Common arrow points recovered
from Late Prehistoric Period sites include Perdiz, Alba, and Catahoula. Groups within this
period continued the hunter-gatherer lifeways established long ago, with focus on coastal and
riverine resources (Moore 1995; Ricklis 1994). With the advent of the bow and arrow came a

shift in lithic manufacture, “reflecting a shift from direct core (or very large flake) reduction
to the reduction of relatively small flakes” (Story 1990:256). The seasonal migratory circuit
tradition continued with Mossy Grove groups. Aten (1983) suggests that smaller bands would
have likely joined other bands to form larger communities during the winter months and then
disperse back into smaller bands along the seasonal round (Ricklis 1994).

Historic

Some of the first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spaniards, who were in the Spring
area as early as 1746 (Severance 2015). It wasn’t until the 1820s when some of Stephen F.
Austin’s Old 300 began settling within the region. By 1836, the area where Spring is currently
located was incorporated into the municipality of Harrisburg. In 1838, William Pierpont, a
legislator, merchant, and farmer from Connecticut, established a trading post along Spring
Creek. By 1840, approximately 153 people were living in the Spring area. Around the same
time, German immigrants began settling in the area. Here they began farming, producing crops
such as sugar cane, cotton, and vegetables. In 1871, the Houston and Great Northern Railroad
arrived in Spring, which contributed to the growth of the town. By 1873, Spring had established
a post office, and in 1884, Spring boasted two steam saw and grist mills, two cotton gins, three
churches, and several schools. At the turn of the century (ca. 1901), the International and Great
Northern Railroad connected Spring to Fort Worth, and the town became a major switchyard.
The population of Spring continued to fluctuate through the mid-1940s (Severance 2015). As
of 2010, the population of Spring was approximated to be 54,298.

Cultural Resources In Proximity To The Project Area

Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the Texas
Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; 2015). Research focused on the
identification of archeological sites, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, sites listed on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), sites listed as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs), cemeteries, and/or archeological surveys within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE
(Figure 3-1). The search revealed that there are four previously recorded archeological sites
and five archeological surveys located within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE.
Four prehistoric-period archeological sites were identified within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of
the APE (Table 3-1). The prehistoric campsites are all situated along or immediately adjacent
to Cypress Creek. At three of the four sites, artifacts were observed by the original recorders
eroding out of a cut bank along the creek. None of the sites were deemed eligible for listing to the
NRHP or as SALs at the time of survey; however, additional testing/survey was recommended
in order to determine site significance.
Between 1978 and 2008, five archeological surveys were conducted within one kilometer (0.62
mile) of the APE. Three of these surveys overlap the APE. The surveys overlapping the APE
encompass approximately 1,825 linear feet along the southeastern side of Treaschwig Road
and 2,400 linear feet along the northwestern side of Treaschwig Road. The four archeological
sites discussed in Table 3.1 were all identified during a 1978 survey, which followed the natural
course of Cypress Creek.

Historical Land Use

In the early twentieth century the APE was devoid of buildings and/or structures (Figure 3-2).
In fact, most of the APE remained relatively undeveloped through the early to mid-twentieth
century with the exception of a few agricultural fields at the APE’s southern end (Figure 3-3).
Using aerial photographs AmaTerra identified 11 small cottages and bungalow-plan houses
located at 3506 Treaschwig Road (Figure 3-4). The Harris County Appraisal District lists 15
single family residences on the property (Account No. 043-209-002-0238) with construction
dates ranging from 1930 to 1950. Residential and commercial development remained relatively
stagnant within and around the APE until the early twenty-first century (ca. 2004) when large
parcels of land were developed for residential purposes. Today, land uses include, residential
(e.g., Werrington Housing Development), commercial, industrial (e.g., water treatment plant),
and recreational development (e.g., Sandpiper Park).

Methodology
Prior to field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for buried historic archeological materials. This research involved examining historical
topographic maps and aerial photographs. In addition, archeologists consulted the Atlas to
assess the potential for Prehistoric archeological sites within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the
APE. This not only allowed investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded
archeological sites or historic-period occupation within or near the APE, but also to gain
insight into the types of sites, artifact types, and average depth of cultural materials below
the surface, among other things. Lastly, the Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map
(PALM; Figure 4-1) was consulted in order to identify areas of high probability for containing
cultural resources within the APE. Coupled together, this information was used when planning
the level of effort, as well as the survey.
Cultural resource investigations were carried out in accordance with the THC/CTA survey
standards (as referenced in the THC policy and 13 TAC 26.20). Fieldwork consisted of visual
inspection, the manual excavation of 38 shovel tests, and the mechanical excavation of eight
backhoe trenches. These investigations took place within the proposed new ROW, as well as on
private property for which the landowner(s) explicitly granted authorization for the investigation
work. Investigators avoided, but photographed previously disturbed portions of the landscape.
These areas included, but were not limited to, roadside drainage ditches, artificially levelled
and raised surfaces, buried utilities, paved surfaces, and residential development.
Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and extended to a maximum
depth of 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) below surface (cmbs) or until encountering restrictive
features (e.g., bedrock, basal clay, or the water table). The shovel tests were excavated in
10-centimeter (3.9-inch) increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware
cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form. Shovel
tests were backfilled upon completion.
Backhoe trenches were excavated near the eastern banks of Cypress Creek where deposits were
believed to be deep and inaccessible using standard shovel testing methods. A Bobcat E45 with
a two-foot wide bucket, operated by Buddy Nelson, was used to excavate the backhoe trenches.
Trench dimensions varied with location and accessibility. Backhoe trench information was
recorded on a standardized form and all trenches were backfilled upon completion.
Lastly, background research indicated that previously recorded Prehistoric sites located
along Cypress Creek were observed eroding out of the cut banks. This led investigators to
scour the banks of Cypress Creek west of Sandpiper Park looking for evidence of Prehistoric
occupation. As a result, investigators exposed and recorded a soil profile along the eastern bank

of Cypress Creek. Information about shovel tests and backhoe trenches was recorded using
metric system measurements and therefore, all description of the results of field investigations
will be presented using metric measurements.

Survey Results
AmaTerra’s survey progressed from
southwest to northeast along the 1.5 mile
stretch of proposed road improvements. The
pedestrian survey documented numerous
disturbances, which have the potential to
impact cultural resources situated within
the APE. Residential and commercial land
use, as well as road construction have
contributed to the artificial levelling and
raising of the natural ground surface. In
addition, roadside drainages border both
sides of Treaschwig Road and buried
utilities transect the proposed project area in
multiple places (Figure 5-1). Investigators
excavated a total of 38 shovel tests and
eight backhoe trenches in support of this
survey. Ultimately, no NRHP/SAL-eligible
cultural resources were observed and no
new archeological sites were documented
during this survey. For organizational
purposes the cultural resources survey was
broken into two segments: 1,000 feet west
of Aldine Westfield Road to Cypress Creek
and Cypress Creek to 1,500 Feet East of
Birnam Wood Boulevard.

Ground visibility varied across the APE from 20 to 90 percent, while the topography remained
relatively level from the southwest to northeast end of this segment. Vegetation along
this stretch of Treaschwig Road consists of maintained grasses, oak trees, and a moderate
understory composed of vines, short grasses, and shrubs. Access to private property along this
segment of Treaschwig Road was available to approximately 40 percent of the parcels. In total,
archeologists excavated 21 shovel tests within this 0.93 mile stretch of the APE, more than the
number (16 per mile) recommended by the THC for linear projects.
All 21 shovel tests within this segment of the proposed road expansion project were excavated
south of Treaschwig Road where access was available and disturbances were minimal. Access
was not available to areas north of Treaschwig Road. In fact, most of the northern portion
of this segment of Treaschwig Road is heavily disturbed through residential development,
commercial land use, and a detention pond. Thus, the potential for intact cultural resources
along the northern portion of this stretch of roadway is low.
Shovel tests ranged in depth of 45–80 cmbs, with an average depth of 65 cmbs. Investigators
found most of the subsurface deposits to be moist or wet and in one case a shovel test (BD01)
filled with water at approximately 60 cmbs. Although soils varied across this stretch of
roadway, a typical soil profile consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam (0–10
cmbs) overlying yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist sandy loam (10–60 cmbs) overlying light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) wet sandy clay loam (60–80 cmbs) with iron concretions. None
of the shovel tests contained cultural materials.
Nine buildings greater than 50 years in age were observed and photographed outside the
proposed new ROW within this segment (see Figure 5-2). None of them would be directly
impacted, nor are they listed or recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL.
Photographs of the buildings can be found in Appendix A.
From Cypress Creek to 1,500 Feet East of Birnam Wood Boulevard
From Cypress Creek to 1,500 feet east of Birnam Wood Boulevard, a length of approximately
0.57 mile, the APE passes rural, residential development, commercial land use, and pasture
land (Figure 5-3). The terrain is relatively flat and archeologists recorded 75 percent ground
visibility across this segment of the APE. Access to private property along this segment of
Treaschwig Road was available to approximately 60 percent of the parcels. Archeologists
excavated 17 shovel tests and excavated eight backhoe trenches within this 0.57 mile stretch
of the APE, more than the number (16 per mile) recommended by the THC for linear projects.
All 17 shovel tests were excavated where access was available and in undisturbed portions of
the landscape. Shovel tests ranged in depth 10–80 cmbs with an average depth of 53 cmbs.
A typical shovel test consisted of brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam (0–15 cmbs) overlying
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam (15–40 cmbs) overlying a compact yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) clay sandy loam (40–60 cmbs). None of the shovel tests contained cultural
materials.

Archeologists also conducted a pedestrian survey along the eastern banks of Cypress Creek
adjacent to Sandpiper Park. In addition to the visual assessment, archeologists exposed a
soil column along the upper banks of Cypress Creek. The soil profile consisted of yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam (0–140 cmbs) overlying light gray (10YR 7/2) oxidized silty
loam (140–170 cmbs) overlying brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam (170–230 cmbs). No cultural
materials were observed during the visual assessment of Cypress Creek or within the exposed
soil column.

Backhoe Trenching

Eight backhoe trenches were excavated near the eastern banks of Cypress Creek: five backhoe
trenches were excavated south of Treaschwig Road on property owned by Henry Duong, while
an additional three were excavated within Sandpiper Park, north of Treaschwig Road. No
cultural resources were observed within any of the excavated trenches.
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench One (BHT
1) was excavated in the
northwestern
corner
of
Mr. Duong’s property near
the southeast corner of
the intersection between
Treaschwig Road and Cypress
Creek (Figure 5-4). The trench
is situated within the newly
proposed ROW in between
Treaschwig Road to the north,
Cypress Creek to the west,
and an elevated landform
to the south. Excavations of
the trench began to the west

Treaschwig Road. The trench
measured approximately 5.40
meters in length, was approximately 1.30 meters wide, and extended to a maximum depth of
2.40 meters below the surface (Figure 5-5). The soil profile observed within BHT 1 consists
of:
•

Zone I (0–26 cmbs) consisted of disturbed gray (10YR6/1) sandy loam with small clay
peds and rootlets.

•

Zone II (26–50 cmbs) was comprised of grayish brown (10YR5/2) sandy clay loam with
some clay nodules and rootlets scattered throughout.

• Zone III (50–74 cmbs) contained
light gray (10YR7/2) sand with
large black (10YR2/1) clay peds
distributed throughout. Rootlets were
also encountered in Zone III.
• Zone IV (74–90 cmbs) was
pale brown (10YR6/3) sandy loam
speckled with oxidation and rootlets.
• Zone V (90–100 cmbs) consisted
of grayish brown (10YR5/2) sandy
loam with slightly more clay content
than Zone IV, some oxidation and
rootlets.
• Zone VI (100–126 cmbs) was
comprised of light yellowish brown
(10YR6/4) sandy loam with oxidation
and rootlets.

• Zone VII (126–170 cmbs)
consisted of light brownish gray
(10YR6/2) sandy clay loam with
rootlets.
•
Zone VIII (170–240 cmbs) was
light brownish gray (10YR6/2) clayey
sandy loam with oxidation.

The uppermost stratigraphic unit (0–26 cmbs) contained a clear glass vessel fragment,
an electrical repair splice
wrapped in electrical tape,
a shell fragment, and a river
pebble. The combination of
these items mixed within this
layer indicates disturbances
have occurred within the near
surface. No cultural materials
were observed within BHT 1.

The trench is situated near the southern
end of Sandpiper Park, east of Cypress
Creek (Figure 5-6). Excavations within
the trench began to the west and moved
east parallel to a crushed gravel foot trail.
The trench measured approximately 6.0
meters in length, approximately 1.20
meters wide, and extended to a maximum
depth of 2.50 meters below the surface
(Figure 5-7). The soil profile observed
within this backhoe trench consisted of:
•

Zone I (0–25 cmbs) Fill material
consisting of asphalt, mussel shell
fragments, pebbles and small gravels.

•

Zone II (25–50 cmbs) was comprised
of brown (10YR4/3) silty loam with
oxidation and rootlets.

•

Zone III (50–67 cmbs) consisted of
pale brown (10YR6/3) silty loam
with oxidation and rootlets.

•

Zone IV (67-95 cmbs) contained light
brownish gray (10YR6/2) silty clay
loam with oxidation.

•

Zone V (95–123 cmbs) consisted of
light gray (10YR7/2) sandy loam
with oxidation.

•

Zone VI (123–190 cmbs) was
comprised of very pale brown
(10YR8/2) sand.

•

Zone VII (190–250 cmbs) consisted
of very pale brown (10YR7/3) sand
with some oxidation.

The uppermost stratigraphic layer (0–25
cmbs) consists of excess gravel fill from
park trail construction. Shell was observed
during trenching (Figure 5-8); however,
no shell was observed in situ below the
fill level. All the shell observed during
the excavation of BHT 2 is believed to
be from the upper stratigraphic layer
(0–25 cmbs). No cultural resources were
observed within BHT 2.

approximately 7.60 meters
long, approximately 1.30
meters wide, and extended
to a maximum depth of
3.05 meters below the
surface (Figure 5-10).
The soil profile observed
within this backhoe trench
consisted of:

•

Zone I (0–35 cmbs) consisted of very
dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy clay
loam with rootlets. Soil was saturated.

•

Zone II (35–75 cmbs) was comprised of
pale brown (10YR6/3) sandy clay loam
mixed with pockets of very fine white
(10YR8/1) sugar sand. Some rootlets
were encountered, along with some minor
oxidation.

•

Zone III (75–110 cmbs) contained light
brownish gray (10YR6/2) compact sandy
clay loam with some oxidation.

•

Zone IV (110–190 cmbs) consisted of
increasing compact, light brownish gray
(10YR6/2) or pale brown (10YR6/3) clay
mixed with sand.

•

Zone V (190–300 cmbs) was composed
of extremely compact, light yellowish
brown (10YR6/4) chalky silty clay with
oxidation.

No cultural resources were observed within
BHT 3.

Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe Trench 4 (BHT 4) was
excavated approximately 45 meters
(147 feet) to the northwest of BHT
3 (Figure 5-11). Excavations within
the trench began to the west and
moved east. The trench measured
approximately 6.3 meters in length,
approximately 1.30 meters in width,
and extended to a maximum depth
of 2.50 meters below the surface
(Figure 5-12). The soil profile
observed within this backhoe trench
consisted of:
Zone I (0–48 cmbs) consisted of dark
yellowish brown (10YR3/4) sandy
loam with rootlets.

Zone II (48–69 cmbs) was composed
of pale brown (10YR6/3) fine sandy
loam with rootlets.
Zone III (69–97 cmbs) contained
brown (10YR5/3) sandy clay loam
with light oxidation.
Zone IV (97–110 cmbs) was
comprised of very pale brown
(10YR7/3) sandy loam with some
oxidation and plinthite (an iron-rich,
humus-poor mixture of clay, quartz,

Revisit

On August 26, 2015, archeologists revisited the project area in order to evaluate the newly
proposed (relocated) detention basin and outfall line located south of Treaschwig Road and
Sandpiper Park. The detention basin is located on private property owned by Henry Duong,
the same property where BHT 1 was excavated. Four trenches were placed within the newly
proposed detention basin revealing disturbed soils consisting of fill material, modern trash, and
stabilizing sand (Figure 5-13). Three trenches were placed in the proposed detention basin,
situated northeast of a prominent bend in Cypress Creek, while the fourth trench was excavated
within the designated outfall line. No archeological material was encountered within any of the
four trenches.
Backhoe Trench 5
Backhoe Trench 5 (BHT 5, field recorded as T-1) was positioned north of Cypress Creek in a
low alluvial terrace. The area was littered with modern trash and surrounded by mature oaks
and pines. Several brush piles were observed in the area surrounding the trench. The trench
measured nine meters in length, maintained a width of 1.2 meters and extended to a depth of
three meters below the surface. Three distinct levels, or zones were encountered during the
excavation of BHT 5 (Figure 5-14), the description of which follows:
•

Zone I (0–135 cmbs) consisted of powdery very pale brown, fine sand (10YR8/2) with
large roots. An oil filter, a pull top beer can, and some modern trash was found in Zone I.

•

Zone II (135–210 cmbs) contained coarse yellow sand (10YR7/6). A modern paper
“Mountain Dew” soda label was found at approximately 190 cmbs.

•

Zone III (210–300 cmbs) consisted of mottled yellowish brown (10YR5/8), yellowish red
(5YR5/8), and grayish brown (10YR5/2 compact clay. The water table was encountered at
about 280 cmbs.

BHT 5 was void of material considered to be archeological. The pull top beer can likely dates
to the 1960s or 1970s and was found in setting lacking context, rendering it non-historical.
The oil filter was extremely corroded, and was severely damaged by the shovel bucket of the
backhoe. The filter was constructed out of a woven fabric, placing the date of the filter to
anytime from the 1930s to the present. However, the filter was found alongside modern trash
and is considered out of context. The paper “Mountain Dew” label is modern.
Backhoe Trench 6
Backhoe Trench 6 (BHT 6, field recorded as T-2) was excavated on top of an alluvial terrace,
north of BHT 5. The area surrounding the trench was overgrown with brush and tall grasses.
Some oaks and pine trees were in the area, but large portions of the terrace had been cleared.
The trench measured 7.5 meters in length, maintained a width of 80 centimeters, and extended
to a maximum depth of four meters below the surface. Like BHT 5, BHT 6 contained three
distinct Zones (Figure 5-15), described as follows:

•

Zone I (0–180 cmbs) was comprised of compact, fine, very pale brown (10YR8/2) powdery
sand. The level was completely sterile and no cultural material was encountered.

•

Zone II (180–380 cmbs) consisted of coarse, yellow (10YR7/6) sand.

•

Zone III (380–400 cmbs) contained coarse yellowish brown sand (10YR5/8) with a small
amount of yellowish red (5YR5/8) clay mottling. The water table was encountered at 400
cmbs.

BHT 6 was completely sterile and contained no cultural material or features. The surrounding
area appears to have been used for the dumping of fill material and sand.
Backhoe Trench 7
Backhoe Trench 7 (BHT 7, field recorded as T-3) was excavated on the same upper alluvial
terrace as BHT 6, and was positioned approximately 50 meters to the southwest. The setting
was very similar to BHT 6, with some mature oak and pine trees, lots of brush, tall grasses, and

cleared, open pasture. The trench measured
8.5 meters in length, maintained a width of
80 centimeters and extended to a maximum
depth of 3.10 meters below the surface.
This trench differed from the previous two
(Figure 5-16), containing five distinct zones:
•

Zone I (0–25 cmbs) consisted of
compacted yellow (10YR7/6) sand
mottled with reddish yellow (5YR7/6)
clays. One fragmented mussel shell and a
red paste brick fragment were found near
the surface.

•

Zone II (25–30 cmbs) was a compact lens
of caliche (10YR8/1). This level was very
narrow and chalky.

•

Zone III (30–105 cmbs) was composed
of similar material to Zone I: compacted
yellow (10YR7/6) sand mottled with
reddish yellow (5YR7/6) clays.

•

Zone IV (105–120 cmbs) was another
thin lens of chalky white (10YR8/1),
caliche-like material.

•

Zone V (120–310 cmbs) consisted of
reddish brown (10YR5/4) or yellowish
red (10YR5/6) sandy clay. This level
contained an asphalt shingle at about 300
cmbs.

Figure 5-16. BHT 7 soil profile.

BHT 7 contained one fragmented mussel shell, a red paste brick fragment, and an asphalt
roof shingle. The soil types encountered in the five zones of BHT 7 appear to be deposited fill
material, as evidenced by the presence of an asphalt roofing shingle encountered in Zone V.
The asphalt shingle is typical to those used in the construction of the modern suburban house
roofs recently constructed in the region.
Backhoe Trench 8
Backhoe Trench 8 (BHT 8, field recorded as T-4) was excavated within the designated outfall
line corridor. The setting for BHT 8 was similar to BHTs 6 and 7, consisting of some mature
trees, thick brush, tall grasses, and areas of cleared field (Figure 5-17). The trench measured
seven meters in length, maintained a width of 80 centimeters, and extended to a maximum
depth of three meters below the surface. The trench was comprised of four distinct zones:

•

Zone I (0–50 cmbs) contained grayish
brown (10YR5/2) sandy loam. One
fragmented mussel shell, a collapsed
Coca-Cola can, and several red paste
bricks fragments were found at the
surface near the southwestern end of the
trench.

•

Zone II (50–205 cmbs) was comprised of
compact very pale brown (10YR8/2) silty
sand.

•

Zone III (205–270 cmbs) consisted of
mottled yellowish brown (10YR5/4)
sandy clay and reddish brown (5YR5/4)
clay.

•

Zone IV (270–300 cmbs) was composed
of compact, pinkish gray (10YR7/2)
silty clay, mottled with reddish yellow
(10YR6/6) clay. One small fragment of
tin foil was encountered in Zone IV.

BHT 8 appears to contain deposited fill
material. A fragmented mussel shell, a
collapsed Coca-Cola can, and several red
paste bricks fragments were encountered in
the upper 50 cmbs. The brick likely comes
from a small pile of bricks deposited near the
western end of the trench and are identical
Figure 5-17. BHT 8 soil profile.
to the type found in BHT 7. Additionally, a
small fragment of tin foil was encountered in
Zone IV. None of the material encountered in BHT 8 is considered archeological.
Discussion of Detention Pond Area
As BHTs 5–8 document, the area for the new proposed detention basin appears to have been
previously modified by cutting and filling. Aerial photographs support this interpretation.
A 1957 aerial photograph of the newly proposed detention basin depicts the area as heavily
wooded with no development or structures visible (Figure 5-18). However, by 1976 a large
swath of the southern portion of the property had been cleared with the ground surface appearing
to have been clearly scraped (Figure 5-19). Currently, the newly proposed detention basin is
being used as a dumping ground for fill material, old cars and boats, and general domestic trash
(Figure 5-20).

Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed the proposed Treaschwig Road expansion project from 1,000 feet west of
Aldine Westfield Road to 1,500 feet east of Birnam Wood Boulevard in Spring, Harris County,
Texas. The project was conducted under the ACT and work conformed to the guidelines for
implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26 and the THC/CTA guidelines.
AmaTerra had access to 100 percent of existing ROW and access to most parcels that were
deemed to have some potential for cultural resources. Shovel testing was focused in areas
where access was available and in areas where the potential for archeological materials to be
present was inferred to be high.
Investigators conducted a thorough pedestrian survey, manually excavated 38 shovel tests, and
mechanically excavated eight backhoe trenches in support of this project. No cultural materials
were observed and no new archeological sites were recorded during field investigations. For
due diligence, investigators documented nine buildings greater than 50 years in age adjacent
to the proposed new ROW. These buildings are outside the APE as defined under the ACT,
but could be considered within the APE should Section 106 apply to the project. None of
the buildings would be directly affected by the proposed road expansion; moreover, none are
recommended as eligible for listing to the NRHP.
AmaTerra recommends that no further work is warranted under the ACT or Section 106, should
it apply. This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 7084.

Introduction
In January of 2018, AmaTerra was contracted by Klotz Associates, Inc. to conduct a
supplemental archeological resource survey under Antiquities Permit No. 7084. The location
of the Treaschwig Road improvements detention pond was moved again. The detention pond
is now proposed for the west side of Cypress Creek, south of Treaschwig Road (Figure B-1).
Additionally, the pond will be located within a 57.9 acre parcel that Harris County is proposing
to develop for a park. The proposed Anchor Park will link to the Cypress Creek Greenway Trail
and include equestrian trails, an equestrian facility, walking trails, a playground, restrooms
and a 10.5-acre detention pond (Figure B-2). Harris County asked AmaTerra to survey the
entire park as well as the detention pond under Permit No. 7084. AmaTerra requested a permit
modification for this effort, and all work was carried out to conform to 13 TAC 26, which
outlines the regulations for implementing the ACT.
Fieldwork was conducted on February 6th–8th, 2018. James J. Hill served as the Project
Archeologist while Amy Goldstein and Joshua Zatopec assisted with the field investigations.
Fieldwork included a pedestrian survey with 100 percent surface inspection of the proposed
Area of Potential Effect (APE) supplemented with extensive shovel testing across the entire
57.9-acre parcel.

Methods
Archeological fieldwork included visual inspection of the entire project area along with
manual shovel test excavation at a rate of 1.2 tests per acre, which exceeds the CTA standards.
Backhoe trenching was originally proposed as an additional discovery tactic within the 10.5acre detention pond as ground disturbing impacts are projected to go as deep as ten feet (3.2
meters) below surface in this area. Ultimately trenching was unable to be carried out however,
as vegetation proved to be much too dense to maneuver a backhoe. Moreover, based on data
from Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), th eproposed pond area falls within a
context where surface survey only is recommended (Figure B-3).
Shovel tests were generally spaced at 60–75 meters (m) intervals. Test spacing decreased at
sites or when cultural material was discovered. Investigators dug a total of 72 shovel tests.
Of those, eight were positive for cultural material. Shovel tests were concentrated along the
terraces surrounding Cypress Creek as they were deemed to have the highest potential for
cultural resources. Additional tests were concentrated within the proposed detention pond as
this area will be most vertically impacted area within the APE.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and, extended in some areas (primarily along Cypress
Creek and supplemental drainages) to a maximum depth of 110 cmbs. The shovel tests were
excavated in 10-cm increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth.
Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Relevant information for all shovel tests was
be recorded on a standardized form and shovel test locations were marked with handheld GPS
units.

Results
A total of 72 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed project area (Figure B-4). Eight
of them were positive for artifacts. Thirty-eight were excavated during the delineation of newly
recorded and re-visited sites as well as probing historical localities, while the remaining 34
served as a discovery tactic. Variability within shovel tests did exist depending largely on
localized field conditions including areas of disturbance, soil types or basal clay. The average
shovel test was excavated to a depth of 50 centimeters below surface (cmbs). Soils were
generally deeper and sandier along the terrace of Cypress Creek and become shallower and
more clayey as shovel testing trended away from the creek.
Vegetation is extremely thick throughout the APE. Pine, yaupon, water oak, Live Oak and
hackberry trees dominate the larger vegetation types and is supplemented by dense understory
foliage consisting of a various shrubs and vines. Ground visibility ranged from 0 to 100 percent
across the entire APE with an average of approximately 20 percent.
Two newly recorded sites (41HR1212 and 41HR1213), a single previously recorded site
(41HR372) as well as two additional historic localities were observed within the APE.
Descriptions of each of the newly recorded sites, the previously recorded site as well as the
historic localities are discussed in further detail below.

Newly Recorded Sites
41HR1212
Site 41HR1212 is a pre-contact period habitation site that resides on the southern bank of
Cypress Creek at an abrupt bend in the creek (Figure B-5). The site is completely buried and
was identified during shovel testing and surface inspection of looter pits along the creek. The
full extent of the site measures approximately 60 meters north to south by 140 meters east
to west, encompassing 1.6 acres. Cypress Creek forms the eastern boundary, and a pipeline
corridor forms the southern boundary. A small erosional gully leading into Cypress Creek
forms the north and west boundaries of site.
Topographically, the site is situated on an upper terrace of a prominent bend in Cypress Creek.
The creek has been cutting into the west bank so Site 41HR1212 falls on the erosional side.
A small gulley leading to the creek runs along the north and west sides of the site and this too
has likely caused some erosion of the landform over time (Figures B-6 and B-7). Several
species of hardwoods were noted within the site boundary that includes variations of oak, pine
and cypress trees. An abundance of understory growth that includes numerous shrub and vine
species were also noted. Ground surface visibility is less than 10 percent throughout the site
boundary apart from an ATV trail running along the edge of the terrace, next to the creek where
ground visibility was 100 percent (Figure B-8). Soils range considerably across the extent of
the site. Along the terrace, soils are mostly sandy, consisting of pink (7.5YR 7/4) to dark brown
(10YR 3/3) and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sand, sandy loam and silty sand that extends
to at least 60 cmbs along the terrace. These soil deposits overlay an olive yellow (7.5YR 6/6)
sandy clay. Further away from the terrace, the soils tend to be shallower consisting of grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) clay soil on average 40–50 cmbs.

Fourteen shovel tests were excavated to determine site boundaries and assess buried deposits.
A total of thirteen artifacts were recorded within five positive shovel tests excavated along
the upper terrace of the creek (Table B-1). Artifacts were recorded as shallow as 20 cmbs and
as deep as 60 cmbs. The prehistoric artifact assemblage consisted of lithic debitage (n=11),
a ceramic sherd and a Gary projectile point (Figures B-9 and B-10). The lone sherd was too
small to determine a temporal affiliation but had bone tempering. It was recorded at 40 cmbs,
at roughly the same depth as the Gary point. Gary Points are commonly found throughout the
east Texas Piney Woods region and are thought to date to the Woodland period, although they
are common among Caddo period assemblages as well. No prehistoric features were identified
during the course of the investigation.
Investigators noted evidence of previous looting at the site. In total, investigators found four
looter pits during the assessment of 41HR1212. The looting has occurred primarily in the
western portion of the site and appears to be extensive and methodical (Figures B-11–B-13).
The largest pit measures approximately 73.4 square meters and looks as if collectors deliberately
dug in regular-sized excavation units, with straight-sided walls. Aside from the looting, there
are no other major human-made disturbances, although a certain amount of natural erosion has
likely occurred along the creek bank.

Although a portion of the site has been affected by previous collecting, an estimated 50-60
percent of the site appears to be buried and intact, at least as deep as 60 cmbs and likely deeper in
some portions of the site. Shovel testing reached a maximum depth of 90 cmbs, but observations
of the cut banks along Cypress Creek suggest that there is potential for archeological deposits
to extend up to at least two meters below the surface. Overall the assemblage from shovel
tests reveal a variety of materials suggesting a prehistoric encampment. Based on shovel
tests and visual evaluation of cut banks along the creek, investigators believe that there is
potential for the site to contain intact and stratified archeological deposits to depths well below
a meter. Investigators recommend site 41HR1212 has unknown eligibility until it can be more
thoroughly assessed for its potential to be listed on the NRHP or as a SAL. Avoidance of the site
is recommended and if avoidance is not possible, formal NRHP/SAL-testing is recommended.

Appendix B

41HR1213
Site 41HR1213 is a twentieth century household debris dump located along a first-order
tributary of Cypress Creek (Figure B-14). The site is in a moderately wooded area of pine,
yaupon, water oak, and hackberry trees. Ground surface visibility was very poor due to leaf
litter. The site measures approximately 60 m northeast to southwest by 35 m northwest to
southeast. Artifacts were confined to the drainage and its banks and were all found in surface
contexts. Six shovel tests (AG12-13, JZ13, and JZ26-28) were excavated around the edges of
the surface artifacts, but all shovel tests were negative. A typical soil profile at the site consists
of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) saturated sandy clay overlaying a very dark gray (10YR 3/1)
hydric clay extending typically to a maximum depth of 50cmbs.
Artifacts observed throughout the site were common early-mid twentieth century household
items. A large pile of building debris that included broken concrete, corrugated sheet metal,
and a broken bathroom sink sits near the southwest edge of the site. Dozens of glass jars and
bottles were scattered along the drainage and its banks: mason jars, cold cream jars, condiment
bottles, Clorox bottles, medicine bottles, and beverage containers were all present in various
states of completeness. Maker’s marks on some of the glass bases could be used to date the
vessels (Figures B-15a–f). Several Owens Illinois Glass Company bottles the that date between
1929 and 1960 were present. One bottle that was probably used for medicine was made by
the Owens Bottle Company between 1919 and 1929. The oldest identifiable bottle from the
site was made by the Chattanooga Glass Company sometime between 1901 and 1913. A few
broken pieces of ceramic from flower pots and bathroom appliances were observed along with
a few miscellaneous metal pieces, but glass was by far the most common artifact type.
Historic topographic maps dating to as early as 1919 do not show a structure in the location
of 41HR1213. The earliest available aerial photograph of the site area from 1944 also does
not show a structure in the site location. This suggests that the artifacts at 41HR1213 were
dumped in this location after a house or some other structure was demolished, or simply as
part of everyday waste disposal. Several houses are depicted nearby on historic maps from
the 1940s and the residents of these homes likely dumped unwanted debris along the nearby
creek banks-- a common occurrence for rural households of the early twentieth century. Since
41HR1213 represents a secondary deposit with no context, nor clear association to any structure
or individual, it is not likely to yield further information and is therefore recommended as not
eligible for NRHP/SAL-listing. No further work is recommended for Site 41HR1213.

Previously Recorded Sites
41HR372 (Historic Locality 1)
During the survey, one previously recorded site, 41HR372 was revisited as part of investigations
(Figure B16). 41HR372 was recorded in 1978 by Tom Hale. Scant information was available
on the Atlas (2018), but according the site form, it appears that Mr. Hale recorded the site
after viewing the artifact collection of Herbert Theiss, the one-time landowner of the property.
According to Mr. Hale, the site was eroding out of an “old cut channel of Cypress Creek” that
extended into an agricultural field owned by the Theiss family. Material collected from the site

included at least one Archaic Period dart point as well as ceramics. The site form states that the
artifacts were collected “10 or 20 years ago” and come from “this site and basically no further
downstream than about one mile to Forest Lake.” So, it appears the artifacts included in the
1978 site recording may cover a large area along Cypress Creek.
AmaTerra revisited the site and excavated more than 12 shovel tests in its vicinity. None of the
shovel tests contained any prehistoric artifacts. However, three shovel tests contained asphalt
approximately 10–15 cmbs (Table B-2). No evidence of the prehistoric component of Site
41HR372 was observed. Investigators did note a large amount of historic period debris within
an erosional gulley draining into Cypress Creek. This debris includes concrete, brick, rebar and
asphalt, as well as shell tabby (for examples, see Figures B-17–B-21). This last item typically
dates to the mid-nineteenth century. Although the debris is likely more than 50 years in age,
it has by all indications has been dumped in this location to create erosion control along the
length of the gulley and the creek banks.

Historical topographic and aerials maps were consulted as part of the 41HR372 site revisit.
The earliest available historic map, a 1919 topographic map, shows a single historic structure
located approximately 140 meters (450 feet) southwest of the APE (Figure B-22). Subsequent
maps, including the earliest available aerial photograph of the site area from 1944 does not
show structures in this location suggesting they were already abandoned and demolished by
that time. This information supports the idea that building debris has been dumped in this
area, possibly as debris from demolished structures appearing on the 1919 map. and does
not represent an actual occupation. Since the building debris represents a secondary deposit
with no context, nor clear association to any structure, it was not given a new site number nor
reported as secondary component to 41HR372. Furthermore, no evidence of the prehistoric
site 41HR372 was found. Therefore, no further work is recommended at this historic locality.

Historic Locality 2
During the course of the survey an additional historic locality was noted within in the north central
portion of the APE. This location consists of two piles of broken concrete (Figure B-23). One
pile is oblong and measures approximately 2 x 10 meters; the other is more circular, measuring
approximately two meters in diameter. Both debris have been dumped in this location and
are not associated with any nearby structure. Lichen growing on the concrete suggest that the
debris has been here for some time. The concrete has large aggregate, which suggests it dates
to the early-mid twentieth century (Figure B-24). Six shovel tests (AG3, AG7-8, and JZ2022) were excavated around the concrete to probe for related subsurface deposits. All shovel
tests were devoid of cultural material and no additional artifacts were recorded on the ground
surface nor around either of the concrete piles.
Historic topographic maps dating to as early as 1919 do not show a structure in this location
(see Figure B-22). The earliest available aerial photograph of the site area from 1944 also does
not show a structure in this location. This information supports the notion that the concrete
building material is a secondary deposit. Since the concrete building material has no context,
nor clear association to any structure, it was not given a site designation. This locality does not
have any further research potential, and no further work is recommended.

Summary and Recommendations
Seventy-two shovel tests were excavated as part of the investigations within the 57.9-acre park.
Two newly-recorded archeological sites (41HR1212 and 41HR1213) as well as two historic
localities (HL1 and HL2) were recorded and a single previously recorded site (41HR372) was
revisited during fieldwork.
Site 41HR1212 is a pre-contact period habitation site that resides on the southern bank of
Cypress Creek with deep, sandy soils with the possibility of containing deeper, buried deposits
from 20–100 cmbs. It is characterized by several artifact types, including lithic debitage, a
Gary Point, and bone tempered ceramics. Systematic looting has taken place across the eastern
portion of the site, but an estimated 60 percent of the site is still intact. As more information is
needed to further characterize artifact and feature content, as well as investigate the depth of
deposits, NRHP eligibility is undetermined at this time. Current project plans call for hiking
and equestrian trails at this location. These amenities would not only have shallow or surficial
impacts, but would also increase use of the area. An influx of people in and around the site could
adversely affect the site via soil degradation and increase the risk of looting. Site 41HR1212
should be avoided and it is recommended that no trails be constructed anywhere near the site.
If avoidance of the site is not feasible, AmaTerra recommends NRHP/SAL-eligibility testing at
41HR1212 to identify a strategy to protect the site or to develop a data recovery plan.
Site 41HR1213 is a twentieth century household debris dump located along a first-order
tributary of Cypress Creek with shallow, clayey soils with limited potential to contain intact
buried deposits. Artifacts observed throughout the site were common early-mid twentieth
century household items including dozens of glass jars and bottles. All the artifacts looked to
dumped here secondarily likely from a nearby home. Because the site 41HR1213 represents
secondary deposits with no context or research potential, it was not recommended for listing as
an NRHP eligible site or SAL. No further work is recommended.
The previously recorded 41HR372 multicomponent prehistoric site was unable to be relocated.
It was originally recorded in 1978 and according to the Atlas, has not been revisited since. It
is possible the site was plotted in the wrong location as the archival data available is over 30
years old and highly speculative as to where exactly the site was recorded and what artifacts
were recorded at the site. As a result, the portion of 41HR372 that resides within the APE
is recommended not eligible for listing as a SAL or NRHP property. No further work is
recommended.
The two historic localities (HL1 and HL2) represent secondarily deposited historic building
material and thus had no integrity nor any historical significance. No site designation was
given, and no further work is recommended in these areas.
With respect to the 57.9-acre property, AmaTerra recommends that the proposed drainage pond
will have no effect on NRHP-eligible resources. However, construction of trails and opening
of the property to public visitation could adversely effect site 41HR1212. Therefore, AmaTerra
recommends eliminating trails through the property, or if that is not feasible, then NRHP/SALeligibility testing is recommended for site 41HR1212.
