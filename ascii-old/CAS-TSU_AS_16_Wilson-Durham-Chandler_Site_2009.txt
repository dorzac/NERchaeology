the Civil War. The first of these sites was owned by the slave holder John McKamie
as managed by several of his slaves from around 1857 to 1869. After emancipation,
ame some of the earliest African American entrepreneurs in Texas. Hiram Wilson
ran the H. Wilson and Company pottery business, with the aid of James, Wallace,
ew Wilson, from around 1869 to 1884. James and Wallace Wilson later bought into
m-Chandler pottery manufacturing business, which had opened in 1869, and worked
arion Durham and John Chandler until that operation closed in 1903.

Details of his

early life before arriving in Texas with the family
of John McKamie Wilson, Jr. in 1856 are largely
unknown. More is known about the wealthy slave
owner John McKamie Wilson, who practiced
law in Burke County, North Carolina. Around
1846-47 he moved with his family and slaves to
Fulton County, Missouri, where he worked as a
Presbyterian Minister and was instrumental in
building a seminary and school. Finally, in 1856
Wilson and his group entered Texas, apparently
to continue maintaining slaves while northern
states were challenging the practice. While in
Texas, Wilson supported the Southern cause in
the Civil War by sending two of his sons to fight
for the Confederacy (Brackner 1981).
In Texas, John McKamie Wilson set up
his household in Seguin, Guadalupe County.
His works in the Seguin community included
minister of the Presbyterian Church, headmaster
of the female academy of Guadalupe College,
and eventually the owner of a stoneware
pottery business. These roles are highlighted
in A Handbook of Texas Online article by Jean
Andrews (2008). In the days before refrigeration
or even the delivery of blocks of ice, utilitarian
stoneware pottery was in great demand to store
and conserve perishable food items. Having spent
time in the Edgefield District of the Carolinas,
Wilson certainly knew the economic potential
and some degree of the technology behind
pottery manufacturing. Wilson has been quoted
as stating, "From the high price of stoneware and
the demand for it, I felt that the pottery business

used to grind the clay. A large waster pile was
also visible on the surface of the site at the time
of Brackner's study. Ceramics at this site were
made with the alkaline and the salt glaze surface
treatments. This first Wilson Pottery business
lasted until 1869. Wilson Pottery production
continued in later years at two other locales.

would be profitable and a source of convenience
and pecuniary advantage to the country" (Blake,
Johnson, and Kinz 1999). He soon set up his own
Guadalupe Pottery business in the Capote Hills,
an area rich in raw clay resources. Guadalupe
Pottery was staffed and maintained by Wilson
slaves who had either learned how to make
pottery in the Carolinas or Missouri, or were
taught pottery manufacturing by John McKamie
Wilson, Jr. or by hired specialists in Texas,
perhaps including Isaac Suttles, Marion Durham,
and John Chandler.
Guadalupe Pottery (41GU6), a utilitarian

stoneware pottery manufacture site is the first
of three sites that today still reveal the remains
of Wilson Pottery production (Figure 1-1).
John McKamie Wilson began the tradition of
producing ceramic containers for food storage at
this locale. A magnetometry survey of this site,
conducted as part of a masters' thesis by Elmer
Joe Brackner, Jr. (1981) revealed the remains of
one oblong groundhog kiln at the site, as well as

The Wilson-Durham-Chandler Pottery Site
(41GU4) was the second location of Wilson
pottery production. Marion Durham, a white
man, and John Chandler, an African American,
were potters from South Carolina that moved to
Texas in the late 1860s (Brackner 1981). They
purchased the manufacturing equipment from
John McKamie Wilson when he closed his first
pottery, and founded this second production site.
It seems that they may have moved the pottery
manufacturing business to the new locale to
be closer to the raw clay resource and the road
that linked Seguin to the Capote community
(Brackner 1981; Greer 1985). Ex-slaves from
Wilson's business also worked
at this locale. It is unclear if

and there were several looters' holes dug into the
kiln before the excavations began.
Excavators working at the Beehive Kin
included Oly Schrank, Beth Langy, and Richard
Kinz. The limits of the excavation were set by
following the visible architecture (Figure 2-2).
Kinz recognized the :floor of the kiln when he
reached a compact and slick surface. The bricks
in the walls sat on top of this slick :floor. It is not
clear how the kiln worked without the usual two
levels of chambers (see Chapter 5, Figure 5-3).
No excavations were conducted to lower levels.

While working at the Beehive Kiln, Kinz
was assisted by the artist Joe Pirog. This artist
made a model of the beehive kiln, illustrating
the interior architecture (Figure 2-3). He read
about the Wilson Pottery Site and came to see the
area for himself. Pirog was a potter interested in
reconstructing Wilson Pottery, and his interest in
the site caused him to purchase land in the Seguin
area. He had hoped to make modern pottery in
the style of utilitarian stoneware mimicking the
Wilson tradition, but was not pursued by the
Wilson Foundation to conduct this work. Pirog
was responsible for constructing an extension of
the fence that borders the site,
moving it further to the east to
enclose the beehive kiln area.

Excavations
at
the
groundhog kiln were conducted
in 2004-2006. Jon St. Clair,
volunteer on the project, located
this kiln by kicking up dirt above
the bricks. Then the excavators
opened excavations in that spot
and exposed the interior of the
walls of the kiln (Figure 2-4).
All of the bricks in the walls
were coated with glaze on the
interior. Excavations followed
the western wall of the kiln until
they located the double chimney
at the northern end, which is an
unusual feature for a groundhog
kiln. They also located the small
entryway door that James Wilson
Jr. describes climbing into and
out of to access the interior of the
kiln (interview with Georgeanna

Greer, 1979, from the Institute of Texas Cultures).
Lastly, they uncovered a small pile of plain lids
near the entryway. In total, this work uncovered
the chimney, the small doorway at the northeast
corner, part of the inside of the western wall '

and were covered with glaze on the inside of the
kiln as a result of the firing process. This is a
common result of the use of salt-glaze on pottery
from this time period. When the salt is introduced
to the hot kiln through openings in the top of the
structure, a chemical reaction takes place and
separates the elements in the salt, producing
hydrochloric acid vapor that corrodes the bricks
and eventually renders the kiln unusable (Greer
1981; Montgomery 2004). Interestingly, sites that
employed salt-glazing often demonstrate a series
of kilns used in this process, one being replaced
by another as the process corroded the interior of
the kilns, just as may have been the case at the
Wilson-Durham-Chandler site (Britt 2005).

KILN CONSERVATION

Molly Morgan and Jon C. Lohse
In the winter of 2007, the Wilson Pottery
Foundation, presided over by LaVerne Britt,
contacted the Center for Archaeological Studies
(CAS) at Texas State University for conservation
work at the Wilson-Durham-Chandler site
(41GU4). The foundation had received a grant
to cover half of the costs for documentation
and conservation from the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). A contract was entered
into spanning from December 2007 through
June 2009. The work required under this
contract includes a) the archaeological mapping
d recording of the exposed kiln features, b)
e backfilling of kilns for conservation, c) the
llection of exposed pottery sherds, and d) the

the previous work, undertaken by Richard Kinz.
Those efforts had left 17 tables along the north and
south fence lines of the site, with ceramic sherds
spread out across their surfaces. Preliminary
sorting had been conducted, following form
categories such as body sherds, rim sherds, and
lids. The tables also indicated sherds that had
been removed from groundhog kiln and beehive
kiln excavations. Sherds were collected in 4
ml plastic zip-lock artifact bags with labels
indicating site identification information and the
number of the table from which those sherds had
been collected. Bags of sherds were boxed by
table. This collection methodology was followed
in order to make best use of, at a later date, the

effort that had gone into sorting sherds by Kinz
and his team.
Site clean up work included picking
up other artifacts on the surface of the site and
removing debris from past site work. Artifacts
collected included bricks, glass, metal, and
ceramic sherds littering the ground surface.
Sherds located in waster piles on the southern
side of the site were left in place, as requested
by the Wilson Pottery Foundation. Debris from
past work at the site included the sorting tables,
buckets, and hand tools. These items were
removed from the site altogether or left piled to the
sides of the site, where they were later picked up
for disposal. This work was done in preparation
for future visits to the site as an archaeological
park, to be conducted through the Wilson Pottery
Foundation. Two picnic tables were left in shady
spots under large trees to provide resting spots
and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the area.

The beehive kiln was the most extensively
excavated kiln found at the site (Figure 3-2).
Inspection of the kilnrevealed all walls completely
exposed (Figure 3-3). Preliminary conservation
measures had been taken to keep the walls from
collapsing, including reconstructing support
walls on the north, east, and west sides of the kiln
to keep exterior walls from falling outward, and
propping up existing interior architecture with
large cement blocks.
Drawings of the beehive kiln highlight
the architecture of this feature. Entrances to
fire boxes are found on both the west and east
sides (Figure 3-4). Chambers in which the
pottery vessels were fired are seen on both sides
of these entrances. The interior walls of these
chambers had thick coatings of glaze indicating
that they were used for firing salt-glazed vessels.
The southernmost two chambers still exhibited
remains of the vaulted roof structure (Figures 35). The bricks of these vaults are also covered
with glaze, as well as encrusted pottery fragments
that became adhered to their surfaces during t
firing process.

GROUND PENETRATING RADAR SURVEY
Tiffany Osburn

On September 19, 2008, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) conducted a groundpenetrating radar (GPR) survey at the Wi1sonDurham-Chand1er Pottery site. The GPR survey
was conducted in two grids to locate features
related to pottery production, including previously
unidentified kilns (Figure 4-1). The purpose of
this chapter is to summarize the results of the
survey work.

surface with a receiving antenna. The greater
the contrast in electrical, magnetic, and physical
properties between two materials at a buried
interface, the stronger the reflected signal will be,
and therefore the greater the amplitude ofreflected
waves. When collecting radar reflection data, the
surveyor moves surface radar antennas along the
ground following transects within surveyed grids
(Figures 4-1 and 4-2). The resulting data are a
series of reflections from each transect that may
be plotted to create a two-dimensional profile.
Each profile is a graphic representation of a
vertical face along a particular transect (Figure
4-3).

(nanosecond) slice roughly approximates a 15 cm
level in the ground.
One stratigraphic layer is visible in the profiles
and in the radar slices as a continuous reflection
surface that appears to slope to the north. Where
this surface is not continuous or broken, some
disturbance such as a pit, kiln, intrusive tree root
or other feature is typically the cause. Near the
center of the grid, in the area of the previously
excavated kilns, this natural layer appears to
undulate as a result of the antenna traveling over
mounded areas, thus increasing the distance
between the antenna and the stratigraphic layer
(Figure 4-4).
The results of this survey show many
anomalies that are caused by trees, tree roots,
previous excavations, piles of pottery, and old
backdirt piles.

at the surface that caused a distorted reflection
throughout the profile. Features A and D warrant
some investigation to determine their association
with the historic pottery manufacture at the site.
While the reflection data do not clearly indicate
buried kilns, analysis of the individual profiles as
well as the time slices indicate that these features
may be cultural and are not the result of tree roots
or surface disturbances.
In summary, remote sensing was productive
in identifying two features that warrant further
investigation. Features A and D (see Figure 4-6)
appear to be cultural and may represent previously
unidentified kilns associated with the WilsonDurham-Chandler Pottery site. Unfortunately,
other cultural features associated with historic
pottery making were likely obscured as a result
of surface disturbance and tree growth.

This survey identified the location of several

WILSON POTTERY

Molly Morgan
The production of stoneware utilitarian
pottery was an important economic and artistic
endeavor in the 19th century inmost regions of the
United States. Before modern refrigeration, the
storage and preservation provided by such vessels
was crucial to most households. Businesses that
could put such items on the market were generally
successful. The Wilson Potteries are an example
of such a business. This chapter provides
background information on utilitarian stoneware
production and the techniques that would have
been used at the Wilson Pottery sites. It also
.summarizes information gained from the pottery
ollected from the Wilson-Durham-Chandler site
41GU4).

Pottery Production
The pottery produced at the Wilson
sites, as well as many potteries in Central
Texas, reflected the Edgefield style of utilitarian
stoneware. Pottery was produced at this time
with the use of a potter's wheel. Clay is widely
available in Texas, and can be collected from
many streambeds. Wilson Pottery was made
from the fine clay recovered from Salt Creek,
which has a geological origin from the Carrizo
Sands of the Wilcox Formation (Blake Johnson
'
'
and Kinz 1999; Brackner 1981). This geological
deposit extends from western Alabama through
Central Texas. The high quality of this clay was
an important factor contributing to the growth of
pottery manufacturing businesses in Texas. It
allowed for the production of stoneware pottery,
which is between earthenware and porcelain in
hardness and vitrification, which depends on the
silica content in the clay and the firing temperature
(for stoneware, a temperature of 1200-1300
degrees C is necessary). The clay found along
Salt Creek in Guadalupe County worked well for
stoneware production, with only the addition of
fine sand necessary for the desired vitrification.

Pottery production in Texas was heavily
fiuenced by the Edgefield District tradition from
th Carolina. In 1850, Edgefield was the home
ve pottery manufacturing businesses. The

'
ttery production workshops were located
and eastern Texas (Brown 2002).

To produce pottery containers, the clay
would be mixed with additive ingredients (in the
Wilson case this included silica), left to dry and
age, and then moistened again and ground on a
mule-drawn pug mill. The clay was shaped into
jars, jugs, crocks, churns, and cemetery flower
jars on a kick wheel. Each piece was removed

of the examples that used salt glaze in the south
(Brackner 1981). To make the salt glaze, common
from the stone base of the pottery wheel by pulling
rock salt was thrown into the kiln in the middle

The sample collected by the Center
for Archaeological Studies did not comprise a
representative sample of pottery from the site
and therefore could not be used in a detailed
ceramic analysis. There are two reasons for
is. First, the pottery collected from 41GU4 had

systematic methods by the excavation team
Richard Kinz. Provenience information for
ferent types of ceramics found throughout the

impossible to accurately determine distributions

All of the pottery sherds collected by

the termination of this research, they will be

Wilson Pottery Shop Chronicle" that continues
to spread awareness of the Wilson pottery sites

With such strong family support, the
foundation has had several successes in
promoting increased appreciation for their
family heritage. The knowledge of the Wilson
potters that has been provided through historical
archaeology helps to foster the sense of pride
that this group feels toward the accomplishments
of their ancestors. This pride is a significant
part of their social identity as they seek public
recognition. The direct link between the material
remains of Wilson pottery activity and the
contemporary construction of this social identity
can be seen in three ways: through the collection
of Wilson pottery, in the appropriation of the
physical space of the Wilson-Durham-Chandler
site and subsequent use by the Wilson Pottery
Foundation, and in the construction of a Wilson
Pottery Museum in Seguin to exhibit objects and
disseminate information to the public.

in an important time in this country's history.
For this reason, obtaining these pottery works
is an explicit and ongoing goal of the Wilson
descendants.

Second, ownership of the Wilson-DurhamChandler site, accomplished by the Wilson
Pottery Foundation in 1999, provides the family
with direct access to the pottery workshop and
the spaces in which their ancestors labored.
Family members worked to clear the land and
Richard Kinz took charge of recovering remains
of the pottery manufacturing business. As early
as 2005, LaVerne Britt, president of the Wilson
Pottery Foundation, saw a need to stop excavation
at the site and sought opinions from professional
archaeologists as to the best way to conserve the
site. Through a Preservation Trust Fund Grant
from the Texas Historical Commission, funds
were acquired for conservation. The foundation

States in general warrants a large-scale museum
complex, complete with administrative offices,
curation facilities, gift shop, and cafe. It is
this type of museum that generally succeeds in
attracting visitors to small towns such as Seguin.
For this reason, the Texas Historical Commission
is working with a museum designer and architect
to come up with plans that will meet these specific
needs of the Wilson Pottery Museum. This work
is underway at the time of this publication and
is starting by focusing on drawing up plans,
adjusting the project budget, and fundraising.
The 41GU4 site itself will continue to be
maintained by the Wilson Pottery Foundation as
a place where their family members can enjoy the
landscape and cultural remains of the WilsonDurham-Chandler Pottery site. It is their intention
to continue to conduct tours and presentations at
the site and educate younger generations of the
Wilson family about the significant contributions
that their ancestors made to the United States
following the Civil War. The Wilson Pottery
Foundation also hopes to put up a structure where
pottery making demonstrations can be conducted
and school groups can meet for lectures, as well as
an information center, permanent restrooms, and
a picnic area. The foundation plans to offer tours
to public groups, although the site will remain
fenced and locked as they continue to protect this
piece of cultural heritage. The other two Wilson
