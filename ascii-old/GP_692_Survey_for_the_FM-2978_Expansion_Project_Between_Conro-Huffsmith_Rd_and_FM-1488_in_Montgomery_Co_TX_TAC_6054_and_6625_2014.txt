ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological
investigations, reconnaissance-level walkover survey, and targeted mechanical deep testing for
a road expansion project in Montgomery County, Texas. Approximately 49 hectares (121
acres), which includes 10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles) along Farm-to-Market Road 2978, 5
detention ponds, and 1 off-right-of-way drainage structure located between Conroe-Huffsmith
Road and Farm-to-Market Road 1488 are included within the project's Area of Potential
Effects. The Texas Department of Transportation has been identified as the Lead Agency for
this project. Work for this project was completed as part of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s overall preliminary environmental analysis filed under CSJ Number 3050-02016, issued by the Houston District. The project is also listed under construction CSJ Numbers
3050-02-024 and 3050-02-025.
Potential buried and surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this
investigation. The goals of the archaeological survey were to determine if the initiation of this
project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish
whether or not previously unidentified archaeological resources were located within the
project’s Area of Potential Effects. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with
reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, as amended [36 CFR 800]) guidelines, and according to standards set forth by the
Texas Department of Transportation Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effects subject to survey included all land within the
project footprint subsuming approximately 49 hectares (121 acres). The archaeological Area
of Potential Effects includes the existing road right-of-way (42 hectares [103 acres]), 5
proposed detention ponds (7.21 hectares [17.84 acres]), and 1 off-right-of-way drainage
structure (0.09 hectares [0.24 acres]). Proposed depth of the roadway portion of the project
will be shallow and typical of general road construction projects of this class. Proposed depth
of the detention ponds and drainage structure are not yet known but will not exceed 3 meters
(10 feet) deep. The investigations discussed in this report took place on easements belonging
to the Texas Department of Transportation and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was
obtained by the client for privately-owned land. Work conducted to complete this survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit numbers 6053 and 6625, issued by the Texas
Historical Commission’s Division of Archeology in October 2011 and August 2013,
respectively. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated within the roadway portion of the
project and 4 of the 5 proposed detention ponds. Right-of-entry was not granted on the
remaining detention pond and complete right-of-entry was not granted on the drainage
structure; therefore, a desktop assessment was conducted for these 2 properties. All findings
were negative for cultural deposits. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further
archaeological work and that the proposed project be allowed to proceed as planned.
It should be noted that a survey and report were previously conducted and prepared for this
proposed project. The draft report, dated August 1, 2012 was conducted under Texas
i

Antiquities Permit Number 6053. The report was reviewed and accepted by the Texas
Historical Commission and the Texas Department of Transportation. The State Historic
Preservation Officer concurred with the report in a letter dated October 29, 2012. This letter is
provided in Appendix D of this report. The final report is dated November 14, 2012.
However, subsequent to the concurrence letter and final report, the proposed project design
changed slightly. The proposed project previously required 3 hectares (8 acres) of additional
right-of-way for the roadway widening and 6 proposed detention ponds. The current proposed
project, as previously mentioned, now consists of the roadway widening being conducted
within the existing right-of-way (no longer requiring additional right-of-way) and requiring 5
newly proposed detention pond locations and 1 off-right-of-way drainage structure. This
report presents the results of the previous and current proposed roadway project; the current
proposed project consisting of widening the roadway within the existing right-of-way,
constructing 5 newly proposed detention ponds, and constructing 1 newly proposed off-rightof-way drainage structure; and the previously proposed project, which included proposed
right-of-way for construction of the roadway and construction of 6 proposed detention ponds.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, at the request of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.
conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations, reconnaissance-level walkover
survey, and targeted mechanical deep testing for a roadway expansion project in Montgomery
County, Texas. Approximately 49 hectares (121 acres) which includes 10.5 kilometers (6.5
miles) along Farm-to-Market Road 2978, 5 detention ponds, and 1 off-right-of-way drainage
structure between Conroe-Huffsmith Road and Farm-to-Market Road 1488 are included
within the project's Area of Potential Effects. Work for this project was completed as part of
the Texas Department of Transportation’s overall preliminary environmental analysis filed
under CSJ Number 3050-02-016, issued by the Houston District. The project is also listed
under construction CSJ Numbers 3050-02-024 and 3050-02-025.
Potential buried and surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this
investigation. A separate architectural survey has been completed for the project (SweetenMcDonald et al. 2012). The goals of the archaeological survey were to determine if the
initiation of this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined
by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800),
and to establish whether or not previously unidentified archaeological resources were located
within the project’s Area of Potential Effects. All fieldwork and reporting activities were
completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended [36 CFR 800]) guidelines, and according to standards
set forth by the Texas Department of Transportation Programmatic Agreement for
Enhancement Projects.
The intensive pedestrian survey for the service areas discussed in this report took place on
easements belonging to the Texas Department of Transportation and privately-owned
property. Right-of-entry was obtained by the client for privately owned land. Work conducted
to complete this survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permits 6053 and 6625, issued
by the Texas Historical Commission’s Division of Archeology in October 2011 and August
2013, respectively. A report (dated August 1, 2012) on the proposed roadway project,
including 6 proposed detention ponds was reviewed, accepted by the Texas Historical
Commission ([State Historic Preservation Officer] on October 29, 20112) and the Texas
Department of Transportation, and finalized (November 14, 2012), but project plans changed
slightly and the 6 previously proposed detention ponds were replaced by 5 newly proposed
detention ponds and 1 off right-of-way drainage structure. This report presents the results of
the proposed roadway project, including the widening of the roadway within the existing rightof-way, the 5 newly proposed detention ponds, the 1 newly proposed off-right-of-way
drainage structure, and the 6 previously proposed detention ponds. All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas [13 TAC 26;
1969 as amended 1997]) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
[36 CFR 800]) guidelines as set forth by the Texas Historical Commission and the Council of
Texas Archeologists and according to standards set forth by the Texas Department of
Transportation Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects.

The existing Farm-to-Market Road 2978 is a 2-lane undivided roadway. The proposed project
would widen the existing Farm-to-Market Road 2978 roadway from Farm-to-Market Road
1488 to Conroe-Huffsmith Road. The proposed project would consist of 4 lanes (two 3.3meter [11-foot] lanes in each direction), a 3.5-meter (12-foot) continuous 2 way, left turn lane
between intersections, 1.5-meter (5-foot) outside shoulders, open ditches, accommodations for
bicycle traffic, a 1.2-meter (4-foot) sidewalk in various locations on the northeast side of
Farm-to-Market 2978, and the construction of 5 detention ponds and 1 drainage structure.
Right-of-entry was granted for 4 of the 5 proposed detention ponds. Right-of-entry was not
granted at 1 remaining detention pond and the proposed off right-of-way drainage structure.
The 6 previously proposed detention ponds were surveyed, but are no longer part of the
current proposed project.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effects subject to survey, conducted for the previous
report finalized on November 14, 2012, included all land within the project footprint, which
consisted of a total right-of-way width (existing and proposed) of up to 55 meters (180 feet)
along the 10.5-kilometer (6.5-mile) roadway. The archaeological Area of Potential Effects
included a total of approximately 42 hectares (103 acres) of existing road right-of-way and
approximately 3 hectares (8 acres) of new proposed road right-of-way. Proposed depth of the
roadway portion of the project will be shallow and typical of general road construction
projects of this class (see attached typical section drawings). No deep impacts are associated
with the road construction.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effects has now been subsequently expanded to also
include the acreage of the design changes; 5 proposed detention ponds and 1 proposed offright-of-way drainage structure. The project proposes to excavate the 5 new detention ponds
and 1 off right-of-way drainage structure adjacent to the road right-of-way within the 10.5kilometer (6.5-mile) limit between Conroe-Huffsmith Road and Farm-to-Market Road 1488.
The detention ponds will subsume of a total of 7.21 hectares (17.84 acres). The off right-ofway drainage structure will subsume of a total of 0.09 hectares (0.24 acres). The proposed
depth of the 5 detention ponds and 1 off right-of-way drainage structure are not yet known but
will not exceed 3 meters (10 feet) deep. Therefore, the entire archaeological Area of Potential
Effects for the Farm-to-Market Road 2978 expansion project will subsume approximately 49
hectares (121 acres).
Fieldwork was conducted by HRA Gray & Pape, LLC in 3 mobilizations by Project
Archaeologist Charles E. Bludau, Jr., Crew Chiefs Julia Balakirova and Jessica Bludau, and
Field Technician Dariusz Soltysiak. All fieldwork was supervised by project Principal
Investigator James Hughey. The archaeological pedestrian survey of the roadway and
previously proposed detention ponds was conducted between October 10 and 19, 2011,
mechanical deep testing was attempted at the previously proposed detention ponds on
February 7, 2012, and 4 of the 5 newly proposed detention ponds were surveyed on August 15
and 16, 2013. Fieldwork required a total of 120 person hours to complete. Site file research
was completed prior to fieldwork mobilizations by Charles E. Bludau, Jr. Graphics were
produced by Julia Balakirova. Report content was prepared by Jessica Bludau and Vincent
Valenti with contributions by Charles E. Bludau, Jr. The report was edited and produced by
Jessica Bludau.
iv

The Texas Department of Transportation’s Houston Area Potential Archaeological Liability
Map was the primary guide for determining the level of effort appropriate to insure adequate
survey. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated at undisturbed locations within the previous
and current project’s Area of Potential Effects includes. All shovel tests were negative for
archaeological deposits. The entire project area was also subjected to reconnaissance-level
walkover survey and photo-documentation of previous disturbances associated with
development and road construction. In addition, deep testing as recommended by Texas
Department of Transportation’s Houston Area Potential Archaeological Liability Map was
attempted at several of the 6 previously proposed detention pond locations. Due to safety
concerns and unstable soils, backhoe trenching was not completed as planned at the 6
previously proposed detention ponds. As a result of this investigation, no new or previously
recorded archaeological resources were identified within the project’s Area of Potential
Effects. Based on the negative results across the 52 hectares (129 acres) encompassing the
entire previous and current project’s Area of Potential Effects for the Farm-to-Market Road
2978 expansion project, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further archaeological work
and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, at the request of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.
conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations, reconnaissance-level walkover
survey, and targeted mechanical deep testing for a road expansion project in Montgomery
County, Texas. Approximately 49 hectares (121 acres) which includes 10.5 kilometers (6.5
miles) along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2978, 5 detention ponds and 1 off-right-of-way
(ROW) drainage structure located between Conroe-Huffsmith (also spelled Hufsmith or
Hufsmith-Conroe) Road and FM Road 1488 included within the project's Area of Potential
Effects (APE). Work for this project was completed as part of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) overall preliminary environmental analysis filed under CSJ
Number 3050-02-016, issued by the Houston District. The project is also listed under
construction CSJ Numbers 3050-02-024 and 3050-02-025. A report, dated August 1, 2012, for
the proposed roadway project, including 6 proposed detention ponds, was reviewed, accepted
by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) ([State Historic Preservation Officer] on October
29, 20112) and TxDOT, and finalized (November 14, 2012), but project plans changed
slightly and the 6 previously proposed detention ponds were replaced by 5 newly proposed
detention ponds and 1 off ROW drainage structure. In addition, the proposed ROW for the
roadway widening was replaced within constructing the roadway within the existing ROW.
Potential buried and surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this
investigation. A separate non-archeological resources survey has been completed for the
project (Sweeten-McDonald et al. 2012). The goals of the archaeological survey were to
determine if the initiation of this project would affect any previously identified historic
properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified
archaeological resources were located within the project’s APE.
The intensive pedestrian survey completed for the service areas discussed in this report took
place on easements belonging to TxDOT and privately-owned property. Right-of-entry was
obtained by the client for privately owned land. Work conducted to complete this survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permits 6053 and 6625, issued by the THC’s Division of
Archeology in October 2011 and August 2013 respectively. All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas 1969, as amended
in 1997) and federal (NHPA of 1966, as amended [36CFR 800]) and the United States
Department of the Interior (USDI 1981; 1983) guidelines as set forth by the THC and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and according to standards set forth by the TxDOT
Programmatic Agreement for Enhancement Projects.
The NHPA of 1966 (P.L.89-665, as amended by P.L. 91-243, 93-54, 94-422, 94-458, and 96515) established the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to list properties significant
in American history, architecture, archaeology, or culture, and directed the heads of federal
agencies to take into account the effect of federal or federally assisted undertakings on eligible
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects. Executive Order 11593, Protection and

Preservation Act of 1974 which strengthened this directive and mandated recovery,
preservation, and analysis of significant data gathered in relation to a federal undertaking.
Procedures for complying with federal regulations are given in Procedures for the Protection
of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800) and NRHP (36 CFR 60). The steps that a
federal agency must take to insure proper review of any undertaking funded or permitted by
that agency and to comply with the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA are elucidated
by 36 CFR 800. According to 36 CFR 800 all NRHP and NRHP-eligible properties that may
be impacted must be identified. The Criteria of Effect (36 CFR 800.3[a]) must then be applied
in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) to determine whether the
undertaking will have an effect on any National Register or National Register-eligible
properties. The Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR. 800.3 [b]) is then to be applied to any
effected properties to determine the nature of the effect. If no adverse effect will result from
the undertaking, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) must be furnished
with documentation of this finding. If the undertaking will have an adverse effect, the agency
must consult with the ACHP and SHPO to consider alternatives that could avoid, mitigate, or
minimize the adverse effects (ACHP 2004).

1.1 Project Description
The existing FM 2978 is a 2-lane undivided roadway. The proposed project would widen the
existing FM 2978 roadway from FM 1488 to Conroe-Huffsmith Road. The proposed project
would consist of 4 lanes (two 3.3-meter [11-foot] lanes in each direction), a 3.5-meter (12foot) continuous 2 way, left turn lane between intersections, 1.5-meter (5-foot) outside
shoulders, open ditches, accommodations for bicycle traffic, a 1.2-meter (4-foot) sidewalk in
various locations on the northeast side of FM 2978, and the construction of 5 detention ponds
and 1 drainage structure.
The archaeological APE subject to survey, conducted for the previous report finalized on
November 14, 2012, included all land within the project footprint, which consisted of a total
ROW width (existing and proposed) of up to 55 meters (180 feet) along the 10.5-kilometer
(6.5-mile) roadway. The archaeological APE included a total of approximately 42 hectares
(103 acres) of existing road ROW and approximately 3 hectares (8 acres) of new proposed
road ROW. Proposed depth of the roadway portion of the project will be shallow and typical
of general road construction projects of this class (see attached typical section drawings). No
deep impacts are associated with the road construction.
The archaeological APE has now been subsequently expanded to also include the acreage of
the design changes; 5 proposed detention ponds and 1 proposed off-ROW drainage structure.
The project proposes to excavate the 5 new detention ponds and 1 off-ROW drainage structure
adjacent to the road ROW within the 10.5-kilometer (6.5-mile) limit between ConroeHuffsmith Road and FM Road 1488. The detention ponds will subsume of a total of 7.21
hectares (17.84 acres). The off-ROW drainage structure will subsume of a total of 0.09
hectares (0.24 acres). The proposed depth of the 5 detention ponds and 1 off-ROW drainage
structure are not yet known but will not exceed 3 meters (10 feet) deep. Therefore, the entire
archaeological APE for the FM Road 2978 expansion project will subsume approximately 49
hectares (121 acres).

It should be noted that portions of the APE along the survey corridor traverse areas that have
been disturbed by previous drainage and roadway construction as well as belowground and
aboveground utility installation, and commercial/residential development.

NATURAL SETTING

2.1 Physiography and Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain extends north to
the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and west to the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The
basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which
includes Montgomery County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes brought about by glacial advance in the northern
portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load
capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, Montgomery County is underlain by relatively recent
sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to
Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).

2.2 Soils
The majority of soils within the APE include Bibb soils, Nahatche loam, Boy fine sand,
Conroe loamy fine sand, Conroe gravelly loamy fine sand, Fuquay loamy fine sand, terrace,
Sorter silt loam, Splendora fine sandy loam, Lucy loamy fine sand, and Waller loam. Only
Bibb and Nahatche soils are classified by Abbott as having high potential for containing
buried prehistoric deposits (Abbott 2001:21).
Bibb soil (Bb) is poorly drained and found in stream floodplains on coastal plains throughout
the southeast (Soil Survey Staff, National Cooperative Soil Survey, Web Soil Survey [SSS
NCSS WSS] 2013). A typical soil profile consists of 10 centimeters (4 inches) of brown sandy
loam underlain by 20 centimeters (8 inches) of mottled dark gray and dark grayish brown
sandy loam. Below these layers lies gray sandy loam to a depth of 94 centimeters (37 inches),
followed by gray silt loam to a depth of 1.5 meters (60 inches). Abbott classifies Bibb soils as
high for geoarchaeological potential due to frequent flooding and the likelihood of buried soil
horizons beneath the recently deposited alluvium (Abbott 2001:21). Bibb soils are found in the
floodplains of Nickaburr Creek, Bear Branch, Dry Creek, and Spring Creek.
Nahatche series soils (Na) are formed in loamy Holocene alluvium in floodplains. Abbott
(2001) categorizes these soils in his high geoarchaeological potential group. A typical profile
of Nahatche loam consists of an A horizon 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) thick of brown
(10YR 4/3) clay loam that is very hard and exhibits a blocky structure. There are few fine faint
dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations and it has a clear smooth boundary.
This is followed by a Bg horizon that is 26 centimeters (10 inches) thick dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) clay loam. This horizon displays common medium distinct yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, few fine iron-manganese concretions; and has clear smooth
lower boundary. This is followed by a second Bg horizon 26 centimeters (10 inches) thick. It
is composed of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam with a subangular blocky structure and
many coarse distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations. It has a few fine ironmanganese concretions and a gradual smooth lower boundary. Two more Bg horizon follow
5

that together are 76 centimeters (30 inches) thick. These 2 layers are light brownish gray
(10YR 6/2), 35% gray (10YR 6/1), and 30% strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam becoming
sandy clay loam in the lower part (Bg4). Both parts have a subangular, blocky structure, ironmanganese concentrations and a clear wavy lower boundary. Below this is a buried Ag
horizon 61 centimeters (24 inches) thick. This buried horizon is extremely hard clay loam with
many medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR
5/8) redox concentrations (Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service, United
States Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA] 2013). Nahatche loam is found only
within the floodplain of Spring Creek.
Boy fine sand (Bo) consists of very strongly acid, grayish-brown fine sand A horizon
extending 13 centimeters (7 inches) from the surface. An E horizon consisting of very acid,
very friable, pale-brown loamy fine sand with yellowish-brown mottles is present from 13 to
88 centimeters (7 to 35 inches). Below this a second E horizon from 88 to 119 centimeters (35
to 47 inches) thick is strongly acid, very friable, pale-brown loamy fine sand with yellowishbrown and yellowish-red mottles. This is followed by a Btvg horizon that consists of strongly
acid, friable, light brownish-gray sandy clay loam with red and strong brown mottles and
reaches a depth of 119 to 178 centimeters (47 to 70 inches) (SSS NCSS WSS 2013). Abbott
classifies Boy soils as low for geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001:23).
Conroe loamy fine sand (CoC) is found on loamy to sandy ancient alluvial terraces
overlooking White Oak Creek, on the south and east sides of the project area. Conroe loamy
fine sand is a moderately well-drained soil of the upland ridges on coastal plains. A typical
profile consists of 10 centimeters (4 inches) of grayish brown gravelly loamy fine sand,
underlain by 53 centimeters (21 inches) of light yellowish brown gravelly loamy fine sand.
Below these layers lies a yellowish brown sandy clay loam from 64 to 79 centimeters (25 to
31 inches). Finally an extremely hard sandy clay, mottled red and yellow, is found to a depth
of 2 meters (78 inches) (SSS NCSS WSS 2013). Abbott classifies Conroe soils as low for
geoarchaeological potential due to their ancient age (Abbott 2001:22).
Conroe gravelly loamy fine sand (CnC) entails a typical surface layer of grayish-brown
gravelly loamy fine sand containing 30% ironstone concretions to a depth of 64 centimeters
(25 inches). The upper portion of the following layer consists of yellowish-brown sandy clay
loam with red mottles followed by a lower portion of mottled red, brownish-yellow, and lightgray sandy clay (SSS NCSS WSS 2013). Abbott classifies Conroe soils as low for
geoarchaeological potential due to their ancient age (Abbott 2001:22).
Fuquay loamy fine sand, terrace (Fs) has a surface layer 64 centimeters (25 inches) of palebrown loamy fine sand. The following layer is brownish-yellow sandy clay loam with red and
reddish-yellow mottles. Lower layers consist of sandy clay loam mottled with shades of
brown, gray, red, and yellow that are 10- 20% plinthite. Small areas of Lucy loamy fine sand
are included in mapping and make up less than 10% of the total acreage (McClintock et al.
1972). Abbott classifies Fuquay soils as low for geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001:22).
Lucy loamy fine sand (Lu) consists of slightly acid, soft, grayish-brown loamy fine sand
extending (7 inches) below the surface. From 18 – 58 centimeters (7- 23 inches) is medium
6

acid, very friable, brown loamy fine sand. Below this is strongly acid, very hard and friable,
dark-red sandy clay loam from 58 – 145 centimeters (23- 57 inches). The next layer extends
193 centimeters (76 inches) deep and is made up of very strongly acid, hard, friable, red sandy
clay loam. The final layer has a depth of 218 centimeters (86 inches) and is strongly acid,
loose, pink fine sand. Small areas of Fuquay loamy fine sand, terrace are included in mapping
and make up less than 5% of the total acreage (McClintock et al. 1972). Abbott classifies Lucy
soils as low for geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001:23).
Sorter silt loam (So) has a surface layer of gray silt loam. The subsurface layer is light
brownish-gray silt loam. The following layer is light brownish-gray silt loam. The next layer is
light-gray silt loam mottled with yellow and brownish-yellow. The final layer is light gray fine
sandy loam. Waller loam and small amounts of Boy fine sand or Leefield loamy fine sand are
included with this soil and make up less than 5% of the total acreage (McClintock et al. 1972).
Abbott classifies Sorter soils as low for geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001:23).
Splendora fine sandy loam (Sp) is a nearly level and somewhat poorly drained soil found on
gently sloping uplands of the Flatwoods (McClintock et al. 1972). The soil is formed out of
fluvial and deltaic coastal plain sediments and has a high water table through winter and
spring. The soil profile typically consists of an upper stratum that is 10 centimeters (4 inches)
thick of dark grayish brown fine sandy loam. This is underlain by a 15-centimeter (6-inch)
thick layer of grayish brown fine sandy loam with light gray and dark brown mottles and few
ironstone concretions. Underlying this is a 25-centimeter (10-inch) thick stratum of mottled
yellowish brown and light brownish gray loam with few ironstone concretions. This overlies a
5-centimeter (2-inch) thick stratum of light brownish gray loam with yellowish brown mottles
and sub-rounded ironstone concretions (McClintock et al. 1972). Abbott classifies Splendora
soils as low for geoarchaeological potential due to their ancient age (Abbott 2001:23).
Waller loam (We) is a poorly drained soil found on nearly level uplands. Due to its poor
drainage and permeability characteristics, the soil is typically saturated from November to
March. Crayfish krotovinas are common in the upper 100 centimeters (39 inches) and the
matrix of the loam consists of approximately 18 to 30% percent clay, 20 to 40% silt, and 15%
coarse sand. Typical soil profiles consist of a surface layer of grayish brown loam 10
centimeters (4 inches) deep followed by light gray loam to a depth of 86 centimeters (34
inches). This is followed by a layer composed of 70% gray clay loam and 30% light gray
(McClintock et al. 1972). Abbott classifies Waller soils as low-moderate for geoarchaeological
potential (Abbott 2001:22).

2.3 The Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map
In Montgomery County, and 5 other counties in the Greater Houston area, data regarding these
soil associations, the landforms they occupy, cultural and natural resource distribution, and
historic and modern land use data were combined by Abbott (2001) to develop the HoustonPALM, a cultural resource management tool that predicts the likelihood of detecting deeply
buried intact cultural resources in various topographic settings around Houston. According to
Abbott (2001:154), “The Houston-PALM….is predicated on the potential for archeological
preservation and integrity”. The development of the PALM is based on a set of 3 mapping
criteria. These include landforms, soils, and land use (Abbott 2001:156)
7

The Houston-PALM model also recommends the type of archaeological survey strategy that
should be implemented for a given PALM Map Unit, of which there are 4 major groupings.
For Houston-PALM Map Unit 1 surface survey is recommended and deep reconnaissance is
only recommended if deep impacts are anticipated. PALM Map Unit 2 only surface survey is
recommended. Map Units 3 and 3a are similar and recommend no surface survey, although
Map Unit 3 recommends deep reconnaissance if deep impacts are anticipated, while Unit 3a
recommends deep reconnaissance only if severe impacts are anticipated. For PALM Map Unit
4 no survey is recommended.
The FM 2978 project crosses PALM units 1, 2, and 4. In general, the most appropriate type of
survey method for this project is shovel testing and visual reconnaissance.

2.4

Likelihood of Intact Archaeological Deposits

Given the environmental and cultural setting of the project area, underlying soils, previous
development and disturbances resulting from past road construction and utility installation,
and known sites in the surrounding area, the potential to find intact resources that may be
eligible for listing in the NRHP is generally considered low although the few perennial
waterways located within the project area increases the potential at these locations. It can also
be predicted that prehistoric and historic sites are most likely to be found in less disturbed
portions of the APE near these water sources although much of these areas have also been
subjected to past leveling and grading during the original construction phase of FM 2978.

3.0 PREHISTORIC SETTING
Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural regions.
Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an interface between
the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines, both Shafer and
Stearns (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record of
this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact cultural
patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74)
states, “it loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a cultural
periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric archaeology
of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive enough
to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural tradition is a
heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this region. The
primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery
that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined the Brazos
Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and suggests that they
may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and Atakapa groups
respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion suggest a number of
possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic inland/coastal cycle of the
Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San Jacinto River basin, may mean that
archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are affiliated with this group. Alternately,
these remains may be associated with the Bidais who occupied territory immediately to the
north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in time, it is not possible to identify the cultural
affiliation of the groups that inhabited the inland sub-region. In part, this is a function of the
dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural traditions met and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin sub-regions, which have
archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact types.
Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland resources
year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.

3.1

Cultural Periods

Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified 6 archaeological time periods
associated with Native Americans in the Southeast Texas region; in general, these include the
Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the general
framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these
periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000
B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600),
9

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600 to 1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500 to 1700), and the Historic Indian
(A.D. 1700 to 1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas chronology
that includes Paleoindian (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 B.C.), Middle
Archaic (5000 to 1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C. to A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400
to 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800 to 1750). Despite these differences, the chronologies
developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies
within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that a broad-based
hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.
3.1.1 Paleoindian Period
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation, and much of what is known about the period in
the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from the state of Texas and North
America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed the Bering Strait, and
within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961).
The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993) and were mega-fauna
hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from mammoths, mastodons, giant
bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried with them an easily recognizable stone tool
material culture, though admittedly, little is known about their wooden or bone tools and
clothing types. Diagnostic points such as fluted Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview points can be
used to identify a site’s Paleo-component and the nature of these points demonstrate the nature
of their hunting style. The above points are large and designed to be attached to a spear. No
evidence of bow and arrow hunting has been found associated with this period (Culberson
1993; Newcomb 1961).
3.1.2 Archaic Period
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna upon which the
Paleoindian peoples depended gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply is seen as
the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Biesaart et al. 1985;
Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961). Though dates often disagree (ranging from 8000 B.C.
marking the beginning of the Early Archaic [Culberson 1993], to Aten [1984] stating that the
transition from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100), there are
3 progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: the Early, Middle, and Late.
Much of what is known about the Early Archaic peoples indicates that they were small,
isolated bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984).
With the loss of the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the
hunting of smaller game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging
(Culberson 1993). The material record fits the transitional makeup of this period because there
was a dramatic shift from the large spear points of the Paleoindian period to a reliance on
smaller dart type points. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San Patrice, Angostura,
Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde, Martindale, Bell, Andice,
Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are much more crudely made than
their Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use on a spear shaft.

10

The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of stone
tools utilized. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs (Culberson
1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and procurement. Gravers,
scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone tools, also known as ground
stone tools began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb 1961). Diagnostic points such as
Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere, Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, and Lange
dominate the spectrum of dart points from the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester
1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect [Newcomb 1961]). The advent of the atlatl also
seems to be placed within this period (Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as did
the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, and raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became socially
more complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups. Culberson (1993:55) states that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in which
stone artifacts were made from exotic materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate, etc.)
acquired from sources great distances away. These materials were fashioned into an
increasingly complex array of household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones,
mortars and pestles, and pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the occurrence
of sandstone bowls (Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are difficult to
distinguish from those of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain prevalent in
southeast Texas, while other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel, Mahomet, Fairland,
and Castroville also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).
3.1.3 Late Prehistoric Period
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a period
marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. The advent of the bow and
arrow is believed by most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961) to be from this
period, though some may place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations, the
first signs of pottery begin to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and
variety of pottery intensifies during the Late Prehistoric, it is an excellent way of determining
the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora
intensifies beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no
sufficient data to demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic points
of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic periods) continue from the end of
the Archaic period to the historic period ushered in by the Spanish Missions and AngloAmerican settlers. During this period there is a shift to the almost total use of arrow points
such as Perdiz and, later, Scallorn, and almost every group now has pottery. According to
Aten (1984), there are nearly 18 different types of pottery from this period currently identified
for the east Texas Coast alone based on temper, paste, and design. It is during this period that
peoples known today as the Caddo, Attakapans, and Bidai, to name a few, are identifiable both

11

culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the historical sources of the seventeenth
through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.
In order to better understand the complexity of the region’s cultures, researchers turn to
historical sources to get an understanding of the peoples who first occupied the southeast
Texas. Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his
expedition in 1542 (Hudson 1976); it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples.
The first expeditions by La Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth
century by Europeans continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the
area (Aten 1984). French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also
known as the Neches Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache
tribes (Newcomb 1961). The later historical sources identify the Hasinai as one of the 2 main
groups in the area of eastern Texas that fall under the Caddo culture (the primary culture that
dominated the Piney Woods area), the other of which is the Kadohadacho (La Vere 1998;
Gregory 1986).
The loose cultural group, known as the Attakapans, dominated the majority of the land north
of present-day Harris County in what is now Montgomery County. Their language group
extended from the Gulf coast to the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers and they had much in
common with the coastal group known as the Karankawa (Aten 1984). The Attakapans were
subdivided into regional groups. The Akokisas dwelled primarily on the shores of the Trinity
and San Jacinto Rivers. The Patiris group occupied the land north of the San Jacinto valley.
The Bidai group dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the small group known as
the Deadoso. Most of what is known about the Attakapans culture comes from the early
accounts of the French explorer DeBellise. They are described as primarily hunter-gather
groups who relied somewhat on agriculture and fishing (Sjoberg 1951).
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native American
groups as pawns in the 2 nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961). Most destructive
for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases. When Anglo-American
settlers began moving into the area in mass around the 1850s, disease and warfare had
decimated the groups to near extinction.
3.1.4 Historic Period
It is believed that the first European to enter the region known today as Montgomery County
was the French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, around the year 1687 (Long
2013). This expedition in turn forced the Spanish overlords of the region to mount retaliatory
expeditions to the region to reclaim the land. Though the Spanish did manage to establish
three missions along Spring Creek, which is within the boundaries of present-day
Montgomery County, they never successfully established permanent settlements throughout
the region. The missions were abandoned around 1756, and only sporadic settlement occurred
until the issuance of land grants by the Spanish and Mexican authorities to Stephen F. Austin.
Anglo-American settlers began to pour in and nearly 42 families obtained legal land titles
from the government. One important early settler to the area was Andrew Montgomery, who
established a trading post on the Loma del Toro crossroads. This trading post soon grew into

12

the town of Montgomery, which in 1837 with the formation of Montgomery County became
the county seat.
Named after the region’s largest existing city, Montgomery County was created by the Texas
Legislature in 1837. It was the third county established by the republic. The original borders of
the county spanned from the Trinity River on the east to the Brazos River on the West, the Old
San Antonio Road to the north and the San Jacinto River to the south. Today, Montgomery
County is bounded by Walker and San Jacinto Counties to the north, Harris County to the
south, Waller and Grimes Counties to its west, and Liberty County to the east.
Situated at the juncture of what is today known as the East Texas Timberlands/Piney Woods
region and the Texas Coastal Plain, the nineteenth century landscape consisted of dense forests
situated on exceptionally fertile soil. This attracted many settlers who immediately began to
clear the land in order to exploit it for agricultural production and cattle grazing. Ranching and
basic subsistence farming were the region’s primary agricultural enterprise until they were
superseded in the 1850s by cotton production. The cotton industry, driven by slave labor and
the plantation economy system, experienced a great boom during prior to the Civil War,
partially by exploiting overland trade opportunities with the growing metropolises of Houston
and Galveston.
It was not until the post-war era that the region faced its first economic downturn. Without the
wartime demand for agricultural goods and the loss of slave labor, planters who had
overextended themselves to meet the increased demand for cotton found themselves without a
market and in possession of lands with depleted soils. Recovery for the county did not occur
until the construction of several railroad lines in the 1870s. The International-Great Northern
Railroad built a line across the county, and the Houston and Texas Central built a line through
Navasota and Montgomery Counties. These lines missed the city of Montgomery, which was
at that time the county seat, but they did intersect at the small community of Conroe; similarly,
the Gulf, Santa Fe, and Colorado rail-lines also intersected there. Shortly thereafter, in 1889,
the county seat was moved to Conroe and has remained there since.
With the construction of the railroads throughout the county, the region saw increased
development of the lumber industry. Long (2013) states that roughly 45 steam-powered
sawmills were in operation throughout the county in 1882. In 1914, the Delta Land and
Timber Company built the South’s largest timber mill near Conroe. The timber industry
remained the largest revenue source for the county until the 1920s when there was a steep
decline in the amount of available timber within the region due to uncontrolled logging. Long
(2013) also states that in the 1870s the county had 80% forest coverage, but over the next 4
decades most of the county was deforested. This deforestation opened the land to a further
increase in ranching and farming. Despite a brief resurgence in cotton production, by the
1910s many farmers began growing fruits and vegetables in order to meet the demands of the
nearby coastal metropolises. The region saw another downturn when the effects of the Great
Depression reached the area, and continued until the post-World War II period. Though the
regional farmers benefited little, the county prospered in the 1930s and beyond due to the
discovery of oil near Conroe in 1932. The discovery of oil brought unimaginable wealth to the
region as well as a significant population increase. With oil fields discovered all around the
13

county, Montgomery County soon became the richest oil producing regions in the United
States. To date, oil remains the primary source of income for the county, while the majority of
agricultural income comes from livestock.

4.0 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Site File and Literature Review
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line research archives maintained
by the THC. Research was conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the
project area to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites, historical markers, and
historic structures eligible for NRHP listing. Site file research was used to provide a historic
context to the archaeological survey.

4.2 Field Methods
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were designed to
identify and record the existence of cultural resources within the defined project boundaries.
The APE was subjected to intensive pedestrian archaeological survey. Archaeological
investigations primarily included a combination of shovel testing and pedestrian walkover,
while targeted mechanical deep testing was planned but could not be completed due to safety
concerns with unstable soils.
Prior to initiating the field survey, topographic quadrangle maps, recent aerial imagery, and
soils data were closely examined and information concerning previously recorded sites in the
general area was collected in an effort to determine which areas within the APE were most
likely to contain archaeological sites. Using this information, the route was divided into areas
of low and high probability for containing buried, intact archaeological sites. This was
essentially based on the project setting as well recommendations made by the Houston-PALM
(See Appendix B). A discussion of the Houston-PALM system and how it guided survey
efforts is described in the following report chapter.
Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for surface reconnaissance and subsurface testing on
linear projects call for 16 shovel tests per 1.6 kilometers (1 mile), within a 30-meter (100-foot)
wide corridor or 1 shovel test per acre for projects between 40 and 80 hectares (101 and 200
acres) in size. Our survey strategy used the THC standards as a guide, while focusing survey
efforts on sections of the road realignment that contained the highest potential for discovering
buried resources.
The majority of the project area contains soils considered to have low geoarchaeological
potential (Abbott 2001:23). The field strategy developed for this project entailed concentrating
on high probability areas most likely to contain intact, significant buried resources. Thus,
sections of the APE were investigated at a closer interval than others. Areas focused on
included locations mapped as Map Unit 2 where fewer disturbances from previous
development and road construction activities were apparent. Likewise, areas mapped as Map
Unit 4 were surveyed less intensively where disturbances were obvious, such as developed
land.

15

Closer-interval testing typically consisted of shovels tests located 60 meters (200 feet) apart
along a single transect on each side of the FM 2978 roadway within the project APE. For this
project, the use of judgmental testing was used instead of the minimum 100-meter (300-foot)
standard for low probability testing. Judgmental tests were excavated at unsystematic intervals
or locations for the purpose of confirming disturbance and the low probability status of an area
within the APE or to explore locations that may not follow the cultural probability model for
the area.
All shovel tests measured 30 x 30 centimeters (12 x 12 inches) in diameter. Vertical control of
each shovel test was maintained by excavating in arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One
wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected
for color or texture change potentially associated with the presence of cultural features.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts
(Munsell Color Chart [Munsell] 2005). Additional information concerning the encountered
soils such as mottling, disturbance, and moisture level was recorded on standardized forms for
each excavation. Whenever possible, shovel tests were excavated into sterile subsoil. All
friable soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh, while soils with
high clay content were hand sorted.
Based on available soils data, deep testing was determined necessary at 4 of the 6 previously
proposed detention pond locations at Nickaburr Creek, Bear Branch, Dry Creek, and Spring
Creek (Appendix B) and none of the 5 currently proposed detention ponds and proposed offROW drainage easement. Trenching at targeted areas required trenches that are designed for
human entry, and applicable standards adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Health and Safety Code were observed. Excavated
trenches of depths exceeding 120 centimeters (47 inches) were intended for evaluation by a
Competent Person and would have been classified as an OSHA Class A, B, or C trench. This
is standard procedure to determine if trenches can safely be entered for inspection.
Unfortunately, trenching, as planned, could not be completed due to unstable soils. If
trenching could have been conducted as planned, all mechanically excavated trenches were
supposed to measure a minimum of 5 meters (20 feet) in length and approximately 1 meter (3
feet) wide. Trenches were supposed to be excavated to an average depth of 3 meters (10 feet).
Samples of trench backfill were hand sifted and samples of alluvial deposits were screened
using 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth. After each 20-centimeter (8-inch) bucketfull of soil was removed, the walls and floors of the trenches were supposed to be monitored
for changes in soil color or texture potentially related to the presence of cultural features. At
least 1 wall of each trench was supposed to be profiled and photographed.
No cultural resources were located as a result of the investigation. However, cultural
resources, if located, were to be defined according to the THC standards (as referenced in 13
TAC 26.20). Delineation shovel tests were to be excavated in 4 radiating directions in
intervals between 10 and 30 meters (30 and 100 feet) within the confines of the survey
corridor. In general, 2 sterile shovel tests in each cardinal direction would be used to define a
site’s size and location. At a minimum, between 6 and 8 delineation shovel tests would have
been excavated unless surrounding landforms or topography suggested the presence of a
16

natural site boundary. A discussion of laboratory analysis and/or curation procedures are not
included here, since no resources were identified.
4.2.1

Assessment of the Oklahoma Cemetery Boundary

The Oklahoma Cemetery, established in 1890, is situated on the east side of FM 2978 at
Conroe-Huffsmith Road. Its western fence is 130 meters (427 feet) from the existing ROW;
recent topographic maps depict the cemetery's western boundary extending to the edge of
existing ROW. To determine whether it was likely that the cemetery extended into the APE,
archival research was completed. Records were reviewed at the Montgomery County Clerk's
office and an interview with the President and Secretary of the Cemetery Association was held
in September 2011. Historic topographic maps and aerial images dating between 1962 and
1978 were reviewed and compared to recent aerial imagery available in Google Earth's Street
View. Following desktop assessment, the APE at the location of the cemetery was subject to
pedestrian survey and the presence of deeply buried utilities were documented. Results are
described in Chapter 5.0.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
For the FM 2978 expansion project, potential buried and surface archaeological resources fall
within the purview of this investigation. A separate architectural survey has been completed
for the project (Sweeten-McDonald et al. 2012). The intensive pedestrian and reconnaissance
surveys as well as the attempted mechanical deep testing for the service area discussed in this
report took place on easements belonging to the TxDOT and privately-owned property.

5.1 Results of Site File and Literature Review
A preliminary search of the Texas Archaeological Atlas Online, maintained by the Texas THC
and a review of the Handbook of Texas History Online revealed that no previously recorded
archaeological sites, cemeteries, Historic Markers, or National Register properties have been
identified within the APE. Furthermore, there is no information to indicate that historic events
or historic individuals are likely to be associated with the project area.
Site file research indicates that there are 4 known archaeological sites, 5 cemeteries, and 1
historical marker (for the Oklahoma School) located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius
around the APE. These include Sites 41MQ185, 41MQ186, 41MQ187, and 41HR981. With
the exception of 41MQ187, an early to mid-twentieth century historic site, all of the other sites
are small, buried ephemeral prehistoric sites with few to no diagnostic materials immediately
adjacent to perennial waterways such as Dry Creek and its tributaries. Site 41HR981 is the
closest site to the project area, measuring 396 meters (1300 feet) from Detention Pond 5, and
is located on the south side of Spring Creek and west of FM 2978. This site will not be
affected by the current proposed project. The eligibilities of these resources for the NRHP or
as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) have not been determined.
Four of the 5 cemeteries are located sufficiently away from the APE (Figure 1). The presence
of Oklahoma Cemetery, established in 1890, is situated on the east side of FM 2978 at
Conroe-Huffsmith Road. Its western fence is approximately 130 meters (427 feet) from an
area of existing ROW. Recent topographic maps depict the cemetery's western boundary
extending to the edge of existing ROW. However, the members of the Cemetery Association
purchased the additional acreage which included land up to the existing FM 2978 ROW and
stated that that land has not yet been used for human interment. Archival research completed
at the Montgomery County Clerk's office and in an interview with the President and Secretary
of the Cemetery Association failed to produce the original cemetery deed and property maps
or more recent documents, but members of the Cemetery Association stated that all burials are
located within the fenced boundary.
A review of historic topographic maps and aerial images indicate that the roadway was built
between 1962 and 1978, long after the cemetery was 150 meters (493 feet) east of the road
ways in 1890. Finally, recent aerial images and Street View in Google Earth images captured
in March 2011 appear to show the presence of a buried utility, overhead utilities, and a
drainage ditch alongside the paved FM 2978 roadway and Conroe-Huffsmith Road; this was
field-verified. Following field verification, it is possible to state with reasonable certainty that
18

no human graves associated with Oklahoma Cemetery are located within or adjacent to the
APE. Although still actively used for human burials, the cemetery was evaluated for NRHP
and SAL eligibility as in close proximity to the existing ROW. HRA Gray & Pape’s National
Register assessment of the cemetery resulted in a recommendation that the Oklahoma
Cemetery is not eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, and D and with regard to
Criteria Considerations C, D, and G. This work is discussed in a separate, bound report of
investigations (Sweeten-McDonald et al. 2012).
Several previous cultural resources investigations have been completed within or near the
current FM 2978 expansion project. In 1980, a large block area survey was conducted in
Montgomery County for the Woodlands development on behalf of the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This survey partially overlaps the
current APE between FM 1488 and the Woodlands Parkway. No cultural resources appeared
to have been recorded within or near the FM 2978 project. In 2004, under antiquities permit
#2979, HRA Gray & Pape completed survey and probability modeling for the proposed
expansion of FM 2978 north of FM 1488, called the Fish Creek Thoroughfare (also called
Egypt Community Drive and Sendero Ranch Road). This project did not result in the
identification of new archaeological or significant historic-age architectural structures (Baird
et al. 2003).
Three recent investigations have been completed by archaeologists at Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. between 1999 and 2005. Each investigation was completed for the proposed
excavation of detention ponds to redirect drainage and runoff away from the Woodlands
community. These surveys resulted in the identification of several sites just east of the current
APE in Montgomery County (described above). Near the southern end of the APE, an
"unknown" survey resulted in the identification of sites in Harris County south of Spring
Creek (Figure 1). Under antiquities permit #3287, also at the southern end of the APE, Carter
& Burgess, Inc. completed a survey immediately east of one of the proposed detention ponds
along FM 2978. This survey included shovel testing and trenching. All work was negative for
archaeological resources.

5.2 Results of Intensive Pedestrian Survey
General survey investigations consisted of intensive pedestrian survey, reconnaissance
walkover survey, and judgmental shovel testing to confirm disturbance within the existing
ROW, encompassing approximately 42 hectares (103 acres), and an intensive pedestrian
survey within proposed ROW, 5 proposed detention ponds (7.21 hectares [17.84 acres]), and 1
off-ROW drainage structure (0.09 hectares [0.24 acres]) for a total of 49 hectares (121 acres)
(Figures 2-14).
Previously proposed roadway ROW, including 6 previously proposed detention ponds, were
also surveyed, but is no longer part of the current proposed project. Mechanical deep testing
was attempted at 3 of the 6 previously proposed detention pond locations as recommended by
the Houston-PALM to check for potentially deeply buried archaeological deposits. Trenching
was determined unsafe following the slippage of unstable, wet soils making the backhoe
unsafe to operate. None of the 5 newly proposed detention ponds are located on high

probability soils; therefore, no deep testing was attempted at these locations. As a result of
survey, a total of 16 shovel tests were excavated across the length of the project (Figures 214). All shovel tests were negative for the presence of archaeological materials.
5.2.1

FM 2978 Roadway

Three shovel tests were excavated at the southern end of the roadway portion of the project,
10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles), along FM Road 2978 between Conroe-Huffsmith Road and FM
Road 1488, totaling approximately 42 hectares (103 acres) of existing road ROW. All shovel
tests were negative for the presence of archaeological materials. Overall, both sides of the
existing FM 2978 roadway are highly disturbed and have been leveled and graded. Both sides
of the roadway also contain paved driveways, drainage ditches, and ICTX Wave Media fiberoptic cables, AT&T cables, CenterPoint Energy and Texas Gas Utility Services gas lines, and
overhead utility poles. The locations of these disturbances are depicted on Figures 2-14.
The depth of shovel test excavation ranged between a minimum of 40 centimeters (16 inches)
to a maximum of 100 centimeters (40 inches). Observed soils were typically disturbed to a
minimum depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) and contained brown (10YR 4/3) sand often
mixed with gravels and modern refuse (Munsell 2005). Modern debris including plastic and
glass fragments was often found beneath the ground surface and at 50 centimeters (20 inches).
This layer was typically underlain by yellowish brown, sandy clay, sometimes including
gravels. Detailed descriptions of all shovel test profiles are provided in a shovel test log
located in Appendix C.
Right-of-entry was not granted for a 0.10-hectare (0.24-acre), off-ROW drainage structure
located on the east side of FM 2978; therefore, a desktop assessment was performed for this
location (Figure 10). The entire proposed drainage area is situated on Boy fine sand and
Abbott’s modeling for this soil series indicates a low geoarchaeological potential “or
likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material in reasonable context” (Abbott
2001:23). HRA Gray & Pape recommends no survey at this location.
Archaeological survey alongside the Oklahoma Cemetery indicated the presence of a drainage
ditch and buried utilities including ICTX Wave Media fiber-optic cables, CenterPoint Energy
and Texas Gas Utility Services gas lines, and overhead utility poles (Figure 11:Photo J). In
addition, HRA Gray & Pape’s National Register assessment of the cemetery resulted in a
recommendation that the Oklahoma Cemetery is not eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A,
B, C, and D and with regard to Criteria Considerations C, D, and G. This work is discussed in
a separate, bound report of investigations (Sweeten-McDonald et al. 2012).
5.2.2

Detention Pond 1

Detention Pond 1 lies adjacent to FM 2978, abutting the road along its south side. The survey
area occupies 1.09 hectares (2.76 acres). Nickaburr Creek is outside of the survey area and
runs parallel to its eastern border. Right-of-entry was not granted at this location; therefore, a
desktop assessment was performed for this location. The majority of the area is situated on
Splendora fine sandy loam, with the western and eastern portions containing Conroe loamy
fine sand and Sorter silt loam respectively. Abbott’s modeling for this soil series indicates a
33

low geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural
material in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:22). HRA Gray & Pape recommends no survey
at this location.
5.2.3

Detention Pond 2

Detention Pond 2 is located on the northwest side of FM 2978, with Westmoreland Lane
paralleling its northern border (Figure 7). The survey area occupies 2.14 hectares (5.29 acres).
The northern third of the survey area is partially covered with soft and hardwood trees, while
the remainder is open semi-grassy pasture (Figure 7: Photo C). This southern portion of the
survey area may have been affected by various modes of land-use, likely attributable to the
presence of a dirt access road running east to west.
Three shovel tests were excavated for this property and all were negative for cultural remains.
Shovel-test records indicate soil disturbance at each tested location. The entire parcel is
situated on Conroe loamy fine sand and the shovel tests revealed a general profile of sandy
clay with strong brown (7.5YR5/6), yellowish-brown (10YR5/6), and light gray (10YR7/2)
mottles. Significant amounts (50-60%) of gravels and ferrous concretions were present in each
test, inhibiting excavation below a depth of 40 centimeters (15.7 inches). These soils are
similar to those indicated by the USGS soil survey. The negative results from the 3 shovel
tests supports Abbott’s modeling for this soil series indicating a low geoarchaeological
potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material in reasonable
context” (Abbott 2001:23).
5.2.4

Detention Pond 3

Detention pond 3 is located on the west side of FM 2978 (Figure 10). The survey area
occupies 2.02 hectares (5.00 acres). The survey area is covered in soft and hardwood trees and
underbrush (Figure 10: Photo G). A dirt road, accessed via FM 2978, bisects the southern half
of the property and runs east to west. Beginning in the vicinity of Shovel Test C3, the land
along the eastern portion of the project area slopes generally downwards towards FM 2978.
Four shovel tests were excavated for this property. The shovel tests were all negative for
cultural remains. The entire survey area is situated on Boy fine sand. The typical shovel test
profile consisted of a grayish-brown (10YR5/2) loam to a depth of 15 centimeters (5.9 inches),
over a light yellowish-brown (10YR6/4) loamy sand with gravels to a depth of 80 centimeters
(31.5 inches). The negative results from the 4 shovel tests supports Abbott’s modeling for this
soil series indicating a low geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could
contain buried cultural material in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:23).
5.2.5

Detention Pond 4

Detention Pond 4 is immediately adjacent to the east side of FM 2978 (Figure 13). The survey
area occupies 0.69 hectares (1.70 acres). The property is almost entirely covered by a thick
growth of hardwood and softwood trees and undergrowth (Figure 13: Photo J). No
disturbances or roads of any type were noted during survey. Boy fine sand covers the entire

34

survey area. The far southern boundary of Detention Pond 4 overlaps a previously proposed
detention pond location.
Three shovel tests were excavated for this property. The shovel tests were all negative for
cultural remains. The soils revealed by the shovel tests include a dark grayish-brown
(10YR4/2) loam to a depth of 15 centimeters (5.9 inches) over a pale brown (10YR6/3) sandy
loam to a depth of 70 centimeters (27.6 inches) The negative results from the 4 shovel tests
supports Abbott’s modeling for this soil series indicating a low geoarchaeological potential “or
likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material in reasonable context” (Abbott
2001:23).
5.2.6

Detention Pond 5

Detention Pond 5 is located just to the northwest of the intersection of FM 2978 and Dobbin
Hufsmith Road (Figure 14). The survey area occupies 1.25 hectares (3.09 acres). Vegetation
on this property consisted of mixed soft and hardwood trees with dense underbrush (Figure 14:
Photo L). No disturbances were observed according to the shovel-test records.
Three shovel tests were excavated for this property. The shovel tests were all negative for
cultural remains. A typical shovel-test profile for this survey area features a brown (10YR4/3)
loamy fine sand to a depth of 15 centimeters (5.9 inches), followed by a pale brown
(10YR6/3) loamy fine sand to a depth of 55 centimeters (21.7 inches) over a dark yellowishbrown (10YR4/6) sandy clay to a maximum depth of 1 meter (39.4 inches). The negative
results from the 3 shovel tests supports Abbott’s modeling for this soil series indicating a low
geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material
in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001: 22 and 23).

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an archaeological intensive pedestrian survey and
reconnaissance survey along 10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles) of existing ROW for the FM 2978
expansion project. The project APE is 49 hectares (121 acres) composed of existing ROW,
including 5 detention ponds and 1 off-ROW drainage structure. The entire project area was
subjected to the archaeological survey techniques described in Chapter 4.0. The Lead Agency
for this project is TxDOT. Work for this project was completed as part of TxDOT's overall
preliminary environmental analysis filed under CSJ Number 3050-02-016, issued by the
Houston District. The project is also listed under construction CSJ Numbers 3050-02-024 and
3050-02-025. The proposed project previously required 3 hectares (8 acres) of additional
ROW for the roadway widening and 6 proposed detention ponds. The current proposed
project, as previously mentioned, now consists of the roadway widening being conducted
within the existing ROW (no longer requiring additional ROW) and requiring 5 newly
proposed detention pond locations and 1 off-ROW drainage structure.
The general archaeological survey strategy developed for the project included intensive
pedestrian survey and walkover survey. Fieldwork was conducted in October 2011, February
2012, and August 2013 and required a total of 120 person hours to complete. All fieldwork
and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (Texas Antiquities Code [13
TAC 26]) under Texas Antiquities Permits Number 6053 and 6625, and federal (36 CFR 800;
36 CFR 60) guidelines.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site file search to identify the
presence of recorded cultural resources in close proximity to the current proposed project. As
a result, 1 recorded cemetery (Oklahoma Cemetery) was located adjacent to the project APE
(Figure 1). Archival research and an appropriate testing strategy were completed primarily by
using the Houston-PALM as a planning tool by which to identify locations within the APE
with the highest likelihood of containing intact prehistoric archaeological resources and by
assessing locations thought likely to contain historic archaeological resources.
Archival records did not prove the absence of graves associated with the Oklahoma Cemetery
within the APE. However, the archaeological investigation confirmed the presence of a
drainage ditch and buried utilities including ICTX Wave Media fiber-optic cables, AT&T
buried cables, CenterPoint Energy and Texas Gas Utility Services gas lines, and overhead
utility poles (Figures 2-14). These deep roadside disturbances indicate that the cemetery is
limited to the east side of the FM 2978 roadway, outside of the existing ROW, and that no
human burials will be affected by the proposed project.
In addition HRA Gray & Pape’s National Register assessment of the cemetery resulted in a
recommendation that the Oklahoma Cemetery is not eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A,
B, C, and D and with regard to Criteria Considerations C, D, and G. This work is discussed in
a separate, bound report of investigations (Sweeten-McDonald et al. 2012).

36

As a result of survey, a total of 16 shovel tests were excavated within the roadway portion of
the project and 4 of the 5 proposed detention ponds. All shovel tests were negative for the
presence of archaeological materials and no exposed materials were observed on the ground
surface as a result of the walkover inspection. Numerous roadside disturbances were
documented including multiple buried utility lines, drainage ditches, paved driveways, and
culverts. In addition, Detention Pond 1 and the proposed off-ROW drainage structure were
subjected to a desktop assessment due to no ROE at their locations. Both locations cross
PALM Unit 2 which recommends surface survey; however, they are located on soils with low
potential of containing archaeological sites. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no survey at
these locations.
The results of the survey indicate that no previously recorded or unknown archaeological sites
are located within the surveyed area. Based on these results, HRA Gray & Pape recommends
no further archaeological work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned. The
result of survey within the project area, with regard to 36 CFR 800, falls under section §
800.4(d.1): No historic properties affected.
