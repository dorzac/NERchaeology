ABSTRACT
The City of Fort Worth, Texas is proposing to replace the current undersized
culvert on Randol Mill Road in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. The
culvert is located approximately 4780 feet west of South Precinct Line
Road and 1.1 miles east of IH 820. The study area is approximately two
acres in size and extends for 75 feet east and west of the existing culvert
and 300 feet north and south of the road. The study area is situated in the
Eastern Cross Timbers along the banks of an unnamed intermittent tributary
of the West Fork of the Trinity River. No evidence of prehistoric or historic
occupation was found anywhere on the surface in the study area or buried in
the sediments of the 12 shovel tests. One historic site (41TR234) was
recorded and that was the existing culvert itself. The culvert dates as early as
1920 or prior based upon the exposure of Damascus Twist Rebar, however it
has been modified by widening and is failing in integrity. The purpose of the
project is to replace the existing culvert because of its poor and unsafe
condition. Therefore, AR Consultants, Inc recommends that the project
should be allowed to proceed as planned. However, during construction if
cultural deposits are uncovered work should cease in that area immediately
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Worth proposes to replace the current undersized culvert on Randol Mill
Road in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1). The culvert is located
approximately 4780 feet west of South Precinct Line Road and 1.1 miles east of IH 820.
The study area is approximately two acres in size and extends for 75 feet east and west of
the existing culvert and 300 feet north and south of the road. The culvert is situated on an
unnamed drainage that carries runoff water to the West Fork of the Trinity River.
During January and February of 2010, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
archaeological survey for Dunaway Associates, LP, which is managing the environmental
permitting for the City of Fort Worth. The purpose of the archaeological survey was to
determine if cultural materials older than 50 years were present, and, if so, make
recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Fort Worth is a
political entity of the State of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5489 was issued
for the archaeological survey. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended PL92500 and the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission not
only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as the Section 106 review
agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the archaeology and
history. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation
is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. Rainwater running off the sandy loams in
the Eastern Cross Timbers, in which the study area lies, drains into the West Fork of the
Trinity River (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 2).
The Woodbine formation underlies the study area south of Randol Mill Road and the
majority north of the road consists of an approximately 175 to 250 foot thick layer of
Cretaceous-era sandstone, clay and shale. The northern most section lies within the
Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone Formation composed of buried calcareous
clays and shale ranging from 25 to 100 foot thick (Bureau of Economic Geology, 1988).
The unnamed intermittent tributary of the West Fork is situated within the Silawa fine
sandy loam with 3-8 percent slopes soil association (Ressel 1981:Sheet 31). This is a
deep, gently sloping to sloping loamy soil encountered on elongated terraces above the
floodplain of major waterways. According to Ressel, the soil is best used as pastureland,
but can be used for growing crops (1981:50).

CULTURE HISTORY
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the Upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook
and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area
most of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas, as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to the
thickening of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of local natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall and along tributaries
during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
time period are typically located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major
tributaries (Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s the aboriginal inhabitants of North
Central Texas continued to play an infamous if not important role in the history of that

region. Garrett, a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities
almost depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than
half" (Garrett 1972:24). According to tradition at least, many Indians of several tribes
roamed Tarrant County until the 1860s.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, Lonesome Dove and Johnson Station, which were both settled in 1845. Lonesome
Dove, located near present-day Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant
County (Garrett 1972:55). In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a
military post on the upper Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the
Grand Prairie and the Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a
high bluff overlooking the confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River.
Within a short length of time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life
in Fort Town, later to be known as Fort Worth, definitely had its refinements (Garrett
1972:80).
The fort as a military post, however, was relatively short-lived. Faced with the continual
westward movement of the frontier, it was decided that Fort Worth no longer commanded
a strategic place in the line of defense for settlers. Therefore, in September of 1853,
troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local population, which
continued to grow and flourish.
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. The county's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. The railroad reached Dallas in the
early 1870s, and by 1876, it had reached Fort Worth. It was also in 1876 that Arlington
was founded, halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth at a location just north of
Johnson’s Station (Joyner 1976:80)
Previous Investigations
Two historic maps were used in the assessment of this project. The first is the 1893 Sam
Street’s Tarrant County map; the second is a 1920 soil map of Tarrant County (Street
1893; USDA 1920). The map by Street shows a landscape a world apart from that which
we see today. The relatively undeveloped country is sporadically dotted with houses and
few roads bridged the West Fork. Both the Sam Street map and the 1920s Soil Map show
owner or tenant houses plotted near the proposed culvert study area, but none were inside
the study area. Today the area surrounding the study area is largely urbanized.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) (2010), no archaeological
surveys have been conducted along Randol Mill Road or within a kilometer of the project
area. R. E. Forrester, Jr., recorded site 41TR151 in 1960 about a mile northeast of the
study area in the floodplain of the West Fork. The site consisted of a Plainview point that
was recovered from mining back dirt operation; site is destroyed but was believed to be
buried 10 feet below the surface (TASA 2010). Additionally, PBS&J recorded a site

approximately 300 meter northwest of the study area, on the end of the ridge overlooking
the unnamed tributary. This site was recorded during a survey that is not yet available.
Site 41TR231, consists of an early to mid 20th century homestead with an unknown
prehistoric component (TASA 2010). Some lithic debris was recovered in the shovel
tests.
The setting of the culvert study area is situated in an analogous situation of
archaeological sites present along a Bear Creek watershed in the Eastern Cross Timbers
(Shelton, Davis, and Skinner 2008). Prehistoric sites were found upstream from the
confluence of the West Fork and Bear Creek on terraces and elevations above flooding.
The only differences are that Bear Creek is a perennial creek with a much larger
watershed, while this unnamed tributary is intermittent and less than half the length of the
Bear Creek Watershed. Such sites are usually recorded near or around freshwater springs
or on knolls above drainages.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The study area is located in the uplands along an unnamed intermittent drainage high up
the watershed that flows into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Despite this, the area
had potential for both prehistoric and historic cultural resources. Two research questions
below were developed to examine the potential of the study area.
Although, previous investigations show that the majority of sites recorded along the West
Fork are concentrated in the deep alluvial deposits, prehistoric sites are known to exist in
an environmental setting similar to that in which the study project is located. Studies
conducted approximately 10 miles northwest of the study area on the west side of the
DFW Airport along Bear Creek and its tributaries demonstrated that prehistoric sites
could be found high up in the watershed (Shelton et al. 2008). Given that the study area is
centered on the drainage there is potential to find evidence of prehistoric occupation. Due
to the small size of the water drainages, such sites are more likely to be temporary
hunting camps and would consist of artifact scatters that have eroded down to the
drainage from the ridge tops and knolls outside of the study area.
Historic sites exist near the project areas and historic maps show that the area was
inhabited in the late 19th century. These consist of historic structures and trash scatters.
Since the study area consists of the drainage itself, historic structures were likely on the
ridges and knolls outside the study area. If historic sites are found, they are likely to be
historic artifact scatters dumped along the drainage.
Methodology
The field team walked parallel transects spaced 8 meters apart and made thorough field
notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas where soil was exposed.
Throughout the course of the pedestrian survey, close attention was paid to the exposed
creek banks, which were visually inspected for artifacts that may have been exposed by
erosion. Shovel tests were excavated according to THC guidelines to the bottom of
Holocene deposits and averaged 30 cm in diameter (THC n.d.). The clay fill from the
shovel tests was inspected visually and broken into smaller pieces in order to determine if
cultural materials were present. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of
texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil
colors in each shovel test. Photographs were taken throughout the survey area using a
Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel digital camera. The shovel test locations were recorded
with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections with the description of the study area
followed by the survey results. Shovel tests are described briefly in the text and are
detailed in Table 1. Conclusions end the chapter
Survey Area
The study area is bisected by the intermittent tributary and the area is heavily eroded. The
tributary ranges between 3 to 6 feet wide and 1 to 2 feet deep. The banks leading down to
the channel begin at the 500’ contour and slope gently at various degrees down to the
level area at the channel’s edge (Figure 2). Due to landowner restrictions, shovel testing
was only allowed in the area between the channel and the 500’ contour on the north and
south sides of Randol Mill. The terrain in the area was slightly level with a several
undulations and a few earthen push piles created by the landowner. The vegetation
consisted of oaks, pecans, willows and greenbriar (Figure 3). Ground visibility ranged
between 20 and 60 percent, while eye height visibility was 15 to 25 meters. No Uvalde
gravels were noted in the study area, only limestone and sandstone.

Survey Results
Prior to shovel testing, the field crew walked three parallel transects in order to identify
any cultural materials that might have been exposed on the surface. During this initial
step, it was identified that the culvert being replaced dated to the early 20th century, given
that it contained Damascus Twist Rebar, a type of rebar that dates prior to 1920
(Friedman 1995; Trask and Skinner 2002). This type of rebar has a plain square shape
that is then twisted and was originally patented by E.L. Ransome (Friedman 1995:108).
The culvert was recorded as site 41TR234 (Figure 4a and 4b). The culvert had been
modified in the mid to late 20th century during a widening of Randol Mill Road. The new
additions to the culvert can be seen on the south side of the road as new concrete and
rebar was added (Figure 5). The dimensions of the culvert are 8’ wide x 6’9” tall x 20’
long. The culvert is in poor condition.
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated, with 6 on the west bank and 6 on the east bank
of the tributary (Figure 6). Shovel testing began on the west bank and transects were
walked south with 3 shovel tests on each side of the road. As previously mentioned
landowner restrictions only allowed for examination of approximately 200 feet north and
south of Randol Mill Road and was concentrated between the channel and the 500’
contour. Shovel tests on the west bank were fairly consistent. On the north side of Randol
Mill, shovel tests contained brown to dark brown sandy loams over dark brown loamy
clay, with 2 and 3 reaching bedrock between 85 and 150 cm below the surface. On the

south side of Randol Mill, a wider range of sandy loams were encountered, from dark brown
to yellowish brown and very dark gray.

Conclusions
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if the study area contained significant
historic or prehistoric cultural resources. The study area is situated in the Eastern Cross
Timbers along the banks of an unnamed intermittent tributary of the West Fork of the
Trinity River. The research design stated that study area could possibly contain
ephemeral remains of temporary hunting or camping sites. However, if the area was used
for hunting or gathering activities, no evidence remains. No evidence of prehistoric or
historic occupation was found anywhere on the surface in the study area or buried in the
sediments.
Historic sites were considered low potential and for historic occupation given that, the
topography provides no suitable occupation site. The research design stated that the only
feasibly expected evidence of historic occupation would have been trash or artifact
scatters near the drainage, however none were located. One historic site (41TR234) was
recorded and that was the existing culvert itself. The culvert dates as early as 1920 based
upon the exposure of Damascus Twist Rebar, however it has been modified by widening
and is failing in integrity. The purpose of the project is to replace the existing culvert
because of its poor and unsafe condition. The site is not considered to be eligible for the
NRHP because of its poor condition and more recent modifications.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that the City of Fort Worth be allowed to replace the culvert at Randol Mill Road without
the need of further cultural resource investigations. We further recommend that if cultural
resources are uncovered during construction that work should cease in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
