Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

Management Summary
On March 18-20, 2019, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) carried out an intensive survey,
as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. Joel B. Butler acted as the principal
investigator, Sara Parkin as field director, and Jessica Kenmore as field technician. 48 person-hours
were expended during fieldwork, 17 shovel tests, and 10 backhoe trenches were excavated in
support of the survey.
Val Verde County, in cooperation with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Laredo
District proposes to widen and make improvements to Frontera Road from 109 linear feet (LF) south
of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) tracks to Aldrete Lane in the City of Del Rio in Val Verde County,
Texas. This project is assigned CSJ no. 0922-11-032 and the archeological survey was carried out
under Antiquities Permit 8733. The total project length is four kilometers (2.5 miles), with a total
Area of Potential Effects (APE) of 27.3 acres including 3.9 acres of proposed temporary maintenance
easement within property administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) along
the U.S. Border Fence. The remainder of the APE is entirely within existing road right-of-way (ROW).
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled
by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA).
During field investigations, 17 shovel tests and ten backhoe trenches were excavated, none of which
contained archeological materials. No archeological sites were documented within the APE. One
previously recorded site (412VV1714) was visited but not relocated.
No further archeological work is warranted, and construction is recommended to proceed for the
project area.
All land surveyed was located on publicly-owned property. No artifacts were collected during
investigations. All notes and forms generated during fieldwork will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Chapter 1
Project Description
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey of proposed
improvements along four kilometers (2.5 miles) of Frontera Road in the City of Del Rio, Val Verde
County, Texas. The project area extends from 109 linear feet (LF) south of the Union Pacific Railroad
(UPRR) tracks to Aldrete Lane (Figures 1 and 2). Under the management of Val Verde County, in
coordination with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Laredo District, improvements to
the existing roadway are planned. This project is being constructed under TxDOT CSJ no. 0922-11032 and the archeological field survey was carried out under Antiquities Permit 8733. Detailed
schematics and typical sections are presented in Appendix A. The project area is depicted on USGS
Del Rio SW, Texas 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle, as seen in Figure 1.
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled by a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). As described in
the Programmatic Agreement between FHWA, TxDOT, and the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, FHWA projects in Texas are administered
by TxDOT. Therefore, the field survey and this report adhere to TxDOT guidelines and requirements.

Existing Facility
The existing roadway is a minor arterial. Within the project limits, Frontera Road is a two-lane
undivided roadway with no raised medians, no shoulders, and an open ditch drainage system. Each
travel lane is 12 feet wide. The existing right-of-way (ROW) is approximately 92 feet wide (typical) and
encompasses 23.4 acres.

Proposed Facility
The proposed project would include the widening, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of Frontera Road
within the project limits, as well as the inclusion of drainage improvements; signing; and pavement
markings. The proposed roadway would include two 12-foot travel lanes (one in each direction) with
two-foot outside shoulders for a total proposed pavement width of 28 feet. The existing drainage
ditches would be graded to ensure proper drainage water capture. The proposed ditches would be
located on the west side of the roadway from the northern project terminus to where Frontera Road
curves to run in a southeasterly direction, at which point the ditches would be located on the north
side of the roadway. The project would also include the addition of drainage structures (reinforced
concrete pipes and box culverts) at nine locations throughout the project APE. A 20-foot wide 3.9acre temporary easement would be located south of Frontera Road on property administered by the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) between Alderete Lane and the northeast 90-degree
turn south of Jessica Lane.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of the
proposed project within the limits of the existing ROW and proposed maintenance easement, and
all project-specific locations to the maximum depth of proposed impacts. Thus, the APE for
archeological resources covers a total area of 27.3 acres within the typically 92-foot ROW to a depth
of three feet, and down to seven feet at culvert locations.

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

The purpose of the archeological survey was to identify whether any archeological sites would be
affected by the proposed roadway improvements. Fieldwork was carried out on March 18-22, 2019.
Joel B. Butler acted as principal investigator, Sara Parkin as field director, and Jessica Kenmore as
field technician. Forty-eight person-hours were expended during fieldwork, resulting in 17 shovel
tests and 10 backhoe trenches excavated in support of investigations. No difficulties were
encountered during the survey. Weather was cool and overcast with dry soil conditions. No
archeological sites or artifacts were observed in the APE during investigations.
No artifacts were encountered during field investigations. All notes and records generated during
fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Environmental Setting and Background
Physical Setting
The project area is located on the southwestern edge of Del Rio in Val Verde County. Frontera Road
is currently home to numerous commercial properties and the U.S. Border Fence along the southern
portion, and a municipal wastewater treatment facility, sports fields, and additional commercial
properties along the northern portion.
Located in the far western South Texas Plains ecoregion, the project is located near the boundary
with the Chihuahuan Desert and therefore displays characteristics of both regions (Griffith and
Omerik 2009). The South Texas Plains region is a nearly level area covered with mesquite brush and
grasses becoming more arid to the northwest. The elevation of the project area ranges from 900 to
945 feet above mean sea level. The Rio Grande River flows just south of the project, coming within
200 meters at its closest location.
Common fauna in this region include swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), plains pocket gopher
(Geomys bursarius), nutria (Myocaster coypus), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus),
killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), coyote (Canis latrans), hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus leuconotus),
American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Texas blind snake (Leptotyphlops dulcis), Gulf Coast
toad (bufo valliceps), and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin [Ellis et al. 1995]).
Vegetation within the project area is a mixture of unimproved vacant lots, commercial and municipal
frontage, and maintained ROW. Surface visibility throughout the area varied from fair (50 percent)
to high (up to 75 percent).

Geology and Soils
Holocene alluvium makes up approximately 60 percent of the APE while Holocene terrace deposits
make up 10 percent and undivided quaternary sediments make up 30 percent (BEG 1992).
Holocene-age alluvium may contain interbedded O-horizons which have potential for intact
archeological deposits associated with short-term or single-use campsites. Terrace deposits may
contain deeply-buried stratified archeological deposits, often with associated large volumes of firecracked rock, identifiable living surfaces, and other indicators of longer-term and/or repeated use.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDANRCS, 2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the APE consist of Lagloria loam (LaB, 63 percent), Rio
Grande series soils (Ro, 13 percent), Laredo silty clay loam (Ls, 22 percent) with small areas of
Reynosa silty clay loam (Ra, 1 percent) and Jimenez-Quernado complex soils (JmD, 1 percent). These
soil series are mostly deep clay and silty loams associated with Pleistocene terraces.

Previous Archeological Work
According to the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, there is one previously recorded site within
the limits of the undertaking (41VV1714) and six sites within one kilometer (Table 1; Figure 3). None
of these sites are documented as National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) eligible and are mostly open campsites containing non-diagnostic chert or quartzite
artifacts. Site 41VV1714 was documented by a TxDOT survey in 1994 along the north side of Frontera
Road east of the northward bend of the APE. Although the Atlas has no information about this site,
11

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

judging by the large size (165 acres), it is likely that it is a lithic surface scatter-type site with possible
open campsites scattered within. One site, 41VV198, was documented 915 meters west of the
project area in 1962 on the right bank of Cienegas Creek. The site contained possible
Paleoindian/Transitional Archaic artifacts in the form of Angustura and Folsom projectile points.
Additionally, the site form for site 41VV1601, 450 meters west of the APE, mentions a City employee
finding a Pandale point (Early Archaic in age) at the wastewater treatment plant that adjoins the
current project area. Site 41VV1992 is located 360 meters southwest of the central bend in the
project APE. The site, documented in 2008 by Engineering-Environmental Management, Inc (e2M)
during a survey for the border fence, consisted of six stone flakes in a shovel test at 30 centimeters
below the surface (cmbs). Site 41VV1993 is located 600 meters south of the eastern project
terminus and consisted of 50 pieces of stone debitage from 11 shovel tests. Depth of cultural
material on the site was recorded as occurring to depths of 25 cmbs.

Historical Land Use
Historically, the project area was heavily used for agriculture. Irrigation canals were constructed in
Val Verde County in the early years of the twentieth century and this enabled large scale agriculture
to flourish. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers âU. S. Army Tactical Topographic Mapâ dated to 1916 and
a 1947 aerial photograph indicate that the project area had several buildings but was largely still
used for agriculture (Figure 4). Today, the project APE mostly consists of vacant and commerciallydeveloped land with a sewage treatment facility and sports fields along the western edge.

Regional Cultural Chronology
The APE is situated within the South Texas Archeological Region directly east of the Lower Pecos Region
(Perttula 2004:7). Although separate from the Lower Pecos geographically (deeply cut limestone canyonlands
in the Lower Pecos and open near-level plains in the South Texas Region), cultural influences from that region
were undoubtedly felt in the area where the APE is located. Due to a lack of intensive excavations on a range
of prehistoric sites, the chronology of this region remains more incomplete than other regions across Texas.
The occupation of South Texas is currently divided into four broad time periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic.

Paleoindian
The first inhabitants of South Texas, known as Paleoindians, are generally thought to have arrived
around 11,200 years Before Present (BP). However, there is some debate about the exact timing and
mode of arrival. The Paleoindian period was characterized by cooler and wetter climatic conditions
than today. These people practiced unique subsistence patterns that consisted of hunting now extinct
megafauna like mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989; Mauldin et al. 2003).
In fact, mammoth remains in South Texas are typically found in secondary deposits along creeks
(Hester 2004). However, within this region no mammoth faunal remains have been found in

14

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

association with Clovis peoples, the earliest known Paleoindian culture. These small bands of
nomadic big game hunters also exploited small game (Collins 1995) and plant resources. Paleoindian
lithic technology consisted of lanceolate-shaped and often fluted projectile points, polyhedral blade
cores, blade tools, and the use of exotic raw materials. Diagnostic Paleoindian projectile points found
in South Texas include Clovis, Folsom, St. Maryâs Hall, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, Angostura, and the
Wilson type (Hester 2004). Archeologists believe that warmer and drier climatic conditions coupled
with the extinction of megafauna caused a shift in Paleoindian subsistence strategies. This shift
marked the end of the Paleoindian period and the beginning of the Archaic period, divided into three
subperiods: Early, Middle, and Late Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic subperiod (ca. 8000 BP to 4500 BP [Black 1989]) is characterized by âvery low
population density, small band sizes, highly mobile, and extremely large territorial ranges (Black
1989:49).â This behavior may be attributed to the arid environment (Hester 2004), as this climate
required inhabitants to be âwater-proximate.â Thomas Hester (2004:136) divides the Early Archaic
into two horizons: early corner-notched and early basal notched. The early corner-notched horizon
has corner-notched dart points with recurved or notched bases. These point types include Martindale,
Uvalde, Baker, Bandy, and Gower dart points, as well as Guadalupe tools probably used in woodworking. The early basal-notched horizon is characterized by dart points with deep basal notches,
large bulbs, and distinctive long stems. Point types include the Bell and Andice dart points. Additional
tools associated with this horizon include early triangular bifaces and large unifacial Clear Fork tools,
which were also likely used in wood-working.
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic subperiod (ca. 4500 BP to 2400 BP [Black 1989]) began with a shift in
subsistence to a greater reliance on plant resources (Black 1989; Hester 2004). Tools associated
with this subperiod include Abasolo, Bulverde, Lange, Morhiss, Pedernales, and Tortugas projectile
points, unifacial distally beveled adze tools like the Nueces tool, and marine shell ornaments and
tools. Reliance on plant resources is evident through âan increase in formal hearths, earth ovens,
and burned rock accumulations (Hester 2004:139)â, as well as the presence of ground stone tools,
such as tubular stone pipes, grinding slabs, and manos. Middle Archaic people occupied a much
broader range of topographic settings with sites found along stream channels, in the floodplain(s),
and on low terraces and natural levees (Black 1989). Nunley and Hester (1975) defined two types of
sites based on their topographic position: âgallery,â or those found on terraces and arroyo banks; and
âbowerâ sites located in hilly areas overlooking arroyos and their tributaries. The possibility that
populations increased and territories became constrained is supported through the presence of large
cemeteries associated with this subperiod (Black 1989).
Late Archaic
The beginning of the Late Archaic subperiod dates to around 2400 BP (Hester 2004). During this
subperiod people continued to exploit plant resources evidenced in fire-cracked rock (FCR)
accumulations, hearths, earth ovens, and grinding implements (e.g., manos and metates). Additional
tools indicative of this subperiod include Desmuke, Catan, Ensor, Fairland, Marcos, Matamoros,
Montell, and Shumla projectile points, as well as Olmos bifaces. Despite a reliance on plant
resources, Late Archaic peoples continued to exploit marine and terrestrial animals such as
freshwater mussels, turtles, fish, rabbits, and deer. Sites are often located near present-day streams
or sloughs with many lithic procurement sites found âon high terraces and ridges composed of Rio

15

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

Grande or Uvalde gravels (Hester 2004:142).â The use of cemeteries increases during the Late
Archaic subperiod, becoming more concentrated with human remains (personal communication
Thomas Hester 2017).
Late Prehistoric
Some archeologists believe that the shift from Late Archaic lifeways to the Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800
to A.D. 1600 [Black 1989]) was a result of cultural diffusion rather than environmental or climatic
change. Diagnostic traits of this period include the use of the bow and arrow, straight-stemmed arrow
points, bone-tempered ceramics, and trade goods (e.g., obsidian, jadeite, and Huastecan pottery;
Hester 2004). Artifacts associated with the Late Prehistoric period consist of Scallorn, Edwards,
Perdiz, Starr, and Zavala arrow points. Sites are often located at or just below the surface of natural
levees adjacent to streams. This period can be divided into the Toyah Horizon, dating from ca. A.D.
1300-1700, and the Brownsville Complex. The Toyah Horizon is often associated with bison hunting
practices. Assemblages have Perdiz arrow points, end scrapers, flake knives, beveled knives, bonetempered pottery, perforators, shell ornaments, and bird bone bead artifacts (Hester 2004). On the
other hand, the Brownsville Complex is known for its shell and animal bone industries, and its
relationships with the Huastecan culture in Mesoamerica (Hester 2004). Located in the Rio Grande
delta, this complex focused on the exploitation of marine resources. Brownsville Complex sites and
cemeteries are found on clay dunes. These people hunted, gathered, and fished for resources
causing some archeologists to refer to them as âlogistical collectorsâ (Kibler 1994 cited in Hester
2004).
Historic Period (ca.1500-1968)
Aside from infrequent visits from early Spanish explorers, the first European presence in the vicinity
of Del Rio began in the 1700s with the establishment of a presidio and mission across the Rio
Grande River in what is now Ciudad AcuÃ±a, Mexico. Development in Del Rio did not begin until the
1860s when spring-fed San Felipe Creek, which flows through the center of Del Rio, was tapped as
a permanent source for reliable irrigation water, and a network of canals was established in the
areas surrounding the town (Overfelt 2019).
Following the establishment of Val Verde County in 1885, Del Rio became the county seat. The local
economy was based largely on ranching and agriculture, spurred by the construction of the Southern
Pacific Railroad in the 1880s (Overfelt 2019).
The military presence in Del Rio has been felt since the Mexican-American War, with several forts
and camps scattered throughout the region. Laughlin Air Base (formerly Laughlin Field) was
established in World War II and has taken the lead in the local economy ever since (Overfelt 2019).
Within the project area, historic maps and aerial imagery indicate that the area was largely used for
cultivation irrigated from local canals. In recent decades the project area has become a center for
shipping companies, which comprise most of the traffic on Frontera Road. Between 2008 and 2010,
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Border Patrol installed a border fence along the southern
edge of the project area and sealed off the eastern end of Frontera Road, which no longer connects
to State Loop 239.

16

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

Archeological Site Potential
The majority of the project APE was found to be heavily impacted by trenched utilities, road and
border fence construction, and mechanical brush-clearing, which would lower the integrity of deposits
near the surface. However, some potential exists for buried prehistoric archeological deposits. The
two most well-documented sites in the vicinity (41VV1992 and 1993) both denote cultural horizons
occurring in the upper 30 centimeters, however deeper exploration was not carried out. Historic
period archeological remains associated with one of the older ranches or farms in the vicinity were
initially thought possible within the APE, however, upon field survey, the narrow width of the unpaved
portions of ROW and the volume of prior disturbances (namely utilities trenching) throughout the
project area precluded the potential for historic deposits throughout the majority of the project.

Chapter 3
Field Methods
The survey took place within existing public ROW and on a temporary easement administered by DHS.
The survey effort was an intensive linear survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 (2) and defined in 13
TAC 26.5 and included visual inspection of 100% of the APE along with the excavation of 17 shovel
tests and 10 exploratory backhoe trenches. Trenches and shovel tests were excavated at regular
intervals within the entire existing ROW and DHS easement unless prior disturbance was confirmed
to have impacted deposits beyond the standard 80 centimeters. Shovel testing was conducted at a
rate of 16 tests per mile per 100 feet of width on each side of the road, except in portions of the APE
where previous deep disturbance was apparent, which were documented through photographs and
field notes and were not tested.
Because the proposed roadway improvements have potential to impact deeply-buried deposits along
the southern east-west portion of the project, backhoe trenching was carried out along that portion
of the project. Backhoe trenches were spaced approximately 300 meters apart (tightening to 200
meters when in closer proximity to the Rio Grande River) and were excavated from 1.5 to 2 meters
deep. Samples were screened from the trenches during excavation and detailed notes, drawings,
and photographs were made to document each trench.
All documents and photographs generated during fieldwork will be permanently curated and housed
the TARL in Austin.

Survey Results
AmaTerra archeologists carried out an intensive survey on March 18-20, 2019. Field conditions
were mild, and no difficulties affected the survey. The project area was observed to be of mixed
development, containing mostly industrial and commercial plots, some residential parcels, city
utilities and parks, and property owned and maintained by DHS Border Patrol. Deep and extensive
previous disturbances were apparent inside the APE, including buried utilities, drainage
improvements, landscaped and heavily bladed areas, as well as paved areas and gravel road
shoulders. There is evidence of extensive earth-moving disturbances within the surveyed area,
particularly in the southern half of the APE, that consists of road backfill, sub-surface asphalt, silty
soils, and sub-surface modern trash. All of these disturbances would heavily impact and/or destroy
any archeological resources present. During field investigations, no new archeological sites were
discovered. A total of 17 shovel tests and 10 mechanical trenches were excavated (Figure 5â8,
Appendix B). No artifacts were collected during this survey.

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

The northern half of the project area referred to in this document extends from the railroad tracks
at the intersection of Cienegas Road to the northeast bend in Frontera Road. The southern half of
the APE runs from the bend in Frontera Road to where it terminates in the east at the border fence
and State Loop 239.
The northern half of Frontera Road is characterized as a mix-use space of residential farming
properties, commercial warehouses with large paved lots, a waste water treatment plant, and
baseball fields. The APE in the northern half of Frontera Road is a narrow corridor populated with a
buried water line, buried phone line, open cut earth drainage and irrigation ditches, and large
swaths of paved or graveled ground. No shovel tests were excavated in the northern half of the APE
due to the presence of buried utility lines and disturbed ground conditions on both sides of Frontera
Road (Figure 9 and 10). One historical structure, an irrigation ditch, was described in a Historic
Project Coordination Request (PCR) prior to fieldwork (Bell 2019). The irrigation ditch is located
adjacent to and, in places within, the APE and consists of an open earth irrigation ditch with a
concrete intersection and a series of sluice gates (Figure 11). One channel flows south alongside
Frontera Road in an open earthen ditch and the other crosses beneath Frontera Road in a concrete
culvert. The irrigation ditch is part of the San Felipe Agricultural, Manufacturing, & Irrigation system
as described by historic marker #699 located at 608 Griner Street in Del Rio. The irrigation system
is recommended as eligible for listing the NRHP.

The southern half of the APE is characterized by commercial warehouses, parking lots, and small
vacant fields to the north of Frontera Road (Figure 12), and a maintained DHS easement and ROW
to the south (Figure 13). 17 shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches were excavated in the southern
half of the APE along the south side of Frontera Road, all of which contained disturbed soils (Figure
14). Sub-surface conditions observed during excavations included road backfill, asphalt, modern
trash (glass beer bottles, industrial plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, etc.), and old buried utilities (DHS
sensor grid). Soils across the excavated portion of the APE were observed to be sandy loams, which
were disturbed to a minimum depth of 60cm. No shovel tests were excavated along the north side
of Frontera Road in the southern segment due to the presence of buried phone, gas, and water
utilities, which filled the entire unpaved portion of the APE (Figures 15 and 16).
Typical shovel tests revealed disturbed and compact soils, comprised of mostly silt, backfill gravel,
and trash. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum of 80cmbs; on average, the 17 shovel tests
were excavated to a depth of 38cmbs. Shovel tests were placed approximately every 100 meters
within the southern APE in areas that appeared undisturbed. Backhoe trenches were excavated
every 300 meters to a depth of 150-200cmbs. Typical trenches included disturbed soils to a
minimum depth of 100cmbs, and included modern trash such as Styrofoam, plastic sheeting, glass
beer bottles, and aluminum beer cans (Figure 17). One atypical trench included a layer of river
rocks from a previous drainage culvert (Figure 18).

Archeological Survey of Frontera Road, Del Rio, Val Verde County, Texas

At the terminus of Frontera Road at State Loop 239 (the easternmost edge of the APE), one
potentially historic monument was located (Figure 19).
From 1891-1894, 276 official concrete obelisks were established along the US-Mexico border.
After the initial 276 concrete obelisks were constructed, smaller concrete markers were erected
along the border in order to further delineate the boundary, particularly in high-traffic areas like
cities and river-crossings. By 1984, 493 additional markers had been added along the border in
urban places like Del Rio (Dear 2005). Based on its appearance, condition, and location, this
marker likely belongs to that family of historic border markers. Due its close proximity to the border
fence, it is unlikely to be impacted by the roadway improvements to Frontera Road, but we
recommend avoiding disturbance during construction.

Summary and Recommendations
On March 18-20, 2019, AmaTerra carried out an intensive survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and
defined in 13 TAC 26.5. During investigations, 17 shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches were
excavated within the 2.5-mile long project APE, which encompasses 27.3 acres including a 3.9-acre
easement managed by DHS. No archeological sites or artifacts were discovered during fieldwork.
The project was conducted under the ACT (Permit 8733) and Section 106 of the NHPA and all work
conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26 as
well as 36 CFR 800. No prehistoric or historic-age artifacts or archeological sites were discovered
during field investigations. However, it is recommended that the concrete obelisk be avoided during
construction.
Construction is recommended to proceed for the Frontera Road improvements with no further
archeological work.
All land surveyed was located on publicly-owned property and all portions of the APE were accessible
at the time of survey. No artifacts were collected during investigations. All notes and forms generated
during fieldwork will be curated at TARL in Austin.
