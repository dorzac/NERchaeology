Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Abstract
Cultural resource specialists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), working on behalf
of the Tarrant Regional Water District (TWRD), the City of Dallas Water Utility (DWU), and
their environmental compliance subconsultant, Freese and Nichols, Inc. conducted intensive
archeological and historic resource surveys for TRWD’s and DWU’s proposed Integrated
Pipeline Project (IPL) for National Historic Preservation Act and Antiquities Code of Texas
compliance. The IPL is a water pipeline that will be maintained by TRWD and will ultimately
carry water from Lake Palestine, Cedar Creek Reservoir, and Richland-Chambers Reservoir
and transfer it into the more densely populated Dallas and Fort Worth Metroplex. Across its full
roughly 150-mile length, the pipeline will cross Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson,
and Anderson Counties. At this time, the pipeline project’s Proposed Action covers most of the
pipeline corridor and some facility sites in Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, and Henderson
Counties. Additional components are known for the proposed Future Action in Tarrant, Ellis,
and Navarro Counties while additional Future Action components have not been finalized east
of Cedar Creek Lake in Henderson and Anderson Counties. Along with IPL survey, cultural
resource survey was conducted at TRWD’s proposed expansion site of the existing Kennedale
Balancing Reservoir (KBR) in Tarrant County. This is an action independent of IPL but was
surveyed at the same time. Working under Antiquities Permit 5826, archeologists surveyed
approximately 14,000 acres of land along a combination linear and area survey. Linear survey
along the pipeline included evaluation of the 150-foot permanent easement and the larger
450-foot evaluation corridor, while area survey evaluated eight facility sites (pump stations,
balancing reservoirs, and other structures).
During the course of fieldwork archeologists excavated approximately 12,216 shovel tests,
of which 226 were positive for archeological materials (~1.8 percent). Two-hundred-seventyeight (278) cultural resources were documented during survey. Fifty-seven (57) archeological
sites were newly-documented through field survey while an additional 14 were revisited and
re-recorded (71 sites total). Architectural historians conducted windshield survey along the
IPL and KBR’s proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE), recording 166 standing historicage resources. Through TRWD’s policy to avoid sites whenever practical and with key
interest in indications of archeological or historical significance, only 81 cultural resources
(17 archeological sites, 7 archeological isolates, and 57 non-archeological historic structures)
will be impacted by the proposed undertakings. Archeological sites that lie within the direct
effects APE include (Tarrant County: 41TR238, 251–252: Ellis County: 41EL88, 101, 155,
257, 259–261; Navarro County: 41NV706, 717–720; Henderson County: 41HE369, 377).
Archeologists recommend that the resources located within the proposed archeological APE
(including all of the IPL Proposed Action and those components of the IPL Future Action west
of Cedar Creek Reservoir and the proposed expansion of the KBR site) are not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs) while architectural historians further conclude that no non-archeological Historic
Properties will be impacted by the IPL Proposed Action or the independent KBR expansion.
As TRWD refines and finalizes the IPL’s proposed Future Action, they have committed to
following the same avoidance strategy employed to this point and will survey all segments that

deviate from previously evaluated areas. Furthermore, the Future Action will be coordinated
with the THC once it has been finalized and cultural resource impacts have been assessed. All
project-generated notes, forms, photographs, and other materials will be curated at Texas State
University’s Center for Archaeological Studies in San Marcos, Texas. This report is offered in
partial fulfillment of TAC Permit 5826.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Acknowledgements
The IPL project was a massive effort, spanning miles and years, accessing more than a thousand
individual parcels, and utilizing dozens of individual field crew workers. Despite its scale, the
authors appreciate the relative smoothness of the process. From the earliest planning meetings
to the late-stage report revisions, the professionalism and interest in work quality has impressed
us here at AmaTerra. This study is a testament to the quality team that was assembled to
complete this massive project. AmaTerra would like to thank representatives at the Tarrant
Regional Water District for their refreshingly genuine interest in environmental and cultural
resource stewardship as they planned this pipeline. Woody Frossard, Darrel Andrews, and
Mark Ernst in particular represented the agency in an exemplary manner and ferried the survey
process along in an attitude that was quite helpful. At Freese and Nichols, Inc. (FNI), Steve
Watters and Alan Hutson actively and directly led an excellent environmental coordination
group during this investigation. Among those FNI workers, Bryan Eaton, Joshua Caster, and
Mark Valentino provided GIS support that was timely, accurate, and invaluable while Karl
Hoffman and Cody Mikeska offered useful insights into the environmental constraints present
throughout the survey corridor. Worthy of individual mention, FNI coordinator Kara Marks
served as the tireless and faultless central switchboard of this massive undertaking, shuttling
right of entry updates to field crews, fielding methodology questions from investigators,
arranging meeting after meeting, and generally keeping her finger on the pulse of the effort from
start to finish. The authors credit a great deal of the project’s smooth operation to Ms. Marks’
role on the team. Also of mention, Brenton Dunn coordinated access to these survey parcels,
served as an intermediary between field crews and landowners, and generally helped us get our
job done with the least amount of trouble. Geomorphological insights provided by Brittney
Gregory and Charles Frederick served us well throughout the investigations. Additionally, we
found a jewel in backhoe operator Robert Axleson, who fashioned a custom boom extension
for his backhoe that gave us those much-needed few extra meters of soil exposures along the
Trinity. A hearty “Thank You” is extended to everyone mentioned and the numerous others
who worked on this project with us.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Chapter 1

Introduction
In an effort to meet projected water demands of an increasing metropolitan north-central Texas
population (estimated to double in the next 50 years), the Tarrant Regional Water District
(TRWD) has partnered with the City of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) to construct the proposed
Integrated Pipeline (IPL) that will transport water from reservoirs in East Texas to the Dallas/
Fort Worth Metroplex. Once complete, the IPL will ultimately consist of a seven- to nine-footdiameter water line that will begin at Lake Palestine and deliver water to DWU and TRWD
infrastructure closer to the metroplex. Along the way, the proposed pipeline crosses primarily
open, rural land in Anderson, Henderson, Navarro, Ellis, Johnson, and Tarrant counties. The
pipeline will interconnect with Cedar Creek Lake and Richland-Chambers Reservoir along
with various stand alone facilities along several tributary lines (Figure 1.1). The IPL project
has been divided into two actions to address TRWD’s immediate need for additional water
supply as well as long-term goals for both TRWD and DWU. Dallas plans to utilize closer
water sources to meet near-term demands, which postpones their need for Lake Palestine water
for a few more years. Working under a subcontract to Project Environmental Team lead Freese
and Nichols, Inc. (FNI), cultural resource specialists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.
(AmaTerra) conducted an intensive archeological and historic resource survey for National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance on behalf
of the TRWD and DWU for all of the Proposed Action components. Additional design planning
is required to finalize potential project-related impacts associated with the Future Action (see
below).

1.1	Description of the Proposed Undertaking
According to TRWD engineers, the proposed IPL facility will utilize a variety of new and
existing infrastructure elements. The IPL’s Proposed Action will involve connecting TRWD’s
East Texas water supplies (Cedar Creek Reservoir and Richland-Chambers Reservoir) to its
existing water distribution system in Tarrant County along approximately 93 linear miles of
pipeline (approximately 2,000 acres), crossing Henderson, Navarro, Ellis, Johnson, and Tarrant
counties (see Figure 1.1). A new intake pump station at the Cedar Creek Reservoir and capacity
expansion of an existing intake pump station at Richland-Chambers Reservoir are included
in the Proposed Action, along with the construction of two booster pump stations (JB-2 and
JB-3) and a balancing reservoir near Midlothian (see below). The proposed Future Action
would include the future construction of the easternmost and westernmost segments of the
IPL, bringing the project total to approximately 150 total linear miles (total impacts at this time
estimated at approximately 3,800 acres). The future easternmost IPL segment would connect
Lake Palestine, in which DWU owns water rights, to the IPL near Cedar Creek Reservoir,
crossing additional portions of Henderson and Anderson counties. The future westernmost IPL
segment would be constructed from existing TRWD facilities near the City of Kennedale to
existing TRWD facilities near Lake Benbrook, extending the project components into additional

portions of Tarrant County. An intake pump station at Lake Palestine and one booster pump
station would also be built as part of the future action to complete the IPL project.
Along with the IPL facilities, TRWD is proposing to expand the existing Kennedale Balancing
Reservoir (KBR) near the community of Kennedale in southern Tarrant County. While initially
a component of the IPL project and slated to have water from the pipeline feed into the facility,
TRWD later elected to separate the 118.8-acre expansion into an independent undertaking that
will be planned and constructed separately. The survey, however, had been completed on the
KBR footprint by that time and results of that investigation (conducted under the same permit)
are included with this larger IPL survey report.
The pipeline itself is the main
component, consisting of various
84- to 108-inch diameter pipes
being installed within a 100to 150-foot-wide permanent
easement (Figure 1.2). The pipes
will be installed to a depth (bottom
of the pipe) of approximately
13–30 feet within an 11–15-footwide, primarily open-cut trench.
Portions of the proposed line
that cross larger roadways or
waterways will be installed
through subsurface tunnels (see
below). While TRWD intends
to install one pipeline at this

pipes may be installed within
the same 150-foot permanent
easement at a later date to meet future demands. TRWD has divided the Proposed Action
into 10 Sections: (from west to east) Sections 10–14, 15-2, 15-1, and 16–18 (see Figure 1.1).
The proposed Future Action will add a Section 9 at the western end while additional sections
to the eastern terminus are yet to be determined. Table 1.1 below summarizes the proposed
segment dimensions for the Proposed Action and the proposed Future Action’s Section 9 (as
TRWD has essentially finalized that proposed route and installation method). Impacts from
the construction of this project component will include easement clearing and maintenance,
vehicular traffic, temporary pipe storage, trench excavation, and backfilling (see Figure 1.2 as
an example of typical pipeline work).
Environmental and cultural resource surveys were conducted early in the pipeline design
process with field data contributing significantly to the final route selection. In addition to the
100- to 150-foot proposed permanent easement, all portions of the proposed pipeline corridor
were surveyed using a 450-foot-wide “evaluation corridor” (an additional 150 feet on either side
of the 150-foot permanent easement; Figure 1.3). This larger survey footprint allowed TRWD

some flexibility to shift the pipeline to avoid environmental and cultural resources. When
resource avoidance dictated that the pipeline easement could not be kept within the evaluation
corridor, a new 450-foot evaluation corridor was surveyed; either through a partial corridor
widening or a more substantial reroute within a new location. In limited circumstances, large
blocks of land were investigated to find a route through which the pipeline could pass that would
avoid impacts in particularly resource-rich areas. Often this route/reroute evaluation process
would go through numerous iterations within a given area to meet all resource avoidance goals

and engineering limitations. As a result, Table 1.1 represents the culmination of more than
two years of environmental and cultural resource investigations conducted in concert with
pipeline design to find a route that would avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands, endangered
species habitat, and significant archeological and historic resources while meeting the specific
limitations of pipeline engineering.
As stated above, the proposed IPL pipeline will be installed primarily through open-cut trenching.
In some locations, however, the pipe must cross such obstructions as major roadways, large
creeks and rivers, and identified environmental constraints. In these areas, the pipeline will be
installed through subsurface tunneling (Table 1.2). In most instances, the bored sections are
short (less than 100 yards) and facilitate the crossing of a small drainage, but in others they
are much longer. The main example of this is the five-mile tunneled section west of Interstate
Highway (IH)-35 West that continues to the pipeline’s western terminus (part of the Future
Action). Tunnels will run roughly 35 or more feet below the ground surface. At each end of the
tunneled segment is a sending/receiving pit that measures less than one acre in size (in most
instances much less; Figure 1.4).
In addition to the main pipeline, the full proposed project includes three intake pump stations,
three booster pump stations with associated reservoirs, and one balancing reservoir (Table
1.3). As can be seen in Table 1.3, the Cedar Creek Pump Station, Richland-Chambers Pump
Station, JB-2 and JB-3 Booster Pump Stations, and the Midlothian Balancing Reservoir are
part of the Proposed Action. All other facilities listed are proposed for the Future Action. The

anticipated impacts from the construction of these types of facilities are estimated to occupy
the full proposed footprint with construction depths extending 15–30 feet below the ground
surface. While each site is summarized below, the total acreage of impacts proposed for these
facilities is approximately 1,084 acres.
Intake pump stations pull water from their respective reservoirs and send it downstream at a
rate of 250–500 million gallons per day (MGD) along the pipeline. These facilities include a
subsurface intake set deep in the reservoir, a pump station facility that pulls the water through

the intake, an electrical substation that gathers power to operate the pumps and various offices,
roads, and other elements. While the IPL project will be adding facilities to an existing site, the
Joint Richland-Chambers Lake Pump Station (JRC1), two other facilities are entirely new: the
Lake Palestine Pump Station and Intake (LP1; Future Action) and the Joint Cedar Creek Lake
Pump Station and Intake (JCC1; Proposed Action). All non-intake-channel components of the
facility will be constructed on uplands. Approximately 28,000 cubic yards of materials would
be excavated during the construction of the intake channel at the proposed Cedar Creek Pump
Station, which would be deposited off-site. A temporary cofferdam would be installed at or near
the lake shoreline within a proposed turbidity curtain at the intake channel. Dredged material
from the intake channel would be stockpiled temporarily onsite, dewatered, and eventually
utilized for construction or disposed of off-site.
Booster pump stations serve as intermediary facilities that maintain water flow and static
pressure on the pipeline once the water moves away from the pump station facilities. Like
the intake pump stations, these facilities include a pump station, an electrical substation, a
chemical feed building, a communication tower, a helicopter pad, and other elements (access
roads, perimeter fencing, storage, etc.), but booster pump stations also include one or more
large reservoirs (80 million gallons for the proposed JB-3 facility) used to maintain water
levels at the pump facility. All proposed booster pump stations and their associated reservoirs
are new locations proposed for the IPL project.
Balancing reservoirs are located along the western half of the project corridor. These facilities
consist of a large reservoir for water storage (450 million gallons for the proposed Midlothian
Balancing Reservoir), intake and outflow pipelines, various water control sluices and valves,
and other associated
facilities

over the course of project development. In most instances, crews surveyed several candidate
locations for a given facility with TRWD choosing a final location based at least partially upon
field findings. In other instances, significant resources required revision and expansion of a
chosen facility site location, in which case archeologists were called to survey an area multiple
times to identify the best locale for a given facility.
The area of potential effects (APE) for direct effects is defined as the final proposed 150-footwide permanent easement and all proposed facility site footprints with depths of impact
extending to approximately 30 feet. The APE for indirect (visual) effects is defined as the
larger 450-foot evaluation corridor. In addition, all new facility sites were evaluated for indirect
effects to standing historic structures within a half-mile radius of the facility boundary. The
relationship between the permanent easement (direct effects APE), the evaluation corridor
(indirect effects APE), and facility site APEs is illustrated in Figure 1.6.

1.2	Regulatory Framework and Management Summary
The proposed IPL project is funded through a partnership between TRWD and DWU with the
majority of lands and subsequent management duties being assumed by TRWD once the water
distribution system is operational. A variety of state and federal regulations are applicable in
constructing the project, many of which have implications for cultural resource management. The
proposed IPL project includes numerous crossings of waters of the U.S. under the jurisdiction
of the Fort Worth District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The project will require
a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit for crossings of waters of the U.S. and a Rivers and
Harbors Act Section 10 permit for crossing the Trinity River, which is classified as a navigable
waterway by the USACE. Authorization for these crossings is expected under Nationwide
Permit 12 (Utility Line Activities), which addresses sections 404 and 10. The USACE permit
triggers federal level cultural resource regulatory oversight as outlined in Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended (Section 106), and coordination procedures as outlined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800. Section 106 and 36 CFR 800 require federal agencies to
“take into account” potential impacts to Historic Properties (cultural resources listed on or
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places [NRHP]) that result from their
actions (in this instance, the anticipated project authorization under Nationwide Permit 12). As
a result, investigations were conducted into the presence and condition of historic structures
and archeological resources that might be affected by the federal agency’s undertaking (i.e.,
by USACE authorization of the proposed project under NWP 12). For regulatory purposes, the
USACE is considered to be the Lead Federal Agency for Section 106 coordination.
The proposed project will be constructed within lands or permanent easements owned by
political subdivisions of the State of Texas (TRWD and DWU). At the state level, this action
triggers the responsibilities outlined in the ACT, which requires investigation of potential project
impacts to significant archaeological resources, called State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs).
Additionally, the project is partially funded through the Texas Water Development Board’s
(TWDB’s) Water Infrastructure Fund (WIF), which calls for adherence to the ACT where
applicable. Archaeological and historic resource surveys were completed for compliance with
both ACT regulations under Antiquities Permit 5826 as well as Section 106. No artifacts were

collected during the course of the field survey; however, all forms, photographs, notes, and
other field-generated materials will be permanently curated at the Center for Archaeological
Studies at Texas State University in San Marcos in compliance with the requirements of
Antiquities Permit 5826.
At the time of survey, the overwhelming majority of the proposed pipeline corridor and its
associated facility sites are located on privately-owned lands, at least partially crossing 836
individual parcels (within the final corridor). TRWD is proposing to purchase permanent
easements on these properties for construction and maintenance or puchasing the lands outright.
Cultural resource specialists surveyed all of the properties that would be impacted by the
Proposed Action components, and present their findings in this report. Additionally, plans for
most of the IPL project’s Future Action have been finalized and have also been investigated
fully; the findings are presented in this report. Accordingly, this report includes detailed
descriptions of the survey and identified resources in those survey areas with the understanding
that the Future Action could ultimately vary from the surveyed areas. Additional coordination
would be required for that portion of the project once the decision is made to seek a 404 permit

for the future project components; additional field survey may be required if the proposed
route deviates from the surveyed areas or passes too close to identified, potentially-significant
cultural resources.

1.3

Identified Resource Summary

As a result of alignment revision during design, the areas surveyed are larger than the final
proposed construction footprint. Tables 1.4 and 1.5 below provide a summary of the areas
surveyed and the number of historic-age resources and archeological sites revisited or newlyrecorded as a result of the effort.

1.4

Administrative Matters

Mason D. Miller and Nicholas W. Trierweiler served as the project’s archeological Principal
Investigators with Kevin Stone serving as the Field Director and Project Archeologist.
Archeological Crew Chiefs included Iakov Doumanov, Noel Steinle, Daniel Rodriguez, and
Daniel Rose. Additional archeologists on the project included Jacob Bentley, Joel Butler,
Travis Cornish, Bruce Darnell, Jon Dowling, Matthew Elverson, Michaela Grillo, Benjamin
Kalenak, Christopher Lamon, Brittany McClain, Amanda Murphy, Jesse Nowak, Antonio
Padilla, Julian “Drew” Sitters, Charles Smith, Shannon Smith, Gregory Sundborg, and
Emory Worrell. Geomorphologists Charles Frederick and Brittney Gregory participated in
supplemental investigations of some backhoe trenches along the pipeline corridor (their report is
provided as Appendix D). The historic resource survey was initiated by AmaTerra architectural
historian Kathryn St. Clair with Kurt Korfmacher completing those responsibilities. Senior
Historic Architect Stephen Eisenhour assisted with reporting and field survey throughout the
investigation. Back in the office, Dan Rose and Joel Butler assisted with GIS analysis and
map production. Margo Gregory and Mindy Bonine completed all document production and
formatting. The historic survey was completed between November 10, 2010 and December
20, 2012, while the archeological field efforts were initiated on December 17, 2010 and largely
concluded on February 17, 2013. Additional isolated route changes prompted occasional field
visits after this report was prepared well into the Summer and Fall of 2013 as well. Results of
these surveys are included in Appendix E.
Following this chapter, the report will include research design and field methods sections that
describe how the AmaTerra field crew conducted their archeological and historic resource
investigations and coordination with the central engineering group. These discussions will
include descriptions of prefield investigations, shovel testing, backhoe trenching, historic site
survey, and archeological site investigation and definition protocols. Due to the geographic
scale of a project such as this, the background, field survey, and site discussions will be
divided by county. Within each county section, the report will include a brief natural and
cultural background, a historical context/background, a general description of the study area,
a brief description of the general results of the field investigations, and detailed descriptions
of each cultural resource site identified within that county. For a more detailed description
of the archeological field findings within a given parcel (soil depths, areas of disturbance,

Environmental Setting
The IPL’s 150-mile corridor crosses through a variety of environmental settings that would
have influenced the lifeways of prehistoric and historic inhabitants in this region. Furthermore,
these natural settings have dramatic impacts on the preservation of archeological sites and
the methods archeologists use to identify them. Accordingly, no detailed survey report can be
written without a brief summary of the project area’s natural environment. Within this chapter,
the IPL’s environmental setting is summarized in broad regional trends. More specific details
are provided for each county within the respective Results of Field Investigations chapters (see
Chapters 5–10).

2.1	Natural Environment
At the time of survey, the majority of the IPL corridor was used primarily as farmland or pasture
land with areas of light commercial or residential use surrounding the larger population centers
(Fort Worth, Mansfield, Waxahachie, etc.). The eastern portion of the project area (primarily in
those components of the proposed Future Action) is found within the Neches River watershed,
while the central and western portions are located within the Trinity River watershed crossing
the channel near the pipeline’s center.
The proposed pipeline crosses two biotic regions, the Austroriparian and the Texan (Figure
2.1). The Austroriparian biotic region is home to many plants and animals that are found
throughout much of the eastern United States with habitat reaching all the way to the Atlantic
Ocean. Within the Austroriparian province there are many common animal species including
the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginaiana), the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), the
eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinesis), the ornate and eastern box turtles (Terrapene ornate
and carolina), the copperhead (Agkistrodon contortirx), and the rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta).
The Texan biotic region is the zone between the moist Austroriparian forests and the semiarid grasslands to the west, with grasslands and forests intermixed within (Blair 1950). While
many of the species known within the Austroriparian province also are common in the Texan,
animals typical to the grasslands of this province include the thirteen-lined ground squirrel
(Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), hispid pocket mouse (Chaetodipus hispidus), deer mouse
(Peromyscus maniculatus) and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and bullfrog (Rana
catesbeiana).
Within the roughly 150 miles of the proposed IPL route (including those area yet to be
finalized), the alignment traverses one broad physiographic region known as the Western
Gulf Coastal Plain, while the easternmost section touches two other physiographic regions:
Central Texas and Osage Plains (Figure 2.2). The Gulf Coast Plain is comprised of broad lowlying valleys that extend around the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States, from the
Florida Panhandle around to easternmost Texas. The Western Gulf Coastal Plain is the largest

physiographic region in Texas, stretching from the Red River to the Gulf of Mexico and the
Rio Grande. The Central Texas physiographic region is a small area between the Western Gulf
Coastal Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the High Plains, with a mixed grass prairie environment
over a hilly limestone foundation. The Osage Plains, covering west-central Missouri, part of
Kansas, most of central Oklahoma, and extending into north-central Texas, is the southernmost
of three tallgrass prairie physiographic areas on the lower plains. It grades into savanna and
woodland to the east and south, and into shorter mixed-grass prairie to the west. These three
physiographic regions comprise large swaths of land in the central-south United States, so
the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin has subdivided and
organized these regions into subprovinces. The subprovinces within the project area are the
Interior Coastal Plains, Blackland Prairies, and Grand Prairie (Wermund 1996). These areas
have been further subdivided into four vegetative sub-regions, including: the Piney Woods and
Post Oak Savannah in the Interior Coastal Plains, the Blackland Prairies, and Cross Timbers
and Prairies in the Grand Prairie (Figure 2.3).
Interior Coastal Plains
Based on the underlying geological formations, soil composition, and vegetative setting, the
segment spanning from the survey corrodor’s eastern terminus at Lake Palestine in Anderson
County, to just east of IH 45 in Navarro County, is located within the Interior Coastal Plains
(Coffee 1975; Diggs et al. 1999; Hatherly and Mays 1979; Meade et al. 1974). The Interior
Coastal Plains contain two distinct vegetative zones known as the Piney Woods and Post Oak
Savannah. Within the proposed project area, the Piney Woods are limited to an area stretching
from Lake Palestine west toward the City of Athens. Naturally forested areas within the Piney
Woods include mature pine and mixed pine-hardwood stands with secondary growth and briar
(Soil Survey Staff 2010). As the IPL survey route progresses westward, the Piney Woods
transitions into Post Oak Savannah vegetation. The Post Oak Savannah is characterized by
a deciduous overstory containing oak, hickory, sweetgum, elm, and cedar. The understory is
characterized by mixed grasses, secondary growth, and briar (US Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012 [USDA 2012]).
Blackland Prairies
The central portion of the proposed IPL alignment from IH 45 in Navarro County to the JohnsonTarrant County line is within the Blackland Prairies physiographic and vegetative regions
(Brooks et al. 1962; Coburn 1985; Diggs et al. 1999; Meade et al. 1974). Topographically, the
Blacklands are described as containing gently undulating or rolling prairies. Although tall grass
prairies dominate the Blacklands’ vegetation, wooded areas are also present along primary
rivers and streams, in isolated patches within particular soils, and within abrupt topographic
transitions (Diggs et al. 1999).
Grand Prairie
Extending from the IH 35 West corridor to the IPL alignment’s western terminus at Benbrook
Lake is the Grand Prairie physiographic region (Ressel 1981). This region is characterized by

“gently sloping, almost level, and usually treeless dip plains, broken only by the valleys and
of the transecting drainage” (Diggs et al. 1999:50). Within the Grand Prairie, the proposed
pipeline alignment crosses though the Cross Timbers and Prairies vegetative area. Similar to
the Blacklands environment, the Cross Timbers and Prairies contain gently rolling uplands.
However, this zone is far narrower than the Blacklands zone, and, in stark contrast, the area
has woody vegetation primarily of the post oak and blackjack oak variety (Diggs et al. 1999).
A sub-region of the Cross Timbers and Prairies, the Fort Worth Prairie vegetative zone is the
specific area crossed by the IPL alignment. This area contains a “continuous body of open
grasslands, roughly 10–30 miles wide, from near the Red River in the north,” to near the
Johnson-Hill County line (Diggs et al. 1999:43).

2.2	Bedrock Geology and Soils
Interior Coastal Plains
The Interior Coastal Plains are characterized as containing “alternating belts of resistant
uncemented sands among weaker shales that erode into long sandy ridges” (Wermund 1996:1).
The proposed project area crosses three geological groups within the Interior Coastal Plains:
Claiborne, Wilcox, and Midway (Figure 2.4). These geological groups contain nine different
formations that have created this setting. These formations are Eocene in geological age
and include the Weches Formation (Ew), Sparta Sand (Es), Queen City Sand (Eqc), Reklaw
Formation (Er), Carrizo Sand (Ec), Wilcox undivided (EPawi), Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt),
Alluvium (Qal), and Willis Point Formation (PAwp) (Barnes 1972). Soils in the Interior Coastal
Plains are mainly sands with little clay near the surface (USDA 2012).
Blackland Prairies
The Bureau of Economic Geology defines the soils of the Blackland Prairies as “the innermost
Gulf Coastal Plains, chalks and marls weather to deep, black, fertile clay soils” (Wermund
1996:1). The Blacklands is underlain by four geological groups that were deposited during the
Upper Cretaceous period and increase in age from east to west (see Figure 2-4). The youngest
formation belongs with the Navarro Group, which includes Kemp Clay and Corsicana Marl
undivided (Kkc) and Nacatoch Sand (Kns). Bording to the west is the Taylor Group. This group
is characterized by marls and sandy marls pertaining to the Neylandville and Marlbrook Marls
undivided (Knm), Wolfe City Sand (Kwc), and Ozan Formation (Ko) (Barnes 1972). The next
oldest formation is the Austin Chalk (Kau), which forms “the elevated backbone or axis of the
Blacklands” (Diggs et al. 1999:38). The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) is the westernmost and
oldest geological group of the Blackland Prairies. Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) and Alluvium
(Qal) are present along the Trinity River and other primary waterways (Barnes 1972). Soils
within the Blackland Prairies are mainly deep clays (USDA 2012).
Grand Prairie
Geologically, the primary difference between the Grand Prairie and Blackland Prairies is “that
the Grand Prairie is established upon firm, persistent bands of limestones, which are harder

than the underlying clay substructures of the Blackland Prairie region” (Diggs et al. 1999:50).
The proposed IPL alignment passes through two of the Grand Prairie’s geological groups:
the Woodbine and undivided Washita. Within these groups are four formations that increase
with geological age from east to west (Diggs et al. 1999) (see Figure 2-4). The easternmost
formation is the Woodbine Formation, which belongs with the Upper Cretaceous period. The
Lower Cretaceous period is represented by Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided
(Kgm), Weno Limestone (Kpw), and Duck Creek Formation (Diggs et al. 1999). Similar to the
Blacklands, Fluviatile terrace deposits (Ot), and Alluvium (Qal) are present along a few major
waterways (Barnes 1972). Soils in the Grand Prairie vary from sands to clays (USDA 2012).

Cultural Background
Along with the natural setting, the IPL corridor’s cultural history has a significant impact on the
site types that are expected within the area and the methods used to identify those sites. Below
is a brief summary of North-Central and East Texas’ cultural histories. These discussions focus
on the prehistoric and early historic occupations of the region. Detailed historical summaries
and contexts relevant to each county are included within Chapters 5–10.

3.1

Introduction

The project area is located within the Deep East Texas, Savannah and Prairie, and NorthCentral Texas Archeological Regions (Figure 3.1). From the Paleoindian period (pre-8500
before present [BP]) to the Middle Archaic (ca. 6000 BP), the archeological record is very
similar across these regions (Jones 2009; Nichols 2010; Pertulla 2004a, 2004b, 2008; Prikryl
1990). However, around 6000 BP the cultural chronologies begin to diverge by region. These
sub-chronologies have been ultimately defined by archeologists into discrete Late Prehistoric
cultural phases; i.e., the Woodlands and Caddo in the Deep East Texas region and the Henrietta
in the North-Central Texas region (Pertulla 2004a; Figure 3.1).
Although the regions share cultural commonalities from the Paleoindian period into the Late
Archaic period, the amount of data contributing to the chronological frameworks is variable.
Archeological sites like George C. Davis, Yarbrough, Hatchell, and Mitchell have provided a
wealth of knowledge pertaining to the Archaic and Woodland periods, as well as the Caddo
phases within the Deep East Texas region. Also, invaluable data has been obtained from “open
campsites including Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta Court, Yousport,
[Gault] Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide” in central Texas (Collins 2004:119). In addition,
deeply buried stratified sites in southwest Texas such as Devil’s Mouth and Arenosa have
greatly contributed to the overarching multi-regional cultural chronology (Dibble n.d.; Johnson
1964; Prikryl 1990:69). On the other hand, despite archeological research, a lack of contextual
data has made for a poor and unrefined chronological framework for the North-Central Texas
region. The chronology primarily remains poorly understood “because of the lack of excavations
conducted on well stratified and intact archeological sites within the region” (Nichols 2010:10;
Prikryl 1990).

3.2	Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period describes the time in which North America was first occupied by
peoples migrating from the Old World. The occupation of the New World is due in part to the
migration of now-extinct fauna (e.g., bison, camel, and horse) across the newly open lands and
the people who followed them, relying on these animals for everyday subsistence. Although

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

this portrayal of the early occupants of North America is generally accepted among some
archeologists, others see the Paleoindian period as a time in which Pleistocene peoples are
separated into Early and Late stages ca. 12,000–8000 BP, based on cultural traditions of tool
technologies (Bousman et al. 2004).
These stages differ from area to area and region to region depending on the data recorded in
those regions. There is a lack of good data in East Texas relating to the Paleoindian period.
While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice
have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, found on the surface, or found in excavations
of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most sites occur in
the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas. Available evidence suggests that
groups occupied small camps, used a generalized toolkit, and were more likely to be highly
mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters (Perttula 2004).

3.3

Archaic Period

The Archaic period signifies a shift to a less mobile, more generalized subsistence strategy.
This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation of local plants and animals.
Along with the change in subsistence, a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of
this is apparent in the archeological record, as a relatively small variety of lanceolate-shaped
points gave way to numerous variants of stemmed and barbed dart points and the presence of
ground stone increased (Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still nomadic in nature,
travel became more seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain localities.
According to Collins (1995), the Archaic period in Texas lasted approximately 7,500 years,
from 8800 to about 1300 BP, and is divided into three sub-stages: the Early Archaic (8800–
6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000–4000 BP), and the Late Archaic (4000–1300 or 1200
BP). However, in the East Texas Archeological Region, reliable dating is not yet available to
unequivocally substantiate these different periods.
During the Early Archaic period, the climate changed from the wet and mild conditions seen
in the Paleoindian stage, to a warmer and drier climate, ultimately leading to severe xeric
conditions during the middle stages of the Early Archaic. These climate changes forced the
peoples of the Early Archaic to broaden their subsistence strategies from hunting bison to
include the exploitation of resources such as acorns, fruits, rodents, deer, and prickly pear (Story
1985:38–39; Weir 1976). Settlement patterns also change during the Early Archaic. Sites are
smaller and more widely distributed, suggesting high group mobility within large territories.
Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the
larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites in major basins in the region, a more
diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of
plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths,
ovens and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and cooking of plant
resources was important (Perttula 2004).

23

Chapter 3

Cultural History

Throughout North and East Texas, Late Archaic sites are relatively common along major streams
and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic, population
density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

3.4	Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by plain
ware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog (broken-up powder of ceramic vessels) or bone, and
by Gary projectile points. At sites near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up
of ceramics, while at other sites in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers,
ceramics are not as common. One explanation for this difference may be possible regional
differences in food processing and diet during this period, all of which may have an effect on
the degree of sedentism between regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods than they had during
the Archaic period. There are some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) in which pottery
making is linked to sedentism, perhaps giving reason for these long stays. In some cases, such
as at the Ray Site, small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated
occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the
region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of sites in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river
basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when
they occur, they are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or on terraces of
larger streams, and also by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland period burial
mounds have been documented in the region.

3.5	Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period beginning around 1250 BP is notable for the introduction of arrow
points. Scholars split the Late Prehistoric period into two sub-categories; the early phase and
the late phase (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). Prikryl (1990) terms the early phase Late Prehistoric
I (1250–750 BP) and states that the introduction of the bow and arrow is the defining moment
during this period. The introduction of the bow allowed hunters to obtain game at greater
distances and without the large open, brushless terrain that is required for hunting larger game.
Smaller-sized projectile points such as Alba, Catahoula, and Scallorn types indicate the use of
arrows in the North-Central Texas (Prikryl 1990:58). The late phase, labeled Late Prehistoric
II (750–250 BP) by Prikryl (1990) is characterized by a steady increase in population as well
as specialized processing kits developed in order to take advantage of the growing bison
population (Ricklis 1992).

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

In the North-Central archeological region of Texas, the Late Prehsitoric period is complicated
by the apparent movement of peoples as well as the influence from nearby Caddo and Plains
cultures located in North and Northeast Texas. Sites such as the Harrel Site (41YN1) in Young
County contained artifacts (Perdiz point, ceramics) that allude to apparent interactions and
influences from Caddo and Toyah groups (Ferring and Yates 1997). Additionally a small
number of Caddo style ceramics have been recorded at sites located on terraces and within
rockshelters within the central Brazos River basin (Perttula et al. 1995). It is conceivable that
similar sites are locates within certain, similar areas within the project area. Perttula et al.
(1995) suggest that the presence of Caddo ceramics within the region can potentially address
important issues relating to the local and extra-local trade and exchange between Caddo
horticulturalist/agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers as well as perceived expansions in Caddo
land use patterns.
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool Site at Joe Pool Lake have yielded evidence of housing structures,
roasting pits, sand and grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
suggest a habitation date of the late twelveth century or early thirteenth century. Present
evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddo influence, but rather a
significant change in subsistence strategies during a middle phase of the Late Prehsitoric (Peter
and McGregor 1988).

3.5.1 Deep East Texas
Formative Caddo Period and Early Caddo Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddo (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddo periods (ca. AD
1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and smaller
tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were primarily
chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent settlements
that included structures, middens, pits, and cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and ceramics
were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads with
rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities, such as the George C. Davis Site on the Neches River, have
also been encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddo period
and continue through the Middle Caddo period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddo sites (Perttula 2004).
Middle Caddo Period
The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD
1200–1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements
with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddo period. One example of such a site
is the Oak Hill Village in Rusk County (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens,

25

Chapter 3

Cultural History

and public structures. Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of
dependence on maize and other crops until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).
Late Caddo Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddo sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches river basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddo-period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities or smaller farmsteads, both with
associated cemeteries. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily
used from AD 1400–1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound
shaft burials continued until 1650–1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples that lived in the northeastern portion of the Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur
and Sabine rivers. These Caddo peoples lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society.
They constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with
status-ranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titus
Phase sites are usually found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and
permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).
Historic Caddo Period
The Historic Caddo period (ca. AD 1680–1860) is defined as the sustained European presence
in and occupation of the Caddo area. It is during this period that the Caddo and all other Native
American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were eventually moved from Texas to
the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the region were small farmsteads and
hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities were composed of many of these
farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts recovered from these sites include a wide
variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone, stone, and wooden tools. European
goods are commonly found on Historic Caddo sites after ca. AD 1740 and include guns and
gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and
silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).

3.5.2 North-Central Texas
Henrietta Focus
The Henrietta Focus was defined by archeologists in 1946 during the excavations of the Harrell
Site in Young County. This focus is the earlier of two Late Prehistoric II phases within the Upper
Trinity Watershed (Skinner 1985). The archeological picture surrounding the Henrietta Focus
is incomplete and poorly understood (Boyd 1997). The most general trait defining this focus
26

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

was a dual dependence on maize agriculture and hunting. Direct evidence for a heavy reliance
on agriculture is present through the remains of cultivated maize, charred corn cobs, bison
scapula and skull hoe blades and digging sticks, possible perforated and unperforated mussel
shells hoes, and unlined food storage pits (Krieger 1946; Price 1993). Less direct evidence
includes a selective settlement pattern pertaining to large, permanent or semi-permanent sites
within sandy areas more apt for cultivating agriculture (Price 1993). Lynott (1977) further
speculates that village sites were utilized during the growing season in the spring and summer
months, and temporarily abandoned during the fall and winter when the villages disbanded into
smaller groups focused on hunting and foraging (Price 1993). Faunal evidence points to bison
as the primary animal hunted, in addition deer, antelope, and a variety of smaller terrestrial and
aquatic animals. Besides the distinct economic practices utilized by Henrietta focus groups, the
cultural remains associated with the focus include house depressions with support postholes,
side-notched and stemmed arrow points (Washita, Fresno, Perdiz, and Harrell), snub-nosed
scrapers, side scrapers, chert and bone tools, awls made from flakes, beads, Nocona Plain
pottery, intrusive lithic material, and human burials (Boyd 1997; Krieger 1946; Nickels 2002;
Price 1993).

The period of 400–200 BP (AD 1600–1800) in north-central Texas is referred to as the
Protohistoric period. From the late AD 1500s, Europeans entered Texas only sporadically and
did not settle there until around AD 1700 (Webb and Carroll 1952). First European contact
on the Texas coast most likely began with the landing of Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez
expedition survivors in 1528. Reliable historical information for the Trinity River basin during
the Protohistoric period is somewhat limited, and it is not well understood which aboriginal
groups resided in north-central Texas during this period. Limited data suggest that Caddo
language speakers, possibly members of the Wichita Confederacy, occupied the area. Caddo
groups, including the Kichai, Ionis, and Tonkawa Indians, are known to occupy the lands
within north Texas. Tribes consisting of the Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and
Kichai are believed to have entered the Southern Plains in an effort to avoid hostile groups
like the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:904). Groups with more abbreviated occupation in this
region include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. More sedentary Plains Villagers of
the Wichita Confederacy tended to leave behind a more substantial archeological presence.
These materials typically included arrow points (Fresno, Harrell, and Washita types), thick end
scrapers, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison hoes, elbow pipes, Womak Engraved
pottery, metal knives, horse tack, shot, kettle fragments, trade beads, and various European
ceramics.

Archeological Site Potential

The proposed IPL alignment has the potential to encounter archeological sites in a variety of
topographic and geographic settings. This section summarizes the potential for archeological
sites to be present within both the upland and lowland settings for each physiographic region
traversed by the proposed alignment.

Cultural History

3.6.1 Interior Coastal Plains
Within the Interior Coastal Plain, the potential for archeological sites was variable across the
topography. Based on official soil series descriptions, upland soils within the project area range
from 6–84 inches thick and are derived from Holocene-age eolian or colluvial processes (Soil
Survey Staff 2010). These soils had high potential to contain archeological resources and were
subject to a full pedestrian archeological survey, which included subsurface shovel testing.
Several stream or river crossings within the project area are located within the Interior Coastal
Plains physiographic region. These stream or river crossings have the potential to contain
deposits that could remain undetected by a pedestrian survey or from shovel testing. Backhoe
trenching provides the most efficient method for establishing the presence or absence of deeply
buried deposits. Crossings that were considered to have a high potential for deeply buried
archeological deposits were at Coon Creek, Walnut Creek, and the Trinity River. Crossings that
were considered to have a moderate potential for containing deeply buried deposits were Caddo
Creek, Catfish Creek, Mill Run, Cedar Creek, and Rush Creek. Several of the crossings (e.g.,
Trinity River, Coon Creek, Rush Creek, and Cedar Creek) were investigated with backhoes

3.6.2 Blackland Prairies
The gently rolling uplands of the Blackland Prairies contain soils with extremely high amounts
of clay, known as ultraclay soils. “Sites formed in these soils are subject to extreme disruption
through soil process (pedoturbation)” (Collins 2004:108). The Blacklands are dominated by
the Houston Black series, which have the potential to form gilgai. Gilgai refers to the rolling
vertical movement of soil that can affect deposits up to two meters below the ground surface
(Collins 2004). Thus, these soils have little potential for intact deeply buried cultural deposits
and were adequately investigated through surface survey and limited shovel testing.
Unlike the upland soils, which can be surface surveyed, the Blacklands contain several stream
crossings that through time have deposited large amounts of sediment and have the potential
for containing deeply buried cultural resources. Stream or river crossings that are considered
to have a high potential for deeply buried deposits include Cummins Creek and Waxahatchie
Creek. Crossings that were considered to have a moderate potential to contain deeply buried
deposits include Mountain Creek and Walnut Creek. Cummins and Waxahachie Creeks were
surveyed with backhoe trenching.

3.6.3 Grand Prairie
A small percentage of the proposed pipeline corridor crosses through the Grand Prairies
physiographic region. The gradually sloping layers of the cuesta topography within this region
contain “thin soil over resistant limestone” (Diggs et al. 1999:51). Due to the shallowness of
the limestone bedrock within the uplands, these soils have little potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits and were adequately investigated through surface survey and shovel testing
only. However, more recent terrace and stream alluvial deposits, which contain low to moderate
amounts of disturbance, provide the best potential for deeply buried cultural veneers. Stream

crossings with high potential for containing deeply buried cultural deposits include Village
Creek and Deer Creek.

3.7 	Previous Archeological Investigations
3.7.1 Investigations within the IPL Corridor
According to the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), at least 18 archeological surveys have been previously
conducted within the 450-foot wide evaluation corridor at the time of the initial background
study in 2010 (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). Fourteen of these were linear surveys for transmission
lines, roadways, pipelines or similar projects that have crossed the current project area. Four
of the projects were block surveys. Of the 18 surveys, four were conducted in the 1970s, six in
the 1980s, six in the 1990s, one since 2000, and one is undated.

3.7.2 Investigations within One Mile of the APE Centerline
At least 106 previous archeological investigations have occurred within one mile of the
centerline of the 150-foot wide direct effects APE. These include 39 linear surveys (for roads,
pipelines, transmission lines, etc.) and 67 areal (or “block”) surveys. These occurred as early as
1931 although most (about 75 percent) are more recent surveys, dating within the last 30 years.

3.8	Known Cultural Resources
Below is a summary of the previously-identified cultural resources within one mile of the
centerline of the 150-foot wide direct affects APE (henceforth called the “background study
area”) at the time of permit application. The pipeline has changed repeatedly during the two
years of survey and some resources are now no longer within the original list of adjacent
sites. The summary below does, however, provide an useful summary of the general cultural
resource trends expected overall.

3.8.1 National Register Properties
No listed National Register Properties are located within the background study area.

3.8.2 Cemeteries
One cemetery is located within the background study area in close proximity to the current
project centerline (see Figure 3.2). The Mankin Cemetery (HE C070) is positioned about
one-half mile southwest of the proposed Cedar Creek Pump Station, in Henderson County.
According to engineering plans, the known cemetery boundary does lie within the 450-foot
evaluation corridor but outside of the proposed final 150-foot permanent easement (see Chapter

9). The cemetery contains headstones that date from the 1890s through the early twentieth
century (Jasinski 2012; see Chapter 9).
The IPL corridor was shifted to avoid the historic-age Saint Paul Cemetery (see Figure 3.2)
near its western terminus (see Chapter 5). An additional 30 cemeteries are located within the
background study area. None of these will be affected by the currently proposed route of the
pipeline.

3.8.3 Historic Buildings
No historic buildings have been recorded within 450-foot evaluation corridor. However, at least
five historic buildings have been recorded within the background study area during previous
neighborhood surveys. The historical significance of these buildings has not been established
but none of these buildings will be affected by the currently proposed route of the pipeline.
1) The Murray House, located at 4945 Rendon Road in southern Fort Worth, is a
stone vernacular structure built in 1934.
2) The First Presbyterian Church in Crowley is a wood-frame vernacular structure
dating to 1897.
3) The Dutch Branch Ranch in southern Fort Worth is an eclectic/colonial revival
style residence built in 1935.
4) The Dingnum-Adams House in Kennedale is a pueblo revival style structure
built in 1936.
5) An unnamed residence at 3571 St. Paul Road in southern Fort Worth is an
historic structure built in 1890.

3.8.4 Historic Markers
One historic marker is located within the 450-foot evaluation corridor. This marker (#10369)
commemorates the Owen Cemetery, named for David Allen Owen who served as County
Judge from 1860–1869. The Owen Cemetery has marked graves ranging from 1873–1947.
While the historic marker is within the 450-foot evaluation corridor, the cemetery itself is
located more than 850 feet (260 meters) from the proposed IPL centerline and is not within the
direct or indirect effects APE.
An additional 14 historic markers are located within the background study area. These
commemorate six churches, five cemeteries, a city park, a railroad depot and the location of
the final review of the last Confederate military unit (Table 3.1). None of these markers will be
affected by the currently proposed route of the pipeline.

investigations for the IPL project. The results
of these investigations can be found in the
individual county chapters (Chapters 5–10). During the revisits, no evidence was found that
would recommend the sites for inclusion to the NRHP or for listing as a SAL.
1. Site 41AN10 is a prehistoric campsite recorded in the 1930s with a possible Caddo
burial.
2. Site 41AN11, also recorded in the 1930s, is a Late Prehistoric occupation site. A whole
ceramic vessel was recovered at its recording, suggesting possible Caddo burials may
have be present.
3. Site 41AN16 is another prehistoric habitation site and possible Caddoan burial. The site
was excavated in 1935 and one ceramic vessel from the location is curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
4. Site 41HE199 is a historic homesite and trash scatter. No standing structures were
present at the time of the recording, but further investigation was recommended.

Research and Field Methods
The IPL cultural resource survey involved a significant effort in all phases of the investigation
including prefield archival review, field survey, data management, and post-field analysis and
reporting. Being such an integral component of the overall pipeline design process, it was
essential that data were up-to-date, accurate, and most-importantly transferrable between the
specialists and the TRWD engineers. This chapter summarizes those methods employed by the
AmaTerra cultural resource specialists from the earliest background review phases, through
field investigations, client coordination, and report preparation.

4.1	Prefield Analysis and Background Review
To formulate an accurate image of the proposed pipeline corridor and its potential for containing
cultural resources, archeologists and architectural historians consulted a variety of archival
and online sources. Though a 100-percent survey methodology was proposed (rather than
selective survey of high-probability areas), a significant amount of preparatory information was
gathered prior to starting the first survey transect to help improve accuracy. The AmaTerra team
consulted the Atlas maintained by the THC to identify previously-recorded cultural resources
in the project vicinity including archeological sites, historical markers, properties listed on the
NRHP, and historic cemeteries, and mapped those resources in relation to the then-proposed
pipeline corridor. Previously conducted surveys (also available through the Atlas) were also
mapped (see Chapter 3). These data assisted in identifying those portions of the pipeline that
have already been investigated and found to be devoid of sites or those areas that were known
as site-rich while also characterizing the types of sites that may be found in a given location.
The pipeline’s physiographic setting also has a significant impact on archeological field crews’
expectations of the cultural landscape within the survey corridor. The Geologic Atlas of Texas
developed by the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas was consulted to
identify pipeline segments that were within ancient landforms and those areas that crossed
more recent, Holocene-age floodplains (Fisher 1992). Soils summarized in the USDA’s Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson County Soil Surveys were consulted to gather
more detailed information about soil formation processes, anticipated depths and compositions
of those sediments, and the potential archeological site context and preservation within those
soils (USDA 2012). Soil and geology data were particularly important in identifying those
portions of the proposed pipeline that had the highest potential to impact deep, Holocene-age
sediments that would require backhoe trenching in addition to shovel testing.
Finally modern and historic maps were consulted to assess the topographic setting and identify
structural locations. All of these data were combined to provide the team with a model of the
archeological site potential and setting for the full pipeline corridor; the areas most likely to be
disturbed, the likely site locations and composition for a given segment, the areas that would

require mechanical trenching to supplement surface survey and shovel testing, and the overall
scale of effort that would best identify those resources.
Along with similar review of THC Atlas datasets (NRHP-listed properties, historical markers,
cemeteries, Registered Texas Historical Landmarks [RTHLs], etc.), AmaTerra’s historical
resource team also consulted a variety of maps to identify those buildings along the corridor
that were likely historic-age and would require field inspection. Historic highway maps
available through the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), historic US Geological
Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangles accessed through the Perry Castañeda Library
at the University of Texas at Austin, and 1940s-era aerial photographs compiled by TRWD
representatives specifically for this project were compared to modern aerial images to identify
those structures that were likely constructed before 1966, 50 years prior to the proposed letting
date. Additionally, the various counties’ central appraisal district data (available online) were
integral in refining the construction dates for many of the structures flagged as potentially
historic-age.

4.2	Right of Entry and Parcel Access Coordination
When coordination and planning began for the IPL cultural resource survey, the proposed
pipeline crossed 857 individual parcels. TRWD identified and contacted parcel owners and
negotiated access for the various environmental and engineering survey crews associated with
the project. To keep the list of affected landowners (and the subsequent need to contact them
and negotiate access) at its lowest level, right of entry was only pursued in parcels that at least
partially overlapped the proposed 150-foot permanent pipeline easement. Parcel boundaries
most often crossed both the 150-foot direct effects APE and 450-foot indirect effects APE;
however, if parcels were within the 450-foot evaluation corridor but not the smaller proposed
permanent easement, those landowners were not contacted and access was never negotiated. In
those locations survey was limited to the edge of the accessible adjacent parcel only.
This protocol continued through the pipeline’s numerous revisions, with the list of contacted
landowners and affected parcels changing with new areas added and abandoned corridors
taken away. While the final tally of affected parcels was close to the original at 864, a total of
1,134 different parcels were viable for survey at one point or another during the investigations.
Though TRWD staff made all initial contacts with landowners, AmaTerra staff contacted those
individuals who had requested advance notice. Additionally, backhoe trenching protocols were
discussed with all private landowners prior to access. In a very small percentage of those
parcels accessed (less than 5 percent), landowners did not permit subsurface investigation.
These parcels were visually inspected from the surface and assessed (relative to nearby fullyaccessible parcels) for their potential for containing significant, intact archeological deposits
and cultural resource recommendations were based upon those observations only. In some
instances (approximately 70 parcels), access was not granted or was not necessary for full
cultural resource assessment. The land was assessed from nearby observation points and found
to have a low potential for containing significant resources as a result of ground disturbances
and/or a comparison with adjacent parcels. All of the parcels within the final proposed
36

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

permanent easement have been adequately investigated by the cultural resource teams, and
there are no parcels requiring additional survey work due to lack of access.

4.3

Geographic Information System (GIS)

As is common for modern environmental resource work, the IPL project had a significant
Geographic Information System (GIS) component. All pipeline data and spatial representations
of background and field information were compiled and referenced through the project’s
dedicated GIS. GIS data were used to generate field maps, identify high- and low-probability
areas, and to deliver field data to the pipeline design team as they prepared corridor revisions
(see below). Survey progress was tracked through an integrated geo-database designed and
maintained by the Principal Investigator through Microsoft Access (Figure 4.1). This database
was used to track changes in rights-of-entry, record archeological and historical survey progress
by parcel, and identified resources both in tabular form natively through Access and spatially
through GIS.

4.4

Archeological Field Methods

4.4.1 Surface Survey and Transect Shovel Testing
Because the evaluation corridor was 450-feet wide, it was was treated as a large area survey rather
than a linear survey. This distinction was outlined in the research design for the archeological
permit application and approved by all of the stakeholders (Appendix B). Following the
approved minimum survey standards, the AmaTerra team conducted a surface survey of the full
pipeline corridor (both the 150-foot permanent easement and the 450-foot evaluation corridor)

noting those observations in their field notes and online in the crew chiefs’ daily survey journal

Archeologists generally spaced shovel tests at a 140-meter interval within each transect and
staggered tests between adjacent transects for maximum coverage. Shovel test frequency was
increased or decreased depending on field conditions, archeological probability, and evidence

of previous disturbance.
For example, while dense
riparian terraces along a
waterway in Henderson
County would be shovel
tested frequently, plowed,
shallow uplands in the
vicinity of Mansfield would
often be surveyed primarily
through surface inspection
alone. Repeated parcel visits
in reroute surveys also saw
varied shovel test intervals

observations from previous
investigations to the new
routes (Figure 4.4). Area

sites such as balancing
reservoirs or pump stations
were conducted in more standard area survey intensity at a rate of one test per three acres.
Each shovel test was recorded by Crew (letter; A-H), Survey Parcel (number; 1-XXX), Transect
(letter; A-F), and Shovel Test on that transect (number; 1-XXX). As an example, Shovel Test
B418D239 would indicate that the test was dug by a member of Crew B, working on Parcel
418 along the “D” transect, and that the test was the 239th along that transect for the entire
survey.
Since the pipeline route changed often throughout the course of survey, many parcels were
visited and revisited multiple times to assess newly-revised corridor segments. In instances
where the 150-foot proposed easement remained within the originally-surveyed 450-foot
evaluaton corridor, surveyors did not need to reassess the revised segment. However, if the
proposed revised corridor extended beyond the original survey area, teams would most often
revisit the parcel and assess the new route in the same manner as the original route. Occasionally
these segments were not revisited if previous observations in the vicinity indicated disturbance
or a very low potential for containing intact deposits. In some instances, the pipeline design
teams relied on environmental crews to define a ‘safe’ route through a particularly resourcerich corridor (as depicted on Figure 1.2). These route-finding efforts largely followed area
survey standards though often crews tightened their shovel testing intervals in certain highprobability areas to gather the highest resolution data where it was most relevant.
Each shovel test was excavated by hand in roughly 20-centimeter intervals to: 1) the
predetermined maximum depth of 80 centimeters, 2) to clearly visible, sterile subsoil or
bedrock, or 3) to evidence of disturbance; whichever was reached first. Soils were screened
through ¼-inch hardware cloth whenever possible, though dense and/or sticky clays that did

Survey Methods

not pass through easily were hand-sorted. Non-site shovel test locations and observations were
recorded on standardized logs and mapped using hand-held Delorme PN-series or Trimble
GeoExplorer hand-held GPS units. Each test record included observations for topographic
location, soil stratigraphy, evidence of disturbance, and any artifacts observed. Once recording
was complete, each test was immediately backfilled.

4.4.2 Backhoe Trenching
Trenching locations were originally selected by examining USGS topographic quadrangles
in conjunction with county soil data. Each location was digitized into the IPL GIS database.
Since soil maps are intended for use as a general approximation of the actual conditions of an
area, additional observations by the field crew refined the initially targeted trenching candidate
locations. Shovel test data, evidence of disturbance, and prevailing topographic setting served
to remove some candidate locations from trenching while other locations were added as a result
of survey. The Field Director most often visually inspected all proposed trenching locales when
a crew was scheduled to survey the area during pedestrian survey. By using shovel testing data
combined with the Field Director’s observations a final field-verified assessment was made.
Within a confirmed trenching candidate parcel, archeologists generally placed trenches along
the proposed pipeline centerline at roughly 300–400-meter intervals. If trenches were in
close proximity to a waterway, the trench was oriented perpendicular to the stream course.
Less emphasis was placed on orientation of trenches within broad floodplain environments.
Following Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHA) Safety standards, trenches
were initially excavated to a depth of four feet and recorded in detail at that depth. Benches
were then added on either side to allow surveyors access to deeper portions of the excavation.
Deeper than approximately seven feet, all trenches were observed from the ground surface and
were no longer entered. Each trench was terminated at either sterile subsoil or bedrock, or at
the backhoe’s maximum depth. Normally, the backhoe’s maximum reach was approximately
11 feet (3.3 meters). For trenching along the Trinity River, where extremely deep deposits
were anticipated, a custom boom extension manufactured specifically for this survey by the
backhoe contractor was used. This boom increased the maximum depth to approximately 15
feet (Figure 4.5). In select instances, the backhoe could be further lowered by skimming down
a lower excavation platform and tilting the machine downward.
Sample buckets from each stratum were set aside from the backfill dirt for screening and/or
closer observation. The general backfill dirt was also visually inspected as it was removed.
Each trench was recorded by stratigraphic level, noting depth, soil consistency, color, possible
inclusions, disturbances, and a variety of other details. Given the geographic scale of the
effort, the research team saw an opportunity for broad geomorphological assessment of the
pipeline’s many stream crossings. As such, roughly half of the trenches were observed and
recorded in detail by consulting geomorphologists Charles Frederick and Brittany Gregory.
Their observations and data are summarized within the report body and presented in full as
Appendix D.

4.4.3

Isolated Finds

At each positive shovel test
or surface find, survey crews
conducted initial cruciform
shovel testing spaced at
roughly 15-meter intervals (called Off Transect tests, or “OT”s). If no additional artifacts were
observed as a result of cruciform tests, or the finds’ surficial components were clearly isolated
historic-aged trash, the find was considered an isolate and given an “IF” number tagged to
crew and parcel (i.e., C520IF1 is the first isolated find in Parcel 520 for Crew C). If additional
tests or features were observed, the resource was considered an archeological site and subject
to more detailed recording.

4.4.4 Site Recording
Once identified, archeological field crews recorded sites following standard recording
protocols outlined in the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards. At a minimum virtually all
sites were investigated through additional shovel tests (a minimum of six tests each; Figure
4.6). Field notes and photographs were collected while site data was recorded on standardized
TexSite forms. Site boundaries (both horizontal and vertical) were defined through subsurface
tests, extent of surface deposits, and topographic observation. Many of the prehistoric sites in
topographically-varied contexts were more accurately defined by changes in the landform than
shovel test observations alone. Whenever permitted by the landowner, significant sites were
‘chased’ outward beyond the survey corridor in an effort to identify its boundaries and assist
in selecting a revised pipeline route. Locational information (features, fencelines, shovel tests,
etc.) were recorded within sites to sub-meter accuracy using Trimble’s GeoExplorer X-series
GPS units and hand-drawn field maps.
In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts were collected during field survey.
When observed, all artifacts (or a representative sample thereof) were recorded through field
notes, drawings, and/or photographs then returned to their find location. Historic-age sites

Fieldwork
for

historic-age
resources was conducted
separately from, but in
coordination with, the archeological survey. Prior to any fieldwork, AmaTerra historians
examined the Atlas to identify any previously recorded properties listed in the NRHP, as SALs,
or designated as RTHLs. AmaTerra staff looked at historical imagery to determine the age
of any above-ground structures and to also understand the spatial patterns of development
throughout the project area. Local residents, historians, and secondary sources (including The
Dallas Morning News’ Texas Almanac and previous survey reports located within or near the
project area) were utilized to gain a general knowledge of the area’s historical background and
various histories of Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson counties.
Using standards accepted by the THC, AmaTerra staff established a cut-off date for historic age
resources (determined as those being 50 years or older) of 1966. The historic resource survey
team then attempted to locate all of the historic-age resources within the 450-foot evaluation
corridor. In addition, areas within the viewshed of proposed above-ground structures (pump
stations, etc.) were given a half-mile buffer around the outside edge of the facility area and this
was used as the APE for indirect effects. Thus, the study area for historic resources includes
the 450-foot evaluation corridor for the pipeline and the half-mile area surrourding all facility
sites.
In the field, architectural historians visited each predicted historic structure location and
observed/briefly documented each identified historic-age structure then moved on to the next
resource. Documentation included field notes and photographs. All identified resources were
numbered by county, parcel, and resource number. As an example: resource number NV201-2 is
the second resource recorded within Parcel 201, which is in Navarro County. In some instances,
historic-age structures were identified within parcels that had not been previously numbered by
42

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

TRWD. Rather than assigning new parcel numbers, such resources were linked to the closest
numbered parcel and given an “a” to indicate it is adjacent to that parcel (ie. NV201a-1 would
be adjacent to Parcel 201 rather than within it). County designations followed those used by
the archeology team except Tarrant (TN) and Henderson (HN) Counties.

4.5.2 Post-Field Documentation
Following fieldwork, architectural historians worked closely with the Principal Investigator to
identify and digitize the location of all identified historic-age resources in GIS and enter field
observation data into the project database along with representative resource photographs.
Historic-age resources that did not fall within the 450-foot APE of the final alignment or the
half-mile indirect effects APE of the proposed facility sites (with the exception of the existing
proposed KBR site) were separated out and not evaluated for NRHP eligiblity. This includes all
identified historic-age resources that fall within the project area of the Future Action.

4.6	Resource Evaluation Criteria
4.6.1 NRHP Evaluation Criteria
In order to be considered for listing in the NRHP, buildings, structures, objects, sites, and
districts must meet standards of significance defined by the Keeper of the National Register (36
CFR 60). Each property must be evaluated within the framework of its historic context and it
must retain characteristics that make it a good representative of properties associated with that
aspect of the past. The NRHP Criteria for Evaluation state that:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location, setting, design, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a) Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction; or
d) Have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history.

Survey Methods

Criterion A
A resource that is representative of an important trend or event may be eligible for the NRHP
under Criterion A. This broad definition provides flexibility when determining the kinds of
significant historical associations. However, a property is not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP simply because it was built during an important era in history or if it fulfilled its historic
role. In order for a property to be eligible for Criterion A, it must be significant under one or
more defined historic context(s), convey a sense of the past, and remain recognizable to the
period in which it was first constructed or achieved significance.
Criterion B
Criterion B applies to properties associated with individuals whose specific contributions to
history can be identified and documented. However, it is important to determine not only what
contributions are associated with the individual and how they compare with those of other
persons, but also how the property represents or is linked to that individual and his or her
accomplishments. The extent and duration of that association is particularly important for
determining NRHP eligibility. Moreover, the significance of that person must be associated
with the contextual themes defined in this report. Properties significant under NRHP Criterion
B should be those most closely associated with a person who has made important contributions
to the past, be associated with the person during the time he or she achieved significance, and
convey a strong sense of the past and remain recognizable to the period in which the person
achieved significance.
Criterion C
Properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C derive significance from the physical
qualities of their design, construction, and/or craftsmanship, including such elements as
architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, and art. To be eligible under Criterion C, a
property must embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction;
represent the work of a master; possess high artistic value; or represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction (a historic district). A
property significant under Criterion C is one that clearly represents a noteworthy example of a
defined property type, dates from the period of significance of one or more historic context(s),
and exhibits the character-defining features of its property type. Therefore, a property must
retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as having a relation to the historic context.
Criterion D
The last of the four NRHP Criteria deals with the significance of resources that have the
potential to yield important information about the past. Criterion D is applied most often to
archeological resources, but it also may be used to evaluate the significance of extant buildings
and structures. Properties significant under this criterion are those that have the ability to yield
important historic information, such as a rare type of construction. In order for these types of
properties to be eligible under Criterion D, they must themselves be, or must have been, the
principal source of the important information, such as how construction expertise affected
44

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

the evolution of local building development. Due to the nature of the reconnaissance level
survey, evaluation under Criterion D is generally excluded unless historians feel a particular
property warrants additional investigation or consideration. Alternatively, Criterion D is most
often used by archeologists to evaluate prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites for thier
NRHP eligibility.
Criteria Considerations
On occasion, certain types of resources are also evaluated that are not normally considered
eligible for the NRHP. These resources include religious properties, structures moved from
original locations, birthplaces and graves, cemeteries, reconstructed buildings, commemorative
properties, and properties achieving significance within the last fifty years. These properties
can qualify for inclusion in the NRHP if they meet specific Criteria Considerations, in addition
to meeting the regular requirements.
a) A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic
distinction or historical importance; or
b) A building or structure removed from its original location but which is
significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure
most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or
c) A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there
is no appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive
life; or
d) A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of
transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from
association with historic events; or
e) A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment
and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and
when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; or
f) A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or
symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or
g) A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional
importance.
Seven Aspects of Integrity
In addition to being significant under one or more of the criteria listed above, a NRHP-eligible
property must also retain historic integrity of those features necessary to convey its significance
(US Department of the Interior 1998:3). The Keeper of the National Register has identified
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

45

Chapter 4

Survey Methods

and defined seven aspects of integrity by which potential candidates for the NRHP must be
measured (US Department of the Interior 1998:44-45):
•

Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the
historic event occurred.

•

Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure, and
style of a property.

•

Setting is the physical environment of a historic property.

•

Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular
period of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a historic property.

•

Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture of people
during any given period in history or prehistory.

•

Feeling is a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period
of time.

•

Association is the direct link between an important historic event, person, or period and
a historic property.

Determining which of these aspects of integrity are most important to a particular property
requires knowing why, where and when the property is significant (US Department of the
Interior 1998:48). For Criteria A or B eligibility, the aspects of location, feeling, setting, and
association take on greater importance in determining a property’s integrity. To be eligible
under these criteria, a property must be able to clearly convey its significant associations with
the historic context. This often requires that a property’s overall environment remain relatively
unaltered from its period of significance. Properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C
must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as retain some relation to the historic
context. The most important aspects of integrity for Criterion C eligibility are location, design,
materials, workmanship, and feeling.
At a minimum, a property eligible under Criteria A or B must retain its basic original form that
identifies its property type and must be generally recognizable to its period of significance.
However, the significance of properties under Criteria A or B is not derived mainly from their
design or construction value. Therefore, a greater amount of alteration to a building’s historic
physical features is allowable when compared to the more stringent standards set for Criterion
C eligibility. Some minor alterations to the physical fabric of the building do not necessarily
preclude Criterion C eligibility, although they may result in some loss of integrity. Such
acceptable alterations could include replacement of roof materials or replacement of a minority
of exterior doors and windows within the original fenestration pattern of the building. In some
cases, non-historic outbuildings or landscape features could also be considered acceptable
modifications to the property, if they are visually unobtrusive and compatible in design and
scale with the original building and its setting. Major changes to a building’s roofline, form,
or overall massing are generally considered unacceptable, and would render a building not
eligible under NRHP Criteria A, B, and C.

4.6.2 Rural Historic Landscapes
The Department of the Interior defines a rural historic landscape as “a geographical area that
historically has been used by people, or shaped or modified by human activity, occupancy,
or intervention, and that possesses a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of areas
of land use, vegetation, buildings and structures, roads and waterways, and natural features.”
They commonly reflect the lives of those engaged in agricultural pursuits such as farming,
ranching, or fishing, but not necessarily so. Rural historic landscapes are defined by eleven
characteristics:
• Land use and activities are the major human forces that shape and organize rural
communities.
• Patterns of spatial organization define the relationships among major physical
components, predominant landforms, and natural features.
• Responses to the natural environment are reflected in the siting of buildings,
construction materials, and the location of clusters of buildings and structures, as well
as traditions in land use, construction methods, and social customs.
• Cultural traditions in the form of religious beliefs, social customs, ethnic identity, and
trades and skills may be evident today in both physical features and uses of the land.
• Circulation networks are systems for transporting people, goods, and raw materials
from one point to another, varying in size from footpaths to railroad lines.
• Boundary demarcations delineate areas of ownership and land use through the use of
fences, walls, tree lines, hedgerows, drainage or irrigation ditches, roadways, creeks,
and rivers.
• Vegetation related to land use includes not only crops, trees, or shrubs planted for
agricultural and ornamental purposes, but also trees that have grown up incidentally
along fence lines, beside roads, or in abandoned fields.
• Buildings, structures, and objects are the various types of buildings, structures, and
objects serve human needs related to the occupation and use of the land.
• Clusters are groupings of like features resulting from function, social tradition,
climate, or other influences, cultural or natural.
• Archeological sites may provide valuable information about the ways the land has
been used, patterns of social history, or the methods and extent of activities such as
shipping, milling, lumbering, or quarrying.
• Small-scale elements such as foot bridges, sign posts, or hay bales add to the historic
setting of a rural landscape, and may be characteristic of a region.
Rural historic landscapes follow the same general guidelines for evaluation as other properties
under the criteria, although due to their complex nature they are commonly significant under
more than one of the criteria and may have to meet one or more of the Criteria Considerations
depending on the composition of contributing elements. Rural historic landscapes must also
retain sufficient integrity to convey their significance. While no landscape will appear exactly
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

47

Chapter 4

Survey Methods

as it did during the historic period due to their variable and mutable nature, the landscape must
retain the general character and feeling of the historic period. Which aspects of integrity must
be retained will vary depending on the reasons behind the landscapes’ significance, but in
general the aspects of setting, feeling, and association are particularly important.

4.6.3 SAL Evaluation Criteria
In addition to the National Register evaluation criteria outlined above, the ACT allows for
archeological resources to be evaluated for significance at the state level as SALs. According
to the ACT, any site located on state-owned land may be considered a SAL if it meets any of
the formal designation criteria (13 Texas Antiquities Code [TAC] 26.8):
1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2) the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the state are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the
site;
3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history
4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could
occur and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal
protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the
effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

4.7 Client Coordination and Daily/Monthly Progress Tracking
Due to the fluid nature of the pipeline planning process, the environmental data gathered in the
field (of which cultural resources were one part) needed to be updated and available for design
team access at any time. As a result, AmaTerra’s survey progress and field observations had to
be accessible and updated frequently even though surveyors (particularly archeologists) worked
for extended periods away from the main office. For the historic resource survey, the teams
were typically able to update progress data frequently enough to meet design teams’ needs;
however, the archeology team utilized electronic data and online tools to keep all field and
office personnel connected and up-to-date. At the end of the archeological survey day, each
crew chief completed a daily survey progress report online through the Google Docs program
(Figure 4.7). The report included summaries of parcels visited, observations, sites recorded,
etc. These data were then accessed by office staff and transcribed into the survey tracking
database and, in turn, automatically integrated into the project GIS.
Through this system, the Principal Investigator (who reviewed virtually all of the survey
progress data) was able to keep informed of the observations and request additional data almost
immediately after fieldwork was completed. A tabular summary of the completed Daily Progress

Report forms is provided in Appendix C. Scanned archeological site forms, GPS data, digital
photographs and other materials were also electronically maintained through a proprietary
Dropbox account, which could be accessed by field and office personnel and consulted through
mobile devices in progress update meetings with TRWD and FNI (see below).
All environmental data gathered in the field was provided to TRWD engineers at TRWD through
monthly progress meetings attended by representatives of the environmental survey teams
(including AmaTerra) and TRWD. At these meetings each parcel visited during the previous
month was reviewed by all meeting attendees with crews exchanging recommendations,
observations, and other relevant information. From a cultural resource perspective, this data
often included detailed recommendations for avoidance, supplements to field information, and
other data relevant to alternative planning (where applicable). In rare instances, such as small
shifts next to previously-surveyed and site-free parcels or pipeline segments through clearly
disturbed areas, etc., parcels were not directly accessed and were, in these meetings, considered
very low probability for significant cultural resources and recommended cleared through this
desktop review only.
All recorded archeological sites and isolates were electronically given a 50-foot buffer around
the perimeter while historic resources were not. TRWD representatives invariably erred on the
side of caution when considering impacts to cultural resources. Any site identified with the
potential of meeting the NRHP and/or SAL criteria outlined above was avoided by re-route
in consultation with the archeologists and historians at these meetings with the edge of the
proposed permanent easement not crossing the 50-foot archeological site buffer or the historic
structure’s footprint.

4.8	Laboratory
All artifacts observed in the field were recorded on site and returned to their find location. All
field-generated forms, notes, photographs, and other materials were organized and curated at
Texas State University’s Center for Archaeological Studies in San Marcos.

Results of Field Investigations
Tarrant County
Beginning at the western project terminus and moving east, Tarrant is the first county the IPL
project crosses (Figures 5.1–5.5). As with almost all counties along the proposed IPL pipeline
corridor, Tarrant County’s segment includes two stages of construction: the Proposed Action
and the Future Action (see Chapter 1). While the route and facility site locations have not been
finalized in Henderson and Anderson counties (see Chapters 9 and 10), the route presented
herein for Tarrant County is the finalized proposed APE, regardless of its implementation status.
Accordingly, the survey discussion will not be broken up into differing descriptions relative to
the corresponding action. With a final length of 20.8 miles of proposed pipeline and 119 acres
of facility sites, the majority of impacts in the area are limited to suburban or rural contexts.
Overall, archeologists and architectural historians surveyed 1,112 acres of the proposed IPL
project (including all abandoned alternative routes) within Tarrant County, documenting
five archeological sites, four archeological isolated finds, and 51 historic resources. Below
is a summary of the county’s environmental and historical background along with a survey
narrative and detailed descriptions of resources identified. It should be noted that the KBR site
falls within Tarrant County. However, as mentioned before, this project was an independent
action, separate from IPL, but was carried out under the same permit number. Accordingly, the
results of that survey are included in this report.

5.1 	Pipeline Description
5.1.1 Preferred Pipeline Route
As can be seen in Figures 5-1–5.5, the preferred IPL pipeline corridor begins as part of the
proposed Future Action at an existing TRWD water pipeline east of Old Granbury Road.
At this location, the proposed IPL pipeline will tie into the existing TRWD infrastructure
through the construction of a small (approximately 6 acres) proposed new pump facility to
be constructed in Parcels 1 and 2 then extend east in a long, tunneled segment (see Figure
1.3). Section 9 contains the only extended segment that is proposed to be installed entirely
through underground tunneling. This tunneled section joins West Risinger Road and continues
beneath that roadway for a distance of 3.7 miles before resuming open-cut trenching in Parcel
1038. Within this tunneled segment, the pipeline will be installed below ground at a depth
of approximately 35 feet. Small sending and receiving pits (n=3; each measuring less than
one acre) are proposed within the central median of West Risinger Road. Due to the lack
of potential for impacts to subsurface archeological deposits and its location within largely
disturbed suburban contexts, this segment was generally unsurveyed archeologically.

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

From Parcel 1038 to the county border to the east, Section 9 will be installed through opencut trenching for the remainder of the project corridor (with the exception of various small
road and waterway crossings). Heading first south, then east, the pipeline crosses fallow, open
pastures dotted with occasional well pads (see Parcel 47). The pipeline corridor crosses IH-35
W in the vicinity of Deer Creek then follows its floodplain through Parcel 67, when it rises
back to upland settings and continues east. At Rendon Road (Parcel 90), the proposed pipeline
shifts southeastward for a distance of approximately 3.1 miles before bending back toward the
northeast, where it meets Sections 10 and 11 at a “T”, moving north toward the KBR site. This
intersection also marks the transition to the proposed Proposed Action. Along this distance,
the pipeline passes primarily through smaller, densely-wooded residential lots associated with
communities in this area such as Rendon and Mansfield.
Moving north, Section 10 carries water over a distance of approximately 2.25 miles to the
Kennedale Balancing Reservoir Site (see below). Along this length, the pipeline will again be
installed through open-cut trenching, with the corridor crossing small, rural residential parcels
(Parcels 125–165). Section 11 continues approximately three miles southeast to the Tarrant/
Johnson County line at County Road 528. The proposed pipeline within this segment crosses
through less-developed, larger parcels as the pipeline moves away from the Fort Worth bedroom
communities and into the rural prairies of Johnson and Ellis Counties toward the south and
east. The first indications of sand mining are present within this portion of the pipeline as well.

5.1.2 KBR Facility Site (Independent Action)
As mentioned above, IPL Section 10’s northern terminus is the KBR, which will serve to
store and regulate water flow over periods of variable precipitation and pumping volume. The
proposed site, located north and west of Parcel 165, between Hudson Cemetery and Hudson
Village Creek Roads, measures approximately 119 acres in size. Within this location, proposed
project components include a large reservoir, a network of underground connecting pipelines,
above-ground utilities, access roads, and a maintenance office. As can be seen from Figures
5.6–5.7, approximately half of the KBR site is operational now and is composed of a large
(several stories tall and more than 200 feet thick) earthen berm that forms the main reservoir.
Much of the material for that berm was pulled from the proposed expansion site, which is
now a pond (Figure 5.8). This pond will be the proposed footprint for the additional reservoir
chambers for the KBR site which will proceed as an independent action from the main IPL
project.

5.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
The pipeline route within Tarrant County went through several earlier corridors as TRWD
and environmental specialists narrowed in on a preferred route. While several minor shifts
were evaluated to allow for avoidance or engineering requirements, some of the original route
segments differed more substantially. The western-most quarter (Parcels 4–39) of Section 9
was initially proposed for open-cut trenching, with the proposed route paralleling the current

route approximately 1.5 miles to the south. Several of these parcels were surveyed before the
route was eventually abandoned (including the now-tunneled segment through Parcels 3–5).
An alternative intersection was proposed for Sections 9–11, in Parcel 123, approximately onehalf mile south of its current location. While Sections 10 and 11 generally followed the same
route despite this shift, Section 9 extended southward and passed through several parcels that
are no longer proposed for impacts. At the northern terminus of Section 10, east of the KBR
site, environmental crews assisted in evaluating an appropriate connection route to the KBR
facility, surveying almost all of Parcels 164 and 165. Additional parcels were considered for
impacts (Parcels 924, 925, 927, 928, etc.), but abandoned prior to initiating fieldwork in the
area.
Almost all of Section 11 was initially proposed along a different route. Within Tarrant County,
the original route roughly paralleled the current corridor but ran approximately 600 meters to
its east, then diverged more substantially near the Johnson County line (see Figure 5.4).

5.2 	Environmental Summary
The project area within Tarrant County is located on the Benbrook, Primrose, Burleson, and
Mansfield 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles. The APE transects mostly rural tracts of land
with intermittent residential and commercial development. The project area crosses five named
creeks in Tarrant County, from east to west: Walnut Creek, Willow Branch, Village Creek,
Deer Creek, and Sycamore Creek.

5.2.1 Tarrant County Soil Summary
The 450-foot evaluation corridor crosses two geological groups within Tarrant County (the
Woodbine and undivided Washita) which contain four different formations (Fisher 1992). These
formations increase in geological age from east to west and include the Woodbine Formation
(Kwb), Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided (Kgm), Weno Limestone (Kpw),
and Duck Creek Formation (Diggs et al. 1999). Additionally, significant Fluviatile terrace
deposits (O+) and Alluvium (Qal) can be found along Village Creek and Walnut Creek. These
Holocene aged formations have high potential to contain deeply buried archeological deposits.
Thirty-three different soil types (Table 5.1) can be found within the APE. The majority of
soils represented within the 450-foot evaluation corridor and facility site footprints consist of
Sanger clay, Gasil fine sandy loam, Crosstell fine sandy loam, and Slidell clay.

5.2.2 Tarrant County Climate
The project area is located within two climatic environments the subtropical and continental
climatic environments. The subtropical environment is characteristically humid with hot
summers and the continental environment is characterized as having a wide range in annual
temperature extremes. Total annual precipitation is 32.1 inches, 59 percent of which usually
falls between April and September. Snowfall is not uncommon with 72 percent of the winters

The project area is located within the Texan Biotic Province as defined by Blair (1950). Typical
vegetation currently encountered within APE includes pecan (Carya illinoiensis), shumard
oak (Quercus shumardii), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), black walnut (Juglans cinera L.),
hackberry (Celtis spp.), bois d’arc (Maclura pomifera), buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides),
bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), and Texas prickly pear
(Opuntia lindheimeri) (Preston 1976).
Typical mammalian fauna commonly observed within this region include opossum (Didelphis
marsupialis), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and coyote (Canis latrans) (Davis
and Schmidly 1994).

5.2.4 Current Land Use
Tarrant County starts as farmland to the far west and becomes urban sprawl associated with the
City of Fort Worth and its surrounding suburbs east of Benbrook Lake. The land use continues
to be suburban agricultural communities dealing mostly with crops and uncleared pasture land
along the southern portion of the county below Fort Worth and Arlington.

5.3 	Historical Context
Tarrant County, much like other north Texas counties, enjoyed most of its early economic
success and population growth courtesy of its agricultural products and healthy transportation
network. Cattle ranching and cotton and wheat farming, early staples of the economy, were
joined later by dairy farming, horse ranching, and a wider variety of crop agriculture. The
arrival of the railroads in the 1870s served to distribute these goods across both the state and
the nation, propelling the county’s growth and setting the stage for the emergence of dozens
of towns and cities. In later years, suburban growth after World War II had a profound impact
on both the county economy and the landscape, as farm and grazing lands gave way to new
residential neighborhoods and commercial districts, and freeways replaced the railways.

5.3.1 Early Settlement and Civil War (1843–1869)
When the first white settlers came to the Tarrant County area, they had problems with the
Native Americans. In 1843 the settlers signed a treaty dividing the area with the Indians. After
this, many immigrants came from Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky to settle in the region.
In December 1849, the state government established the county and named it after General
Edward H. Tarrant, who helped to drive out the Indians. Several small settlements were formed,
necessitating a military presence. U.S. Army General William J. Worth established Fort Worth
on the banks of the Trinity River in 1849 as the northernmost camp of a series of seven western
frontier forts stretching south to Eagle Pass on the Rio Grande (Campbell 2003:196–197).
Although the military closed the fort shortly after, a small community had already formed

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

around it, calling itself Fort Worth in honor of the camp. The city of Fort Worth was designated
the county seat in 1856.
The earliest permanent settlement in southeast Tarrant County occurred at Mansfield, when
Ralph Man and Julian Feild sold their prosperous saw and grist mill in Fort Worth to establish
a new one in 1857. The area at the time was sparsely populated but ideal for wheat cultivation,
and their new steam powered mill proved an immediate draw for other settlers. The new
residents named the community Mansfield (originally spelled Mansfeild) in honor of the men.
The mill provided flour to the Confederate Army during the Civil War.
The county population declined slightly during the 1860s, due to the effects of the Civil War.
During Reconstruction, a federal military force occupied Fort Worth to ensure the safety of
those appointed to government office by the federal government. The military government
stayed in power until 1869, when new elections were held. During this period, most of the
growth in the county occurred in the northeast section; the county south of Fort Worth was
relatively unsettled outside of a few scattered pioneers.

5.3.2 Cattle Drives and Arrival of the Railroads (1870–1910)
Two economic drivers helped push Tarrant County’s growth after the Civil War: cattle and
the railroads. With the state economy in shambles after the war, enterprising Texans turned to
the vast numbers of unclaimed cattle roaming the landscape. These cattle were herded north
up cattle trails to range land and markets further north. One of the most popular cattle drive
trails, the Chisholm Trail, passed through Fort Worth on its way north to Kansas, allowing
the tired cowboys a chance to rest before finishing their journey (Erlichman 2006:108–109).
“Cowtown” soon became a destination in and of itself, as stagecoaches arrived in 1874, the
Texas and Pacific Railroad arrived in 1876 and the Yuma Stage Line made Fort Worth its
eastern terminus in 1878.
The arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railroad (T&P) in Fort Worth in 1876 opened the doors to
development and eventually helped remake Fort Worth as a meat packing and shipping center
(Reed 1981:354). Although not used for shipping cattle for another ten years after it arrived, the
railroad nonetheless provided a shipping point for local products as well as a source of goods
from out of town and out of state. As the cattle industry shifted from trail drives to meat packing,
more railroads joined the T&P. In 1880, railroad baron and Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad
(Katy) controller Jay Gould transferred track rights from the T&P to the Katy, providing the
Katy with a connection to Fort Worth from Denton (this route would soon become part of the
IH 35 fork from Hillsboro to Denton, forming IH-35 W and IH-35 E). Other railroads included
the St. Louis, Texas and Arkansas in 1887 (later the St. Louis Southwestern, or Cotton Belt)
and the Chicago, Rock Island and Texas in 1894 (later the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific;
Reed 1981:415–418; Zlatkovich 1981:17). By the turn of the century, eight railroads connected
to Fort Worth.
When barbed wire and quarantines ended the practice of driving cattle overland in the mid1880s, ranchers turned to the railroads to get their stock to markets. Although stockyards had

existed in some form since the railroad first arrived, it was not until 1893 that local business
leaders with outside investors incorporated the Fort Worth Stock Yards at their present location
north of the Trinity River. In 1902, the stock yards signed formal agreements with the Armour
and Swift companies, bringing the two meat packing giants to Fort Worth and beginning a
powerful partnership (Schmelzer 2008). The Fort Worth Stockyards soon became one of the
leading livestock centers in the country, handling hogs, horses, and mules in addition to cattle,
and a primary focal point of the county economy. Numerous support and cottage industries
developed alongside the stockyards, such as grain elevators, pharmaceuticals and veterinary
interests, and other meatpacking companies.

5.3.3 Rural Communities and the Agricultural Economy (1880–1950)
As the railroads improved transportation in the county and the cattle markets improved the
economy, the various settlements surrounding Fort Worth began to grow. Crowley moved to
its current site in the early 1880s when the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe Railroad built through
the area and constructed cattle pens. Dairy farming, cattle ranching, and the railroad provided
the biggest factors in the community’s development. Rendon began as a small agricultural
community in the 1880s but did not receive a post office until 1891. It soon gathered other
agricultural industries such as flour mills and cotton gins. Mansfield continued to prosper and
grow. In 1886, the Fort Worth and New Orleans Railroad connected the city to Fort Worth and
Waxahachie (shortly bought by the Houston and Texas Central, and later transferred to the
Texas and New Orleans Railroad). By the last decade of the nineteenth century, Mansfield was
a prosperous agricultural hub with a population of 1,000 (Hart 2010).
Agricultural opportunities attracted many initial settlers to the area with rich soils suited to
the cultivation of cotton, wheat, corn, oats, and a variety of other grain and cash crops. With
the coming of the railroads in the latter decades of the nineteenth century and establishment
of local shipping points at area towns, the stage was set for an explosion of agriculture. Field
cultivation soon came to dominate the area fueled by farm tenancy, while ranching declined
and land holdings decreased to less than 100 acres on average. Despite the suitability of the
land for other crops such as corn and alfalfa, cotton quickly dominated as the cash crop. As
the price for cotton increased rapidly around the turn of the century, more farmers devoted the
majority (or entirety) of their holdings to growing the crop. Cotton became the driving force
behind the area’s economic prosperity, despite warnings from soil scientists against a singlecrop focus.
Cotton remained the dominant crop through the first decades of the twentieth century, although
several factors began driving prices down. The boll weevil, introduced to Texas in the late
nineteenth century, had spread to most of the cotton-producing areas by 1922, damaging crops
and reducing yields (Britton et al. 2010). Government controls also reduced the amount of
cotton that could be grown, along with increased foreign competition. Although World War
I produced a short spike in demand, many farmers turned away from cotton by the 1920s.
The Great Depression further affected cotton’s prominence, as farmers abandoned fields for
other lines of work or shifted them over to different crops at the urging of soil studies and
demonstration farms (Dallas Morning News 1941:177, 204–207). Farm sizes remained small
64

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

during this time, less than 90 acres on average due to the prominence of animal labor (as opposed
to tractors and other forms of mechanization; Brooks et al. 1962:71). As the Depression set
in and many tenant farmers left the fields for the cities, ranching returned to prominence as
landowners put their once-cultivated fields to other uses. Cattle proved popular, as the fields
provided ample forage for both beef and dairy herds. The packing plants at nearby Fort Worth
provided a convenient way of getting beef cattle to market from the surrounding farms.
What farms remained during this period also underwent significant changes. Mechanization
allowed farmers to work larger fields and a wider variety of crops. The average farm size
increased to over 250 acres. Buildings devoted to animal husbandry on farms gave way to
machine shops and tractor barns. Fields once set aside for feed crops to support draft animals
could now be reclaimed for added income. Staple crops like legumes and wheat, and forage
crops such as clover replaced large portions of the region’s cotton acreage. Even with the
effects of the Depression, the area was still primarily rural with an agrarian economy on the
eve of World War II and agriculture remained the driving economic force in the immediate
post-war years.

5.3.4 Industrial Development and the Rise of Suburbia (1942–1970)
World War II kicked off major changes to the region’s economy which only accelerated in
the post-war years. The war brought heavy manufacturing industries, particularly aviationrelated factories, to the Fort Worth area. Many of these industries switched production from
war materials to commercial goods and support in the years following the war. Consolidated
Vultee Aircraft Corporation built an enormous bomber factory at Tarrant Field and the Army
established Carswell Air Force Base on the south shore of Lake Worth. North American
Aviation opened a plant in Grand Prairie in the early years of the war; at its peak the plant
employed 48,500 people and caused enormous growth in the community, resulting in a housing
shortage. The plant’s presence grew Grand Prairie’s population from 1,595 in 1940 to 18,000
in 1945 (Maxwell 2012). After the war, returning soldiers flocked to the cities for work and the
regional population exploded. General Motors opened a manufacturing facility in Arlington in
1951, and the Great Southwest Industrial District opened in 1956. The population of Arlington
increased from a little over 4,000 on the eve of World War II to over 40,000 by 1961 (Shannon
2011).
As Arlington, Grand Prairie, and Fort Worth grew, Mansfield (long stuck at a low population
due to its agricultural focus) began shifting to a new role as a bedroom community to its
neighbors. While industry blossomed in areas east of Fort Worth, newly created jobs resulted
in the need for new housing. Combined with the general post-war housing boom, the parallel
economic boom of the 1950s saw tremendous growth in the region’s suburbs and roadways
(Hightower 2008). Post-war suburbs began springing up all over the Fort Worth area as the
population boomed, and the city expanded its limits by annexing nearby communities. While
this lead to a decline of the downtown core of the city, suburbs flourished. The mass number of
self-contained residential neighborhoods built during the 1950s had, by the 1960s, transformed
American suburbia. Farm and ranch land began giving way to new suburban development
to house the ever-increasing population. Gone were the connections to the inner city, made

obsolete by regional shopping centers connected to neighborhoods by highways, freeways, and
expressways. Suburban industrial parks and office buildings in the 1960s further decentralized
the city’s population, leading to a commuting workforce and “freeway suburbs” (Korfmacher
and Root 2006:6).

5.4 	Previously-Recorded Archeological Sites and Surveys
Only one previous archeological survey is documented within the IPL corridor in Tarrant
County at the time of the background review and current survey. This survey, conducted on
behalf of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in 1994 investigated Granbury Road,
crossing the IPL corridor at its western terminus. During that survey, archeologists documented
Site 41TR137, a prehistoric lithic scatter that was recommended as ineligible for NRHP or
SAL listing. Additionally, Site 41TR238, a historic-age electric railway grade, crosses the IPL
corridor within Tarrant County. Both sites were revisited and re-evaluated during the course of
IPL-related field survey.

5.5 	Results of Archeological Survey Investigations
5.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
As described above, the Tarrant County portion of the IPL project transitions from a residential,
Fort Worth suburban setting in the west to a more agrarian setting toward the east. One thousand,
one hundred, twelve shovel tests were excavated within the county (seven contained cultural
material), primarily following the survey methods discussed in Chapter 4. Five archeological
sites, all historic-age, were recorded. As described in Chapter 1, below is a section-by-section
summary of the results of survey within the county. In all instances, unless stated otherwise,
the reader is to assume that the accessed parcels were intensively surveyed through surface
inspection and shovel testing in accordance with the methods provided in Chapter 4. Specific
resources are described in detail in Section 5.6 below. Shovel testing distribution maps are
provided in Appendix A along with specific depiction of identified archeological resources. A
parcel-by-parcel survey review (including shovel test counts, surface and soil observations,
recommendations for each parcel) is provided for detailed analysis and inspection as
Appendix C.
Old Granbury Road to IH-35 W
The westernmost segment of the IPL corridor was among the most developed of the survey.
The majority of the proposed IPL corridor within this segment is being installed through deep
tunneling, well below any archeologically-viable contexts. Archeologists briefly surfaceinspected this tunneled segment and found it highly disturbed, primarily from construction of
Risinger Road (Figure 5.9). The large sending and receiving pits at the eastern and western
tunnel termini (in Parcels 1 and 2 and 1038, respectively) were intensively surveyed and
shovel tested (seven tests in Parcel 1 and 2 and 13 in Parcel 1038; Figures 5.10–5.11) with
archeologists finding shallow, upland soils in open, plowed fallow fields or pastures. Several

small intermediary shafts are proposed between the termini, but those will be placed in the
Risinger Road median, in severely disturbed contexts. From Parcel 1038 east, the proposed
corridor is slated to be open-cut, following Risinger Road to its intersection with existing
railroad tracks and turning south to Deer Creek Park (Figure 5.12). Archeologists excavated
132 shovel tests along the final pipeline corridor. Shovel tests in this area revealed an ancient,
upland soil column that typically consisted of 30 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 3/3)
overlying dense clay (10YR 4/3) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil (tests usually terminated
at approximately 40 centimeters). With excellent (typically 60–80 percent) surface visibility in
this upland setting, archeologists spread their subsurface test intervals, relying more heavily on

surface inspection. As the proposed pipeline turns east at Parcel 40, it crosses through highlydisturbed land immediately adjacent to IH-35W and ultimately will be tunneled beneath the
roadway in Parcel 43. Historic-age Sites 41TR251 and 41TR252 were documented within this
area, each with primarily surficial components.
The originally-proposed corridor passed farther south, through less-developed contexts. While
this route was ultimately abandoned, archeologists did access several of the parcels, finding
open, scrub pastures and fallow fields and fewer instances of significant modern disturbance.
Where subsurface tests were conducted (Parcels 3–10, 25, 30–34), archeologists found dense,
upland clays similar to those observed along the final proposed corridor (Figures 5.13–5.14).
Because of excellent surface visibility and clearly upland settings, some areas were not
shovel tested at all, with archeologists relying on surface survey only (Parcels 36–40).
However, 195 shovel tests were excavated along this now abandoned section. No sites
were documented within the now-abandoned portion of the segment.

IH-35 W to Rendon Road
Moving east of IH-35 W, the IPL corridor remains largely unaltered from its original iteration
(with a few small, minor shifts at various locales). Along this five-mile portion of the corridor,
archeologists found the study corridor to be generally flat to gently-rolling and less developed,
with the pipeline avoiding many of the residential tracts associated with the community of
Rendon, instead passing through unmaintained back residential lots and undeveloped fields
and forested areas (Figures 5.15–5.16). Archeologists did note a marked increase in natural
gas extraction activities through this segment with numerous two-track roads and gas pads
dotting the pipeline vicinity and several buried pipeline markers crossing the corridor at
various locations (Figure 5.15 and Figure 5.17). Through the 302 shovel tests excavated in this
portion, archeologists noted that soils transitioned from the dense, heavy clays to the west to
sandier loams toward the east (particularly in the vicinity of Deer and Village Creeks). Shovel

consisting of a dense, uniform (10YR 2/1) clay that become impenetrable beyond approximately
50 centimeters below surface (cmbs). The soils in the vicinity of Deer and Village Creek were
found to be more stratified with Shovel Test A63C1, containing a typical soil column for this
area of 40 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 4/3), overlying 20 centimeters of dense clay
loam (10YR 3/2), overlying a compact clay (10YR 2/2) with gravel that extended to the shovel
test terminus at 80 cmbs. This lower stratum (60+ centimeters) was considered to be sterile
subsoil. Archeologists excavated four backhoe trenches in this area to further evaluate the
potential for impacting deep, intact floodplain sediments (see below). Near the eastern terminus,

wooded with soils markedly sandier.
Shovel Test B88D200 (located in
Parcel 88) contained a typical soil
column for this area, consisting of
80 centimeters of sandy (10YR 5/8)
gravel. Archeologists revisited and
recorded the historic electric rail
line berm referenced above (Site
41TR238) in this portion of the IPL
corridor (see below).

Rendon Road to Section 9-11 Split
(Near Bennett Lawson Road)

Moving east of Rendon Road, the IPL
corridor continues to pass through
a primarily remote, suburban and
agrarian setting (Figure 5.18). The
gently rolling, wooded landform through which the survey crossed transitions to a large,
terraced agricultural field before crossing Teague Road and leading into more overgrown
pastures behind widely spaced homes. From there, the line moves through a large urbanized
area where the pipeline then crosses Bennett Lawson Road. Like those areas west of Rendon
Road, archeologists noted abundant evidence of oil and gas extraction with continued buried
pipeline markers and disturbed sediments (i.e. Parcels 105, 108, and 110). Along this segment,
archeologists excavated 141 shovel tests. The soils in this area are Gasil fine sandy loam
of varying slopes with small segments of Birome fine sandy loam. Shovel Test B109A36,
excavated within Parcel 109,
contained a typical soil
column
containing
20
centimeters of fine sandy
loam overlying a prominent,
dense, red (7.5YR 3/4) sandy
clay that was interpreted
as sterile subsoil. Deeper
sediments were observed in a
small rise adjacent to Willow
Branch (Parcel 110) that
were investigated through the
excavation of one backhoe
trench (see below). No sites
or isolates were observed
within this portion of the
pipeline corridor.

Parcels 164 and 165) where
TRWD was unsure of the
pipeline’s approach to the facility (Figure 5.21). Over its full length, archeologists excavated
106 shovel tests within this section. The soils in this northern arm of the proposed pipeline
are predominantly Rader fine sandy loam. Shovel tests in Section 10 had a yellowish red sand
on top of a degraded sandstone. Depths varied with the shovel tests; the soil in Parcel 165
was much deeper (40–80 cmbs), while the subsoil of Parcel 164 was shallow, with degrading
sandstone typically noted at approximately 40 cmbs. Shovel Test A153F1 contained a typical

Passing along the western
suburbs of the community
of Mansfield, archeologists
found the study corridor to be more heavily populated than Section 10 with the corridor
passing regularly across numerous two-lane paved roads and variably-maintained residential
lots. Informal modern (less than 50 years old) trash dumps were also frequently observed in the
various small ephemeral creek crossings and at parcel boundary areas. Terrain in this segment was
noted as gently-rolling, becoming slightly more dramatic with distance toward the west (Figure
5.22). Within the segment, archeologists excavated 111 shovel tests. As with Section 10, the
area was mostly populated
with mixed hardwood areas
along with occasional open
fields. Archeologists noted a

an active sand borrow area.

rather than at depth. Closer to the Johnson County line, Shovel Test C982C672 contained a
typical soil column consisting of 30 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/4) overlying a sandy
clay (10YR 5/2) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil and terminated at 50 cmbs.
As mentioned above, the original Section 11 was wholly abandoned during the IPL design
process, shifting west to the proposed final alignment in Parcel 122. While the majority of this
abandoned corridor is located within Johnson County (see Chapter 6), archeologists did survey
a large portion of the Tarrant County component of the abandoned corridor (Parcels 178–198;
Figure 5.23) excavating an additional 111 shovel tests. Archeologists noted that this corridor
consists of cedar woods with an abundance of secondary growth and scattered modern trash
dumps throughout. The soils
within these parcels consisted
of a 10YR 4/4 or 7.5YR 4/4
sandy loam atop 5YR 5/8
basal clay, found between 35
and 50 centimeters (Shovel

KBR Site Survey (Independent Action)
Archeologists investigated the western half of the existing/proposed KBR facility site (those
portions of the site away from the existing reservoir, see Figure 5.6). Archeologists utilized a
100 percent pedestrian surface survey accompanied by the excavation of four subsurface shovel
tests. The surveying archeologist noted that the tract had been severely modified through its
previous use as a borrow area for the levee of an adjacent existing reservoir. Approximately 80
percent of the natural grade within this tract had been removed (in some instances well below
the original ground surface) and two water tanks/ponds remain. Additionally, much of the tract
periphery is lined with markers for buried utilities, further reducing the potential for any intact
archeological deposits (Figure 5.24). Of the four tests excavated, only one in the extreme
southeast corner of the tract lacked clear indications of disturbance.

Archeologists did not document any archeological sites or isolated finds within the tract, though
the investigator was informed that the facility’s maintenance worker’s residence once stood in
the borrow area. The archeologist thoroughly inspected the most likely area where the site may
have been (in the northwest tract corner) and found no features or artifacts, but instead observed
a broad sheet of overgrown,
introduced
construction
gravel that was dense and
compacted by repeated
vehicular passes, making
shovel testing impossible
(Figure 5.25). The former

Within Tarrant County, AmaTerra excavated five backhoe trenches, including four at the
confluence of Village and Deer creeks (Parcels 63 and 1043) and one at Willow Branch (Parcel

of buried resources.

Road in the vicinity of Parcel 63. Along the confluence-side of the Village Creek channel (left
bank), archeologists found the IPL corridor crosses through an open, broad, flat floodplain
approximately 500 meters across (within the IPL corridor; Figures 5.26–5.27). Archeologists
excavated three backhoe trenches within Parcel 63 (Trenches 63-1–63-3). At the eastern and
western trenching area termini (Trenches 63-1 and 63-3, respectively), archeologists observed
numerous subsurface impacts with markers for buried gas and sewer pipelines passing
throughout the vicinity, but trench sites were found that were sufficiently clear of any of those
obstructions.

Figure 5.26. Backhoe Trenching Map in the vicinity of Village Creek.

As can be seen in Tables 5.2–5.3, sediments within the Village/Deer Creek floodplain were
relatively shallow. Within Trench 63-1, archeologists observed a 125-centimeter column
of 10YR 4/3–5/4 sandy clays that are interpreted as Holocene alluvium overlying gravels
(indicating high energy deposition or the relic channel itself) that extended to the trench’s
terminus at 185 centimeters. Trench 63-3, dug at the western terminus, was ended almost
immediately after its initiation as archeologists observed a dense gravel bar at 30 cmbs (Figure
5.28). The deepest and best preserved floodplain soil column was observed within Trench 63-2.
At this location, approximately midway between Trenches 63-3 and 63-1, the recorded soil
profile reveals two low energy flooding regimes separated by a higher-energy gravel lens at 122
centimeters (Figure 5.29). Archeologists thoroughly examined all trench walls and samples of

(Trench 1043-1). Like Parcel
63, archeologists observed markers for buried gas pipelines in the immediate vicinity, but
were able to excavate the single trench off a two-track road within a densely-wooded riparian
zone. Trench 1043-1 revealed a distinctly different soil column from those to the west (Table
5.4; Figure 5.30). The prevailing red (5YR 4/3 and 7.5YR 5/4), gravelly, sandy sediments
within the 160-centimeter excavation are Pleistocene terrace deposits that very likely do not
contain intact archeological deposits. Immediately east of the trench, the landform rises and
archeologists were able to contact subsoil through shovel testing only.

Figure 5.30. Observed soil profile from Backhoe Trench 1043-1.

Given the disturbed nature of the floodplain as well as its shallow depth within the proposed
IPL corridor, archeologists consider that construction will likely have minimal potential for
impacting significant deposits in the vicinity of Deer and Village creeks.
Willow Branch Area (Parcel 110)
Moving east, the IPL corridor briefly crosses a narrow (roughly 200 meters wide) band of Willow
Branch floodplain sediment in the vicinity of Parcel 110. At this location, archeologists were
unable to reach the base of Holocene sediments in excavated shovel tests and supplemented
those investigations with a single backhoe trench (Trench 110-1; Figures 5.31–5.32).
Archeologists, had to pay close attention to the trench site as numerous buried gas pipeline
markers were visible criss-crossing the IPL line and a large gas well pad is located just north
of the centerline; however, a One-Call locator was able to direct AmaTerra archeologists to an
undisturbed location. Within the trench, archeologists recorded a relatively shallow Holocene
soil column with culturally-viable soils, reaching a maximum of 115 cmbs before transitioning
to pale, saturated, manganese-included sandy clay near 165 centimeters that was considered
sterile subsoil (Table 5.5; Figures 5.33–5.34). No artifacts, features, or other cultural inclusions
were observed within the trench; citing this lack of identified resources in a disturbed setting,
further trenching work is unwarranted. Construction in this area is not likely to impact intact
archeological deposits.

Identified Archeological Resources

During the course of archeological fieldwork, surveyors documented five historic-age
archeological sites (41TR237, 41TR238, 41TR243, 41TR251, and 41TR252) and four isolated
finds (A66IF1, A66IF2, A89IF1, and A139IF2; Table 5.6). Additionally, archeologists revisited
the marked location of Site 41TR137 only to find the area to be disturbed and inundated
with no identifiable site components. A summary of each site and isolated find is provided

5.6.1 Archeological Sites
Sites Located Within the Proposed IPL Direct Effects APE
Site 41TR238
Site 41TR238 is a section of an eroded railroad bed attributed to the early twentieth century
Fort Worth Southern Traction Company Interurban Electric Railway. Within the current survey
corridor, Site 41TR238 is composed of a single railroad berm measuring about 75 feet wide
(Figures 5.35–5.36), which was ultimately also recorded as a standing historic structure
(TR56-1). The site is located along Deer Creek, northwest of Farm-to-Market (FM) 1187 and
Oak Grove Road. Occupying an area of approximately 80 x 120 meters (north/south x east/
west) but extending well beyond this arbitrary boundary, the site is situated in an upland prairie
setting. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Frio silty
clay experiencing occasional flooding. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of brown, gravelly, silty clay (10YR 4/3), reaching bedrock at approximately 40
cmbs. The site area has been leveled and re-contoured in the past either for railway construction
and/or contouring of the adjacent pasture.

(approximately 30 miles).
The rail line was in operation
between 1912 and 1931.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online (Rieder 2012), this railway was built around the
time when steam railroads were unable to keep up with the demands of small-scale interurban
commuting. Similar to traditional street cars, these engines criss-crossed the countryside
connecting many of Texas’ urban centers during the pre-family automobile days. At 500 miles
in total laid track, Texas’ interurban rail system was the second largest in the country west of the
Mississippi River. As families began to purchase their own vehicles and road systems improved,
the popularity of the electric rail lines dwindled. The last electric rail line discontinued service
in 1948 (Rieder 2012).
Though the site is associated with a distinct period of Texas history and therefore could be
considered locally significant, the components of Site 41TR238 within the proposed IPL
pipeline corridor are heavily modified and lack integrity. Additionally, anticipated projectrelated impacts to the site in this location will not destroy the resource as a whole, but will
simply add another graded crossing to an otherwise heavily-modified earthen berm. Within
the IPL project corridor, Site 41TR238 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. Thus, no further work is recommended for the site.
41TR251
Site 41TR251 is a historic-period livestock stockade and grain storage structure containing
an associated debris scatter (Figures 5.37–5.38). The site is located in the gently-rolling
uplands south of Risinger Road, occupying an area of approximately 85 x 110 meters (north/
south x east/west). Local vegetation consists of young mesquite trees and pastureland grasses.
Overall, surface visibility was estimated at less than 20 percent. According to the USDA’s

Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Slidell clay with one to three percent
slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column consisting of 30–40
centimeters of very dense clay (10YR 4/2). Typically, shovel tests terminated at a depth of 30
cmbs upon encountering dense clay subsoil. The site has been disturbed through the removal
of structures and installation of an underground gas pipeline north of the site. Today, the area
is used as pastureland and receives little attention.

Archeologists

three main features and
several additional ancillary
structures within 41TR251
site boundaries. Feature 1 is
a grain or hay storage barn
measuring
approximately
60 x 12 feet (east/west x
north/south). This structure
was constructed using 2 x
6 inch lumber and has been
partitioned into four rooms;
three used for feed storage
with the fourth serving as a
utilitarian storage closet. The
three feed rooms are elevated
approximately 3 feet above
the ground, each containing
an elevated 2 x 6-foot access
door and grain trough (see
Figure 5.38). Feature 2
includes two small animal
coops with an associated
concrete slab (Figure 5.39).
Each coop has three separate
stalls, presumably used for
small livestock. They are
constructed of planks similar
to Feature 1 and covered
with corrugated metal siding.
They measure approximately
30 x 10 feet and stand 3
feet tall. Feature 3 is 20 feet
south of Feature 1 and is
comprised of a rectangular
concrete foundation that is
roughly 100 feet long and
20 feet wide (Figure 5.40).
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline

Feature 3 served as the foundation for a onewalled pole barn used for feeding livestock
stored in several of the fenced livestock pens
south of Feature 3. Located along the site’s
northern boundary, archeologists recorded
a small concrete foundation (Feature 4)
measuring approximately 10 x 5 feet (east/
west x north/south), standing approximately
30 inches above the surrounding grade
(Figure 5.41). Two corrugated metal bale
feeders were also recorded north of Feature

standing and in relatively good condition.
Archeologists excavated eleven shovel tests
during their investigations of Site 41TR251

tests were devoid of cultural materials.

Archeologists conducted deed research within the
Tarrant County Clerk’s office in an effort to link
the site to its likely original occupants. Tarrant
County’s deed records have been fully digitized and
all paper indices and books are no longer accessible.
Unfortunately, strict search criteria accompanied
with vague grantor/grantee information made a
detailed database search difficult. The team was
able to trace the deed records back to the mid 1940s,
when T. B. Corley and his wife, Sadie, sold the
parcel to Jennie K. Welch (1/11/44; Volume 1673,
pg. 409). Ms. Welch owned the property for the next
25 years, selling it to a Harry Welch in April of 1971
(Volume 5021, pg. 717). The 1944 deed record lists
that the property was part of a land transfer to W.
C. Gaffey by J. E. Burton in a lawsuit in 1925. It is
unclear if Gaffey sold the property to Corley and the
original court records could not be located. With an
artifact and feature assemblage that post-dates the
1920s, this 1944 deed record provides the names
of the most likely original site occupants: W. C.
Gaffey, Jennie Welch, or T. B. Corley and wife.

According to the 1930 US Census, Thomas “T. B.” Corley was (at the time) a 33-year-old white
man working in the insurance industry. He lived with his wife, Sadie (33), son T. B., Jr. (14),
daughter Sylvia (3), and two servants, Ike (26) and Hattie (23; both African-American). By
the 1940 census, T. B. is listed as a real estate agent still living with his wife and two children
(T. B., Jr. is now a 24-year-old book salesman). The two servants are no longer listed as living
at the Corley residence. A Janie Welch is listed as a Tarrant County resident in the 1930 census
working as a servant, but no one by the name of Jennie Welch could be found in any of the
census records. Likewise, W. C. Gaffey is not included in any Tarrant County census records
in any of the relevant years. With T. B. Corley’s profession being decidedly non-agricultural
(insurance and real estate), the site is not realistically attributed to his family. Being a real
estate agent, he may have leased the parcel to a tenant farmer who could not be identified, or
the land served as an investment property. More likely, the ranching materials are attributed to
Ms. Welch, who owned the land beginning in 1944.
In addition to deed research, investigators also consulted historic aerial photographs in an
effort to identify the site’s age and function. While a 1940 aerial of the vicinity (Figure 5.43)
is very blurry and difficult to decipher, the main feed barn is visible in the site’s center. A 1968
aerial, however, is much clearer, and provides a distinct depiction of the site’s features (Figure
5.44). Notably, a large pole barn closest to the road was likely removed during Risinger Road
expansion as that feature was not visible at the site. The site includes a small animal pen south
of Feature 3 that was visible at the time of recording. Curiously, Feature 3 appears to have been
expanded at some point subsequent to 1968 as the structure visible in the aerial is shorter than

the one recorded during the survey (see Figure 5.37). Of note, being found adjacent to Site
41TR252 (see below) with no apparent dividing fencelines, it is possible that the two parcels
were owned by the same individual at that time. Accordingly, the two sites may have been two
components of a larger agricultural operation (see below).
41TR251 is primarily composed of extant historic-age agricultural structures directly adjacent
to a heavily-trafficked modern roadway. Archeological investigations of the site revealed
subsurface deposition while the surface scatter was diffuse. Indeed the structural remains
carry the highest research potential, particularly Feature 1. However, those structures are out
of their historical context, and contain a diffuse and unremarkable artifact scatter. While the
distribution of features does maintain a level of historical integrity related to early- to midtwentieth century farming activities in southern Tarrant County, it is unlikely that additional
investigations would contribute substantial new information about the site or agricultural sites
in this region. Finally, the site is not linked to an individual or event of historical significance.
Accordingly, Site 41TR251 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
Though the site is likely to be destroyed through IPL-related construction, no further work is
recommended.
41TR252
Site 41TR252 is a historic-age, single component, farmstead/homestead containing eight
features. The site is located within the proposed IPL permanent easement and will likely be
impacted by planned construction (Figures 5.45–5.46). Occupying an area of approximately
70 meters in diameter, the site is situated within a level pastureland south of Risinger Road.
Overall, surface visibility was estimated at 1–25 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil
Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Ponder clay loam and Sanger clay with 1–3 percent
slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 30 centimeters of
sandy loam (10YR 3/4) atop dense clay subsoil (10YR 5/7). Shovel tests typically terminated
at 100 cmbs where clay was not encountered and 40 cmbs where clay was present. Based on
surveyor observations, the site continues to be impacted by erosion and razing, leaving roughly
20 percent of the site intact.
Within this farmstead site, archeologists recorded eight individual features of varying condition
(many of which appeared to have been burned). Feature 1 is a concrete foundation measuring
approximately 42 x 32 feet (Figure 5.47). A concrete walkway is present on both the northern

x 25 feet in size with a large water storage tank in the southeast corner (Figure 5.48). Feature
2 is located roughly 20 meters southwest of Feature 1 and is connected to it by a narrow strip
of concrete. Feature 3 consists of four concrete pier bases—each roughly 18 x 18 inches in
size—that make four corners of a larger 12 x 12 foot square shape. A metal anchor is located in
the center of the square. Though difficult to conclusively discern, this feature may have served
as the base for a communication tower or small water tank (Figure 5.49). Feature 4 is another
square concrete pad with an iron pipe protruding at the center along with two anchor points
located on each side of the pad (Figure 5.50). This feature is located 5 meters east of Features
2 and 3. Feature 5 is a water pump located on the south side of a chain link fence, roughly 6

Results Tarrant County

As stated with the previous site discussion, Tarrant County deed records have been fully
digitized but are difficult to navigate due to the strict search limitations. Despite a great effort
employed, researchers were simply unable to trace the deed records back earlier than 2001
(Volume 15346, pg. 311). Archeologists contacted the current landowner (Crowley Independent
School District) but calls were not returned. As such, it was not possible to link the site to
a contemporary individual. As discussed above, archeologists consulted historic aerials that
depict Site 41TR252 a short distance east of 41TR251 (see Figures 5.43–5.44). With no visible
fencelines between them, it is possible that the site is associated with the same individuals
linked to 41TR251, the Corleys, Gaffeys, or Ms. Jennie Welch.
41TR252 is a historic domestic and agricultural complex that is in poor condition. As is
visible in Figures 5.48–5.53 the extant features are either rotted and collapsing, are partially
burned, or are composed of nondescript concrete foundations and depressions with minimal
functional patterning. A non-diagnostic and regionally-redundant assemblage of nails, plastic,
and other items suggests that the artifacts do not likely carry a large amount of additional
research potential. Though the distribution of features does maintain a level of historical
integrity related to farming activities in southern Tarrant County, it is unlikely that additional
investigations would contribute substantial new information about the site or agricultural
practices in this region. Finally, the site is most likely not linked to an individual or event of
historical significance. Accordingly, Site 41TR252 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. Though the site is found partially within the proposed impact corridor and
may be impacted by construction, no further work is recommended.
Archeological Sites Outside of the Proposed IPL Direct Effects APE
Site 41TR137
Site 41TR137, previously recorded for the TxDOT-Environmental Affairs Division in 1994,
is a prehistoric lithic scatter (Figure 5.56). At the time of the its initial recording, the site
consisted of a biface and an unspecified amount of chert, sandstone, and quartzite debitage.
According to the site form, 41TR137 was located on the north side of a small drainage in
an open pasture on a narrow finger shaped hill. Restricted to a surface survey, archeologists
recommended the site ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Today, the mapped site
boundary is located adjacent to a residential housing complex with standing residences 200
meters to the south. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity
are Sanger clay with 1–3 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 40 centimeters of gravelly clay (10YR 5/6) transitioning to dense gravels to
the terminus at approximately 50 cmbs. Modern disturbances are abundant with evidence of
grading and bulldozing present.
Archeologists excavated five shovel tests during their investigations in the vicinity of Site
41TR137 (Shovel Tests OT1–4 and B1). All of the shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials.
Recent (at the time of survey) rains and a generally clayey composition of the soils resulted
in large swaths of standing water within the site area (Figure 5.57). As a result, no artifacts
were found on the surface. Archeologists, finding no artifacts or features, considered the site

Subsequent
to
AmaTerra’s
survey,
an
avocational
archeologist
revisited the site location and
documented one dart point
(unspecified) base and one
biface on the ground surface in
the mapped site vicinity. The
archeologist determined that the
western portions of the site had
been destroyed by construction,
while the eastern segments
still retained some integrity.
As a result of the survey,
recommendations for additional
work were suggested in the
event future impacts (from the
nearby housing development)
were proposed in the vicinity of
the site.

Figure 5.57. General overview of Site
41TR137 terrain and setting.

Based on information gathered by AmaTerra archeologists and subsequent investigations,
Site 41TR137 has been completely destroyed by bulldozing and urban encroachment within
the IPL survey corridor. The site will likely be avoided during IPL construction since it is
located entirely within this portion of the project. Within the proposed IPL pipeline corridor,
41TR137 is recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No further work
is recommended for the site at this time.
Site 41TR243
Site 41TR243 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of a standing house with an ancillary gas
tank and an associated shallowly-buried zone of cultural materials (Figures 5.58–5.59). The
site is located east of South Eden Road within the western half of the survey corridor in Section
10. Occupying an area of approximately 25 x 35 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is
situated on a level upland terrace with a very slight slope to the northeast toward an ephemeral
drainage. Local vegetation consists of tall mixed grasses with small patches of ash juniper trees
to the east. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 15 percent. According
to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Holocene-age Rader Series
sandy loam. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 60 to 80
centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/3) overlying a dense clay to clay loam (10YR 7/8). This
yellow clay was interpreted to be sterile subsoil at which point shovel testing was terminated.
Site 41TR243 is considered to be heavily disturbed due to severe impacts from a large tree that
has fallen into the standing structure’s roof, modern utilities, and general disrepair.

Features within 41TR243 consist
of the standing house (Feature
1) and an ancillary gas tank
(Feature 2). According to the
current landowner (personal
communication) the house was
constructed during the midtwentieth century. The structure
is built in an ‘L’ shape plan that
measures approximately 28 x 28
feet (Figure 5.60). The original
structure contained three square
rooms, with an additional fourth
room added later. In general, the

wood clapboard siding. Portions of
the northerly-facing wall contain
more modern asbestos siding,
lining the bottom half of the wall.
The roof is cross-gabled, covered
with asphalt shingles. A small
front porch on the western side and
enclosed addition on the eastern
side were added at a later date.
This conclusion is based on the
similarities in the roof construction
design, size, differing construction
materials, and the blocking of a
window on the internal wall of
the addition. The original window
frames are composed of wood, and

are equally dilapidated. A large
tree, originally located 35 feet
south of Feature 1 has fallen onto the roof near the eastern addition, causing the roof to collapse
(Figure 5.61). The house’s propane gas tank (Feature 2) is approximately 30 feet south of the
structure near the base of the tree (Figure 5.62). The house has been used in the last decade
as indicated by the satellite dish located approximately 6 feet south of the porch as well as
the presence of furniture stored within the dwelling. The house’s front yard contains a scatter
of various sized coarse earthenware cinder blocks(?) with the inscription “C HUMBOLDT
KANS B,” asphalt shingles, and portland cement chunks. A search for companies of that name
did not return any results.
Archeologists excavated seven shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41TR243 (Shovel
Tests A35, C34, B35, OT1–OT4; Table 5.8). Of these, three shovel tests (OT1, OT3, and OT4)

structure) contained one piece of asphalt roofing shingle (20–40 cmbs). In Shovel Test OT3
(east of the main structure), four pieces of metal, at least two discernable wire nails, and two
shards of clear glass were excavated from the upper 20 centimeters, while at 20–40 cmbs a
single undecorated whiteware sherd was recorded. Shovel Test OT4 yielded three clear glass
shards at 0–20 cmbs and two pieces of undecorated whiteware between 20 and 40 cmbs. All
other tests were devoid of cultural materials.
According to the property owner, the house was owned by his uncle since the mid-twentieth
century and has been in the family’s possession ever since. The landowner stated that his
uncle acquired the house when the land was purchased. From a brief review of the parcel’s tax
records, an Albert Dignum purchased the property from a J. D. and Nettie Baugh in July of
1936 (Book 1290, pg 419). Nine years later, Dignum sold the property to Rhonda Adams (Book
1684, pg. 144), who owned the property until 2001, when it was sold to the current landowner
(Book 15630, pg. 26). It is presumed that Rhonda Adams (or an immediate family member) is
likely the owner of the house as explained by the current landowner, though no name could be
located. While no Albert Dignum is found in any relevant census records, Jesse (assumed to be
J. D.) Baugh is listed in the 1930 census as a 30-year-old farmer. None of the names that are
temporally associated with the site are considered to be of historical significance.
Site 41TR243 is a partially damaged, single building homestead that likely dates to the earlyto mid-twentieth century. The site is in moderate to poor condition and is not associated with
an individual or event of historical significance. Accordingly, Site 41TR243 is considered
ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Being located outside of the Direct Effects APE,
the site will not be directly impacted. Thus, no further archeological work is recommended for
the site.

5.6.2 Archeological Isolated Finds
A66IF1 is a historic-age water well and pump. The isolated find is located within an open
field east of Village Creek in Parcel 66 (Figure 5.64). The feature, composed of rough-cut
stone courses and Portland cement mortar, is square in plan, measures approximately 3 feet
in diameter, and stands approximately 3 feet tall. A rusted cast iron water pump and spigot
rises from the feature with “Baker MFG/EVANSVILLE WI6” embossed on the main shaft.
The “6” after “WI” is possibly a manufacturing month or year, but with only a single digit,
it is impossible to determine to which decade it might be referring. With a pipe leading
horizontally from the spigot and no apparent hand pump mechanism, it is assumed that this
was part of a gas-powered pump assembly with the engine subsequently removed. According
to Montgomery (2012), Baker Manufacturing Company was established in 1873 in Evansville,
Wisconsin, specializing in industrial equipment (including water pumps). The company
(still in business today) opened a branch in Fort Worth some time around 1896. While the
pump could have been purchased before, it most likely (citing the use of Portland cement)
was installed some time during the early twentieth century. Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of silty clay (10YR 4/4) overlying 40+
centimeters of clay (10YR 4/2). Additional shovel tests (OT1–OT6) were devoid of cultural
materials. No associated artifacts or features were observed in the resource’s vicinity. It is
found a short distance north of the W.T. Berry homestead, a historic agricultural/residential
complex documented by architectural historians as Historic Site 41TN65-1 (see below), and
is likely associated with that occupation. The well and pump are located within the 150-foot
IPL permanent easement and may be impacted by construction, but due to a lack of associated
features or artifacts, the resource is recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. Thus, no further work is recommended for this isolated find.

A89IF1 is an isolated, concrete well located in a
wooded area within Parcel 89 (Figure 5.66). The

single sheet of plate metal. Given the well’s condition
and composition, it does not appear to be particularly

no further work is recommended for

A139IF2 is a surficial trash scatter containing both contemporary and historic period cultural
debris. The historic material consists primarily of a historic-age plow (Figure 5.67) interspersed
with modern material. Occupying an area of approximately 50 feet in diameter, the isolated
find is located within a wooded area. Additional shovel tests (D6, B8, C9, F2, and E5) were
devoid of cultural materials. Observations made during shovel testing revealed a typical soil
column of 20 centimeters of clay (10YR 5/8). Given the isolated find’s location, outside of the
proposed impact corridor, and the presence of modern material interspersed with the historic
debris this feature is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Thus, no further
work is recommended for this isolated find.

miles east of the intersection of Wildcat Way and FM 1187. Dating to circa 1908, the remnants
consist of an earthen embankment supporting the old rail bed and poured concrete bridge
abutments and supports. The rails, rail bed, and bridge decking are no longer extant. The Texas
Electric Railway ceased operations in 1948 and abandoned the line (Figures 5.68–5.69).

Although the Texas Electric Railway
was a significant part of Texas railroad
history, TN56-1 has only limited historic
significance under Criterion A for its
association with the line. The remnants
have no known association with persons
of historic importance under Criterion
B, and no architectural or engineering
significance under Criterion C. As such,
TN56-1 is recommended not eligible for
listing in the NRHP.

and the shed roof (Figure 5.70). No
other outbuildings are present. The
barn has only minimal association with
agricultural practices in Tarrant County,
but with no other buildings or features, is
unable to convey any significance under
Criterion A. It has no known association
with important historic persons under
Criterion B. While large shed roof barns
are uncommon, this particular barn
does not rise to the level of significance
required for architecture under Criterion

TN102
TN102 is a mixed residential/agricultural
property at 6798 Rendon New Hope Road
consisting of a house, storage building, and
a large barn. The house (TN102-1, Figure
5.71) is a circa 1960 one-story Ranch style
house of wood-frame construction with brick
masonry veneer and wood siding. Windows
are two-light metal-sash in pairs or triplets.
Entry is through a wood hollow core door,
or through plate glass sliding patio doors.
The gable roof has moderate eaves, and is

covered with standing seam metal sheets.
The storage building (TN102-2, Figure
5.72) is a one-story side-gabled building
with brick veneer foundation wall and stucco siding. Doors and windows were not visible
from public right-of-way. The roof is covered with wood or composite asphalt shingles. The
barn (TN102-3, Figure 5.73) is a large gambrel-roofed wood-frame building with a hay loft.
The walls are corrugated metal on the sides, and a mix of vertical and horizontal wood siding
on the gable ends. Attached to the west end of the barn is a flat-roofed open air pen or tractor
barn. The barn opens on to a small fenced corral, while the flat-roofed section opens on to field.

Figure 5.73. Barn (TN102-3), facing southwest.

Although nominally associated with agricultural practices of the mid-twentieth century, the
property is in limited agricultural use and lacks important buildings required for significant
association with agriculture; as such, it is not significant under Criterion A. The property has
no known association with persons of historic importance under Criterion B. The house is
a typical mid-century Ranch style house, with minimal character-defining features. Due to
the popularity of this particular architectural style, the bar for significance is high, and this
property does not meet the requirements for significance under Criterion C. Therefore, TN102
is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

TN103-1
TN103-1 is a four-box concrete bridge class culvert on Teague Road over Willow Branch.
Built in 1940 by the WPA, the cast concrete culvert features a simple stepped design on the
curbs and chamfered corners on each channel opening. A patinated metal plaque embedded
in the east side lists the county judge, commissioners, and engineer at the time of planning
and construction, as well as the bridge’s elevation and construction date. Archival research at
Tarrant County’s County Clerk’s office revealed that the WPA culverts observed during the IPL
survey were part of a large, county-wide improvement project in the 1930s to replace old wood
structures with the concrete structures that are in place now (Figures 5.74–5.75). According to
the records consulted, over a thousand of these structures were built during the project. Since
this resource is one part of a much larger pool of identical culverts in the immediate vicinity,
it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP. A report detailing these resources
was submitted to the THC’s History Program in march of 2013, with AmaTerra receiving
concurrence with the above recommendations (not NRHP-eligible) on march 27, 2013 (see
Appendix B).

TN103-2
TN103-2 is a dairy barn off Rendon Bloodworth Road, located behind a modern residence
(Figure 5.76). The circa 1940 two-story masonry building features brick masonry walls on the
lower half and wood shiplap siding on the upper half. A wood shed addition is attached to the
southeast side and opens onto a fenced corral. The primary doors are wood panel sliding doors,
with other entrances through wood stall doors along the southeast side within the addition.
The upper level has a wood hayloft door and exposed hay lift brace. The gambrel roof is
covered with modern standing seam metal roofing and has three metal roof vents, while the
addition has corrugated metal roofing. Although associated with agricultural practices present
in mid-twentieth century Tarrant County, the barn lacks associated historic buildings and
exists only as an outlier. The residence on the property is modern, and the other outbuildings
are similarly not of historic age. As such, the barn is unable to convey its significance under
Criterion A. It has no known association with persons of historic importance under Criterion B.
Although functional and in good condition, the barn is not a particularly noteworthy example of

early 1930s and finished in 1940, is a two-story building with brick, cut stone, and metal lathe
with plaster. Bricks used in the house were salvaged from the nearby Hemphill Methodist
Church. The asymmetrical-plan house has large cross gables and a steeply pitched gabled
roof with composite shingles. Windows are multi-light metal casement, with those inset into
masonry on the façade sporting arches above. The two oversized chimneys have intricate
brick and stone work. The basement houses a three-car garage with wood garage doors. A
small addition or mudroom on the north side has horizontal wood siding and aluminum sash
windows. The interior of the house has wood floors and arched entryways between rooms
(Figures 5.101–104).
Several other buildings share the property with the main house. Due east is a circa 1930s onestory wood-frame bungalow plan house with wood siding and multi-light wood-sash windows
under a gabled roof (Figures 5.105–5.106). North of the secondary house is a circa 1930s
long, single-story wood-frame building that served as a chicken coop. The coop has horizontal
beadboard siding and once had multi-light wood-sash windows, but most have been removed.
Farther east is a later (circa 1960) large, single-story metal barn composed of two sections.
The west section has a low-pitched gabled roof, with the east section sporting a moderate

TN164 is the Dingnum-Adams House, a 1936 Pueblo Revival house located on Hudson
Cemetery Road in Tarrant County. The one-story, wood-frame house (TN164-1) built by Albert
Dingnum features a stucco exterior and single pane wood sash windows. The house is built
with a series of rectangular sections with rounded corners, a round tower entry, and a chimney
with rounded corners. The roof is flat with decorative cornices and exposed vigas. A later
owner, Dorsey Adams, expanded the house in 1950 with sympathetic additions. The house
was previously recorded by representatives of the THC for a neighborhood survey (December
1982). The property also features a matching garage (TN164-2) constructed at the same time
as the original house, and a complex of later wood barns (TN164-3) behind the house that do
not match the architecture (Figures 5.119–5.121).

KBRa-1
KBRa-1 is the Hudson Cemetery on Hudon Cemetery Road approximately one half mile west of
US 287 south of Kennedale. The cemetery, started in 1878 by the Hudson Family for the burial
of their daughter, was later deeded by the family for cemetery use in 1892. Most of the 500-plus
burials date to the first half of the twentieth century, although the cemetery is still in active use
with modern burials. Markers are a mix of cut stone and cast concrete headstones, obelisks,
and markers, and modern in-ground flat plaques (Figure 5.133). The cemetery is surrounded
by a modern chain link fence, with a simple iron lich gate with the name of the cemetery at the
entrance (Figure 5.134). The cemetery does not have curbing or grave fencing. An OTHM

Results of Field Investigations
Johnson County
The proposed IPL pipeline crosses briefly into Johnson County’s northeast corner as it moves
east from Tarrant County (Figures 6.1 and 6.2). Within Johnson County, the proposed IPL
pipeline stretches over approximately 6.7 miles, with the 150-foot proposed permanent easement
occupying an area of approximately 121 acres. No proposed facility sites associated with the
project are found within Johnson County. Moving away from the more suburban setting of
Tarrant County, the IPL corridor transitions to a primarily rural, agricultural setting with the
survey crossing almost entirely over large, plowed fields and open pastures in shallow, clayey
uplands. Overall, archeologists and architectural historians surveyed approximately 590 acres
of the proposed IPL project within Johnson County, documenting one archeological site, one
isolated find, and six historic-age buildings. Below is a summary of the county’s environmental
and historical background along with a survey narrative and detailed descriptions of identified
resources.

6.1 	Pipeline Description
6.1.1 Preferred Pipeline Route
Beginning at its crossing of CR 528, the IPL pipeline will make cross Johnson County entirely
through open-cut trench installation (see Figures 6.1 and 6.2). From Parcel 985 through 1018,
the 150-foot preferred pipeline corridor crosses mostly open, rural parcels and smaller suburban
residential lots (in the Mansfield outskirts to the north) with minimal obstructions.

6.1.2 Facility Sites
Within Johnson County, no facility sites are proposed.

6.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
Nearly all of the IPL pipeline corridor within Johnson County was originally proposed to
pass through a different location approximately one mile to the north. The original survey
corridor made a more direct southeast trajectory through the county with a small, 1.5-mile-long
northeastward spur connecting the line to an existing water pipeline at Mathis Road near CR
360. This route was abandoned relatively early in the pipeline survey process and only a small
portion of the abandoned corridor (near its midpoint and along the northeastward spur) was
surveyed by cultural resource crews (see Figure 6.1).

Once the route had been refined, one small deviation was proposed in the vicinity of Parcels
1006 and 1007 as TRWD elected to reduce the point of intersection (PI) angle of the pipe and
pass the proposed pipeline north of an unnamed tributary to Mountain Creek. Both alternative
routes were evaluated by archeological field crews.

6.2 	Environmental Summary
The project is located on the Mansfield and Britton 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles. Within
Johnson County, the 450-foot evaluation corridor transects mostly rural tracts of land with
intermittent residential and commercial development. The project area crosses two named
creeks, Mountain Creek and Reece Branch, in the relatively short distance that it traverses the
county.

6.2.1 Johnson County Soil Summary
The 450-foot evaluation corridor crosses two geological groups within Johnson County:
the Woodbine Group (Kwb) and the Austin, Eagle Ford Group Kef. These groups contain
two different soil formations
that are Late Cretaceous in

The reader should refer to Chapter 5 for a representation of the conditions typical of Johnson
County.

6.2.3 Current Land Use
The IPL corridor within Johnson County, from west to east, crosses through mostly rural tracts
with intermittent residential development. Rural areas are primarily actively cultivated fields
and cattle grazing land. Residential development in the Mansfield area comprises the majority
of the more densely-populated portions of the pipeline corridor within the county.

6.3 	Historical Context
6.3.1 Early Settlement and Civil War (1854–1869)
Prior to European settlement, Johnson County was home to groups of Tonkawa, Kickapoo,
Anadarko, Caddo, and Waco Indians. In 1851 the Caddo led an uprising that led most of the
early European settlers to flee. No other serious Indian conflicts occurred and Johnson County
was formed from Ellis County in 1854 with a recorded population of 700. The first county seat
was located at Wardville, but moved in 1856 to Buchanan, then again in 1867 to Cleburne. The
present county borders were formed in 1881 after a section of Ellis County was reassigned to
Johnson County (Elam 2010).
The first census in which Johnson County was included took place in 1860, and the county was
recorded to have a population of 4,305 persons. At this time the slave population of the county
was 513, or 11.9 percent. Livestock was the primary industry and corn was the largest crop.
With the onset of the Civil War, Johnson County voted overwhelmingly in favor of secession
and nearly all able-bodied free men took up arms against the Union. Johnson County saw its
slave population double during the war years as refugees from other slave states made their
way into the county, bringing along their slaves. After the war however, the African-American
population dwindled, dropping to about one percent of the county population by 1900 (Elam
2010).

6.3.2 Cattle Drives and Arrival of the Railroads (1870–1910)
Following Reconstruction, Johnson County grew rapidly. The population expanded from 4,923
persons in 1870 to 17,911 in 1880. Until the twentieth century the economy of Johnson County
was tied to agriculture with corn and cotton being the major crops. Livestock also continued to
increase in the latter two decades of the 1800s. The historic Chisholm Trail crossed the northern
portion of the county. Railroads played an important role in the growth of the county. Railroads
arrived in Johnson County in 1881 when the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway crossed
the county. Entering into the twentieth century, Johnson County remained rural. The county’s
proximity to major urban areas such as Fort Worth and Dallas did not affect population growth,
and the county’s population remained more or less stable (Elam 2010).

Results—Johnson County

6.3.3 Rural Communities and the Agricultural Economy (1880-1950)
Settlement in the northeast corner of Johnson County was light, dominated by scattered
farmsteads and the nearby town of Mansfield in neighboring Tarrant County. In 1886, the
Fort Worth and New Orleans Railroad (shortly bought by the Houston and Texas Central,
and later transferred to the Texas and New Orleans Railroad) connected Mansfield to Fort
Worth and Waxahachie, providing area farmers with a shipping point for agricultural goods.
By the last decade of the nineteenth century, Mansfield was a prosperous agricultural hub with
a population of 1,000 (Hart 2010).
Agricultural opportunities attracted many initial settlers to the area with rich soils suited to
the cultivation of cotton, wheat, corn, oats, and a variety of other grain and cash crops. With
the coming of the railroads in the latter decades of the nineteenth century and establishment
of local shipping points at area towns, the stage was set for an explosion of agriculture. Field
cultivation soon came to dominate the area, fueled by farm tenancy, while ranching declined
and land holdings decreased to less than 100 acres on average. Despite the suitability of the
land for other crops such as corn and alfalfa, cotton quickly dominated as the cash crop. As
the price for cotton increased rapidly around the turn of the century, more farmers devoted the
majority (or entirety) of their holdings to growing the crop. Cotton became the driving force
behind the area’s economic prosperity, despite warnings from soil scientists against a singlecrop focus.
Cotton remained the dominant crop through the first decades of the twentieth century, although
several factors began driving prices down. The boll weevil, introduced to Texas in the late
nineteenth century, had spread to most of the cotton-producing areas by 1922, damaging crops
and reducing yields (Britton et al. 2010). Government controls also reduced the amount of
cotton that could be grown, while market share was simultaneously threatened by foreign
competition. Although World War I produced a short spike in demand, many farmers turned
away from cotton by the 1920s. The Great Depression further affected cotton’s prominence,
as farmers abandoned fields for other lines of work or shifted them over to different crops at
the urging of soil studies and demonstration farms (Dallas Morning News 1941:177, 204–
207). Farm sizes remained small during this time—less than 90 acres on average—due to the
reliance on animal labor as opposed to tractors and other forms of mechanization (Brooks et
al. 1962:71).
As the Depression set in and many tenant farmers left the fields for the cities, ranching returned
to prominence as landowners put their once-cultivated fields to other uses. Cattle proved
popular, as the fields provided ample forage for both beef and dairy herds. The packing plants
at nearby Fort Worth provided a convenient way of getting beef cattle to market from the
surrounding farms.
What farms remained during this period also underwent significant changes. Mechanization
allowed farmers to work larger fields and a wider variety of crops. The average farm size
increased to over 250 acres. Buildings devoted to animal husbandry on farms gave way to
machine shops and tractor barns. Fields once set aside for feed crops to support draft animals
136

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

could now be reclaimed for added income. This added capacity, in many instances, actually
had a negative, cyclical impact on farm income during the 1930s as increased supply drove
prices down. Farmers responded by working more, and producing more, which in turn drove
prices down further (Stiglitz 2012). Staple crops like legumes and wheat, and forage crops
such as clover replaced large portions of the region’s cotton acreage. Even with the effects of
the Depression, the area was still primarily rural with an agrarian economy on the eve of World
War II and agriculture remained the driving economic force in the immediate post-war years.

6.3.4 The Rise of Suburbia (1942–1970)
World War II prompted major changes to the region’s economy that only accelerated in the
post-war years. The war brought heavy manufacturing industries, particularly aviation-related
factories, to the Fort Worth area. Many of these industries switched production from war
materials to commercial goods and support in the years following the war. Farmers in small
communities, battered by years of economic depression, moved to cities in search of work and
the population of small communities shrank.
As cities such as Dallas and Fort Worth grew in size, Mansfield (long stuck at a low
population due to its agricultural focus) began shifting to a new role as bedroom community
to its neighbors. Newly created jobs resulted in the need for new housing. Combined with the
general post-war housing boom, the parallel economic boom of the 1950s saw tremendous
growth in the region’s suburbs and roadways (Hightower 2008). The mass number of selfcontained residential neighborhoods built during the 1950s had, by the 1960s, transformed
American suburbia. Farm and ranch land began giving way to new suburban development
to house the ever-increasing population. Gone were the connections to the inner city, made
obsolete by regional shopping centers connected to neighborhoods by highways, freeways, and
expressways. Suburban industrial parks and office buildings in the 1960s further decentralized
the city’s population, leading to a commuting workforce and “freeway suburbs” (Korfmacher
and Root 2006:6).

6.4 	Previous Cultural Resource Research
6.4.1 Previous Surveys
Only one previous archeological survey is documented within the IPL corridor in Johnson
County. This survey, conducted on behalf of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) in 2005 for a proposed pipeline, parallels the IPL corridor before crossing it at FM 917.

6.4.1 Known Archeological Sites
Based on the THC Sites Atlas, two previously recorded archeological sites (41JN54 and
41JN56) exist within one kilometer of the proposed IPL pipeline corridor within Johnson
County. Both of these sites are located outside of the 450-foot evaluation corridor.

Archeological Survey Observations

6.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
Though the final proposed IPL pipeline corridor passes through a very short section of Johnson
County, archeologists surveyed a larger area as the original Section 11, which passes entirely
through the county, was wholly abandoned and moved to its final route farther to the west. A
total of 376 shovel tests were excavated within the county, following standard survey methods.
One archeological site was recorded within the county (41JN71) outside of the proposed final
IPL permanent easement. As described in Chapter 1, below is a very brief summary of the results
of the survey within the county with the discussion instead focusing on the resources identified.
In all instances, unless stated otherwise, the assessed parcels were intensively surveyed through
surface inspection and shovel testing in accordance with the methods described in Chapter
4. The reader should refer to Appendix A for detailed shovel test distribution maps and site
locational data and Appendix D for detailed survey observations (soils, disturbance, etc.).
Johnson County Line to FM 917
At the county line, the proposed final IPL corridor extends immediately east of an existing
overhead electrical line. The survey corridor in this area passes partially within the cleared,
maintained powerline easement with excellent surface visibility and partially in the dense,
wooded, unmaintained private property area with poor surface visibility (Figure 6.3). In fact,
much of the IPL corridor follows existing overhead power or buried utility lines in this region
with archeologists abandoning subsurface tests in those areas found to be clearly disturbed
(i.e. Parcels 983-987, 1066;
Figure 6.4). In open, grassy
fields (beginning in the
vicinity of Parcel 987; Figure
6.5), lush ground-covering
vegetation made surface
visibility poor. However,
abundant disturbance limited
the shovel tests that were
conducted.

Occasionally, land was actively
farmed, including a corn field in

was more frequent in this area,
with archeologists noting a modern
industrial facility disturbing the
northern half of the survey corridor

construction impacts evident in
Parcels 213 and 214. None of the

Shovel Test D995E50 shows a typical soil column for the developed area consisting of 30
centimeters of clay (10YR 4/2) overlying compact clay (10YR 6/8) that is interpreted as sterile
subsoil. Farther east, the land is flat and open, composed of broad pasture land. Shovel Test
1007OT1 contained a typical soil column for this area consisting of 30 centimeters of plow
zone (10YR 3/2) overlying a dense, uniform silty clay (10YR 4/3) (interpreted as subsoil) that
extended to the shovel test terminus at 80 cmbs. At the time of survey, many of the parcels had
recently been plowed, providing excellent (>80 percent) surface visibility. In those areas (i.e.,
Parcel 1010), the crews relied on surface survey, finding no evidence of archeological sites in
the vicinity.

Survey crews paid particular attention to the IPL pipeline in the vicinity of Mountain Creek as
backhoe trenching might have been required if deep sediments were observed. Approximately
90 percent of this area was clear pastureland that had been plowed previously, but was covered
in short grasses (Figure 6.10). Soils consisted of thick blackland clay that transitioned to more
gravelly and thicker clays at approximately 30 centimeters that were determined to be sterile
subsoil. Several rolling hills end at or near the survey corridor, which contained even shallower
potentially Holocene soils. Only a small sliver of Parcel 1016, closest to Mountain Creek
had older growth trees and appeared to be undisturbed with deep sediments, the IPL corridor
corresponds closely with an existing pipeline in this area. As a result, backhoe trenching was
unwarranted.

consistency: a dark brown
clay loam with small sandstone gravels. Beneath this, at roughly 40–60 centimeters, lay a
lighter, pale brown clay loam that was interpreted as sterile subsoil. At the time of survey,
the abandoned Section 11 contained a northern line that was intended to connect to TRWDowned pipeline facilities near Mathis Road. Within Parcels 229 through 232, archeology crews
documented open agricultural fields that sloped inward toward a small drainage that constitutes
Parcel 232. In the fields, surface visibility was excellent (80 percent) while it was poor closer
to the channel (20 percent). Soils within Parcels 229, 230, 231, and 232 were mostly a dense
clay (10YR 3/3 or 10YR 4/3). Some shovel tests within 232 yielded clay (10YR 5/3) that
was mottled with a basal clay (7.5YR 5/8). In this area, archeologists recorded A230IF3 (see
below).

6.5.2 Backhoe Trenching Effort
Prior to fieldwork, archeologists anticipated that backhoe trenching would be required in the
vicinity of Mountain Creek (within Parcel 1015); however, pedestrian surveyors were able to
contact sterile subsoil using shovel testing alone while buried pipelines in the floodplain area
disturbed soils within the proposed impact corridor. As a result, backhoe trenching was not
conducted within Johnson County.

Identified Archeological Resources

Surveyors documented one historic-age archeological site (41JN71) and a single historic-age
isolated find (A230IF3) within Johnson County (Table 6.2). Both resources are located outside
of the project’s proposed final footprint and will not likely be impacted by construction. A brief
summary of each cultural resource is provided below.

Resource Description

6.6.1 Archeological Sites Outside of the 150-foot Direct Effects Footprint
Site 41JN71 is a small historic-age farmstead with a moderately dense accumulation of historic
surficial household debris, construction material, and a complement of shallowly-buried
artifacts. The site is located within an existing gas pipeline easement on the western edge of
the evaluation corridor in Segment 11 outside of the 450-foot evaluation corridor (Figures 6.11
and 6.12). Occupying an area of approximately 70 x 30 meters (north/south x east/west), the
site is situated within a drainage in a small wooded area between two existing, heavily disturbed
gas pipeline corridors. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 20 percent.
According to the USDA Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Houston black clay with
0–1 percent slopes. Observations
from site shovel tests revealed a
typical soil column consisting
of 30 centimeters of clayey
sand (10YR 4/3) overlying
30 centimeters of clayey sand
(10YR 6/4). Beneath the clayey
sand (at 60 cmbs) is a dense,
reddish (7.5YR 5/6), iron-rich
clay interpreted as sterile subsoil.
Surface manifestations of Site
41JN71 include a scatter of
diffuse, historic domestic and
construction debris including 10
orange-paste “TEXAS” bricks,
50 pieces of unidentifiable
scrap metal, 2 plain whiteware
sherds, 50 clear and aqua bottle
glass shards, as well as milk
glass shards from three to four
containers (Figure 6.13 and
6.14), and an unidentified coin.
The brick is attributed to the
Texas Press Brick Company of
nearby Ferris, TX (bricknames.

bottle prevalent during the 1930s and the 1940s. Though the site contained no formal structural
features, archeologists did note an electrical box within the site boundary.
Archeologists excavated six shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41JN71 (Shovel
Tests WPT632, and OT1–OT5; Table 6.3). Of these, only one shovel test (OT2) contained
cultural materials including 50 clear glass shards and three brown bottle glass shards in the
upper 20 centimeters. Between 20–40 cmbs archeologists recorded 20 clear glass shards, one
blue transfer patterned whiteware sherd, and one piece of scrap metal.

Archeologists compared the mapped
boundary of Site 41JN71 to a 1940
aerial photograph and found that the
site lies along the eastern periphery of
a small farmstead residence (Figure
6.16). When compared to Figure 6.11,
it is evident that the main house area
has likely been destroyed by pipeline
construction. The remnants of the site
observed during the IPL survey could
be displaced from that recent activity
or are trash scatters dispersed over
years of agricultural activity.

From available information, Site 41JN71 is a nearly-destroyed, minor historic-age farmstead
scatter with no associated structural features. The site is likely a push pile deposited in the
drainage channel during previous pipeline construction episodes. Artifacts from the assemblage,
though numerous, are redundant and typical of a late nineteenth or early to mid-twentieth
century domestic site (likely the latter) with no distinctive characteristics that would refine this
estimate. Furthermore, the site is clearly destroyed and lacks any functional integrity. Given
the relatively common nature of sites such as this in this region, as well as its overall poor
condition, Site 41NJ71 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. The site is
located outside of the IPL’s permanent easement and therefore is not likely to be impacted by
construction. Thus, no further work is recommended for this site at this time.

6.6.2 Archeological Isolated Find
A230IF3 is a small, very diffuse surficial scatter of approximately 15 historic-age artifacts. The
artifacts are located outside of the 450-foot evaluation corridor within a plowed agricultural
field. In an area roughly 325 square meters in size, archeologists noted approximately three
pieces of indeterminate scrap metal, an iron nail or staple, a square-section spike or large nail,
three clear window glass shards, a clear glass bottle neck, and two undecorated whiteware sherds
(Figure 6.17). One clear bottle glass shard is embossed with “It’s Different…” indicating that
it is a Kravemor soft drink bottle that likely dates to the 1940s or 1950s (Retrohound 2012).

Additional shovel tests were
devoid of cultural materials
(C21, E13, F10, C22, and F9).
Observations made during
shovel testing revealed a typical
soil column of 40 centimeters
of clay (10YR 3/1) overlying
sterile subsoil clays (5YR 5/8).
While the find did contain
a relatively large number
of artifacts, their extremely
scattered distribution and overall
lack of interpretability allowed
archeologists to consider the
find a non-site isolate. Due to the
isolated find’s ephemeral nature
within an agricultural field and
the presence of artifacts common
to this region the isolated find is
considered ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. The
find will not likely be impacted
by construction and no further
work is recommended.

JN987 is an abandoned agricultural complex at the end of a private drive off CR 525. JN987-1
is a single-story, concrete masonry unit building with stucco siding, wood-frame windows and
doors, and a side-gabled roof with composite shingles. The doors and windows are missing
(Figure 6.18). JN987-2 is a circa 1965 single-story, wood-frame animal barn with corrugated
metal walls and roofing (Figure 6.19). Also on the property is a double-wide mobile home.
None of the buildings are occupied or in use, nor are they visible on a 1995 aerial of the
property. The property has no association with important historic events, trends, persons, or

Results of Field Investigations
Ellis County
East of Johnson County, the IPL corridor crosses into Ellis County’s northwest corner and
exits in its southeast corner (Figures 7.1–7.8). As with almost all counties along the proposed
IPL pipeline corridor, Ellis County’s portion includes two stages of construction, the Proposed
Action and the Future Action (proposed for construction at a yet-undetermined later date).
While the Future Action has not been finalized in Henderson and Anderson Counties (see
Chapters 9 and 10), the route through Ellis County, though deferred to a later date, is the
proposed footprint/alignment. Accordingly, the survey discussion will not be broken up into
differing descriptions relative to the corresponding action. The proposed IPL line passes south
of Midlothian, on to the southern Waxahachie outskirts, then proceeds south of Lake Bardwell
before entering Navarro County approximately 40 miles to the southeast of its origin. The
150-foot proposed permanent easement occupies an area of approximately 732 acres within
the county. Additional project components include the JB-3 and JB-4 Booster Pump Stations
and the MBR Balancing Reservoir site, adding approximately 637 additional acres. Like
Johnson County, the IPL corridor passes primarily through open agricultural fields and grazing
pastures, running occasionally near industrial complexes and residential locations. Overall,
archeologists and architectural historians surveyed approximately 4,474 acres during the IPL
survey within Ellis County, documenting 11 archeological sites (all of historic age), seven
isolated archeological finds, and 32 non-archeological historic-age resources. Below is a
brief summary of the county’s environmental and historical background along with a survey
narrative and detailed descriptions of identified resources.

7.1 	Pipeline Description
7.1.1 Proposed Final IPL 150-Foot Corridor
According to the design engineer, the proposed IPL corridor enters Ellis County near the
terminus of Section 11, south of US 287 (see Figures 7.1–7.8). The open-cut pipeline (all part
of the Proposed Action) meets at a “T” at the proposed JB-4 Balancing Reservoir site (part of
the Future Action; see below) with Section 12 travelling approximately 2.25 miles north where
the water will feed into existing pipeline facilities south of Joe Pool Lake. A small portion of
this line (approximately 800 linear feet) will be tunneled beneath US Highway 287. Within
Section 12, the proposed IPL pipeline passes through primarily open, agricultural fields in
upland settings that are intersected by small to medium-sized creeks.
Moving south of JB-4, IPL’s Section 13 passes midway between Midlothian and Venus, and
skirts the western edge of rolling hillsides in the vicinity of Mountain Peak before it transitions
to Section 14 near Angus Road, approximately 13 miles to the southeast. The proposed pipeline

will be installed through open-cut trenching within Section 13 with the pipeline passing through
open, plowed fields and variably-maintained grazing pasture. Near its eastern terminus, Section
13 meets the proposed MBR site that is planned for the vicinity of Parcel 929 (see below).
Section 14 continues approximately 11 miles in a southeastern direction and carries the IPL
pipeline south of Lake Waxahachie and the community that is its namesake. It passes under
IH-35 E near Parcel 348 and transitioning to Section 15 near the JB-3 East facility at Parcel
374. Like other major roadway crossings, the IPL’s intersection with IH-35 E will be tunneled
while the remainder of the Segment will be installed through open-cut trenching.
Continuing farther to the southeast, IPL’s Section 15 carries the pipeline to the Navarro County
Line, passing immediately south of Lake Bardwell. Over its 13-mile span, Section 15 roughly
parallels Waxahachie Creek, passing very close to the waterway and its associated floodplain
near Lake Bardwell.

7.1.2 Proposed Facility Sites
JB-4 Booster Pump Station
At the intersection of Segments 11-13, the IPL project’s proposed Future Action includes the
small, 49-acre JB-4 booster pump station (Figures 7.9–7.10). As summarized in Chapter 1, the
booster pump station serves to pull water from the pipe and push it farther down the line when
elevation does not permit gravity-assisted runs. This site includes the pump facilities, access
roads, storage buildings, and a helipad. Impacts are anticipated to be similar to that of the
pipeline itself with underground pipes meeting with the pumping facilities within the property
at similar depths while more extensive impacts are anticipated at or immediately below the
ground surface from the access roads, buildings, and other elements.
MBR Midlothian Balancing Reservoir
Near the eastern terminus of Section 14 near the intersection of Baucum and Curtis Ray Roads,
the Proposed Action, 223-acre MBR site is designed to balance the water load of the IPL
system and maintain a relatively even flow through varying periods of precipitation (Figures
7.11–7.12). The proposed site will include three 150-million gallon reservoir chambers, supply
and release pipelines, water control sluices and other facilities, all of which will be newlyadded for the IPL project within an open upland pasture area. Additional components include
a control building, a helicopter pad, a communication tower, and chemical feed elements.
Impacts, like at the KBR site, will be approximately 30 feet deep with some structures rising
well above the prevailing grade.

capacity each) held within 250-foot-wide earthen berms that will most likely be similar to those
of the existing KBR site (see Figure 5.6). Additional elements include maintenance roads,

7.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
Portions of the IPL project within Ellis County went through several variations during the
refinement process and many now-abandoned alternatives were at one time under consideration.
While many small shifts were considered during the evaluation process (i.e., Parcels 340–341,
405, 419), larger footprints (particularly in association with the various preliminary facility
site locations) and wholesale route alternatives were also considered at one time or another. As
design teams considered pipeline routes out of the JB-4 facility, archeologists were instructed
to survey all of the adjacent parcels to which access had been granted. This gave the design
teams a route that was clear for the final proposed pipeline corridor. Within Parcels 242 and 244
(north of the JB-4 site) and Parcels 246–247 (south of the JB-4 site), archeologists surveyed
400 acres (62 acres north and 338 acres south; see Figure 7.1) of open, plowed agricultural
fields, excavating 129 shovel tests that were devoid of archeological materials within dense
clays (10YR 2/2). With no archeological sites identified, TRWD was clear to plan the proposed
pipeline without cultural resource constraints.
Moving south, into and beyond Parcel 247, design teams briefly considered a five-mile
alternative route west of the current corridor, passing US 67 near V. V. Jones Road and rejoining
the current route near Parcel 278 (Figures 7.1-7.3). This route was partially surveyed, but was
found to pass over a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA) Superfund site and the alternative was eventually abandoned. A small,
1.6-mile route immediately to the southeast was also abandoned due to engineering constraints
associated with the challenging terrain.
As the MBR East site was undergoing design revisions, three alternative pipeline routes were
considered to run into and out of the facility (see Figures 7.3 and 7.4). The first alternative
followed the original pipeline corridor (Parcels 300–308) while a second moved to the northern
extent of the facility (Parcels 299, 304, 306–307, 930). TRWD eventually settled on the 2.6mile corridor that passes roughly through the MBR site’s midline (Parcels 300, 304, 306–307,
931, 1110–1112).
In the vicinity of IH-35 E, the original IPL pipeline was rerouted approximately 0.3 miles to
the north (Parcels 346–367; see Figures 7.5–7.6). At this location, TRWD initially considered
a northeastward spur to connect the pipeline to Lake Waxahachie, running through Parcels
357–363. This was eventually abandoned from consideration. A similar, much smaller spur
was also proposed to feed to Lake Bardwell near the Ellis/Navarro County Line, extending the
short 0.4-mile distance to the lake from Parcel 414. Like the other, this spur was eventually
abandoned in the design process.
Moving farther to the east, TRWD engineers considered two alternative locations for the JB-3
Booster Pump station (see Figure 7.6). While JB-3 East was eventually selected as the viable
candidate, approximately 440 acres of primarily open farmland in nearby Parcels 374, 873–877
were investigated as the JB-3 West candidate site.

7.2 	Environmental Summary
The project area within Ellis County is located on the Britton, Venus, Midlothian, Boz, Forreston,
Ennis West, Cryer Creek, and Emhouse 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles. Within Ellis County,
the proposed IPL corridor transects mostly rural tracts of land with intermittent residential and
commercial development. The project area crosses three major creeks within Ellis County.
These creeks are (from west to east): Soap Creek, Armstrong Creek, and Waxahachie Creek.

7.2.1 Ellis County Soil Summary
The proposed IPL corridor crosses two geological groups within Ellis County. Both the
Austin, Eagle Ford Group to the west and the Taylor Group to the east are Late Cretaceous in
geological age. The Taylor Group contains three different formations consisting of Neylandville
and Marlbrook Marls undivided (Knm), Wolfe City Sand (Kwc), and Ozan Formation (Ko)
(Barnes 1972). Also within this group, areas containing Fluviatile terrace deposits (Ot) and
Alluvium (Qal) can be found along Waxahachie Creek. These deposits have a high potential
to contain deeply buried archeological sites. The Austin, Eagle Ford Group consists of Austin
Chalk (Kau) and Eagle Ford Formation (Kef). Thirty-four different soils types (Table 7.1) can
be found within the proposed IPL corridor. The majority of soils represented within the project
area consist of Houston Black clay, Trinity clay, Austin silty clay, Eddy soils, and Ellis and
Heiden clays.

7.2.2 Ellis County Climate and Biota
Environmental conditions within Ellis County are similar to those described in more detail in
the previous Tarrant County discussion. The reader is directed to Chapter 5 for a representation
of the conditions typical of Ellis County.

7.2.3 Current Land Use
Ellis County is mostly made up of agricultural land devoted to farming and ranching. The land
stays rural from west to east with some slight urbanization in the Northwest portion around
Midlothian, Waxahachie, and Lake Bardwell.

7.3 	Historical Context
7.3.1 Early Settlement and Civil War (1836–1869)
Ellis County was home to Tonkawa Indians just prior to European settlement, although parties
of Waco, Bidais, Anadarkos, and Kickapoo Indians hunted in the area. Several land grants
were made beginning prior to the Texas Revolution in 1836 through the 1840s, first by the
Mexican government then by the newly established Republic of Texas. The county was

officially established on December 20, 1849, and organized in February of 1850; however, the
boundary was under dispute with neighboring Johnson County until the 1930s (Haaser 2010).
By 1859, all Native Americans had been relocated to Oklahoma, allowing for increased
settlement of Ellis County. Settlers came predominantly from the southern part of the United
States. Most settled along the rivers and streams in the county, grazing cattle on the rich
grasslands, and raising subsistence crops. These settlers also brought their slaves with them,

indirectly leading to strife during the Civil War years and during Reconstruction. Rumors
of slave insurrections in Waxahachie in 1860 led to the lynching of a number of blacks and
alleged anti-slavery whites. In 1861, Ellis County voted overwhelmingly in favor of secession
and many local men served the Confederacy during the Civil War (Haaser 2010). The county
also supported Confederate industries, such as a hat factory and a powder mill.

7.3.2 Arrival of the Railroads and the Agricultural Economy (1872–1950)
After the Civil War, Ellis County struggled with Reconstruction. During this time the economy
changed from livestock to an agricultural base. A large reason for this shift was the establishment
of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad in 1872, allowing for more expedient shipment of
crops to the rest of the state and beyond. An increase in immigration into the region in 1873
saw a shift to cotton production (Haaser 2010). As the price for cotton increased rapidly around
the turn of the century, more farmers devoted the majority (or entirety) of their holdings to
growing the crop. Cotton became the driving force behind the area’s economic prosperity,
despite warnings from soil scientists against a single-crop focus. By the turn of the century, the
county had over 6,000 farms and was one of the leading cotton growing regions in the nation.
The county continued to be primarily agricultural and rural from 1880–1930. The population
continued to grow, reaching 55,700 by 1920. Cotton remained the dominant crop through the
first decades of the twentieth century, although several factors began driving prices down. The
boll weevil, introduced to Texas in the late nineteenth century, had spread to most of the cottonproducing areas by 1922, damaging crops and reducing yields (Britton et al. 2010). Government
controls also reduced the amount of cotton that could be grown, along with increased foreign
competition. Although World War I produced a short spike in demand, many farmers turned
away from cotton by the 1920s. The Great Depression further affected cotton’s prominence, as
farmers abandoned fields for other lines of work or shifted them over to different crops at the
urging of soil studies and demonstration farms (Dallas Morning News 1941:177, 204–207).
Farm sizes remained small during this time, less than 90 acres on average due to the reliance on
animal labor (as opposed to tractors and other forms of mechanization; Brooks et al. 1962:71).
As the number of farms shrank, the survivors began to evolve and grow in size. Mechanization
allowed farmers to work larger fields and produce a wider variety of crops. The average farm
size increased to over 250 acres. Buildings devoted to animal husbandry on farms gave way to
machine shops and tractor barns. Fields once set aside for feed crops to support draft animals
could now be reclaimed for added income. Staple crops like legumes and wheat, and forage
crops such as clover, replaced large portions of the region’s cotton acreage. After World War II,
cattle ranching again increased in prominence, creating a more balanced and varied agricultural
economy.

7.3.3 Urbanization and Industry (1950–1970)
The declining number of farms in Ellis County during the Great Depression and following
decades meant many rural residents began moving to the cities seeking work. On the eve of
170

World War II, less than half the population lived in cities. By 1950, the balance had shifted and
more than half now lived in cities and urban centers. Rural electrification efforts ensured that 95
percent of the county had access to electricity by the mid-1950s, and most of the county’s roads
were paved by this point as well. Despite these modernization efforts, the county population hit
a low point of just over 40,000 by 1960. Agricultural diversity, however, had finally stabilized
the economy, and new industries began moving to Ellis County; including oil and gas drilling
and light manufacturing. The completion of IH 35 in 1970 helped cement the county as a
modern transportation corridor between Dallas and San Antonio, and many residents began
commuting to Dallas for work.

7.4 	Previous Cultural Resource Research
7.4.1 Previous Surveys
Previous archeological surveys documented within the IPL corridor in Ellis County consist
of a survey conducted on behalf of the FHWA in 1994 which crosses the IPL corridor at US
Highway 287. An area survey of Joe Pool Lake conducted on behalf of the Fort Worth office
of the USACE in 1979, overlaps the IPL corridor in two small areas. A survey conducted on
behalf of the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation (TDHPT) in 1976
crosses the IPL corridor at US 57. A linear survey conducted on behalf of the USDA Soil
Conservation Service in 1975 crosses the IPL corridor near Arrowhead Road southwest of
Waxahachie. A linear survey conducted on behalf of TDHPT in 1975 crosses the IPL corridor
at Highway 34 in Bardwell.

7.4.2 Previously Recorded Archeological Sites
Based on the Atlas, 29 previously recorded archeological sites exist within 1-kilometer of the
IPL proposed pipeline corridor and facility sites in Ellis County. Of these 29 archeological
sites, five (41EL88, 101, 155, and 248–249) are located within the 450-foot IPL evaluation
corridor. The remaining 24 archeological sites are within 1 kilometer of the 450-foot corridor.
All archeological sites located within the survey corridor are discussed in detail below.

7.5

Archeological Survey Observations

7.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
Within Ellis County, the IPL project includes a relatively large number of project components
including 40 miles of pipeline and three facility sites (MBR East, JB-3, and JB-4). The
archeological survey effort within Ellis was among the most intensive of the the six counties
in terms of field effort. Crews excavated over 3,000 shovel tests and documented a variety
of primarily historic-age resources in a generally broad, open, rolling upland setting. Below
is a very brief summary of the survey results within the county. In all instances, unless stated
otherwise, the assessed parcels were intensively surveyed through surface inspection and

shovel testing in accordance with the methods described in Chapter 4. The reader should refer
to Appendix A for detailed shovel test distribution maps and site locational data. Please see
Appendix D for detailed survey observations (soils, disturbance, etc.).
Johnson County Line to JB-4 Site
The proposed final IPL corridor crosses into Ellis County at the eastern-most terminus of
Section 11 as it passes into the proposed JB-4 site (see below). Along the 600-meter corridor,
the archeologists crossed
a small open field with a
modern storage building
along the southern edge of
the corridor (Figure 7.15).
Shovel tests in this area
(n=10) were shallow, upland
clays overlying bedrock. All
tests in the area were devoid
of archeological resources.
Section 12 - JB-4 Site
to Joe Pool Lake
Moving north from the
JB-4 site, the proposed IPL
pipeline corridor’s Section 12
was first surveyed as a broad
area survey through Parcels
242 and 244 as TRWD
engineers sought a clear route
away from the proposed
facility site. Within the two
parcels (particularly within
Parcel 244), archeologists
found extensive modern
disturbances from active
quarrying activities and
dumping (Figure 7.16).
In less impacted areas, the
archeologists excavated 69
shovel tests (all negative),
finding a soil column (e.g.,

centimeters of gravelly, dense clay (10YR 4/4 or 4/3) interpreted as sterile subsoil. Continuing
north, survey crews paid particular attention to the conditions of the Mountain Creek floodplain.
While the IPL’s previous crossing called for backhoe trenching within Parcel 110 (see Chapter
5), all shovel tests in the immediate vicinity of the waterway were able to contact the sterile
subsoil as the pipeline corridor rides the upper edge of the creek terrace, overlooking deeper
sediments to the east. Due
to the extent of disturbance
and the condition of soils
in the area, trenching was
considered unnecessary at
this crossing.
North of Mountain Creek,
the IPL pipeline passes
immediately north of the
historic-age
Saint
Paul
Cemetery. The cemetery
was evaluated by AmaTerra
architectural
historians
during evaluation of roadway
improvements along US 287
(Figure 7.17), providing the
following description of the
existing resource:

Figure 7.17. 2011 Photograph of Saint Paul Cemetery, located
outside of the IPL survey corridor (from Korfmacher 2011).

“...the small, rectangular, informally-planned Anglo Christian cemetery is
bounded by a steel chain link fence, with access provided by a double chain
link swing-gate with a wrought-iron lich gate. Grave markers are a mix of
commercial and handmade; materials include cast concrete, stone, and metal,
in various conditions. The graves are aligned in north-south rows with the
majority facing east, although several face west as well. Marked graves date
from the mid-1870s to the present. Unmarked graves likely exist within the
confines of the cemetery due to sunken depressions suggesting collapsed
burials. Some of the burials are for World War I or II veterans, with a variety
of fraternal orders represented as well. The cemetery is still in use with recent
burials. Historic aerials show a church (identified as St. Paul Church) once
existed on the land due north across St. Paul Road, but the chapel and any
associated buildings have since been demolished. An OTHM marker in the
cemetery states a school was once adjacent to the cemetery as well (also no
longer extant)” (Korfmacher 2011:21–22).
The Saint Paul Cemetery is located on the south side of Saint Paul Road, approximately 80
meters outside of the easternmost edge of the proposed IPL corridor and approximately 100
meters east of the eastern edge of the proposed IPL permanent easement. Archeologists found
the pipeline’s evaluation corridor in the cemetery vicinity to be well away from the marked

boundary and an additional
parcel boundary separates
the permanent easement
from the existing cemetery
fence. Surveyors noted no
depressions or evidence of
alteration that would suggest
that unmarked graves are
present (Figure 7.18; as
was described in the 2011
historic survey). None of the
four shovel tests excavated
near the cemetery contained
any artifacts or indications of
burials. Soils are described
in Shovel Test F238B85 as

loam overlying 10YR 5/7
clay subsoil (terminating at
40 centimeters). Located far
from the marked cemetery boundary and in a seemingly unaltered context, the IPL permanent
easement has minimal potential for impacting the cemetery or unmarked graves. Additional
investigations, such as broad exposures from backhoe trenchingm are not recommended.
North of Saint Paul Road, the Saint Paul Church once stood in the rectangular parcel that
partially crosses into the southern portion of the IPL evaluation corridor (see Figure 7.1). Being
outside of the final proposed 150-foot permanent easement, right-of-entry was never pursued
for the now-abandoned church parcel and archeologists were unable to conduct direct survey
at that location. Archeologists instead limited all evaluation to Parcel 238, which surrounds the
church lot to the north and west. Within the accessible parcel, archeologists found conditions
similar to those of the neighboring Parcel 239 (Figure 7.19). Within the four tests excavated
near the abandoned church site, none contained artifacts or indications that historic features or
foundations are location within the proposed permanent easement. No additional investigations
are warranted in this area as the construction will not likely impact the historic resource.
Moving north, current design indicates that the IPL pipeline will be tunneled beneath Highway
287 then open-cut trenched to its terminus approximately 1.3 miles to the north (Figures 7.20–
7.21). Along this portion of the segment, archeologists found unmaintained scrub pastures
(Parcel 1054) and recently-plowed fields with excellent surface visibility. Modern disturbance
from agricultural activities were the most prevalent, though a large water tank with an earthen
berm surrounding it is located immediately east of the evaluation corridor in Parcel 1053. Along
this segment, archeologists excavated 42 shovel tests with a typical soil column (Shovel Test
D1053D154) consisting of 30 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 4/3) overlying clay subsoil.
All shovel testing in this area indicates that sediments are ancient, upland varieties that have
been adversely impacted by repeated plowing. Surface visibility in this area increased with

terminus, TRWD engineers
propose to install a 25-acre
tie-in facility that will connect the IPL pipe to the existing TRWD pipeline. Since archeology
crews had conducted a survey in the pipeline corridor leading to the site and found it to be
open, shallow uplands in disturbed, plowed fields, a field survey of the site was not warranted.
Archeologists considered that construction at the proposed tie-in had a very low potential
for impacting intact, significant archeological deposits and recommended that survey was
unnecessary.

Section 13 - JB-4
Site to MBR Site
Moving south of the JB-4
site, Section 13 begins in a
manner similar to Section
12, with TRWD engineers
requesting a broad area
survey to locate a cleared
pipeline corridor. Within
Parcel 247, archeological
field crews found active,
plowed agricultural fields
and open pastures. Shovel
tests in the area continued to
be shallow upland clays that
were devoid of archeological
resources. Beyond Parcel

into evaluating the standard
450-foot corridor. Along
the proposed final corridor,
archeologists
surveyed
approximately 3.7 miles of
pipeline corridor, excavating
139 shovel tests before
reaching US 67. In this area,
the terrain was characterized
as gently-rolling, plowed,
agricultural fields in broad,
contiguous parcels. Closer
to the highway, smaller
pastures and commercial
buildings were noted (e.g.,

rises southward. Shovel Test
248F125 shows a typical
soil column for this area
consisting of 30 centimeters of clay loam (5YR 4/2), interpreted as the plow zone, and continues
with the same color clay to its terminus at 50 cmbs. Soils in this area consist of Houston black
clay with various slopes.
Along the proposed final corridor, archeologists also intensively investigated a now-abandoned
pipeline route farther to the west. Along this three-mile route, archeologists found similar
rolling hills, variably maintained pastures, and planted fields. In Parcels 247 and 248, field
crews excavated 102 shovel
tests, encountering shallow,
upland clays that were devoid
of archeological materials.
South of Highway 67, the
proposed IPL final corridor
passes adjacent to a large
industrial and shipping
complex with an associated
railroad (Parcels 266-277;
Figure 7.22). In this area, the
pipeline skirts along the edge
of a flat lowland prairie (to the
west) and an abrupt rolling
rise (to the east; Figure
7.23). Soils continue to be
dense upland clays typical of
the region with archeologists

Archeologists
excavated
118 shovel tests between US
67 and CR 875. Adjacent to
the industrial complex area,
archeologists documented
one minor, surficial historicage archeological isolate
(D275IF1).

A small portion of the pipeline
corridor was also surveyed,
but ultimately abandoned, near CR 875. Across Parcels 275–292, archeologists found that the
IPL survey corridor passed into the higher uplands. Surface visibility was moderate to low due
to dense grasses, but soils were very shallow exposed bedrock visible in many areas. Overall,
the survey crew excavated 51 shovel tests in this abandoned corridor with none containing
archeological materials.

South of CR 875, the IPL
pipeline continues another
three miles to the MBR
facility site (see below).
Along this portion of the
survey, archeologists found
several tall, grassy pastures
with sparse tall mesquite
trees (Figure 7.24). The
landform had a very gentle

centimeters. TRWD requested
environmental teams survey three
alternative approaches to the
MBR site, ultimately choosing
the central alternative. All three
passed through similar upland
pasture settings with shallow
soils and occasional exposed
bedrock (Figure 7.25). All three
alternative routes were devoid of
archeological materials.
Section 14 - MBR Site to JB-3
Site

Figure 7.25. Photograph of the MBR facility
site western pipeline approach.

As the IPL pipeline exits the
proposed MBR facility site along
the central proposed alternative
in Parcel 304, the corridor passes through open, upland prairies interrupted by minor, ephemeral
drainages. Soils were shallow, contacting bedrock at approximately 20–40 centimeters below
the surface (Parcels 303–307). Surface visibility was generally excellent (>60 percent) with
surveyors not conducting any subsurface tests in some areas. As the alternatives join with
the preferred pipeline corridor, survey conditions continue in a similar manner (open, upland
pastures and plowed agricultural fields) across the approximately 6.5-mile stretch to the
pipeline’s crossing at IH-35 E south of Waxahachie. Archeologists noted that the land was
primarily unaltered beyond minor agricultural activities; however, blading and grading noted
in Parcel 315 reduced shovel testing intensity in the vicinity. Of the approximately 543 shovel
tests excavated between the MBR site and IH-35 E, all were devoid of archeological materials,
except for the three positive tests dug within the marked boundary of previously-recorded
Site 41EL88 (see below). Shovel Test A320A194 contained a typical soil column for this area
consisting of 35 centimeters of pale brown silty loam (10YR 4/2) overlying bedrock at 30
cmbs. The AmaTerra team investigated an early booster pump station site alternative that was
ultimately abandoned in Parcel 335, excavating an additional 48 shovel tests (all devoid of
archeological materials).
Continuing east, the IPL corridor will be tunneled beneath IH-35 E before resuming open-cut
trenching in Parcel 352 and continuing on another 4.5 miles to the JB-3 facility site. Archeologists
found the area to consist of open, plowed fields and grazing pastures (Figure 7.26). Survey
crews often investigated massive, recently-plowed agricultural fields with excellent (nearly
100 percent) surface visibility that extended as far as the eye could see in this portion of the
pipeline. Due to seasonal rains, progress in some locations was severely inhibited by standing
water and sticky clays that required hand-sorting rather than screening (Figure 7.27). Along
with the 294 shovel tests excavated along the proposed final corridor, archeologists also
investigated a short, abandoned southern corridor and the abandoned lateral connecting to Lake

overlying very dense clay

passes the two JB-3 site
alternatives (the eastern
being the selected alternative
[see below]), the terrain
and subsurface conditions
continue in a similar manner.
No archeological sites were
documented in this area, nor
were any isolated finds.

was a buried gas line that crosses the IPL corridor at a shallow angle in Parcels 401 and 402.
Over this 5.2-mile length, archeologists excavated 292 shovel tests along the preferred corridor
and an additional 116 tests along several small abandoned segments. Shovel Test C410F786
contained a typical soil column for this area, consisting of 40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR
4/3) with increasing density with depth; interpreted as sterile. Archeologists briefly revisited
two previously-recorded archeological sites and newly-documented a third in this portion of
the survey (Sites 41E248, 249, and 261; all historic-age, see below).

pale brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam from the surface to the 80-centimeter terminus. Though
archeologists excavated 268
shovel tests east of CR 985,
backhoe trenching was also
employed to fully assess the
pipeline’s impacts to deep
sediments as the floodplain
soils were too dense and
deep to be fully assessed
through
hand-excavation
alone (see below). No
archeological
sites
or
features were documented
within this portion of the

JB-4 Site Survey
Field archeologists surveyed
the proposed JB-4 facility

965 with crews investigating
the remaining portion of
Parcel 245 outside the normal
450-foot evaluation corridor
subsequent to centerline
survey (Figure 7.30). In
addition to work previously
conducted,

station location, the team did
not encounter any cultural
resources on or below the
ground’s surface. The study area has been impacted by cultivation activities and the construction
of two small stock tanks, which are located within the northern and north central portions of
the tract. The construction of these tanks likely impacted the shallow sediments nearby, further
reducing the area’s archeological integrity. No prehistoric or historic archeological resources
were encountered within Parcels 245 or 965.
Within the one-half-mile anticipated APE for indirect visual effects, two historic-age resources
were recorded (EL245a-1 and EL245a-2). The two resources are located on the unnumbered
parcel west of Parcel 245 (see below). Resource EL245a-1 is a frame livestock barn with a
corrugated metal roof. The barn was likely constructed around 1945. On the same parcel is
Resource EL245a-2, a small farm complex containing a barn and metal silo, likely dating to
circa 1945. Non-historic age buildings are also part of this complex. The barns and silo are no
longer associated with an intact, architecturally and historically significant farm.
As design teams considered pipeline routes out of the JB-4 facility, archeologists were instructed
to survey all of the adjacent parcels to which access had been granted during their survey. This
action would provide the design teams a route clear of archeological and historical resources
suitable for the final proposed pipeline corridor. Within Parcels 242 and 244 (north of the JB-4
site) and Parcels 246–247 (south of the JB-4 site), archeologists surveyed 400 acres (62 acres
north and 338 acres south) of open, plowed agricultural fields, excavating 19 shovel tests that
were devoid of archeological materials within dense, shallow, upland clays (10YR 2/2) with
excellent surface visibility. No archeological sites were identified.

surface visibility and shallow
(20–50 centimeters) upland
clay loams overlying bedrock
(generally between 20–50 centimeters; Figure 7.31). None of the shovel tests were positive
for archeological artifacts or features and no surficial archeological elements were observed.
Architectural historians assessed the potential that construction would adversely impact
significant structures in the vicinity. Utilizing the approximately half-mile indirect effects APE
defined in Chapter 4, architectural historians found no structures that would warrant detailed
survey or consideration as eligible for listing on the NRHP. Three historic age structures were
identified south of Parcel 302 that are within the half-mile APE. Structure 302a-1 is a linear
corrugated metal barn/shed with a central breezeway. Structure 302a-2 is a carport that was
once adjacent to a house, but the main structure has since been removed. Finally, Structure
EL302a-3 is a near-modern (<59 years old) horse or tractor barn that is likely the same age as
Structure 302a-1.
Approximately 40 acres were added to the northern extent of the proposed MBR site following
field survey, but citing findings from the larger field effort (shallow, upland soils, agriculturerelated disturbance, etc.), archeologists determined that the potential for impacts to significant
archeological resources was very low and the area was not recommended for further survey.
JB-3 Site Survey
Project TRWD East and JB-3 West). Field archeologists surveyed both candidate locations
before the design team ultimately selected the JB-3 East site as the preferred alternative. For
the JB-3 East site, archeologists surveyed the entire proposed facility footprint (approximately
364 acres) over the course of three field visits, excavating 101 shovel tests through generally
shallow, dense upland clays and clay loams. Most of the candidate facility site had excellent
(>80 percent) surface visibility, being composed of recently plowed agricultural fields
182

(Figure 7.32). Given its upland setting, surface visibility was so high in some locations that
shovel testing was abandoned over relatively large expanses (approximately 50 acres). During
the JB-3 survey process, the archeology team encountered one minor historic age archeological
site (41EL257) and one historic age archeological isolated find (F383IF1). Several structures
potentially of historic-age were identified by historians using field photographs and detailed
aerial photography. However, when field-verified these were determined to be modern (post1960s) buildings.
The JB-3 West candidate location
was also surveyed by cultural
resource teams. Located within
Parcels 374, 375, 873, 874, and
876, the JB-3 West site occupies
approximately 440 acres of
undeveloped open agricultural
land that had largely been
impacted by farming activities
(Figure 7.33). Archeological
field crews investigated the entire
area, utilizing a combination
of surface inspection and
approximately 114 subsurface
shovel tests. Much of the
evaluation location was recently
plowed or otherwise offered
excellent
surface
visibility
allowing some segments to be
fully evaluated without shovel
testing. During the process, the
team encountered one minor
historic archeological isolated
find (C375IF1) consisting of
a small, surficial scatter of
historic-age brick and glass
(see below) while architectural
historians documented seven
adjacent historic structures
within the estimated half-mile
indirect effects APE. The seven
structures (EL876-1, EL876a-1,
EL876a-2, EL876a-3, EL873a-1,
EL873a-2, and EL873a-3) were
all minor domestic or agricultural
structures common in the site’s
rural setting (see below).

7.5.3 Backhoe Trenching
Approximately two miles of the IPL corridor pass through the Waxahachie Creek/Slough
floodplain southeast of Lake Bardwell. To investigate the project’s potential to impact deeplyburied archeological resources, archeologists excavated 12 backhoe trenches within Parcels
419–421, and 423, placing them roughly every 400 meters along what was the proposed pipeline
centerline (Figures 7.34–7.35). Subsequent to trenching, the centerline shifted slightly, but
observations from the field effort are considered close enough to the final proposed easement
to remain valid for the revised centerline. Though trenching continued east, those areas are
located within Navarro County and will be discussed in the following chapter. Due to the
size and significance of this floodplain, AmaTerra contracted the geomorphological consulting
services of Charles Frederick and Brittany Gregory, who assisted with trench excavation
(Figure 7.36). Their report is provided in its entirety as Appendix D, but their findings are
summarized below. Waxahachie Creek was the first area to be subject to backhoe trenching and

interpreting backhoe
trench in Parcel 421.

AmaTerra’s excavation subcontractor initially utilized a small machine, limiting the depth of
accessible exposure within Parcels 419–420 to approximately 260 centimeters (Figure 7.37).
A standard backhoe was employed for the remainder of excavations in the area, extending
exposed sediments from 260 to 340 centimeters.
According to Gregory and Frederick (this volume, Appendix D):
“...Waxahachie Creek valley is a broad, nearly flat surface that varies between 1–1.5 km
wide (0.6–1 mile) and has a low gradient (~6 feet per mile). The valley floor is neither
flat nor featureless and is crossed by shallow sinuous linear depressions that appear to
represent the former courses of both Waxahachie Creek and its tributary Onion Creek.
In recent times numerous flood control structures have been constructed in the valley to
restrict the flooding by Waxahachie, Onion and Chambers Creeks to relatively narrow
corridors, and this construction work also changed the location of the confluences of
these streams from their natural late Holocene courses. Today, the modern Waxahachie
channel is a narrow, incised meandering stream confined by levees on one or in a few
cases both sides. The floodplain rises between three to five meters above the modern
channel.”

Within the 13 trenches excavated in the county (Parcel 419: Trenches 419-1 through 419-6;
Parcel 420: Trenches 420-1 through 420-3; Parcel 421: Trenches 421-1 and 421-2; Parcel 422:
Trench 422-1; and Parcel 423: Trench 423-1), archeologists and geomorphologists noted a
generally consistent depositional pattern: a deep, Holocene soil profile, consisting of five to six
horizons that extended to the base of many of the trenches (roughly 300 centimeters). Trench
419-1 provides a typical profile for floodplain sediments on the right creek bank while Trench
421-1 provides a typical soil column for the left bank (Tables 7.2–7.3; Figures 7.38–7.39).

Results—Ellis County

Soils in this area can be broken down into four alluvial units: A–D (from oldest to youngest;
Table 7.4; Figures 7.40–7.41). Unit A, the oldest, is actually found outside of Ellis County
and will be discussed in more detail in the following chapter, however, the soils are considered
Pleistocene-age. Within Unit B (40-230 centimeters within Trench 420-3), surveyors noted a
leached A horizon and a Stage II calcic horizon that suggest Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene
age ranges. Unit C (40–270 centimeters in multiple trenches), found much more commonly
throughout the valley, was fine-grained cumulic floodplain sediment whose stratigraphic
position, appearance and degree of soil development are reminiscent of Pilot Point Alluvium
on the Trinity River and this deposit is most likely of Late Holocene-age. Finally Unit D (0–155
centimeters in multiple trenches), the youngest, and again found throughout the floodplain, is
likely deposited within the last millennium. Typifying the unit, investigators found the soils to
be strongly calcerous, pale, and weak with occasional exposures of a thin paleosol.
Archeologists found that they generally were unable to break through Holocene-age sediments
in any of the backhoe trenches. Cut bank exposures near the point that Ensign Road crosses
Waxahachie Creek suggest that the Holocene alluvial deposits are at least five to six meters
thick. No cultural material was unearthed during the trenching of Waxahachie Creek; however,
three of the four units discussed appear to have the potential to contain deeply buried prehistoric
archeological sites. Unit A (in Navarro County), which is probably of Late Pleistocene age,
is too old to contain archaeology, but depositional Units B, C, and D all appear to have the
potential contain in situ archaeological sites. With that said, it is unclear if extensive additional
trenching efforts in this floodplain would result in refined data regarding the project’s potential
for impacting such intact deposits.

Identified Archeological Resources

During the course of fieldwork, surveyors documented 11 historic-age archeological sites
within Ellis County (41EL88, 101, 155, 248, 249, 255, 257, and 259–261) and seven isolated
finds (Table 7.5). A continued paucity of prehistoric finds is consistent with archeological
models for the region, either through prehistoric groups’ preference to stay within proximity
to more varied terrain and a broader resource base than what would have been present within
much of Ellis County, or as a result of environmental impacts such as erosion (see Chapter 11).
A brief summary of each site is provided below.
As described above, the direct effects APE includes the 150-foot IPL permanent easement
and any facility site footprints. Those impacted resources include regulatory recommendations
while non-impacted resources are discussed for inventory purposes only, though SAL or NRHP
eligibility recommendations are often offered.

foundation, a stock tank, and a variety
of historic-age artifacts (e.g.,
whiteware sherds and pulled wire
nails). During AmaTerra’s revisit
in 2010, archeologists did not
observe any remnants of the house
or concrete foundations within the
proposed 150-foot IPL permanent
easement (Figure 7.42). However,
AmaTerra documented a large,
conspicuous oak tree within an open
dairy cattle pasture (Figure 7.43).
Near the pipeline’s centerline, in
a level grassy field, archeologists
did observe a small 20 x 25 meters
(north/south x east/west) surficial
scatter of historic-age artifacts. The
scatter is located approximately 50
meters south of the THC-mapped
site centroid. Local vegetation
consists of short grasses and sparse
oak trees. Overall, surface visibility
was estimated at approximately
51–75 percent. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils
within the site vicinity are Upper
Cretaceous, Eddy gravelly clay
loam and residuum weathered from
Austin Chalk. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 20 centimeters
of dense, gravelly clay loam (10YR
4/2) overlying 15 centimeters of
dense clay (10YR 3/2). Shovel tests
typically terminated at 45 cmbs upon
encountering degraded bedrock.
Modern disturbances include cattle
trampling and, citing the broad
diffusion of surface artifacts and a
lack of features, possible bulldozing
or plowing.

piece of steel pipe, and clear glass shards (Figures 7.44–7.45). According to Hardy Heck &
Moore (2012), PALMER bricks were made by the Palmer Pressed Brick Company, which
operated under that name from 1902–1929. Several pieces of cement were located several
hundred meters outside of the survey corridor and are probably associated with this site as well.
Archeologists excavated 15 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41EL88 (OT1-13,
C183, E192; Table 7.6). Of these, three shovel tests contained cultural materials within the
upper 40 centimeters of sediments (OT2, OT3, and OT6). Shovel Test OT2 contained one
shard of clear bottle glass in the upper 20 centimeters. Shovel Test OT3 contained two sherds
of non-diagnostic undecorated whiteware and one aqua glass shard in the upper 40 centimeters.
Lastly, Shovel Test OT6 contained one cut nail in the upper 20 centimeters, suggesting that the
site (or some component thereof) may date to the late nineteenth century. All other shovel tests
were devoid of cultural materials.

In conducting their interpretation of Site 41EL88, AmaTerra archeologists consulted modern
aerial photography depicting the site vicinity and noted a prominent grouping of trees and
discolored soil in a distinct right-angled, 100 x 100-foot square shape outside of the survey
corridor approximately 60 meters north of the current THC site centroid (and more than 100
meters north of the additional site components observed in the 2010 AmaTerra field visit;

see Figure 7.42). This geometric grouping is most likely the “house site” (or more accurately
the yard surrounding the house) recorded in 1990 and the centroid has been mis-plotted.
Additionally, archeologists consulted a 1940 aerial photograph of the site vicinity and see that
the overgrown area does correspond with a structure, though the structure appears to be more
likely a barn (Figure 7.46). The residence on the property is likely located at the end of the
prominent parking loop farther north.
The chain of title for the land on which Site 41EL88 is located was difficult to unravel as there
were numerous gaps and incongruities, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s. Located on
the John Estes Survey, the land, being part of the proposed Superconducting Supercollider
corridor, was briefly owned by the federal government during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The government won an imminent domain lawsuit against the then-owner Kars and Grace
Tamminga. The Tamingas purchased the property from Joyce Jones in October of 1986 (Volume
755, Pg. 996), who had previously purchased the property from Thomas A. Ewers in late 1977
(Volume 617, Pg. 31). Ewers was the highest bidder on the property when the then owners, Ann
and Nelson Dunn were unable to provide payment for the mortgaged property and the land was
auctioned (Volume 607, Pg.
422). Though they owned
the land since 1959 (Volume
217, Pg. 273), the Dunns
had persistent financial
difficulties, having Nelson
Dunn Senior as a co-signor
on the original mortgage
and taking out a second note
immediately after paying off

in 1901 (Volume 128, Pg. 104). According to the deed record for the September 1951 sale of
the land from D.H. Gross to J.O. Turner (Volume 419, Pg. 564), Gross had a small house on
the property that was to be moved following the sale:
“... In being agreed that a two-room boxed servant’s house with metal roof, located on
said premises... belongs to grantors herein and they shall have the privilege of moving
said house off of said land at their convenience...”						
							
Deed Record (Volume 419, Pg. 565)
With Site 41EL88 likely occupied during the first half of the twentieth century, the site is
likely attributed to the Turner family, more specifically either J. C. or J. O. According to the
1920 United States Census, John C. Turner of the 5th Precinct in Ellis County, is listed as a
56-year-old farmer living with his wife, Mattie, daughter Ethel (21), son Bennie (20), and son
J. O. (17). J. O. Turner, in the 1940 U.S. Census, is listed as the 35-year-old head of household,
married to Kathleen (age 42). J. O. is listed as a sharecropper while his father, J. O. is listed as
a farm operator. Dan H. Gross is listed in the 1940 census as a 67-year-old operator of a cotton
yard and storage facility while 20 years earlier he is described as a farm laborer (possibly
a sharecropper). Gross likely worked on J. C. Turner’s property for some time and briefly
purchased the land before transferring it to J. O. near the end of his life.
It is possible that the cultural materials of Site 41EL88 are associated with the servants’ house
that was removed from the property by D.H. Gross shortly after he sold the land to J.O. Turner.
Alternatively, lacking any foundation elements within the survey corridor, and no identified
structures at the recorded site location on the 1940 aerial photograph, the site extension
is more likely simply dumped construction debris from the abandoned house to the north.
Regardless, the components of Site 41EL88 within the IPL impact corridor are not considered
to be archeologically significant. All materials are limited to the ground surface or shallow
contexts and are composed of common historic site materials such as glass shards, undecorated
whiteware sherds, occasional cut nails, and brick fragments. Further investigations in this area
would not yield additional, new data about the region or its early twentieth century inhabitants.
Additionally, the Turner and Gross families are not considered historically significant.
Accordingly, the site is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Though this
portion of the site is likely to be impacted by construction, no further work is recommended at
this time.
41EL101
Site 41EL101, a previously recorded site, consists of a small historic-age farmstead remnant
with a moderate accumulation of surficial household debris and construction material (Figures
7.47–7.48). Three features are associated with the site: a can and bottle scatter (Feature 1), a
cistern remnant just to the north (Feature 2), and a well or cistern (Feature 3). Occupying an area
of approximately 140 x 100 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated on a level rise
between two plowed fields. Local vegetation consists of mesquite and cedar trees not exceeding
40 years in age with mixed grasses and greenbriar. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at
approximately 26–50 percent; with grasses and leaf litter the most common visual obstructions.

site. The only cultural feature
observed at the time of their survey was
a cistern. Artifacts observed at the time
included manganese bleached glass,
wine bottle glass, whiteware sherds, a

feature consists of approximately 150
tin cans, 40–50 red PALMER bricks,
and 100 clear and milk glass bottles/
shards. Feature 2 is a cistern in very
poor condition approximately 10 meters
north of Feature 1 (Figure 7.50). With
the remaining components barely more
than a soil depression that measures
approximately 10 feet in diameter and
two feet deep, the cistern is comprised
of one surficial red PALMER brick
and a metal pipe approximately seven
feet in length. Feature 3 is a small well
or cistern located along the northern
boundary of the site approximately 122
meters northwest of Features 1 and 2 (see
Figure 7.50). Like Feature 2, Feature 3
is in poor condition with only a small
portion visible in an otherwise 10-footdiameter depression in the surrounding
grade. Upon close inspection, stone
courses are just visible above the soil
and leaf litter (Figure 7.51).

rusted, unidentified tin cans, PALMER
bricks, and corrugated metal. From the archeological assemblage, it is clear that Site 41EL101
is a post-1900 occupation site that more likely dates to the latter 1930s or 1940s. As stated
previously Palmer Brick Company was established in 1902 and changed their name to the
Barron Brick Company in 1929 (HHM 2012). Archeologists observed a hobbleskirt CocaCola bottle, which likely dates to the mid-twentieth century (Lockhart and Porter 2010), while
RC Cola was first introduced to the marketplace in 1934 (Royal Crown International 2010).
Finally, the “Early American Old Spice” milk glass bottle from the Shulton Company observed
amongst the scatter is the earliest product of the Old Spice brand, ironically targeting women,
which was introduced in 1937/1938 (Proctor and Gamble 2011).
Archeologists excavated eight shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41EL101 (OT1–
OT8). All of the shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials.

Like that of 41EL88, the chain of title
for the land on which Site 41EL101
is located was difficult to decipher.
However, key periods of site occupation
were linked to specific deed records,
allowing for archeologists to accurately
associate the site to individual occupants.
According to Ellis County deed records,
Site 41EL101 is located on land that
is currently owned by the Waxahachie
Independent School District. As
mentioned above, the land was at one
time included in the Superconducting
Figure 7.51. Photograph of stoneSupercollider land purchase and, in

turn, was briefly owned by
the federal government
(1991-1996, Volume 1303,
Pg. 314), who purchased
the tract from Sammy L.
Phillips in January of 1991.
At some time between 1982
and 1991, Phillips purchased
the property, presumably
from Robert Strauss, who
inherited the property from
the Richard Strauss Trust in
September of 1982 (Volume
679, Pg. 233). Prior to
Figure 7.52. Glass bottles associated with Feature 1.
Strauss, the land was owned
by the D. H. Gross family,
who purchased the property from a Charlie Turner in
April of 1951 (Volume 417, Pg. 395). The Turners, in turn
retained the property for 50 years when J. C. purchased the
plot from J.W. Coleman (Volume 128, Pg. 104).
With 41EL101 likely occupied during the 1930s or 1940s,
it is most likely that the site can be attributed to the Turner
family (more specifically either J.C. or Charlie). According
to the 1920 United States Census, John C. Turner of the
5th Precinct in Ellis County, is listed as a 56-year-old
farmer living with his wife, Mattie, daughter Ethel (21),
son Bennie (20), and son J. O. (17). Charley [sic] Turner is

Chapter 7

Results—Ellis County

a 27-year-old farmer living in the same precinct with his wife Myrtle (25). The previous census
(1910) shows a 17-year-old Charlie living with John at the same residence, suggesting that he
is John’s son.
Archeologists reviewed a 1940 aerial photograph of the site vicinity and observed numerous
structures near the recorded site boundary (Figure 7.54). Features 1 and 2, correspond with a
small, geometric-shaped discoloration in an otherwise open field, while Feature 3 is located
immediately south of an apparent barn. The surficial brick scatter observed near the site’s
northern terminus, corresponds with the southwest corner of the main residence, an apparent
single-story cross-gabled structure. The majority of the main residence is found outside of the
survey corridor, to the north.
Based on both previous site information and the results of the current investigation, it is estimated
that Site 41EL101 is the remnant of an early-to-mid-1900’s farmstead with a 1930–1940s
trash dump most likely associated with the Turner family, specifically John C. and Mattie, or
Charlie and Myrtle. Viewed with Site 41EL88, a short distance away, Site 41EL101 is seen
as a second component of a
family farm operation during
the early twentieth century
(Figure 7.55). Though the
combined two resources do
add to the research potential
of the site, representing two
households in a larger farm
operation, the site within
the currently-evaluated IPL
impact footprint is too diffuse
and disturbed to carry any
significant research potential.
Additionally, none of these
Turners associated with
the resource are considered
historically
significant.
Given the relatively common
nature of sites such as this
within the region, as well
as its poor condition, Site
41EL101 is considered
ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. Though it is
found within the proposed
IPL permanent easement
and may be impacted by
construction, no further work
is recommended.

41EL155
Site 41EL155, previously recorded by PBS&J in 2008, reportedly consists of a historic artifact
surface scatter composed of early twentieth century domestic refuse. At the time, PBS&J
archeologists inferred that the refuse was associated with tenant farming and the Bardwell
Community. Occupying an area of approximately 270 x 820 meters (north/south x east/west),
the site is situated within active agricultural fields. Local vegetation consists of planted crops.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Houston black
clay with one to three percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 30 centimeters of clay (10YR 4/1 or 10YR 4/2). The majority of shovel
tests terminated at 5–30 cmbs. The area was observed to be heavily disturbed as a result of
plowing and erosion.
AmaTerra archeologists surveyed the recorded site location and found the surface visibility
within the plowed, open field to be excellent. No cultural materials were observed. Recording
archeologists noted rilling and mud typical of erosion, which may have impacted site resources
within the survey corridor. Due to the lack of artifacts and the erosion impacting the site’s
supposed location, Site 41EL155 is not present within the proposed IPL permanent easement
and will not be impacted by construction. No further work is recommended for this site.

facility site (Figure 7.56). Occupying an area of approximately 210 x 95 meters (north/south
x east/west), the site is situated on a slight rise separating two intermittent drainages (Figure
7.57). Local vegetation consists of planted crops. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at
approximately 76–99 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site
vicinity are Houston Black Clay. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 30 centimeters of clay (10YR 3/2) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil.
Shovel tests typically terminated at 20–30 cmbs. Modern disturbances are high and include
extensive plowing, vegetation clearing, and the removal of structures.
Surficial manifestations of Site 41EL257 include 20 milk glass shards, 30 amethyst-bleached
glass shards, 20 aqua glass shards, 50 clear glass shards, earthenware sewer pipe, 40
undecorated and blue painted whiteware sherds, 100+ unmarked red brick fragments, two milk
glass marbles, and multiple metal fragments (Figure 7.58). The artifacts are uniform in size,
indicative of excessive plowing. With the relatively large number of brick fragments and the
ceramic sewer pipe within the site boundary, it is likely that a house once stood somewhere in
the vicinity that has been previously razed and removed. No structural remains, wells, or other
features were observed.
Archeologists
excavated
eight shovel tests during
their investigations of Site
41EL257 (OT2, OT4–OT5,
OT11–OT12, and OT18–
OT20). All of the shovel
tests were devoid of cultural
materials indicating that all
site components are limited
to the ground surface.
According to the Ellis
County Clerk’s office the
land on which Site 41EL257
is located was owned by
Kenneth Staples beginning
in April of 1981 until 2007,
when the land was sold
to Brazos Electric Power
Cooperative (the current
owner; Volume 659, Pg.
657; Volume 2321, Pg. 242).
Prior to Staples, the land was
owned by Joe and Geraldine
Loftis, who purchased the
parcel from Charles and

1959 (Volume 469, Pg. 200). Prior to
this sale, the Buie family retained the
property for more than 40 years, with
the land being purchased by Thomas
“T.M.” Buie in 1916 (Volume 226,
Pg. 552 and Volume 216, Pg. 206).
From then, Thomas “T.M.” and his
wife Alma transferred the land to
T.M. Junior and Roma (9/17/1948;
Volume 396, Pg. 236), who deeded
it to Charles and Velmer in July of
1958 (Volume 463, Pg. 308). T.M.
Buie Senior purchased the land from
T.P. Godfrey or J.L. King in 1916
(it is unclear which parcel is which,
but both deeds date to 1916 and are
relevant to contiguous tracts in this
area). Prior to this date, the land
purchases were difficult to decipher,
though it is likely that they remained
in the King and Godfrey families into
the waning years of the nineteenth
century.

According to the 1930 U.S. Census,
the first to include both T.M. Senior
(aged 57) and T.M. Junior (aged 19),
the Buies are listed as a farmer and a
general store operator (respectively).

Godfrey, Junior of Ellis County’s Precinct 1 (the same as that listed on all census records) was
reportedly killed in August of 1938 at the age of 71 while acting as the Ellis County Constable
in a pedestrian/vehicle accident as he served an arrest warrant (ODMP 2013; Baker 1998). A
Jim (likely J.L.) King is listed as a boarder on the property in the same census, describing his
profession as a day laborer. By 1910, J.L. King is listed as a 35-year-old farmer within the
precinct with a wife, Effie (24), and four children (son Walter [6], son Corley [4], daughter
Jewell [3], and son John [19 months]).

A small structural complex
is visible in a 1940 aerial
photograph of the site area
(Figure 7.59). The complex,
located off a small two-track
road, is relatively modest
with a single residence and
one outbuilding within the
site boundary (in its northern
half). A second outbuilding, a
small structure of some kind,
is located along the site’s
western boundary while a
third outbuilding (a barn) lies
just beyond the mapped edge
of the site. The structure
stands in contrast to the
otherwise featureless, open,

be discerned regarding the
site’s age and its possible
inhabitants. With the presence
of amethyst-bleached glass on site, the occupation can be dated to the latter nineteenth to early
twentieth centuries. During this time, the land was owned either by T.M. Buie, T.P. Godfrey,
or J.L. King. As a result of farming activities, all surface and subsurface features related to the
farmstead complex visible in the 1940 aerial have been removed. Lacking any intact features
and being located within a heavily-disturbed context, the site lacks any archeological research
potential. Additionally, being attributed to Buie, Godfrey, or King, the site is not associated
with individuals of historical significance. Accordingly, Site 41EL257 is considered ineligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Though the site is located within the proposed JB-3 East
facility site and may be impacted by construction, no further work is recommended.

Site 41EL259 consists of a historic-period farmstead with an associated surficial debris scatter

Overall, surface visibility was

in the stock pen’s construction, suggesting
a post-1900 construction date. Feature 2,

horizontal clapboard siding (Figure 7.63).
The barn contains no studs, but rather uses
vertical planks as wall framing—called “box

of Feature 2 (Figure 7.64). The structure,
measuring approximately 40 x 20 feet

standing after its chimney fell onto the roof,
collapsing it (Figure 7.65). The three-room

several corrugated metal siding patches
where it has rotted away. The bricks of the
collapsed chimney are orange-paste, unstamped machined varieties. Temporally diagnostic
attributes include the four-over-two window configuration and the cornice door molding
suggesting that the house dates to the early 1900s (Thomas Eisenhour personal communication
2012; Figures 7.66–7.67). A diffuse scatter of automotive parts and other trash around (and
within) the structure suggests that it may have been used as a shed after it was abandoned as a
residence.
Due to dense clay soils and a clearly surficial site context with no potential for buried deposits,
only two shovel tests (F156–157) were excavated. Both tests were devoid of cultural materials
terminating at 40 centimeters in subsoil.
According to the Ellis County Central Appraisal District’s data, the property was previously
owned by a Charles A. Orr, whose trust sold the property to its current owner in 2006. The Orrs
owned the land beginning in February of 1963, when Edwin and Pauline Orr purchased the land
(part of a multi-parcel transaction) from a group of sellers including W.W. and M.B. Seeton,

as the Grantees in a December 30, 1925 purchase from Ples and Lizzie Hendrixson (Volume
280, pg. 106), while Hendrixson purchased the land five years earlier (3/30/1920; Volume
246, pg. 373) from a group of individuals (W.H. Brown, Tinch and V. McCormick, J.L. and
A Clark, and Chas and L. Mays). Title records could not be chased any earlier, though these
earliest owners (the Hendrixsons, Browns, McCormicks, Clarks, and/or Mays) are likely those
associated with the structure while the later assemblage of automotive parts and trash could be
attributed to the Orr family.
A review of the 1920 US Census reveals that the Hendrixsons (listed as living in Midlothian)
may have moved to the property and built the house that same year to accommodate their
large family. With a wife and nine children ranging from 2.5 to 21 years of age, Ples (a 45 year
old farmer) needed as much room as possible. By the 1930 Census, Hendrixson is living in
the site area. Of the other owner names, only John L. Clark is included in the 1920 census, in

the approximate site area. His wife’s
name is illegible but he is listed as a
cashier at a bank.
Archeologists reviewed a 1940 aerial
photograph of the Site 41EL259
vicinity and noted clear indications
of the structures that continue to
be extant (Figure 7.68). The house
and barn are plainly visible while
the northern-most shed/pole barn
is not. Other small structures are
seen around the site area that were
not discernible during the field
investigation.
From the information gathered in the
field and through archival research,
Site 41EL259 is an early twentieth
century farmstead with a residence

condition and are not considered
distinctive in form or workmanship.
The site’s artifacts are diffuse, limited to the ground surface, and are mixed with more modern
debris, making interpretation problematic. Finally, a review of deed records suggests that none
of the individuals likely associated with the resource are considered historically significant.
Only a very small portion of the site (a surficial scatter area) passes within the proposed IPL
permanent easement. All features and denser artifact clusters will be avoided by construction.
The site is recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP and no further work
is recommended.
41EL260
Site 41EL260 consists of a historic-period brick and debris scatter on the same upland ridge
as Site 41EL259 (Figure 7.69). Occupying an area of approximately 150 x 40 meters (north/
south x east/west), the site parallels an ephemeral unnamed drainage that contains a mix of
hackberry, mesquite, elm, and bois d’arc trees. The understory is dominated by leaf litter and
grass (Figure 7.70). Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 30–40 percent.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Houston Black
clay with one to three percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 20 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 4/3) overlying 20 centimeters of clay

Three features were recorded
on the surface at Site
41EL260. Feature 1 is a scatter
of ”Whiteselle Corsicana”
bricks and construction
debris encompassing the
northwestern portion of
the site (see Figure 7.70).
Approximately 60–75 bricks
are scattered within a 50-foot
area. Intermixed within
the brick scatter are a few
pieces of plastic and screw
top jars. South of the brick
scatter is Feature 2, a small
pile of milled lumber with
corrugated metal measuring
approximately seven feet
in diameter (Figure 7.71).
No additional artifacts were
observed in the vicinity of
the pile. Approximately
300 feet to the southeast is
Feature 3, a trash midden measuring 15-feet
in diameter (Figure 7.72). Feature 3 is very
dense and contains an abundant amount of
double-seam cans, paint cans, scrap metal,
tires, unidentified clear glass jars, condiment
bottles, a possibly amethyst-bleached
perfume bottle, milk glass shards, wire,
and machine parts (Figure 7.73). Though
detailed investigations of the bottles were
not conducted, the majority of the specimens
appear to date to the 1930s or 1940s while
the amethyst glass perfume bottle pushes
the date to the early twentieth century. No
foundations or other elements were observed

that may indicate the presence of a structure
anywhere in the site boundary or its vicinity.
Archeologists excavated four shovel tests
during their investigations of Site 41EL260
(A152, F154, C153, and B153). All shovel
tests were devoid of cultural materials. Due
to the surficial nature of the site within an
upland setting (Blackland Prairies), no
additional shovel tests were necessary.
From records available at the Ellis County
Central Appraisal District and the County
Clerk’s office, the property on which Site
41EL260 is found is most likely associated
with the William C. Davis family, who
purchased the property in 1905 and whose
family retained the land until February of
2000 (Volume 1661, Pg. 104; Volume 158,
Pg. 312). A William C. Davis is listed in the
vicinity in the 1910 US Census as a 50-yearold professional timekeeper (presumably
tracking workers’ labor hours) while his
wife, Emily (47) is listed as a dressmaker.
William’s four children (Mary, Willard,
Dellen, and Mattie) were also living on the
property. None of these members of this
Davis family are considered historically
significant.

Figure 7.71. Photograph of lumber and
corrugated metal recorded as Feature 2.

Figure 7.72. Photograph of trash
midden recorded as Feature 3.

Along with deed research, archeologists
also reviewed a 1940 aerial photograph of the
site vicinity and found no structures within or
immediately outside of 41EL20’s recorded
boundary (Figure 7.74). Instead all that is
visible is a cleared pale field. This suggests that
Site 41EL260 was not likely associated with a
structure unless that structure had been removed
prior to the 1940 aerial photograph.
From the collected data, Site 41EL260 is a
historic-period surface scatter with minimal
remaining integrity (particularly within the
IPL impact corridor). The features themselves
do not correspond to occupational structures

while the materials observed (with
the exception of the trash midden,
Feature 3) are non-diagnostic.
Feature 3, though dense, is filled with
common varieties of 1930s and later
trash that is common throughout the
region. Additional investigations
at this site would not likely yield
significant new data and such efforts
are unwarranted. Site 41EL260 is
recommended as ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. Though
portions of the site lie within the
proposed IPL permanent easement
and those resources may be impacted
by construction, no further work is
recommended.
41EL261
Site 41EL261 is a 1960s farmstead
consisting of a fenced pasture, a
contemporary corrugated tin pole

gravel smear. Occupying an area
of approximately 80 x 50 meters
(north/south x east/west), the site is
situated in a sparsely-treed pasture (Figures 7.75). Local vegetation consists of hackberry and
other varieties of fast growing trees. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, local soils
are Leson clay with one to three percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a
typical soil column consisting of 50 centimeters of silty clay (10YR 3/4) overlying clay subsoil
(10YR 3/4). Typically, shovel tests terminated at approximately 50 cmbs upon encountering
sterile subsoil. Modern disturbances were minimal, limited to cattle grazing foot traffic.
The pole barn structure (Feature 1) measures approximately 15 x 20 feet and was considered by
field archeologists as marginally historic-aged (1950s or 1960s; Figure 7.76). The corrugatedmetal-sided and roofed structure contains a single interior livestock barn and an open-aired
covered bay. Outside the barn is an alignment of bricks (Feature 2) enclosing a crushed gravel
bed (Feature 3; Figures 7.77–7.79). It is possible that this served as a patio or a sidewalk to
an above-ground structure—like a trailer or a pier and beam residence that has been razed or
removed. The gravel pad measures approximately 6 x 10 feet. Near the gravel base is a small
pad made of bricks labeled Whitesell[e] Corsicana. Near Shovel Test OT1 (see below) is a pole
with an electric meter on it.

According to the current landowner’s
son (personal communication 2012), the
property was purchased in the late 1960s
from a man named Brinks Baker, who had
lived on the property since the turn of the
century. The informant recalls that the barn
was built in the late 1960s. The informant
explained that a house (presumably Mr.
Baker’s) used to be on the property near
where the barn was built, but that the house
was destroyed or removed prior to the
land sale. According to the informant, Mr.
Baker kept mules and a Model T Ford near
the current standing barn. Archeologists
searched for Brinks Baker in census records,
but no exact matches could be found.

A 1940 aerial photograph
of the site vicinity does
depict such a residence
within 41EL261’s boundary
(Figure 7.81). Along with
the main residence (a crossgabled structure facing the
nearby county road, the
photograph shows several
small outbuildings extending
toward the south and west
with a large animal barn
and pen just beyond the site
boundary. Remnants of this
structure were not observed
during survey. The gravel
driveway visible in the photo
was also recorded during the
current survey (see Figure
7.75) providing a visual
baseline to link the two. As
can be seen, the pole barn
extant at the site in modern
times is located over the
former house site, occupying
the site’s center.
Site 41EL261 is a 1960s
barn that likely was built over
an earlier farmstead, but no
evidence of pre-1960s artifacts or features was found. The site lacks functional patterning in
the features observed or the limited number of artifacts noted on the surface and within the
single positive shovel test. Those materials recorded at Site 41EL261 are marginally-historicaged, are quite common for sites of this type, and are not considered to be associated with
individuals or events of historical significance. Accordingly, Site 41EL261 is recommended
ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Though the site may be impacted by IPL-related
construction, no further work is recommended.

Archeological Sites Outside of the IPL Impact Footprint
As discussed in previous chapters, archeologists documented a large number of sites during
the course of the IPL-related survey that lie outside of the proposed final permanent easement.
These sites are located either within the 450-foot evaluation corridor, or they are found on
pipeline segments or facility site alternatives that have been abandoned. Since these sites will
not likely be impacted by IPL-related construction, they are presented below for inventory

Site 41EL248
Site 41EL248, previously recorded by PBS&J in 2008 during the Texas Independence Pipeline
Project (Galle 2008a), reportedly consisted of a surficial early twentieth century domestic
artifact scatter. At the time, the surface scatter was composed of vessel glass shards (colorless
and aqua), cement fragments, and an unspecified quantity of ‘FERRIS’ brick fragments.
Occupying an area of approximately 246 x 147 feet (north/south x east/west), the site is situated
on gently-sloping terrain within an active cotton field. According to the USDA’s Web Soil
Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Houston Black clay with one to three percent slopes.
Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of dark
brown (10YR 3/3) clay. According to Galle (2008a:2), modern disturbances include erosion,
plowing, and urban development. Additionally, during AmaTerra’s revisit to Site 41EL248
archeologists documented disturbances associated with the Texas Independence Pipeline, which
is evidenced by markers and a
visible scar trending from
northwest to southeast across
the originally denoted site
boundary.
During
the
2010
AmaTerra survey, surficial
manifestations, correlating
with the previously identified
cultural materials, include
one unidentifiable piece
of scrap metal, one Pepsi
Cola clear bottle shard, and
approximately 12 unmarked
red and tan brick fragments
(Figures 7.82–7.83). Today,
only a 50 x 50-foot (north/

Site 41EL248 is a nearly-destroyed,
early twentieth century refuse scatter
with few remaining artifacts and
little integrity. While the site may
have initially been associated with a
structure (as evidenced by the brick
scatter) such features have been
all but destroyed by the pipeline
installation. Only the ‘FERRIS’ brick
fragments recorded previously are
diagnostic, providing dates between
1901–1923 (Galle 2008a). The site is
not associated with an individual or
event of historical significance. Given

such as this within the region, as well
as its overall poor condition, 41EL248
is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Being located outside of the
proposed IPL permanent easement it will not likely be impacted by project-related construction
and no further work is recommended.
41EL249
Site 41EL249, previously recorded by archeologists at PBS&J in 2008 during the Texas
Independence Pipeline project (Galle 2008b), is an early twentieth century domestic surface
scatter consisting of eight glass shards (three colorless, three green, one rose, and one blue),
three whiteware sherds, one ceramic doll head, and an unspecified quantity of ‘FERRIS’ brick
fragments. Occupying an area of approximately 130 x 20 meters (north/south x east/west), the
site is situated on gently sloping terrain within an active cotton field. According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Houston Black clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes.
Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of dark clay
(10YR 3/3). According to Galle (2008b:2), modern disturbances include erosion, plowing, and
development during the site’s initial recording. Additionally, during AmaTerra’s revisit to Site
41El248 archeologists noted disturbances associated with the Texas Independence Pipeline,
which is denoted by markers and a visible scar trending from northwest to southeast across the
originally defined site boundary.
During AmaTerra’s IPL survey, surficial manifestations, correlating with the previously
identified resources, include three glass shards (one clear, one aqua, and one amethyst-bleached)
and a few small reddish-orange and deep purple brick fragments (Figures 7.84–7.85). Today,
only a 50 x 20-meter (north/south x east/west) portion of the site is existent, the remainder
presumably destroyed during gas pipeline construction. Due to the recent tilling of the soil
and the site’s original documentation, the site boundary was delineated on the basis of surface
artifacts only. The ‘FERRIS’ brick fragments identified during the site’s original recording
provide dates between 1901 to 1923 (Galle 2008b).

To the south, behind Feature 1, stands an
old disconnected telephone pole with rusted
wire boxes. Feature 2 is located about 30
meters east of the water tank and consists
of a cattle pen with barbed wire fencing, a
concrete slab measuring approximately 30
x 50 feet in size, and an animal stockade
(Figure 7.88). The animal stockade fence
is built of wooden posts and hog fencing.
The feature is approximately 140 feet in
length. Feature 3 is a cattle chute (Figure
7.89) roughly 65 feet in length. Feature 4 is
a collapsed wooden barn with a corrugated
tin roof (Figure 7.90). The fence hardware
and telephone poles indicate that this site
potentially dates to the 1940s.

standing stable, measures
approximately 20 x 12 feet
(east/west x north/south). The eastern end of the structure has no wall, which has led to the roof
collapsing. The western end of the stable has a door leading to a small closed off room. To the
south of the standing stable is a row of collapsed smaller stables approximately 30 feet long but
only about 10 feet wide (Feature 2). The structure is composed of dimensional lumber around
a simple rough-hewn lumber frame with a flat and corrugated metal roof. All fasteners were
more modern variety pulled wire nails with no cut examples observed (Figure 7.92). Figure
7.93 shows the west wall of the standing stable and the collapsed row of smaller stables. East of
the stables is a divided corral made of a mixture of barbed wire and wooden fencing. Further to
the east is what remains of a cleared
pasture which now has exposed
bedrock, within this cleared area are
two elevated gas storage tanks which
may or may not have been added
to the area more recently. No other

Site 41EL262 were sparse, some
modern trash was mixed in with the

D71 contained only one piece of clear vessel glass in shallow sediments while F71 was devoid
of archeological materials. Archeologists also reviewed a 1940 aerial photograph of the site
vicinity and found no obvious structure within the site boundary (Figure 7.94). However, to the
south of the site boundary are several buildings which appear to be a farmstead, no remnants of
these structures were observed during the current survey. Though aerial photographs suggest
the structure may not have been present in 1940, the construction materials and workmanship
suggests that the site likely does date to around that time. Either the structure predates the
photo and was hidden by vegetation, or it was built shortly after 1940.

From the collected data, Site 41EL262 is a historic-period stable and corral with minimal
remaining integrity. Additional investigations at this site would not likely yield significant
new data and such efforts are unwarranted. Site 41EL262 is recommended as ineligible for

7.6.2 Archeological Isolated Finds
Along with archeological sites, AmaTerra surveyors briefly documented an additional seven
isolated finds along the IPL evaluation corridor in Ellis County. All of the isolated finds are
historic in age.
Isolated Find D1053IF1 is a collapsed historic windmill located near Sites 41EL259 and 41EL260
(Figure 7.95). To the north, west, and south of the isolated find are recently plowed agricultural
fields, while a stock pond is located to the south-southeast. The windmill parts are located on
the surface within a dense patch of mixed
growth woods. The windmill discharge pipe
is protruding from the subsurface suggesting
the well is still intact below the ground
surface (Figure 7.96). Shovel tests in the
vicinity (C155, F155, OT1, and OT2) were
devoid of cultural materials. Shovel test
observations revealed a typical soil column
consisting of 30 centimeters of sandy clay
(10YR 4/3). At one time, the windmill
likely serviced the retention pond to the
south-southeast, but now sit inactive. With
no associated artifact scatter or additional

was considered a non-site isolate and is not
recommended as eligible for listing on the
NRHP or as a SAL. The windmill is located
within the proposed permanent easement
and will likely be impacted by construction,
but no further work is recommended.
Isolated Find E248IF1 is a small polebarn with a corrugated metal exterior
(Figure 7.97) with an associated surficial
trash scatter composed of wooden
beams and poles, potentially utilized as
fencing material. A historic well pump,
manufactured by the F. E. Myers and Bro.

V-1950MP-6607F1; Figure 7.98), is also
within the vicinity of the pole-barn. The year
“1950” is presumed to be the pump’s date
of manufacture. According to the property’s
tenant (personal communication), the
features were constructed in the 1970s. This
late construction date precluded the need
to record the resource as an archeological
site. Shovel tests (C145, D129, and E123)
excavated within the vicinity of the structure
were devoid of cultural materials. Shovel test
observations revealed a typical soil column
consisting of 40 centimeters of clay (10YR
4/4). Lacking historical significance and
considering the young age of the features,
the isolated find is considered ineligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Being
located on a now-abandoned corridor,
the isolate will not likely be impacted by
project-related construction and no further
work is recommended.
Isolated Find D275IF1 is a 1960s surficial
trash scatter (Figure 7.99). Artifacts include
an aqua colored glass shard, one orange
paste, unmarked brick fragment, and an
assortment of unidentified metal. The find is
located outside of the IPL evaluation corridor
along a finger extension of a prominent
ridge. The area is currently used for railroad
construction and maintenance. Shovel tests
(E64, E65, and A66) excavated within the
vicinity of the trash scatter were devoid of
cultural materials. Shovel test observations
revealed a typical soil column consisting
of 50 centimeters of clay (10YR 4/6). The
area does not fall within the proposed
permanent easement and therefore will not
be impacted by proposed IPL construction.
Lacking historical significance and taking
into account poor archeological context, the
find is considered ineligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP. Thus, no further work
is recommended for this isolated find.

Isolated Find A280IF1 is an International
Harvester farming implement (Figure
7.100) with the words “Deering New Deal”
embossed on the front. The agricultural
implement, located on the surface outside
of the IPL project corridor, is situated on
the slope of a prominent landform near an
old stock pond. The area is periodically
cleared for agricultural purposes, leading
investigators to believe the isolated find is
out of context. Shovel test observations
revealed a typical soil column consisting of
20 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/4) on
top of clay (10YR 7/3). Neighboring Shovel
Test B3 is devoid of cultural materials.
Lacking contextual integrity, associated
features, or other archeological materials,
the find is considered ineligible for listing as
a SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.
Isolated find F358IF2 is an animal stockade
(Figure 7.101) located outside of the 150foot IPL permanent easement. Thus, the area
will not be impacted by the proposed corridor.
The stockade has been built through ad hoc
attachment of modern fencing materials to
standing trees. Shovel tests excavated within
the vicinity of the isolated find were devoid
of cultural materials (D72, E72, and D619).
Shovel test observations revealed a typical
soil column consisting of 20 centimeters of
clay loam (10YR 2/2) overlying bedrock. As
a result of the isolated find’s modern age, the
animal stockade is considered ineligible for
listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Thus, no
further work is recommended.
Isolated find C375IF1 is small scatter of four
aqua colored glass shards (Figure 7.102)

90–100 percent. Shovel tests excavated within the vicinity of the isolated find were devoid
of cultural materials (C374, C375, and OT24). Shovel test observations revealed a typical
soil column consisting of 50 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/2) on top of clay (10YR 4/1).
Lacking features or additional archeological resources the isolated find is considered ineligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. The resource is located outside of the IPL impact footprint
and will not be impacted by proposed IPL construction. Thus, no further work is recommended
for this isolated find.
Isolated find F383IF1 is a diffuse surface scatter
of isolated milk glass shards (Figure 7.103) and
one coarse earthenware sherd located within
the proposed JB-3 pump station site. The glass
shards appear to be the remains of a cold cream
jar. Shovel tests excavated within the vicinity of
the isolated find were devoid of cultural materials

construction, no further work is recommended.

7.7 	Historical Resources
Along with the archeological sites, AmaTerra architectural historians documented 32 individual
historic-age structures during survey in Ellis County (Table 7.8). While the majority are earlyto mid-twentieth century home sites or barns typical of the region, additional resources include
a stone culvert and a railroad bed. Below is a summary of the resources documented during
Ellis County historical survey.

7.7.1 Properties within the 450-Foot Survey Corridor
EL250-1
EL250-1 is an abandoned barn off Weatherford Road west of Midlothian, approximately one
mile northwest of US 67. The circa 1955 one-story, wood-frame building has metal siding and
two large metal swing doors. The gabled roof has no eaves, and is covered with corrugated
metal, similar to the walls. The barn has a wing addition on the east side. Although affiliated
with mid-century agricultural practices in Ellis County, the barn lacks significance under
Criterion A. It has no known association with persons of historic importance under Criterion
B, and is not a noteworthy example of barn architecture under Criterion C. As such, it is
recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP (Figure 7.104).

EL250a-1
EL250a-1 is a residence at 5191 Weatherford Road, approximately one mile northwest of US
67, west of Midlothian. The circa 1925 one-and-one-half-story, wood-frame bungalow rests on
a pier-and-beam foundation. The walls have a mix of stucco, wood beadboard, and plywood
or particle board siding. Windows are a mix of wood-sash and modern vinyl-sash. The frontgabled roof has open soffits with exposed rafter tails and some decorative knee braces. Roofing
is corrugated metal. The house once had an inset full-width porch, but this has since been
enclosed and a small modern wood porch added with a modern door. The building has no known

association with important historic
events, trends, or persons under Criteria
A or B. Although it displays many of the
characteristics of a Craftsman bungalow,
the many changes and alterations
to the building impact integrity of
design, materials, workmanship, and
feeling under Criterion C. As such, it is
recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP (Figure 7.105).

EL250a-2 is a residence on a private drive
off Weatherford Road, approximately
one mile northwest of US 67, west of
Midlothian. The circa 1955 one-story,
wood-frame ranch house features
asbestos siding and single or paired
aluminum-sash windows with wood trim
painted bright blue. The side-gabled roof
has minimal eaves and composite shingle
roofing. The house has a small inset
porch on the south side. The building
has no known association with important
historic events, trends, or persons and is
not a noteworthy example of the Ranch
style. As such, it is recommended not
eligible for listing in the NRHP (Figure

historic events, trends, or persons.
The architecture appears to have some
Craftsman or Queen Anne influence,
but is of no recognizable style and
does not rise to a level of significance
required under Criterion C. As such, it is
recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP (Figure 7.107).
EL352a-1
EL352a-1 is the old railroad bed for
the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad,
located along old US 77 approximately
450 feet east of IH-35 E and 600
feet south of Bingham Road, near
Waxahachie. Since the pipeline will be
tunneled beneath this resource, it was
not documented by archeologists. Only
the gravel base and raised embankment
remain, as the tracks were removed
between 2005 and 2008. The alignment
includes a small stone culvert over
an unnamed tributary to South Prong
Creek. The Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railway, affectionately known as the
“Katy,” was an important railroad in
Texas history and helped pave the
way for the current route of both US
77 and IH 35. However, this segment
of old railroad bed has only nominal
significance for its association with
the railroad under Criterion A, and the
lack of tracks greatly impairs its ability
to convey what limited significance it
possesses. The alignment and culvert
have no known specific association
with an important historic person under
Criterion B. The small stone culvert
is well-constructed, but is simple
in design and construction and not
particularly noteworthy under Criterion
C. As such, the track bed and culvert are
recommended not eligible for listing in
the NRHP (Figure 7.108–7.109).

EL373
EL373 is a vacant farm complex
on a private drive off W Road,
approximately 0.75 miles west of
FM 877, southeast of Waxahachie.
Resource EL373-1 is a circa 1920
single-story, wood-frame Craftsmaninfluenced bungalow on a pier-andbeam foundation. Walls have a mix
of wood and replacement siding,
with wood-sash windows. The frontgabled roof has modest eaves with
decorative knee braces and composite
shingles. The hipped gable projecting
porch has wood support columns.
Resources EL373-2 and EL373-3 are
circa 1960 one-story, front-gabled

EL395-1
EL395-1 is an abandoned barn off FM 984, approximately 0.4 miles northeast of the Bacak Road
intersection, west of Bardwell. The mid-twentieth century one-story, wood-frame building has
corrugated roofing but is otherwise almost completely collapsed. No other buildings are in the
vicinity. The barn has minimal association with agricultural practices in Ellis County, but lacks
significance under Criterion A. It has no known association with important historic persons
under Criterion B, and has no significance under Criterion C. As such, it is recommended not

228

EL1054-1 is a ranching complex located
at 2905-2915 Davis Road outside of
Mansfield. It consists of two residences with
associated outbuildings. The residences
are two 1930 cottages and a circa 1965
Ranch-influenced house. The outbuildings
include a tractor barn, animal pens, and a
storage barn, all circa 1965 (Figures 7.1147.117). The outbuildings do not adhere to
any particular style, being relatively simple
yet functional buildings. The neighboring
fields have been subdivided and are no
longer directly associated with the property,
according to the residents. While nominally
significant under Criterion A in the area
of Agriculture for its association with
mid-century farming practices (period of
significance: 1930-1968), the changes to
the property lead to a loss of integrity of
location, design, materials, workmanship,
and association. It has no known association
with persons of historic importance, and is
not architecturally significant either as an
example of a particular style or a agricultural
property. The property was determined not
eligible for listing in the NRHP by TxDOT
and THC in July 2011.

Results of Field Investigations
Navarro County
It is within Navarro County that the IPL pipeline transitions out of the primarily shallow clays
and clay loams of the Blackland Prairies region and into the deeper, sandy soils of the Post Oak
Savanna toward the east. The cultural background of the region changes as well. Archeological
sites begin to reflect greater Caddo influence during the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic
periods. Within this physiographic and cultural transitional zone, the IPL pipeline travels
nearly due east for a distance of approximately 24 linear miles, crossing north of the City of
Corsicana and terminating at the proposed tunneled Trinity River crossing (Figures 8.1–8.8).
Unlike almost all other counties along the proposed IPL pipeline corridor, Navarro County’s
segment is entirely composed of Proposed Action elements including the pipelline, expansions
of the existing Richland-Chambers pump station capacity, and th eproposed JB-2 East Booster
Pump Station. While a Future Action has not been finalized in Henderson and Anderson
Counties (see Chapters 9 and 10), the relevant components presented herein are the proposed
footprint/alignment presented for coordination. Approximately midway along this span, the
pipeline includes a 12.5-mile southern segment that draws water from Richland-Chambers
Reservoir into the main corridor. At the intersection, the IPL project includes the JB-2 East
Booster Pump Station, while water from Richland-Chambers will be drawn from expansion
of the existing Richland-Chambers Pump Station as part of the Proposed Action, components
of which will be improved to allow for added capacity. The 150-foot proposed permanent
easement occupies an area of approximately 686 acres within the county while the two facility
sites add an additional 296 acres of proposed impacts, bringing the total to approximately 982
acres. Like Ellis County, the IPL corridor largely passes through open, agricultural fields and
grazing pastures, but generally avoids most population centers and residential areas. Overall,
archeologists and architectural historians surveyed approximately 3,599 acres of the proposed
IPL project within Navarro County, documenting 13 archeological sites (primarily historic
age), 25 non-archeological historic-age resources, and eight archeological isolates. Below is
a brief summary of Navarro County’s environmental and historical background along with a
survey narrative and detailed description of identified resources.

8.1 	Pipeline Description
8.1.1 Proposed Final IPL 150-Foot Corridor
Continuing east from the Ellis County line in the vicinity of Onion Creek, the IPL Pipeline within
Navarro County begins in Parcel 426 transitioning from Segment 15-2 to 15-1 approximately
1.6 miles east of the county line. This segment of the IPL pipeline is included in the Proposed
Action. Segment 15-1 crosses Cummins Creek at Parcel 439 and continues east, crossing IH
45 and moving on to the southern outskirts of the community of Montfort before terminating

in Parcel 509 at the proposed 281-acre JB-2 East Site (see below). At this location, the IPL
pipeline intersects at a “T” with the southeastward Segment 16 and the eastward Segment 17
and continues on an eastward trajectory. Segment 17 is approximately seven linear miles within
Navarro County, crossing into Henderson County at a proposed one-acre tunneled segment
that will cross beneath the Trinity River in Parcel 948.
Segment 16, as described above, extends approximately 12.5 miles to the southeast from the
JB-2 East Site through open pastureland, crossing just west of the community of Kerens at
Highway 31 then enters an existing 150-foot-wide TRWD pipeline easement near its southern
terminus at Parcel 1086. The IPL line continues within the existing, disturbed water pipeline
pipeline corridor for a distance of approximately 1.4 miles to the Segment’s terminus at the
existing Richland-Chambers Pump Station immediately north of Southeast CR 3250.
Like other county segments, the IPL pipeline within Navarro County will be installed primarily
through open-cut trenching to a depth of approximately 35 feet. Subsurface tunneling is
proposed for the pipeline’s crossing at IH 45 and the Trinity River.

8.1.2 Proposed Facility Sites
JB-2 Booster Pump Station
At the intersection of Segments 15-2, 16, and 17, the IPL project includes the 281-acre JB-2
Booster Pump Station (Figure 8.9). As summarized in Chapter 1, the booster pump station serves
to pull water from the pipe and push it farther down the line when elevation does not permit
gravity-assisted runs. At this facility, TRWD proposes to construct up to four large (600 x 800
foot) reservoir chambers isolated by earthen berms (current plans call for two cells with space for
the remainder left in place). Additionally, the proposed site includes pump facilities, access roads,
storage buildings, an operator’s residence, and a helipad. Impacts are anticipated to be similar
to that of the pipeline itself with underground pipes joining the pumping facilities within the
property at similar depths while more extensive impacts are anticipated at or immediately below
the ground surface from the access roads, buildings, and other elements. Additionally, materials
for the large earthen berm(s) will be collected from nearby borrow areas within the mapped
facility site footprint. The earthen berm will be similar in size to that observed at the existing
KBR booster pump station discussed in Chapter 5.
Richland-Chambers Pump Station (JRC1)
Located along the northeastern bank of the Richland-Chambers Reservoir, the IPL project will augment
the existing Richland-Chambers Pump Station. Built from 1985 through 1989, the existing facility
has a capacity of 250 MGD, but an additional 70 MGD capacity will be added to the facility through
the addition of pumps and electrical features along with additional access roads and other facilities. All
work (construction, staging, etc.) is limited to the existing 16-acre parcel boundary (Figure 8.10).
TRWD anticipates that depths of impact will extend to approximately 30–35 feet.

8.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
As with the other counties surveyed, the IPL line went through several shifts and adjustments
as its final proposed corridor was defined. This county, however, contains the largest single
abandoned corridor of the proposed route as TRWD abandoned an earlier Segment 16 route,
which turned south of the main corridor much closer to the Trinity River (at Parcel 528) and ran
246

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

approximately four miles east of the final selected corridor. The entire 11-mile original corridor
was abandoned when the proposed original booster pump station site (Parcels 527–529) was
found to be unfeasible for construction.
When the original Segment 16 was abandoned, TRWD considered several alternatives for
the revised Segment 16 that depended upon which of the two proposed booster pump station
alternatives were selected (JB-2 East or West; see below). While none of the JB-2 West segment
pipeline was surveyed, some varied routes farther south (Parcels 879, 883–891) depict the
route refinement process.
Finally, TRWD was faced with significant challenges with crossing the Trinity River in a
location that had the least potential to impact sensitive environmental and cultural resources.
While most of the route changes are more evident east of the River in Henderson County, the
pipeline’s western river approach changed significantly over time. Cultural resource teams
surveyed three alternative routes through this area and surveyed all of Parcels 528 and 529 to
provide a safe route through the area. Due to limited right-of-entry in the early stages of survey,
the original corridor—located approximately one half mile north of the final route—was never
surveyed prior to its abandonment. Eventually, the design teams settled on the center corridor,
which was selected in direct consultation and guidance with the archeology and ecology teams.
As stated above, design teams considered two alternative locations for the JB-2 site (East and
West). While they eventually selected the eastern alternative, TRWD requested a full survey of
the 380-acre JB-2 West site, as well as the JB-2 East during their evaluation process.

8.2 	Environmental Summary
8.2.1 Navarro County Soil Summary
The APE crosses four geological groups within Navarro County: the Taylor Group, the Navarro
Group, the Midway Group, and the Wilcox Group. The Taylor Group and the Navarro Group
date to the Late Cretaceous. As discussed in the Ellis County soils description, the Taylor Group
consists of marls and sandy marls. The Navarro Group consists of Kemp Clay, Corsicana Marl
undivided (Kkc), and Nacatoch Sand (Kns). The Midway Group and the Wilcox Group are
Eocene in geologic age and consist of the Reklaw Formation (Er), Carrizo Sand (Ec), Wilcox
undivided (EPawi), and the Wills Point Formation (PAwp)(Fisher 1992). Significant deposits
of Alluvium (Qal) and Fluviatile terrace deposits (Ot) can be found along Chambers Creek,
Rush Creek, and the Trinity River. These formations are considered to have a high potential
for containing deeply buried archeological deposits. Forty-four different soil types (Table 8.1)
are designated within the project area. The majority of soils represented within the project area
consist of Crockett fine sandy loam, Burleson clay, Mabank very fine sandy loam, Wilson clay
loam, and Heiden clay.

8.2.2 Navarro County Climate and Biota
Environmental conditions within Navarro County are similar to those described in more detail
in the previous Tarrant County discussion. The reader is encouraged to refer to Chapter 5 for a
representation of the climatic and biotic conditions typical of Navarro County.

8.2.3 Current Land Use
Navarro County contains predominantly rural agricultural communities with farming and
ranching distributed west to the east, respectively. The urban and industrial areas in the county
are centrally located around Corsicana near Richland-Chambers Reservoir.

8.3 	Historical Context
Early Settlement and Civil War (1836–1869)
At the time the first white settlers arrived in 1836 in what would become Navarro County, the
area was dominated by Ione, Kickapoo, and Comanche native tribes. Despite the presence of a
trading post, relations between the settlers and the tribes were often violent. For example, the
Kickapoos massacred a 25-man survey team in 1838. By 1846, however, enough settlers had
arrived that serious talk began on forming a county. The new Navarro County formed in April of
that year, but did not adopt its present boundaries until 1866 after several neighboring counties
were established from its original holdings. Corsicana, the county seat, was established in 1848
on 100 acres of land donated by Thomas Smith.
Like most of the State of Texas, Navarro County overwhelmingly supported secession at the
start of the Civil War, and sent many men to fight for the Confederate cause. The county had
nearly 6,000 people at the start of the war (including over 1,900 enslaved blacks), and continued
to grow through the war years despite the formation of several army brigades. Corsicana even
had a military school in 1865. By 1870, the population was just shy of 9,000 (Miller 2012).
The importation of enslaved blacks during the Civil War accounted for the largest share of
that growth, as southern plantation owners fled neighboring states (with their enslaved) where
fighting and devastation were more prevalent.
Agricultural Growth (1870–1930)
The agricultural economy of the county received a boost with the arrival of the Houston and
Texas Central Railroad in 1871, providing area farmers with a fast and reliable means to get
goods to market. In 1880, the county boasted over 2,000 farms encouraging the construction
of the Southwestern and Cotton Belt Railroads. The county enjoyed increasing prosperity over
the next fifty years. Cotton was popular, but unlike neighboring Ellis County, Navarro County
farmers diversified their crops to a much greater degree, growing corn, tobacco, peaches, sweet
potatoes, and pecans. Livestock included cattle, hogs, and poultry (primarily chickens).

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 8

Results — Navarro County

By the turn of the century, the county boasted a population of over 47,000 residents. Despite
the earlier diversification of crops, farmers increasingly relied on cotton for income. Cotton
remained the dominant crop through the first decades of the twentieth century, although several
factors began driving prices down. The boll weevil, introduced to Texas in the late nineteenth
century, had spread to most of the cotton-producing areas by 1922, damaging crops and
reducing yields (Britton et al. 2012). Government controls and increased foreign competition
reduced the amount of cotton that was grown. Although World War I produced a short spike in
demand, many farmers turned away from cotton by the 1920s. Still, in 1930 the county’s 6,500
farms produced over 88,000 bales of cotton, and the population hovered at around 60,500
(Miller 2012).
Oil and Industry (1894–1950)
With the county’s rapid growth in the waning decades of the nineteenth century, the city of
Corsicana found itself running low on reliable water supplies. Drilling efforts in search of a
new artesian well began in 1894, but instead of finding water the drillers struck oil. This kicked
off the first oil boom in the state’s history and led to rapid growth and prosperity for Corsicana
(Long 2012). The state’s first oil refinery opened a few years later, and the city built a new
courthouse in 1905 as Corsicana became a petroleum hub. The discovery of a second, larger
oil field in 1923 continued the prosperity up to the Great Depression.
Industry, too, enjoyed increased success in the county in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Manufacturing increased over 250 percent from 1860–1900, and by 1920 the county
had 53 different manufacturing establishments. The Great Depression, however, impacted
much of the county’s economy. Industries tied to agriculture were especially hit hard, including
cottonseed oil mills and gins. Manufacturing declined as well, although oil remained enough
of a driving force that the county began recovering by the end of the 1930s. By the 1950s,
prominent industries included Wolf Brand Chili and the Colin Street Bakery, both of which had
national distribution (Long 2012).
Agricultural Decline (1950–1970)
As Corsicana’s industries and oil wealth continued to prop up the county seat, the rural areas of
the county did not fair well during the middle of the twentieth century. Agricultural production,
which had stumbled during the depression, recovered during the 1940s only to begin another
period of decline starting in 1950. The number of farms declined to 3,100 by 1950, and
continued to decline to under 1,800 by 1969. Crop production declined as well, especially
cotton. In 1950, area farmers harvested over 70,000 bales of cotton, but by 1970 only 7,000
bales came out of the county’s fields. Livestock, particularly cattle, also declined during this
time to a low of 1,600 cattle in 1970. By 1970, only 31,000 people called the county home, and
most were living in Corsicana or other urban areas (Miller 2012).

8.4 	Previously-Recorded Archeological Sites and Surveys
8.4.1 Previous Surveys
Previous archeological surveys documented within the IPL corridor in Navarro County consist
of an area survey conducted on behalf of the US Soil Conservation Service in 1983 near IH 45,
a survey conducted on behalf the FHWA in 1991 crossing the IPL corridor at IH 45, a linear
survey conducted on behalf of the Fort Worth District Office of the USACE in 1981 crossing
the IPL corridor at FM 603, and 1985, crossing the IPL corridor two kilometers to the east. A
linear survey was also conducted on behalf of the USDA in 1999 that crosses the IPL corridor
at 2nd Street west of Kerens. A linear survey conducted on behalf of the USACE in 1985
parallels the IPL corridor, crossing it near Walker Lake. A linear survey conducted on behalf
of the Rural Electric Administration in 1989 also parallels the IPL corridor before crossing it
near Walker Lake.

8.4.2 Previously Recorded Archeological Sites
Based on the Atlas, 26 previously recorded archeological sites exist within one kilometer of the
IPL proposed pipeline and facilities within Navarro County. Of these 26 archeological sites only
one (41NV545) falls within the 450-foot evaluation corridor. Another six archeological sites
(41NV129-131, 139, 275, and 299) are inundated within the Richland-Chambers Reservoir.
The remaining 20 archeological sites are within one kilometer of the 150-foot easement, but
are located outside of the IPL evaluation corridor. Archeological Site 41NV545, located within
the 450-foot evaluation corridor, is discussed in detail below.

8.5

Archeological Survey Observations

Navarro County is the last of the Blackland Prairies counties the proposed IPL corridor passes
through as it transitions to the east Texas Piney Woods toward the east. Along its full length,
the survey teams investigated approximately 37 linear miles of proposed pipeline corridor
and an additional 296 acres of proposed facility sites. Conditions across the county were
similar to those observed in neighboring Ellis County with surveyors encountering primarily
open, actively-cultivated agricultural fields and pastures across a sparsely-populated rolling
upland prairie. Once the pipeline crosses the Trinity River the geographic conditions change
dramatically. A lack of significant resources resulted in relatively few alternate routes, though
the single largest reroute of the project, the wholesale revision of Segment 16, is a notable
exception. During the course of their survey, archeologists excavated 2,617 shovel tests and an
additional 15 backhoe trenches within the county while recording 13 archeological sites and
11 isolated finds. As described in Chapter 1, below is a very brief summary of the results of the
survey within the county, with discussion focusing on the resources identified through survey.
In all instances, unless stated otherwise, the reader is to assume that the assessed parcels were
intensively surveyed through surface inspection and shovel testing in accordance with the
methods described in Chapter 4. The reader should refer to Appendix A for detailed shovel test

(soils, disturbance, etc.).

8.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
Ellis County Line to Eastern Terminus of Segment 15-2
The IPL survey corridor crosses into
Navarro County from Ellis County
within the Waxahachie and Chambers
Creek floodplains, heading eastward
along the waterway’s left bank.
Surveyors found the study area to be
broad, generally flat, and populated
with overgrown woods intermixed
with recently-plowed fields (Figures
8.11–8.12). Shovel tests in the area
(n=115) often encountered deep,
alluvial sediments consisting of
65 centimeters of dark brown clay
loams (10YR 4/3) overlying clays
(10YR 3/2) that extended beyond
the test’s terminus (see Shovel Test
A425A64). The deep sediments
and flat terrain continue through
to the edge of the segment, as the
Creek bends southward, away from
the proposed pipeline corridor.
Backhoe trenches were the primary
tool used to conduct investigations
in this area as shovel testing could
not reach deep enough to fully
assess deep impacts (see below).
Though no formal archeological
sites were recorded in this portion
of the pipeline, the survey teams
did encounter limited evidence of
prehistoric occupation along a small
ridgeline overlooking the creek
as archeologists documented two
prehistoric lithic flakes observed
in as many shovel tests (A426IF4–
A428IF5; see below).

Eastern End of Segment
15-2 to Interstate 45
At the arbitrary transition to IPL
Segment 15-2, archeologists noted
that the terrain continues to be
primarily open, managed agricultural
fields and grassy pastures in
shallow, rolling upland hills. Some
parcels (i.e., Parcel 433) were less
intensely managed and are instead
overgrown woodlands (Figure
8.13). Archeologists excavated
approximately 240 shovel tests (dug
at roughly 130–150 meter intervals)

dense subsoil in most of the tests.
Shovel tests in the area west of
Cummins Creek are characterized
by 45 centimeters of clay (10YR
5/1) overlying basal clay (10YR
6/1) that extended beyond the shovel
test’s terminus at approximately 50
cmbs (see Shovel Test A433A78).
As the pipeline continues east, the
proposed pipeline crosses a small,
narrow floodplain at Cummins
Creek that again was subject to
backhoe trenching on its eastern and
western banks (Parcels 438 and 439,
see below) before continuing to IH

scrub, and briar patches lining small
drainages (Figure 8.14). At the
eastern Cummins Creek boundary,
the design teams requested additional area survey to the edge of the parcel boundary to identify
possible alternative routes if such were needed. In this 28-acre parcel, archeologists excavated
an additional eight shovel tests that were all devoid of archeological resources. Near the
highway, the IPL corridor was found to be much more developed with archeologists noting
abundant modern disturbance and a clearly sterile clay subsoil at roughly 60 cmbs (see Shovel
Test C450A99). One isolated historic-period trash scatter (A432IF1) and one historic-period
occupation site (41NV706) were recorded in this area.

Interstate 45 to FM 1129
Continuing east of IH 45, the
proposed IPL corridor again cuts
through broad, open upland prairies
populated with pastures and plowed
agricultural fields. While some
portions were subdivided into smaller
suburban lots (Parcels 455–463),
all areas were only slightly altered
by modern disturbance. Excellent
surface visibility resulting from
plowing in many of the parcels (i.e.,
Parcel 477) reduced the intensity
of shovel testing, however, most
parcels contained at least a carpet of
short grasses that required intensive
subsurface testing to fully assess
project impacts (Figures 8.15–8.16).

Figure 8.15. Photo of plowed fields with
excellent surface visibility in Parcel 478.

Along the seven-mile segment
between IH 45 and FM 1129,
archeologists excavated 426 shovel
tests and an additional 21 along an
abandoned reroute between Parcels
476 and 478. Observations from
local shovel tests were typical of
the western portion of the segment,
containing 40 centimeters of sandy
clay loam (7.5YR 6/4) with gravels
overlying 10 centimeters of clay

between IH 45 and FM 1129 as seen in Parcel 482.
Farther east, soils in this segment
were generally shallow, consisting of
compact clay (10YR 4/3 and 10YR
3/3) and sandy clay overlying very dense, gravelly, calcium-rich dense clays (10YR 5/4) that
were interpreted as sterile subsoils. Near the eastern terminus at FM 1129, soils consist of a
thin, 20-centimeter upper clay (10YR 4/4) zone overlying 15 centimeters of clay (10YR 4/2)
(see Shovel Test A482B283). The segment was found to be devoid of archeological resources
and no sites, features, or isolates were observed. In Parcel 480, TRWD engineers propose to
include a small staging area south of the proposed 450-foot evaluation corridor. Field survey
in the immediate vicinity suggested that these activities would not likely impact significant
archeological deposits and the proposed staging area footprint was cleared through desktoplevel review only.

FM 1129 to JB-2
From Parcel 1129 to the proposed
JB-2 booster pump station site
(a distance of 4.2 miles), the IPL
pipeline corridor continues again
through open, flat, or gently-rolling
upland fields and pastures intercut
with small ephemeral drainages
(Figure 8.17). Evidence of modern
disturbance was generally minimal,
though archeologists did encounter
isolated push piles and evidence
of construction-related impacts in
some parcels (i.e., Parcels 496 and
Figure 8.17. Typical view of the

tests were excavated in this portion
of the IPL survey with archeologists
encountering a continued trend of shallow, upland clays overlying sterile subsoil. Soils typical
of the segment contain 50 centimeters of dense clays (10YR 3/2) overlying subsoil (see
Shovel Test A492A139). Farther to the east, tests begin exhibiting transitional elements of the
Trinity River floodplain with archeologists observing a fine sandy loam (10YR 4/4) overlying
a dense clay (10YR 2/1) subsoil (see Shovel Test A505F396). Archeologists also evaluated
two alternative locations for the proposed JB-2 site within this portion of the IPL corridor.
Including these two area surveys, archeologists documented four historic-period archeological
sites in this area (41NV714–715, 718, and 721). The land again continues to be flat pasture
land to where it crosses CR 3180 at Parcel 505. Soils within this area consist of 45 centimeters
of silty clay (10YR 4/4) (see Shovel Test A505F96).
Segment 16 - JB-2 Site to SH 31 (Final and Abandoned Routes)
As described above, the IPL corridor also connects to the Richland-Chambers Reservoir,
pulling water from that reservoir to be pumped west along Segment 16, an approximately
12-mile northwest to southeast running pipeline corridor that ties into the main route at the
JB-2 site. While the proposed final Segment 16 connects to the final JB-2 site in Parcel 508, the
original pipeline alignment was farther east, and joined the main route at Parcel 528. Within the
northern half of the preferred Segment 16 corridor, archeologists continued to encounter flat,
large, open pastures with shallow, upland sediments (Figure 8.18). From the JB-2 site to State
Highway (SH) 31 (a distance of 5.4 linear miles), the archeology team excavated 207 shovel
tests at roughly 150-meter intervals; all of which were negative for archeological materials.
Within Parcels 894–902, the land was recently plowed with excellent surface visibility (>80
percent; Figure 8.19). In these areas, shovel tests were spaced farther apart, or were abandoned
altogether, with teams relying on surface inspection only. Shovel tests typical of this area
consist of 30 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 30+ centimeters of dense
clay (10YR 4/2) (see Shovel Test D913OT6). Other areas were well maintained with grassy

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

pastures with poor visibility and shallow,
rocky sediments with distinct, orange
clay subsoils (see Parcels 914 and 920).
A significant proportion of the original
Segment 16 corridor north of SH 31
was also investigated during the early
stages of survey. Along the four-mile
original survey route (Parcels 528–546,
853–857), archeologists excavated 162
shovel tests through similar plowed
fields and grassy pastures, though the
terrain was more rolling and varied than
the nearly featureless preferred corridor
to the west (Figure 8.20). Extremely
cold temperatures at the time of survey
along this area (1°F with wind chill)
reduced the archeologists’ ability to
excavate deep shovel tests, but the crews
identified increased silt content and a
distinct red, wet clay subsoil in most
locations. Shovel Test B543F120, dug in
Parcel 543 was typical of the segment,
containing brown silty loam for the upper
30 centimeters (10YR4/4) followed by
20 centimeters of dark brown silty clay
loams (10YR3/4). In many areas, this
clay loam overlay a pale brown and
red mottled clay that was interpreted as
sterile subsoil. Closer to SH 31, a typical
soil column consists of 60 centimeters of
sandy loam (7.5YR 5/4) overlying dense
clay (10YR 5/1) subsoil (see Shovel Test
B546E131). Site 41NV707, a historic
farmstead remnant, was recorded within
the now-abandoned portion of Segment
16 (see below).

floodplain between Parcels 891
and 892 then rises again to the flat,
open uplands common throughout
the county that continues to the
segment’s terminus at the existing
Richland-Chambers Reservoir, 6.8
miles south of Highway 31 (Figures
8.21–8.22). Along with shovel
testing, archeologists excavated a
backhoe trench on the southern and
northern creek banks within Parcels
891 and 892 respectively while
the crews briefly recorded a minor
historic archeological trash scatter
north of the creek (Site 41NV717).
Between SH 31 and the RichlandChambers Reservoir, archeologists
excavated 168 shovel tests along
relatively large 180-meter intervals.
Initial versions of the revised
Segment 16 diverge from the final
proposed route at Parcel 891,
moving a short distance to the west.
Archeologists completed intensive
survey along this initial reroute
corridor, excavating 82 shovel
tests through repeated open, flat,
plowed fields in shallow uplands.
Shovel Test A880F600 was typical
of the segment, described as 30
centimeters of sandy clay loam
(10YR 4/4) overlying clay (10YR
5/3) interpreted as subsoil.

floodplain vicinity (Parcel 891 or 892).

and flat uplands common throughout the

After survey was complete, TRWD
elected to shift the proposed final
pipeline a short distance (~150 meters) west between Parcels 882 and 891, and surveyors
returned to the area to evaluate the revised final corridor. Archeologists found continued
excellent surface visibility resulting from recent plowing and, owing to these unobstructed
conditions and shovel test observations nearby, elected to complete only limited shovel testing
in site areas, relying almost solely on surface inspection between Parcels 882 and 887 (Figure
8.23). Farther south, archeologists completed a small area survey within Parcels 1063 and 879
in an effort to provide the design teams with a cleared route to connect to existing TRWDowned pipeline infrastructure. During the revised route survey, archeologists recorded two
historic-period archeological sites (41NV719 and 41NV720).

As the proposed final pipeline nears
the Richland-Chambers reservoir, the
final IPL corridor enters an existing
water pipeline permanent easement
that has been archeologically
surveyed and cleared previously (no
permit available). This easement
extends from the southern edge of
Parcel 879 through to the RichlandChambers Reservoir (Figure 8.24).
Due to the abundant disturbances
that would have come with previous
pipeline installation efforts and
the earlier survey’s findings of no
sites, archeologists did not directly
investigate this portion of the line.

Figure 8.23. View of the typical final
pipeline corridor within Parcel 1062.

South of SH 31, the original IPL
Segment 16 survey corridor was
also largely investigated prior to its
abandonment. Within this 6.1-mile
segment, archeologists excavated
266 shovel tests through mixed
terrain and vegetation including
open pastures and fields (Parcels
558, 565) and lowland riparian
woods along several Rush Creek
tributaries (Parcel 555). Soils typical
of the shallower upland context
areas consisted of 40 centimeters
of clay loam (10YR 4/3) over clay

excavated closer to one of the small
tributaries, contained 55 centimeters
of clay loam (10YR 4/3) overlying clay (10YR 5/4) subsoils. Before the route was abandoned,
it was slated to parallel the existing water pipeline easement from Parcels 577 through 584,
utilizing new proposed easements to the immediate east. Archeologists encountered abundant
evidence of disturbed and shallow (30–60 centimeters) sediment. Within this abandoned
corridor, archeologists recorded three archeological sites (41NV708–710) and one non-site
isolate (C562IF1), all relating to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Segment 17 - JB-2 Site to Trinity River
The easternmost IPL segment within Navarro County extends 7.1 miles from the proposed JB-2
facility site and Parcel 511 to the Trinity River east of Parcel 952. The segment is primarily
noteworthy for its transition from the flat uplands to the hilly Trinity River floodplain at the
eastern terminus. As described above, the proposed pipeline permanent easement went through
a series of small revisions in this area (Parcels 1083, 513, etc.), but they generally were small
and easily assessed. At the Trinity River, however, the design teams struggled to identify a
clear route across the channel, resulting in multiple corridors that were mostly surveyed only
to be abandoned (i.e., Parcels 587–601, 942–952). Once a preferred route was found, the IPL
design team elected to tunnel beneath the river.
Archeologists found that the survey corridor continued to be agrarian, and only sparsely
populated with occasional impacts from water tanks, two-track roads, and fences, but the
terrain was increasingly pronounced with distance toward the east. While Parcels 510 and
511 through 515 were described as open cow pastures that slope “gently” toward the south
and east or “gently rolling.” Parcel 524 is recorded as “hilly” and difficult to cross in wet
conditions with denser, more wooded vegetation. These areas were being used primarily as
hunting ranches. As the pipeline descends into the main Trinity River floodplain, the land again
is a flat upland, but it descends abruptly at the River’s edge (Parcels 943–952). From on-site
estimates, the western bank at the proposed final IPL crossing is the erosional bank, depositing
sediments on the eastern side of the waterway. Regardless, backhoe trenching was required to
fully assess potential project impacts within Parcel 949, in the area where the proposed bore
sending pit will be installed.
Along this survey segment, archeologists excavated approximately 323 shovel tests with an
additional 99 excavated along the many short reroutes (generally at 130–150-meter intervals).
Soils near the JB-2 site were shallow upland varieties typical for most of the county. A typical
soil column for this area contains 20 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 5/6) overlying a clay
loam (10YR 6/8) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil (see Shovel Test B511B110). Soils
encountered within Parcels 518 through 522, though located adjacent to a moderate drainage,
were equally shallow with archeologists routinely encountering pale yellow, sterile subsoil at
10–30 cmbs. Continuing east (Parcels 524–527, 587), surveyors encountered siltier soils that
transitioned abruptly to a deep red clay subsoil. A typical soil column of this area contains 20
centimeters of mottled clay (10YR 4/3 with 7.5YR 5/6) overlying a clay subsoil (10YR4/4)
(see Shovel Test C523C27). In Parcels 948–950 (near the eastern terminus) the land is heavily
wooded along the river banks with a typical soil column consisting of 20 centimeters of silty
clay (10YR 4/2) followed by 20 centimeters of silty clay (10YR 3/2) overlying 20 centimeters
of impenetrable clay (10YR 4/4; see Shovel Test C949F618). No new archeological sites were
recorded in this portion of the study corridor, though one previously-recorded prehistoric
scatter was observed in the Trinity River’s cutbank (41NV599).

8.5.2 Facility Site Surveys
JB-2 East Site Survey
Archeological field crews surveyed all of the proposed JB-2 East site alternative during
the Summer of 2011 including Parcels 508, 509, and 867 (Figure 8.25). In the process,
archeologists utilized a combination of surface inspection techniques supplemented with 125
shovel tests. Of these, Shovel Test C509OT4 was positive, containing one piece of historic-age
amethyst glass and one undecorated whiteware sherd. Crews documented the topography as
gently rolling with scrub located along riparian zones containing tall grasses throughout the
rest of the parcels. Soils were very hard and compact and difficult to excavate. On average,
archeologists reached sterile subsoil at a depth of approximately 40–50 cmbs. One historic-age
archeological site (41NV718) was documented within Parcel 508 along with one isolated find
in Parcel 509 (C509IF1; see below).
Architectural historians visited the
survey parcel vicinity during their
survey of the main IPL pipeline
corridor and documented no
historic standing structures within
that main corridor. Additionally,
historians reviewed photographs
taken by archeologists during their
June survey of the larger parcels
and the ½-mile indirect effects
APE to identify the significance of
any standing structures that were
recorded during the investigation.
As a result, no historic-age structures
were documented. This alternative
was ultimately selected as the
preferred facility site.

Cultural resource professionals

utilizing a combination of surface
inspection
and
approximately
160 subsurface shovel tests.
Archeologists found the study area
to be similar to that of JB-2 East with

shallow, upland soils that typically reached 50–70 cmbs. Due to severe drought conditions at the
time, vegetation was relatively sparse and archeologists were afforded excellent (60–80 percent)
surface visibility. During the process, the team documented two historic-age archeological
sites (Sites 41NV714 and 41NV715) and one historic-age isolated find (C863IF1).
Architectural historians visited the survey parcel vicinity during their survey of the main IPL
pipeline and documented no historic standing structures within that main corridor. Additionally,
historians reviewed photographs taken by archeologists during their survey of the larger parcels
to assess the significance of any standing structures within the IPL corridor. Resources NV5001, NV862a-1, and NV863a-1–NV863a-4 were identified and recorded within or adjacent to
the study parcels. No other historic-age structures were identified within the study area and
all resources were considered likely ineligible for listing on the NRHP. This alternative was
ultimately not selected for construction.
Richland-Chambers Reservoir Site (JRC1)
Cultural resource field crews briefly visited the Richland-Chambers Pump Station site, which
would be augmented for additional IPL-related capacity. The survey crew found the area to
be severely modified as a result of grading and subsurface construction of the existing facility
(completed in 1989) and considered that subsurface shovel testing was not warranted to assess
the construction’s potential for impacting intact archeological deposits (Figures 8.27–8.30).
Existing pump and electrical facilities provide a visual reference for what additional elements
will look like on the site. Standing structures observed in the vicinity are considered nonhistoric-age residential buildings that were likely built as lake-front properties after the
reservoir was impounded in 1987 (TPWD 2013; see Figures 8.22 and 8.2). Since the facility is
existing and similar elements are being added within the existing footprint, it is assumed that
construction will have no indirect effects on non-archeological historic properties within the
vicinity of the pump station.

8.5.3 Backhoe Trenching Effort
The IPL corridor crosses several waterways as it passes through Navarro County including
Waxahachie Creek/Slough and Chambers Creek, Cummins Creek, Rush Creek, and along
the Trinity River. Archeologists excavated 15 backhoe trenches at these various crossings to
identify the potential for impacts to deep archeological materials. Though archeologists did
encounter three isolated artifacts in two trenches the overwhelming majority of the excavations
were resource-free and additional excavations in these areas are considered unwarranted.
Waxahachie Creek/Slough and Chambers Creek
As discussed in the previous chapter, Waxahachie Creek/Slough was subject to extensive
backhoe trenching as the IPL corriodor passed through its long floodplain. While trenching
was conducted as far east as Parcel 419, archeologists excavated four backhoe trenches along
drainages within the vicinity of Navarro County within Parcels 426 and 429–431 (Figure 8.31).

Geomorphologists again assisted with excavations and in the interpretation of soil profiles (see
Appendix D).
According to Gregory and Frederick (this volume), backhoe trenches within Parcel 426
(Trenches 426-1 and 426-2) contain a similar depositional environment to those observed in
Parcels 419–423 (see Chapter 7). Backhoe Trench 426-1, placed on a valley terrace overlooking
a tributary channel to the east, contained a 280-centimeter soil column divided into five
depositional horizons that are all likely pre-cultural, being attributed to the late-Pleistocene
Unit A described in Chapter 7 (Figures 8.32–8.33). Trench 426-2, dug on the opposite bank
contained three horizons that were attributed to Depositional Units C and D (see Appendix D;
Figure 8.34). Dating to the Late Holocene, these depositional units are the youngest observed
in the floodplain. As stated above, all backhoe trenches in this area were devoid of cultural
resources.

Farther east, archeologists excavated
two trenches within a relict alluvial
fan in Parcel 429 (Trenches 429-1 and
429-2; see Figure 8.31; Figures 8.35–
8.36; Tables 8.2–8.3). The trenches,
dug on the western and eastern sides
of the fan (respectively), revealed a
40–85 centimeter Holocene alluvial
zone overlying Late Pleistocene fill
that extended to the trench termini
(1.75 meters in Backhoe Trench 429-1
and 3.5 meters in 429-2; see Appendix
D). According to Gregory and
Frederick (this volume), it appears that
the Holocene alluvium in Parcel 429
was deposited in two pulses including
a pedogenically-altered lower pulse
that likely dates to the Late Holocene,
and a younger pulse that occupies the
30-centimeter plow zone. Again, none
of the trenches contained evidence
of cultural occupation, though the
sediments suggest that such materials
could be present on this landform.

Continuing east, archeologists excavated

eastern and western banks of Chambers
Creek (Trenches 430-1, 430-2, 431-1, and
431-2; see Figure 8.31, Figures 8.37–

excavations within Parcel 430 only. All
excavations in Parcel 431 were interpreted
through non-geomorphologist observation.
According to Gregory and Frederick (this

a late Pleistocene landform similar to that
observed within Parcel 429 with a thin late
Holocene lens nearest the channel (Tables

On the opposite bank (Parcel 431) excavators encountered a uniform depositional regime that
was similar to that observed in Backhoe Trench 430-2 with the upper 150–200 centimeters of
sediments containing black to dark brown clay loams overlying a distinct 2.5Y 4/3 carbonaterich subsoil (Table 8.6, Figure 8.40). Archeologists did observe a single chert cobble within
Backhoe Trench 431-1 at 180–200 cmbs that has one large possible flake scar on its face,
indicating that the item may be a core (Figures 8.41–8.42). Lacking any other marks, it could
also simply be a naturally-deposited stone or manuport. No other artifacts were observed in the
trench or its backdirt, nor were any features or soil variations observed in the trench walls. As
such, the find was considered a non-site isolate (D431IF1). As with trenches excavated along
this floodplain within Ellis County, backhoe trenching indicates that in many locations Holocene
sediments continue beyond the maximum reach of the backhoe. Investigations, however, were
considered sufficient to complete a due diligence effort to assess potential project impacts and
no further work in the area is recommended.

for investigations in Parcel 439 (Appendix D). According
to Gregory and Frederick (this volume), the Cummins
Creek valley is separated from the Waxahachie and
Chambers Creek Valley by a long, narrow ridge that
trends northwest to southeast between the two channels.
Within the valley, surveyors found that the landform
exhibits several linear depressions that appear to be
paleochannels of Cummins Creek; Trench 438-1 was
situated on a low rise between two such depressions.
The modern creek channel, which lies a short distance
(~40 meters) from the trench excavation, is about 10

On the western bank, archeologists
excavated Backhoe Trench 438-1 to
a depth of approximately 3.5 meters,
revealing two stratigraphic units: 1) a
1.4-meter-thick drape of Late Holocene
alluvium, and 2) a buried soil formed in a
Late Pleistocene alluvial deposit (Figure
8.45; Table 8.7). At the base of the
Holocene deposits, near its interface with
the Pleistocene alluvium, archeologists
recorded one possible flake and one
possible burned rock (Figure 8.46).
These items were found in an otherwise

cobbles noted and bear slight indications
of cultural use, but their identification as artifacts is tentative and the finds were recorded as
a non-site isolate (D438IF1). If they indeed are archeological artifacts, this suggests that the
Pleistocene deposits served as a prehistoric occupational surface (see Figure 8.39). Shovel
testing in the vicinity, as well as the geomorphologists’ interpretation of the area suggested that
additional trenching in this area was unwarranted.

On the east bank, archeologists completed two backhoe trenches (Trenches 439-1 and 439-2;
see Figure 8.31). Both trenches were very similar, being excavated to approximately 3.2–
3.6 meters in depth and exhibiting a six-zone soil profile (Figure 8.47; Tables 8.8–8.9). In
comparing the soils encountered on this bank with geomorpohological interpretations of Trench
438-1, archeologists conclude that a Holocene-age alluvial deposit roughly 80–110 centimeters
thick lies atop a much older soil horizon that, is carbonate-rich and well-developed and likely
predates any cultural occupation. Unlike on Parcel 438, none of the trenches contained any
archeological materials and the landform was considered to be devoid of archeological site
potential.

Rush Creek
The proposed IPL permanent easement crosses the narrow (approximately 80 meters wide)
northwest-southeast-trending Rush Creek floodplain in Parcels 891 and 892, immediately south
of SH 31. It was determined that this area would require backhoe trenching to assess the potential
for construction to impact deep archeological sites (Figures 8.48–8.49). Archeologists placed
two backhoe trenches (Trenches 891-1 and 892-1) on opposite banks of the waterway. Neither
trench contained archeological materials, features, or other indications of intact archeological
deposits in the floodplain area. As can be seen in Figure 8.40, the Rush Creek floodplain is
distinct, lying below a prominent ridgeline that parallels the water course. Archeologists noted
that several relic channels meander through the floodplain and crews placed trenches between
those depressions approximately 20 meters from the creek’s edge. On the northern bank (Parcel
892) Backhoe Trench 892-1 reached a maximum depth of 350 centimeters through a series of
seven soil zones. As can be seen in Table 8.10, the upper 150 centimeters of sediments are
composed of overlapping layers of silty loams and sandy clay loams that transition to a sandy
clay that extends to the terminus (Figure 8.50). The silty clays and clay loams are interpreted
as Holocene-age deposits, however, increasing iron inclusions beginning at 50 centimeters
suggests that these loams may be older.

On the southern bank (Parcel 891), the backhoe excavations revealed six soil zones that
consisted of varying densities of silty clays through to its terminus at 350–400 cmbs (Table
8.11; Figures 8.51–8.52). Detailed analysis of the trench walls was impossible as the trench
reached the water table at approximately 200 centimeters and seeping water caved profiles in
regularly. A lack of a distinctly sterile clay subsoil in this area indicates that all sediments may
be of Holocene age, however, the raised water table suggests that archeological deposits may
not be found below the 200-centimeter elevation range. With such a narrow floodplain overall
and a lack of identified archeological resources, it is unlikely that construction across the Rush
Creek floodplain will impact significant archeological materials and additional investigations
in the area are unwarranted.

Trinity River (Western Bank)
As mentioned above, the Trinity River crossing was one of the more challenging from an IPL
design perspective as engineers evaluated numerous routes across the waterway during the
course of field investigations ultimately selecting the final route depicted on Figure 8.53. This
large waterway and its associated well-developed depositional system was a keenly anticipated
investigation target from the onset of archeological field investigations. Though the current
designs call for subsurface tunneling across the main channel, archeologists excavated two
backhoe trenches (Backhoe Trenches 949-1 and 949-2) in Navarro County with the remainder
located east of the channel in Henderson County (see Chapter 9). Consulting geomorphologists
assisted with monitoring and interpretation for Backhoe Trench 949-1 (see Appendix D) while
AmaTerra field investigators oversaw excavation of Backhoe Trench 949-2 on their own. Of
the two excavated, neither is located within the proposed final IPL permanent easement as the
final alignment shifted after trenching was completed. Backhoe Trench 949-2, however, dug
in a wooded area initially at the proposed bore sending pit location, is within the final 450foot evaluation corridor and close enough to the final alignment to assess construction-related
impact potential.
As described above, the Trinity River’s western bank at the IPL corridor is largely erosional
with a distinct, flat primary terrace meeting abruptly at the channel edge dropoff to the east and
rising westward approximately 400 meters west of the water (Figures 8.54–8.56). According to
Gregory and Frederick (this volume), the IPL’s western Trinity River approach crosses through
the river’s Carrollton terrace. Characterized by a non-calcerous matrix of red Bt and Bk loamy
alluvium overlying bedrock, the Carrollton terrace is roughly 20,000–30,000 years old.

As can be seen in Tables 8.12–8.13, both trenches revealed similar soil columns, extending to
320–340 cmbs (respectively; Figures 8.57–8.59). The A Horizon is characterized by clayey,
melanized alluvium with slickensides while the B Horizon is notable for its increased clay
content and one-meter-thick calcic horizons. At the base of the profile, the C Horizon (found
primarily in Backhoe Trench 949-1) is often loose sand. None of the trenches contained
archeological materials while the exposed soil column revealed sediments that are considered
to predate human occupation in the region. Accordingly, IPL-related construction on the
Trinity’s western bank will not likely impact intact, deeply buried archeological deposits and
additional detailed investigations in the area are not warranted.8.6 Identified Archeological

Identified Archeological Resources

During the course of archeological survey of the IPL corridor, its facility sites and the various
considered alternatives, archeologists documented 13 archeological sites (41NV599, 706–710,
714, 715, 717–721) and 11 archeological isolated finds (Table 8.14). Of this tally, half (5 sites
and 4 isolates) of the resources are located within the proposed IPL impact footprint. The
majority of sites identified are historic age rural farmsteads and farmstead ruins, however,
a small complement of prehistoric archeological components were also identified during
investigations. Below is a brief summary of each recorded site.

8.6.1 Navarro County Archeological Sites
As discussed previously, due to the large survey corridor and the multiple revisions of the
proposed IPL permanent easement, a larger number of archeological sites were recorded than
are actually located within the proposed 150-foot permanent easement (considered the direct
impact footprint and the APE for direct effects to archeological resources). The following
archeological site discussion is divided into two sections: 1) those sites that wholly or partially
are found within the proposed final permanent easement and have the potential to be impacted
by the project); and 2) those that lie outside of the APE easement and are not likely to be
impacted.

Sites found within the impact footprint will include detailed regulatory recommendations
(including NRHP/SAL eligibility findings) and, in the instance of historic archeological sites,
archival research summaries. Those sites lying outside of that corridor will not be impacted
by project-related construction and are presented for inventory purposes only with minimal
interpretation and/or regulatory recommendations offered.

41NV706
Site 41NV706 is the remnant of a small, historic-age tenant farmstead with a moderate to high
density accumulation of surficial household debris and construction material (Figures 8.608.61). The site includes a collapsed main house (Feature 1), a brick well/cistern (Feature 2),
a dirt road (Feature 3), and a barbed wire fence that surrounds the house (Feature 4). The site
is located within the IPL 150-foot permanent easement, spanning nearly the full width of the
450-foot evaluation corridor. Occupying an area of approximately 120 x 100 meters (north/
south x east/west), the site is situated on top of a level rise. Local vegetation consists of a dense
stand of elm and post oak trees. Overall, site surface visibility is estimated at approximately 20
percent with grasses and leaf litter the most common obstructions. According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Wilson clay loam of Quaternary age derived
from mixed soils. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 50
centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/2) overlying a dense clay (10YR 3/1) that was interpreted
as sterile subsoil. Shovel tests typically terminated between 20 and 40 cmbs after encountering
sterile subsoil. Modern disturbances within the site are moderate, consisting of isolated push
piles that are likely the result of the main house’s demolition.
The main house structure remnant (Feature 1) measures approximately 14 x 22 feet in size. The
structure was built using pulled wire nails and has a single collapsed red-brick chimney (Figure
8.62). Bricks from the chimney are uniform, machine-made examples, and display very little
variability in paste color/firing conditions, suggesting a more recent manufacturing date. Due to
the structure’s complete collapse, archeologists were unable to discern internal rooms or other
components from the pile that remains. Approximately 50 feet to the southeast, archeologists
recorded Feature 2, a brick and mortar well/cistern made of orange “CORSICANA” brick
(Figure 8.63). The well/cistern opening had been covered by a pile of logs and brush and
was flush with the ground surface with no superstructure observed. The well opening is
approximately two feet in diameter and is estimated to be 25 feet deep. A wire, fence-lined
two-track road (Feature 3) leading to the site from the north beyond the survey corridor ends
in a small gravel driveway approximately 40 feet east of the main house. Finally, surrounding
the main house area is an octagonal barbed-wire fence (Feature 4).

Surficial manifestations of Site
41NV706 were recorded near Feature
1 and approximately 30 meters south
of Feature 2. The cultural materials
included undecorated whiteware sherds,
clear bottle glass shards, scrap metal,
house debris, structural materials, and
corrugated metal. A variety of whole
glass bottles were noted littering
the ground surface around the main
structure. These included a brown glass
bleach bottle (Figure 8.64), an aqua
hobbleskirt Coca-Cola bottle from
the Corsicana plant (Figure 8.65), a
clear relief-printed Pepsi-Cola bottle
(Figure 8.66), and an unlabeled aqua
Duraglas bottle from Owens-Illinois
Bottle Works. A review of maker’s
marks suggests that these vessels all
date to the late 1940s and early 1950s
(Lockhart 2012; ABCH 2012). The
Duraglas bottle (from a Waco plant)
is stamped with a 1952 manufacture
date and Pepsi-Cola is reported to have
abandoned their full name on bottles in
1953.

tests during their investigations of Site

E245, E246, F272, F228, and OT1-5). All shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials
indicating that the site is entirely limited to surficial manifestations.
According to available deed records, the property was included in a large number of parcels
sold to Virgil Atchley and his wife by a group of individuals who were most likely members
of the Fortson family. They included Joe B. Fortson, Jr., Jennie Edmondson Bartlett (widow),
and Norlaine (wife) and Carroll (husband) Barton who transferred the property (and several
others) to the current landowner in 1954 (Volume
573, pg. 553). The site, based upon the associated
artifact assemblage, was likely abandoned shortly
before this land transfer. The deed record did not
specify which tract was owned by which individual
so further refinement of site ownership was difficult.
Virgil and Mamie Atchley are listed in the 1940
Census in Navarro County along with their two
children, J. W. and Barbara, with Virgil listed as a
farmer.

B. Fortson, Senior (from Bartlett 2013a).

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

The Fortson family, particularly during the 1920s
through the 1950s, was prominent to Navarro
County. A representative of the current landowner
(personal communication) stated that the property
had been in his family for four generations, first
owned by his great-grandfather, Joe B. Fortson,
Sr. (Figure 8.67). The representative said that
Mr. Fortson built several tenant farm houses on
the property and that this is likely the remnant of
such a structure. Mr. Fortson is listed in several US
censuses (1910–1940) along with his son of the
same name. According to the 1930 Census, Joe B.
Fortson Sr. is the president of a bank while his son,
Joe Jr., is the manager of a general store.
A Fortson family history available online (Bartlett
2013a) includes a summary of Mr. Fortson Senior’s
staggering list of accomplishments in the Navarro
County area. Born in 1872 in Navarro County,
Joe and his brother, John started a cotton gin and
mercantile business in 1890 which was called
Fortson Brothers. In 1900, he started the First State
Bank of Rice (which he helmed until his death
50 years later). Fortson Brothers then entered the
construction industry and built many of the levees
seen in the region (possibly the large levee along
Waxahachie Creek adjacent to the IPL survey
287

Chapter 8

Results — Navarro County

corridor; see Chapter 7). By 1926, he
had moved to Corsicana and was the
President of Corsicana National Bank and
the General American Finance Company.
While heading financial interests, Mr.
Fortson also was the director of the
Trinity Improvement Association which
oversaw soil conservation and flood
control efforts (no doubt a convenient
philanthropy for an individual leading
a levee construction business). In the
1930s, he purchased an ice plant (the
Pure Ice Company) in nearby Palestine
and eventually entered the hotel business
in his last decade, purchasing the
Navarro and Beaton Hotels in Corsicana.
Upon Joe Senior’s death, Joe Junior took
over most of his father’s titles including
leading the First State Bank of Rice and
the Corsicana National Bank (Bartlett
2013b).
Archeologists reviewed a 1940 aerial
photograph of the site vicinity and found
no indications of a standing structure
at that location (Figure 8.68). Two
structures are visible along the road to
the north that were recorded as part of
the IPL historic structure survey (see
below). A stand of trees is visible along
the southern site periphery but those trees
do not match any of the recorded feature
locations. A 1960 aerial photograph,
however, does include the structure at
the location of Feature 1, indicating that
it was built some time between 1940 and
1960 (Figure 8.69). This would indicate
that the house and trash scatter were
added after that date (as is suggested by
the site’s artifact assemblage).

Based on this research, Site 41NV706 represents a historic-age tenant farmstead that has
been abandoned and subsequently fallen to ruin, leaving only fragmented surficial elements.
Though the property can be linked to individuals of local historical prominence, Joe B. Fortson
Senior and Junior, the site is most likely associated with less storied occupants. Tenant farms
such as this are very common in the region and are not, especially in the condition that Site
41NV706 is in, considered to be archeologically significant. The surface scatter of glass bottles
point to a terminal date of occupation in the early 1950s. Given that all artifacts date to the
1950s (roughly), and given that they are limited to the surface of the site, reducing potential
interpretability, Site 41NV706 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
The site is located within the proposed IPL permanent easement and will likely be impacted by
proposed construction. However, no further work is recommended for this site.
41NV717
Site 41NV717 is a historic-period farmstead site consisting of a well and former home site
(Figure 8.70). The site measures approximately 40 x 25 meters (north/south x east/west) and
is located in the IPL permanent easement within Segment 16. The site sits on a broad upland
terrace (Figure 8.71) that gradually slopes down toward Rush Creek, located one kilometer
to the south. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at 0–25 percent due to the presence of
opportunistic grasses and forbs in an otherwise fallow pasture. Local vegetation consists of
stands of mesquite trees with intermixed live oaks. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the eastern portion of the site are Mabank very fine sandy loam consisting of
clayey alluvium of Quaternary age derived from mixed sources. The western portion of the
site is made up of Wilson clay loam. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil
column of 40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3) containing some small gravels overlying
compact clay (10YR 4/2). Shovel tests typically terminated at 40 cmbs upon encountering
sterile subsoil. Modern disturbances consist of agricultural use and cattle grazing.
At Site 41NV717 archeologists recorded two surficial features. Feature 1 is a brick well with a
square opening that measures approximately 35-1/2 inches x 36-1/2 inches. The well opening
rises 35 inches above the ground surface, and is constructed of concrete within a bailing wire
guard (Figure 8.72). Below the surface, the well shape is round and composed of brick; the
diameter of the brick portion of the well is approximately 2-1/2 feet. The depth of the well
could not be measured, but is approximated to be 30–35 feet. Feature 2 is the remnant of
former structure represented by at least six concrete pier and beam footings for a structure that
measured approximately 24 x 13 feet. These piers are located approximately 30 feet southeast
of the well (Figure 8.73). Surface scatters of “Whiteselle Cherry Reds Corsicana” brick, milled
timber, clear bottle glass shards, and metal fragments were also observed within the site area.
Whiteselle Cherry Reds are a very common variety of brick in this region and were produced
from the late 1890s well into the later 20th century. Based on the building materials used for
the house piers and well, it seems likely that the features date to the 1930s or later.
Archeologists excavated six shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV717 (OT1-OT3,
D107, B100, and A101; Table 8.15). Shovel Test OT2 contained one undecorated whiteware

(Figure 8.74). Remaining shovel tests
were devoid of cultural materials.
Archeologists briefly interviewed the
property’s 94-year-old landowner for
information regarding the site’s origins
and individuals likely associated with
it. According to the owner, the well and
foundation footings are associated with
a former homestead. When the owner’s
father, Wiley Hemphill, purchased the
property in the 1920s she recalls that the
house was not present. According to the
Figure 8.74. Photograph of whiteware

public north/south road that crossed
the nearby railroad tracks and is now a
private two-track road. According to the
1920 and 1930 US Census, Wiley Hemphill is a farmer, living with his wife Hardowe and
his two daughters. Ms. Hemphill could not recall who owned the property before her father,
though it seems clear from interviews and the features themselves that the home site was built
during the Hemphill’s ownership of the property, probably as a tenant farm. More extensive
deed research would be needed to identify the previous owners. However, given the date of the
features, such investigations were considered unwarranted.
Site 41NV717 is a historic-period tenant farmstead from the 1930s or later. The site is not
associated with an individual or event of historical significance and cultural materials are
diffuse, as well as common to this region. It is unlikely that extensive additional investigations
would yield substantial contributions to our knowledge of tenant farming and owner-farmed
lands. Accordingly, Site 41NV717 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
The site is located within the proposed IPL permanent easement and will likely be impacted by
construction, however, no further work is recommended for this site.

Site 41NV718 is a historicperiod farmstead, located
within the proposed JB-2 East
facility site, characterized
by a barn (Feature 1), a
repurposed
hand-hewn
log structure (Feature 3), a
residential yard and home
remnant (Feature 3), an
associated well (Feature
4), and a shallowly-buried
brick jumble (Feature 5;
Figures 8.75 and 8.76). As
can be seen in Figure 8.75,
site features are distributed
with the house foundation
and well to the north and
the barn and fallen handhewn log structure to the
south. A power line runs
north to south across the site
while a gas line bisects the
site east to west (between
the corn-crib and the house
remnant). The house and

of the surrounding landform,
within a grove of trees. The
remnants of a barbed wire
fence run east to west just north of the log structure while a stock pond is located just south of
the barn (Feature 1). The centroid of the site is located near the centerline of the proposed IPL
line in Segment 15-1. The site is situated on a flat terrace and occupies an area of approximately
600 x 400 feet (north/south x east/west). Local vegetation consists of mesquite trees and an oak

hickory forest. Overall, site visibility was estimated at approximately 20 percent. According to
the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Crockett soils with 2–5 percent
slopes and Crockett fine sandy loam with 1–3 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests
revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3) overlying clay (10YR
4/3) subsoil. Shovel tests typically terminated between 40 and 60 cmbs upon encountering
compact clay. Modern disturbances include gas and power lines bisecting the site.
Surficial manifestations of Site 41NV718 include the features mentioned above, as well as
lumber, metal sheeting, and rusted farm equipment, all located primarily toward the south,
near the stock pond and barn. The eastern site periphery is composed of push piles and jumbles
of rusting farm equipment and trash that was likely deposited after the house was demolished
(see below).
At Site 41NV718’s southern segment, archeologists recorded a small agricultural complex.
Along with the variety of scattered farming implements and milled lumber, archeologists
recorded a barn and a collapsed ancillary structure. Feature 1, the front-gabled barn, retains an
uncorrugated metal roof, measuring 30 x 16.5 feet (Figure 8.77). The structure is built with
rough-hewn posts sided with dimensional board and batten siding, held by wire nails. The
structure consists of three separate bays—two open-air bays on either side of a central enclosed
room. A loading door is seen near the peak of the gabled roof on the western entrance. Fifty
feet northwest of the wooden barn is Feature 2, a collapsed, hand-hewn log structure in poor
condition measuring approximately 10 feet x 20 feet and standing approximately four feet
above the ground (Figure 8.78). Composed of approximately 12 somewhat clumsily-adzed
logs (each measuring approximately 9 inches in diameter) interlocked at the one remaining
intact corner (southeast) with square mortises, Feature 2 was initially thought to be a corn
crib (Figure 8.79). Two of the beams do include round trunnel holes in the motises that were
thought to suggest a very early construction date. However, those holes are only on a small
proportion of the beams, none of the holes correspond to holes on neighboring timbers, and
no actual trunnels are visible, indicating that the holes are not serving a fastening purpose any
more. This suggests that the feature may be built of repurposed timbers from an older structure

that is now no longer extant. Cut and wire nails have since been fastened along some of the
timber faces (see Figure 8.78). Metal sheeting lies next to the timbers that likely served as the
structure’s roof while six-inch dimensional lumber is likely the roof’s supporting framework.
Along the feature’s southern wall, archeologists noted a low hinge and additional dimensional
lumber that forms a door that was likely the entrance. Archeologists excavated one shovel
test within the feature and found a distinct, pale loam that was very different from any of the
remaining tests at the site (see below) but was also devoid of archeological materials.
Moving approximately 250 feet north of the agricultural complex, Site 41NV718 also includes
a residential area consisting of a yard, a foundation, and a brick well. Feature 3, the house
foundation and associated yard is primarily visible by surficial scatter of burned and broken brick
and ash surrounded by two linear
rows of ornamental irises, forming a
right angle at the feature’s northwest
corner (Figure 8.80). At the center of
the southern portion of the apparent
house location, archeologists noted
a broad, amorphous, low concrete
mound that may have served as the
foundation of a chimney (Figure
8.81). Archeologists excavated
a single broad shovel test at this
location (OT104) that was devoid
of archeological materials, exposing
a pile that was approximately three
feet wide. Beyond the concrete
mound, no structural remnants or
Figure 8.79. Detail of Feature 2’s southeast
foundations were observed within
corner, the most intact of the feature.
Feature 3 though an abundance of
nails, glass, and ash/charcoal in
shovel tests (see below) suggests a
structure once stood at this location
that eventually burned down.
Immediately east of the structure
remnant is the residence’s water
supply cistern (Feature 4).

Feature 4 is a brick cistern located
east of the foundation (Figure

approximately eight inches thick.

visible on the cistern’s exterior are mostly buff-colored, small and slightly rounded variety
specimens of variable coloring with a soft, sandy mortar suggesting a nineteenth century
construction date. A repair of later Whiteselle Cherry Reds is visible on the lip. There is a low
ash and charcoal mound around the cistern which looks to contain material that has been moved
and mounded around it. A group of ornamental irises is growing next to the cistern while the
ground surface has a small scatter of bricks and cast-iron piping (2.5-inch outside diameter
of various lengths). When surveyors lifted
some of the pipes, a subsurface scatter of
bricks was found emanating southward
from the cistern (Figure 8.83). The bricks,
exposed in Shovel Test OT101, were a
single layer of Whiteselle Cherry Reds and
Corsicana Brick Company varieties that
become increasingly jumbled and broken
up with distance to the south and west.
This jumble, measuring approximately 4
x 2.5 feet (north/south x east/west) was
recorded as Feature 5. Observed to have
an approximate herringbone arrangement,
Feature 5 is believed to be a component of
the cistern (e.g., overflow line).

OT30, also adjacent to Feature 4, contained two whiteware sherds (one undecorated and one
blue transfer ware), one clear glass shard, and two cut nails (0–20 cmbs). The whiteware
sherds in both tests look to be burned. Shovel Test OT101 contained three wire nails, one
cut nail, three shards of clear glass, one shard of ornate clear glass, and one painted clear
glass (0–20 cmbs). Shovel Test OT102 contained two shards of broken clear glass, one wire
nail, one iron pipe fragment, and one square-head ⅞-inch machine screw, all in the upper 20
centimeters of sediments. Shovel Test OT103 contained six clear glass shards, one cut nail
fragment, one whiteware sherd (0–20 cmbs), one additional shard of clear glass, one shard of
rippled dark green glass, and a brick fragment (20–40 cmbs). Shovel Test OT105 near where
the modern gas pipeline crosses the site contained a copper strap, a fence staple, and a piece of
unidentifiable metal (0–20 cmbs). Shovel Test OT106, excavated inside of Feature 2 contained
only an unidentifiable piece of metal.
Archeologists briefly interviewed the property’s current landowner in an effort to tie the site to
a specific individual. The owner (personal communication) explained that the house and one
of the barns (presumably the corn crib) had burned down before he purchased the property
approximately 20 years ago. This supports field observations that the house may have been
destroyed through fire. Roughly 50 years earlier, the property had been owned by the Tramel
family, who owned the nearby J and R Ranch. The land, legally described as a 139.58-acre
portion of the Henry Brown Survey, Abstract 95, Tract 10, was owned by James and Glenda
Perry, who purchased the land from William and Allen Stevenson in March of 1995 (Volume
1305, pg. 846). From the Navarro County deed records, the Stevensons purchased a portion of
three separate tracts and sold all portions to the Perrys. Investigators did deed and title research
on all three portions in an effort to identify all possible owners of the specific property on
which Site 41NV718 is located and parcel descriptions were difficult to decipher clearly. The
first tract, described as a 163-acre portion of the above-mentioned survey, was in the Stevenson
family from December of 1948 when the land was purchased by Herbert Stevenson from Mrs.
Mary Tramel (Volume 486, pg. 55), a widow of husband Shelah V. Tramel (1886–1941; Figure
8.84). From conversations with the Perrys, the site is located on the former Tramel ranch and
this parcel is the most likely candidate of the three included in the previous land sale.

Shelah, a World War I veteran, was
the second of nine children of Elijah
and Thena Davis-Tramel (1860–1938;
Figures 8.85 and 8.86), whose name
is frequently included in deed indices
throughout this portion of Navarro
County in the late 1800s and early
1900s, including his ownership of this
parcel in particular. The Tramels were
a prominent family in this region of
Navarro County, moving to the area
from DeKalb County, Tennessee in 1889
(Brown and Holman 2006). According
to the 1930 U.S. Census, Elijah is
listed as a farmer and the sheer number
of land purchases observed in deed
indices suggests that Elijah was quite
successful. While researchers could not
find a record of the land transfer from
Elijah to Shelah, it is assumed to have
happened at some point as the parcel
was purchased by Elijah (not Shelah)
in August of 1911 from a James W.
Westbrook (Volume 168, pg. 596).
Westbrook, like Elijah Tramel, was a
landowner of some success in the area
who owned a large number of parcels.
The success of both men muddies the
archival record in this area as there
are multiple sales of land within the
Brown Survey from Westbrook to
Tramel throughout the 1910s with none
individually matching the 163.8-acres
defined above. The son of Zachariah
Westbrook (1809–1878), an immigrant
from South Carolina, James was a
prominent early settler of the region with
siblings settling in Navarro and nearby
Ellis County (Williams and Knox 2009).
To further confuse research, James
Westbrook was presumably related to
another James Westbrook as well as a
John Westbrook while another unrelated
John Westbrook lived in the county as

well. Many index records
of purchases in the late
19th century relevant
to this area simply state
“J. Westbrook” as the
purchaser from a variety
of individuals; too many
to attempt to archivally
chase further. A likely
earlier purchase of the
parcel was recorded in
Volume 130 (pg. 126)
when J. W. Westbrook
bought a parcel of the
Brown Survey from W.
Franklin in December of
1883.

The
second
parcel
included in the Stevenson
land sale in 1995 is a 32-acre tract Eila and Herbert Stevenson purchased from a Mrs. M.A.
Holmes in September of 1947 (Volume 467, pg. 198). Holmes had owned the land for less than
a month, when she sold it, having purchased the parcel from a John Arnett et al. (8/15/1947;
Volume 467, pg. 194). Arnett, in turn had purchased the tract from the J. W. Westbrook discussed
above in June of 1915 (Volume 198, pg. 320). It is presumed that Westbrook, considering the
large amount of land owned and the confusion over the various J. Westbrooks in Navarro
County into the late 1800s, owned the land into the latter 19th century.
The third possible parcel relevant to Site 41NV718 is a 50-acre tract that, like the previous
parcels, was sold to the Stevensons from Mrs. M.A. Holmes—in this instance in December of
1944 (Volume 431, pg. 202). Unlike the previous land, Mrs. Holmes retained the property for
much longer, purchasing it from C. J. and Mary Hall in February of 1917 (Volume 193, pg.
104). The Halls owned the land for less than three months, as they purchased the property from
a Tom Warren in November of 1916 (Volume 180, pg. 419). Warren owned the land for exactly
one year, purchasing the property from a Lucy Albritton in November of 1915 (Volume 195,
pg. 206). In continuing the trend of short parcel ownership, Albritton also owned the land for
slightly more than a year, buying the property from the aforementioned J. W. Westbrook in late
October of 1914 (Volume 192, pg. 166). Again, the Westbrooks likely continued ownership of
the property at least into the 1880s (as discussed above).
While additional records extend the trail of ownership to earlier occupants, given the likely
age of the site (very late 19th to early 20th century) and the confusion associated with the
Westbrook name in the region, it was determined that such efforts were unwarranted. As
mentioned above, Feature 2 likely is composed of repurposed wood from another structure
that is no longer extant. It is possible, though impossible to prove, that the repurposed structure

may have been Westbrook’s, having been dismantled and rebuilt by either Elijah or Shelah, when they
lived there. Additionally, the well, being made of late nineteenth century bricks was also likely built
by Westbrook. The additional site components (pulled wire nail barn, Whiteselle Cherry Reds, etc.)
suggest a post-nineteenth century occupation that more than likely can be attributed to either Elijah
or Shelah Tramel (or both). A lack of refining temporal diagnostics makes further interpretation of the
archival data impossible.
A review of a 1940 aerial photograph of the site area reveals the two functional components of
Site 41NV718 (Figure 8.87). To the north, the site’s residential area includes a residence and
one or two outbuildings to the southeast. A well-worn road leads southeast to the agricultural
area, where the barn and log structure are visible. By 1960, the site appears to be less intensively
utilized, particularly in the agricultural area, as opportunistic trees are now dotting the vicinity
(Figure 8.88).
Site 41NV718 is the scant remnant of a late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century residence
and farming complex within the proposed JB-2 facility site. The five recorded features are
geographically and functionally divided into a southern agricultural area and northern
residential area. Within the agricultural area, the standing barn is common in this region and
was likely built in the early 1910s or 1920s. A fallen, hand-hewn log structure is, in the opinion
of the Principal Investigator, composed of repurposed wood and is not an in situ corn crib as
one speculated. In the residential area, the remnant of the house is limited to linear iris rows,
a chimney foundation, and a surficial and shallowly-buried scatter of glass, whiteware, brick
chunks, and various nails. No structural features or distinct artifacts or artifact clusters were

observed. The residence’s well is in very good condition and likely dates to the latter decade of
the 19th century while the adjacent brick and pipe scatter is most likely the result of the house’s
demolition.
Though the site is among the earliest of the historic-age archeological resources recorded along
the IPL survey area and is associated with a somewhat prominent member of the community in
the early 20th century, the Principal Investigator considers that survey recording has collected
the most valuable data available at the site. Additional shovel tests would likely yield additional
nails, pieces of whiteware, and glass, artifact classes that are quite common throughout the
state. With no additional features to observe and record, no further field investigations are
necessary to document the resource. Though the Trammel and Westbrooks are prominent, they
are not considered to be historically significant. Lacking interpretable artifacts and features or
a tie to important individuals, the site is not considered eligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. Though the site is located within the proposed JB-2 facility site and may be impacted
by construction, no further work is recommended.

Archeologists excavated three shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV719
(OT1-OT3). All of the shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials.
Navarro County deed records suggest that 41NV719 is most likely associated with either W.L.
Cherry or J.C. and Nancy Chapman, who owned the parcel during the earliest years of the 20th
century (the period of site use as indicated by the artifact assemblage). In October of 1904, the
parcel on which the site is located (part of the Joshua Richardson Survey) was purchased by
W.L. Cherry from M.C. Scruggs (Volume 133, pg. 141), who eventually sold the land to J.C.
and Nancy Chapman 15 years later (Deed of Trust Volume 60, pg. 670). A Walter L. Cherry
is listed in the 1910 US Census as a 24-year-old farmer living with his wife, Lillie, daughter,
Mamie, and an African-American hired hand named Lessley Kilgore (age 16). Several other
members of the Cherry family are listed on the same census sheet, living in nearby parcels.
By the 1920 Census, Walter and his family are no longer living in Navarro County. Curiously,
there are no J. C. or Nancy Chapmans listed in any of the US Censuses in Navarro County
between 1920 and 1940. This would suggest that they were absentee landowners who may
have leased the property.
Site 41NV719 is a domestic debris scatter from a no-longer extant farmstead. The likely home
site located nearby pre-dates 1940, as it is depicted on 1940 aerial photographs and a county
road map. The presence of amethyst glass further refines the site occupation date to the latter
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It contains an abundant amount of artifacts which
are no longer in their original context, having been scattered across the surface of a plowed
field. Therefore, the cultural materials lack interpretability. Deed records suggest that at this

time, the site was occupied by members of the Cherry or Chapman families; none of which are
considered to be historically significant. Given this, the site is considered ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. The site is located within the proposed IPL permanent easement
and will likely be impacted by construction. However, no further work is recommended at this
time.

Archeologists excavated three shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV720 (OT1–
OT3). The shovel tests were all devoid of cultural materials. A structure may have been present
in this area, though none is depicted on the 1940 County Highway map nor is it visible in a
1940 aerial photograph of the vicinity (Figure 8.93). Nonetheless, a number of structures were
located along roads nearby and these materials likely were deposited as trash and then spread
through repeated plowing.
Site 41NV720 is a historic-period debris scatter consisting of stoneware sherds, undecorated
whiteware sherds, and glass bottle shards. The site lacks integrity and due to disturbances and
the generally dispersed nature of the assemblage the site has little research potential. The site
lacks intact features and is not associated with any structures at or near the site boundary. It
is not likely associated with an individual or event of historical significance. Site 41NV720
is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. The site is located within the
proposed IPL permanent easement and will likely be impacted by construction. However, no
further work is recommended for this site.
Archeological Sites Outside of the Impact Footprint
As discussed in previous chapters, archeologists documented a large number of sites during the
course of the IPL-related survey that lie outside of the proposed final permanent easement. These
sites are located either within the 450-foot evaluation corridor, or they are found on pipeline
segments or facility site alternatives that have been abandoned. Since these sites will not likely
be impacted by IPL-related construction, they are presented below for inventory purposes.

Regulatory recommendations are
largely missing and (with historic
sites) extensive archival research is
not provided.
41NV599
Site 41NV599 is a buried prehistoric
site located outside of the IPL
evaluation corridor within the cut
bank of the Trinity River (Figures
8.94 and 8.95). The site was
originally recorded in 1977 by
Southern Methodist University
(SMU) when archeologists noted
a large amount of FCR eroding out
of the Trinity River cut bank 12 to
15 feet below the ground surface
(Figure 8.96). Original documents
describe the site as a deflated shell
lens and occupation horizon. At that
time, approximately 90 percent of
the shell lens was washing out of
the cut bank. Despite the erosional
toll, one very large four to five meter
long feature containing burned clay,
FCR, and charcoal was observed
deeply buried within the cut bank.
No shell was associated directly
with the burned clay zone, which
investigators thought could represent
a “roasting pit.” Occupying an
area of 133 x 15 meters (north/
south x east/west), the site area is
currently utilized as a pasture and
composed of sediments transported
by alluvial action. Local vegetation
consists of mixed grasses and sparse
trees, mostly oak. Overall, surface
visibility was estimated to be 75-100
percent. According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within the
site vicinity are Trinity clay and
experience frequent inundation.

revealed a typical soil column of clay
loam (10YR 4/4) extending to a depth of
100 cmbs where shovel tests terminated.
Modern disturbances include general
agricultural use and fluvial erosion.
The AmaTerra revisit in 2010 occurred
during two separate occasions. During
the revisit within the then-proposed
pipeline corridor, only one flake core
was observed on the surface. However,
cultural material was observed just
south of the then-proposed easement.
In this area, approximately 20 pieces of
shell, FCR, a biface (Figure 8.97), lithic
debitage, and a possible net weight were
present at the time of survey. All artifacts
were observed eroding out of the cut
bank at a depth of 1.8 meters below the
ground surface or on the surface (Figure
8.98).
Archeologists excavated three shovel
tests during their investigations of Site

All of the shovel tests were devoid of
cultural materials. Additionally, two
backhoe trenches were excavated in the site vicinity (Trenches 949-1 and 949-2; see above)
that were also devoid of archeological materials.
Site 41NV599’s original boundary was expanded to included the area to the north of the original
site boundary. During the current investigations, water levels were much higher, than they were
when SMU surveyed the site. As a result, fewer artifacts were observed than during the SMU
survey. AmaTerra archeologists believe Site 41NV599 extends to the north toward the bend

beyond, leading surveyors to
approximate the site size at 60
meters in length. This indicates a
much larger site than is currently
known.
Due to the depth of artifacts,
the likelihood of intact deposits,
potential for features, and

has components that would

further reducing the potential that the site will be impacted. Further work is, however, highly
recommended prior to any future projects involving ground disturbance.

was estimated at approximately five percent.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the site vicinity are Crockett fine
sandy loam and residuum weathered from
shale of Tertiary age. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical soil column
of 30 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/2)
overlying a dense clay loam (10YR 6/8) that
was interpreted as sterile subsoil. Shovel
tests typically terminated between 40 and
60 cmbs. Modern disturbances, attributed to
the previous or current landowner, include
demolition of standing structures.
Features within 41NV707 are solely
surficial and include two collapsed wooden
structures, both likely utilitarian pole barns/
sheds (Features 1 and 2), a brick and concrete
well covered by a derelict flatbed (Feature
3), evenly-spaced brick piles (Feature 4),
and a concrete sanitary privy (Feature 5).
Feature 1 is a collapsed structure, measuring
approximately 36 x 42 feet. The collapsed
structure is composed of wood, contains a
limited number of in situ support beams,
and has a rubble pile consisting of tires and
mechanical parts (Figure 8.101). A concrete
pad, interpreted as a garage floor, was also
observed beneath the rubble pile. Feature 2
is a collapsed ancillary structure interpreted
as a shed (Figure 8.102). The collapsed
building is composed of wood with some
rusty remains of farming equipment and
a ceramic toilet in the rubble, as well as
a two burner-kerosene stove shells and
two balance arms. The feature measures
approximately 15 x 15 feet. Feature 3 is
a brick and concrete well whose opening
stands about 1.5 feet high and is four feet
in diameter (Figure 8.103). The bricks are
machine made of uniformly-colored orange
paste and have no visible markings on them.
Covering the well is a large flatbed cart that
seems to have been moved there many years
ago to cover the well. Feature 4 was recorded
309

Chapter 8

Results — Navarro County

as a series of small brick piles approximately
20 x 15 feet (Figure 8.104). Based on their
linear pattern, it is thought that they might
have served as beam supports for a structure
that has since been removed. Located near
the site’s northern terminus, archeologists
recorded a concrete and brick sanitary privy
base as Feature 5 (Figure 8.105). This
feature is composed of a 4 x 4-foot concrete
pad with superstructure-supporting bolts cast
into it. Beneath the pad are three courses of
orange paste bricks. Rising approximately
13 inches above the pad is an 18 x 30-inch
oval-shaped opening, with supporting bolts.
As part of the New Deal era, various federal
government agencies began a nationwide effort to improve sanitary conditions
in rural areas and sent workers to install
prefabricated privies similar to these across
the countryside (Stotts et al. 2012; Figure
8.106). However, their origins trace back
to the US Public Health service’s early
twentieth century public health campaigns
against hookworm in the rural south. Feature
5 is almost certainly one of these sanitary
privies from the early twentieth century or
the WPA era.
A large belt-driven piece of agricultural
equipment, recorded as Feature 6, was found
approximately eight meters east of Feature
1. The iron element appears to be an engine
stamped with “SUPERIOR Chicago House
Wrecking Company” (Figure 8.107). A
second plate is stamped “HP 4,” indicating
that it is likely a four-horsepower engine.
Along with the main engine body are two
fly-wheels, various handles, gauges, and
knobs (primarily bronze). According to
several sources (Sears Modern Homes 2011;
Smokstak.com 2007a), the Chicago HouseWrecking company formed in 1893 and got
their start salvaging and reselling industrial
equipment from abandoned factories, homes,
and other structures. Though the company

name is found on a large number of similar engines across the country, none were actually
manufactured by them; the company simply applied their nameplate and serial numbers over
others’ prior to resale. Eventually their business model changed in a seemingly incongruous
fashion; later manufacturing and selling mail-order kit homes and permanently changing their
name to Harris Brothers in 1913.
Archeologists excavated 11 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV707 (OT1-6,
A128, A129, B129, C121, F118). All shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials.
Site 41NV707 is clearly visible in a 1958 aerial photograph of the area as a large domestic
and agricultural complex including an “L” shaped residence to the west (corresponding with
the well and brick piles), barns near the site’s center (corresponding to Features 1 and 2),
and several other small outbuildings (Figure 8.108). The site’s extension to the east, which
was defined by a surface scatter of lumber and other materials, does not correspond to any
structures on the 1958 aerial and may, in fact, be a later addition to the site components.
Based on the cultural materials observed at the site such as wire nails, a ceramic toilet, car
reflectors, and the Chicago House Wreckers nameplate, it is likely that the site dates from the
early to mid-twentieth century. Since the site is not located within the IPL evaluation corridor,
intensive archival research was not conducted. Though such work was not conducted, the site
is largely destroyed and is not considered particularly unique in this region. Though the site’s
cistern and privy may contain some artifacts and other data about the occupants, it is unlikely
these would contribute significantly to our understanding of early to mid-twentieth century
farming families in this area. Accordingly, the site is recommended as ineligible for listing on
the NRHP or as a SAL. The site is, as stated above, not proposed for impacts under the current
IPL alignment and no further project-related work is recommended at this time.

41NV708
Site 41NV708 is a small historic-period farmstead remnant consisting of a surficial trash
scatter, a brick well, ornamental flowers, a historic road, and a complement of shallowly-buried
domestic debris located partially within the 450-foot IPL evaluation corridor (Figures 8.109
and 8.110). Occupying an area of approximately 30 x 50 meters (north/south x east/west), the
site is situated along the downward-sloping edge of an upland terrace that descends to a small,
unnamed creek to the north. Local vegetation consists of short to mixed grasses with mesquite
and cedar scrub dotting the periphery. Overall, site visibility was estimated at approximately 20
percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Holoceneage Gowen-Mabank-Lamar complex loamy clays. Observations from site shovel tests revealed
a typical soil column of 28 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 4/4) overlying dense, gravelly
clay (10YR 5/6-6/3) that were interpreted as sterile subsoil. Shovel tests terminated between
35 and 40 cmbs. Modern disturbances were minimal with slight push piles located in some
areas, though the site itself has suffered from extensive erosion downhill from the terrace edge.
Surficial manifestations of Site 41NV708 include two small (6 x 15 feet and 60 x 30 feet)
scatters of diffuse historic-period domestic and construction debris including orange-paste
“Whiteselle Corsicana” brick and mortar fragments, pulled-wire nails, fence staples, scrap
metal, undecorated whiteware sherds, and clear bottle glass shards. Among the debris,
surveyors observed a clear glass Owens-Illinois Glass Company bottle base, but could not
determine any additional markings that could identify a manufacturing date or factory (Figure
8.111). Additionally, investigators noted an unusual, radial machine part that may have been
a farming implement (Figure 8.112). In addition to cultural materials, a historic road was

observed running approximately southwest to northeast, bisecting the site along its southern
boundary.
The densest accumulation of these surficial artifacts is located in the site’s northwestern
corner, approximately 30 feet beyond the evaluation corridor. A small, linear arrangement of
ornamental flowers in the vicinity of this scatter suggests a domestic structure may have been
located here at one time, though no such elements remain (Figure 8.113). Also outside of the
study corridor, on the hillside approximately 30 meters to the south, archeologists recorded a
brick and cement well whose opening rises approximately one foot above the prevailing grade
(Figure 8.114). The well may have at one time been covered with a metal ‘lid’ that is located
nearby.
Archeologists excavated 11 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV708 (A18,
B18, and OT1-9; Table 8.17). Of these, only one shovel test (OT1) contained cultural materials:

According to the property’s current owner, the site area corresponds with a historic-age
sharecropper’s farmstead (personal communication) dating to roughly 1910-1940. A 1940
aerial photograph of the site area also depicts a house site at this location, standing west of the
survey corridor with the road observed during site recording corresponding to a gravel driveway
(Figure 8.116). The assigned age range is supported by temporally diagnostic artifacts. For

example, Owens-Illinois Glass and Whiteselle Brick were both widely available at this time
and Hawk Brand was a work clothing manufacturer that began production in the early 1910s
and continued at least into the late 1940s (Cienna 2012). According to Cienna (2012), the
button goes to work overalls. Local newspapers from the 1930s ran advertisements for Hawk
brand products. The Malakoff News from December of 1938 encourages Christmas-shopping
locals to go to the Craver & Galyean hardware store to “Give Dad or brother a suit of fade
proof [Hawk Brand] khakis…” selling men’s overalls for $1.05 (Malakoff News 12/16/38:2).
Site 41NV708 is an early twentieth century farmstead. The site contains few interpretable
artifacts and those that remain lack integrity or significant research potential. The site does
include two features, of which the well could yield new data about occupants in the area, but
those components are well outside of the potential impact area. Additional investigations may
be warranted if future projects pass through the site vicinity. Being located on an abandoned
survey corridor, the site will no longer be impacted by proposed IPL construction. Accordingly,
no further work is recommended for this site.
41NV709
Site 41NV709 is a small,
historic-period
site
consisting of a shallowlyburied trash scatter that is
approximately 754 x 246
feet (north/south x east/west)
in size located outside of
the IPL evaluation corridor
(Figure 8.117 and 8.118).
The site is situated within a
gently sloping agricultural
field that has artificial
terracing north of the site’s
boundary. Local vegetation
consists of recently mowed
short grasses. Overall, site
visibility was estimated at
approximately zero to five
percent. Archeologists noted
that the site vicinity was
devoid of trees. According to
the USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the site vicinity
are Tertiary-age Crockett
fine sandy loam. However,
site shovel testing revealed
a different soil composition

Shovel tests typically terminated between

Artifacts excavated from shovel tests
consisted of one brown and five clear
glass bottle shards, one undecorated whiteware sherd, three small orange brick fragments, an
unidentified metal fragment, and a single pulled wire nail (Figure 8.119). Extensive plowing
has repeatedly broken the observed artifacts into small, uniform sizes. While most of the artifact
assemblage is non-diagnostic, the pulled wire nail indicates that the site likely post-dates the
early 1900s. All recorded artifacts were present within the active plow zone.

Due to the relatively few artifacts recorded and the absence of surface material, little can be
deduced regarding the site’s original function. Today, the observed cultural material illustrates
a highly transported and mixed deposit of construction material and household debris that has
been increasingly spread across a nearly featureless field. The debris was likely associated
either with some sort of standing structure or refuse dump. However, no evidence of a structure
was identified within the survey corridor. Since the site is no longer within the impact corridor,
no efforts were made to conduct archival research to identify its original ownership or contact
landowners to glean additional site data. However, its overall lack of integrity make such
efforts unwarranted in this instance.
Site 41NV709 is a nearly destroyed, low-density historic-period trash scatter that (given its
context) is likely associated with an early to mid-twentieth century farmstead located outside
the IPL evaluation corridor. The site appears to contain little to no integrity, is relatively
common in the region, and provides no potential for new data. Based on these facts, 41NV709
is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Additionally, the site is located
on lands that are no longer scheduled for IPL-related construction. Thus, no additional work
is recommended for this site.
41NV710
Site 41NV710 is an enclosed
historic-age livestock pen
with an associated fence,
two standing stables, and one
collapsed stable (Figures
8.120 and 8.121). The site
also contains an ephemeral
subsurface
scatter
of
construction and trash debris.
The site is located outside of
the IPL evaluation corridor
in Segment 16. Occupying
an area of approximately 60
x 45 meters (north/south x
east/west), the site is situated
on a level plane east of the
reservoir and just south of
an existing pipeline corridor.
Local vegetation consists
of short grasses, oak, and
mesquite trees. Overall, site
visibility ranged from zero to
five percent due to leaf litter.
According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within

the site vicinity are Axtell fine sandy loam with one to three percent slopes. Observations from
site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 30 to 40 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR
4/3) overlying 20 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3). Shovel tests typically terminated at
60 cmbs with the presence of a heavy clay (10YR 5/8) interpreted as a sterile subsoil. Modern
disturbances were minimal and consistent with periodic agricultural activities.
Archeologists recorded four surface features within Site 41NV710. Feature 1 is a semi-circular
fence that connects Features 2, 3, and 4 together (Figure 8.122). The fence is constructed
using panels of corrugated metal that are opportunistically mounted to cedar posts, milled
lumber, and rooted trees as supports. Feature’s 2, 3, and 4, are a series of individual holding
pens, located directly adjacent to each other in a southeast (Feature 2)/northwest (Feature 4)
orientation. Feature 2 is in moderate condition with only a few pieces of corrugated tin having
fallen to the ground. Feature 2 is directly south of another stable (Feature 3). The roof of Feature
3 is suspended by two support beams in the front, while the back is resting on the ground in
a lean-to fashion (Figure 123). Feature 4 is the northernmost stable within the livestock pen
complex and is in poor condition. Although a portion of the feature is partially standing, the
vast majority has collapsed. All three of the stables had a combined measurement of 30 x 45
feet.
Archeologists excavated six shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41NV710 (OT1-6;
Table 8.19). Of these, two shovel tests (OT3 and OT6) contained historic artifacts in the upper
40 centimeters. Shovel Test OT3 contained three asphalt shingle fragments and one piece of
metal wire (0–40 cmbs). Shovel Test OT6 contained 14 unidentified scrap metal fragments
(0–20 cmbs). Remaining shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials.
Based on site features, 41NV710 is interpreted as a horse and/or cattle pen likely dating
to the mid-twentieth century. The site has not been used as an active pen for some time as
evidenced by the secondary growth of plants inside the fenced area, and the site’s general state
of disrepair. With an undecipherable artifact assemblage and a complement of three common

stable features, Site 41NV710 has limited
research potential and is not considered
eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
Additional archival investigations would be
required to link the resource to individuals
of historical significance. Since the site is
not located within the IPL impact corridor,
such investigations were not conducted. It
is unlikely, though, that such efforts would
contribute positively to the resource’s
eligibility. Since the site will not likely be
impacted by IPL-related construction, no
further work is recommended at this time.

41NV714
Site 41NV714 is a historic-age farmstead consisting of a large pole barn, cistern, and surface/
sub-surface artifact scatter located in the JB-2 West pump station alternative that was ultimately
abandoned (Figures 8.124 and 8.125). Occupying an area of approximately 140 x 70 meters
(north/south x east/west), the site is situated on a hilltop that rapidly descends toward a relic
streambed to the north and more gradually in all other directions. Overall, surface visibility
was estimated at 25 percent to 99 percent depending on the location, with some areas obscured
by opportunistic grasses and forbs in an otherwise fallow field. Local vegetation consists of
stands of mesquite trees lining the periphery with live oaks sporadically intermixed. According
to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils in the site vicinity are Crockett fine sandy loam with
1–3 percent slopes. Shovel testing within the site area suggests that an alternate sediment
type is found here as archeologists encountered a shallow, upland setting consisting of 40
centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3) with small gravels increasing in frequency with depth.
Shovel tests typically terminated at a depth of 60 cmbs. Modern disturbances include disrepair
and vegetation clearing.
Two features were identified at 41NV714, including a barn (Feature 1) and a semi-masonry
cistern or well (Feature 2). There is also a Whiteselle Corsicana brick scatter near Feature 2
that was not given a feature number. Feature 1 is a dog run style wood framed, side gabled

barn with a loft on both sides of a central
breezeway (Figure 8.126). The barn is an 18
x 36-foot structure made of milled standardsized lumber (2 x 10s and 1 x 10s) with a
corrugated metal roof and siding. Full cut
lumber of this type was generally not used
after 1940, suggesting a structure that was
built before that time. The structure is large,
standing approximately 30 feet tall. There
are several hackberry trees surrounding
the barn to the east that form two straight
lines that meet at a right angle, presumably
indicating a former fenceline. Within that
presumed fenced area are several piles of
milled lumber that have likely fallen off of
the structure and been piled here for eventual
disposal or were part of other structures.

Figure 8.126. Pole barn at the northern end
of Site 41NV714 recorded as Feature 1.

While the barn is located in the northern
portion of 41NV714, Feature 2, a large
cistern/well, is situated at the site’s southern
boundary separated by a large, open expanse
of pasture (Figure 8.127). The cistern/well
is approximately seven feet wide at the
ground surface, expanding to roughly 12
feet in width below that and extending to
an approximate maximum depth of 12 to

trash bags). The opening is slightly oblong
and has been mechanically scraped flush
with the ground’s surface. Two brick piles nearby (described above) likely represent the well’s
above-ground structure. The cistern/well is made with Whiteselle orange paste machine-made
variety bricks in the upper three feet closest to the surface and are plastered with a thin, mostly
decayed mortar lining. Below the bricks, however, the cistern/well appears to be made with
large flat limestone or sandstone slabs. This suggests that portions of it may have been rebuilt
after the initial construction. The cistern/well is filled with modern trash and ash, indicating
that it currently is being used for trash burning.
A small (10 x 4 foot) collapsed structure was noted in the site’s northwest corner (Feature 3).
This resource is thought to be an outhouse or shed that has collapsed intact (Figure 8.128).
Besides the features, the only other surficial manifestation is a patchy, ephemeral scatter of
refuse and construction material that is spread around the cistern in a hummocky, push-piled
fashion, presumably indicating a structure has been razed nearby. A small complement of
charred wood and ash indicates that such a structure was likely burned.

burned, reinforcing the interpretation that
the house nearby burned. All other shovel
tests were devoid of cultural material. Archeologists noted a functional distinction between
the surface artifacts near the barn and those near the cistern. Artifacts near the cistern were
domestic while those near the barn were tools and other work-related materials.

The scale of the cistern was significantly
larger than most cisterns observed in
the region. A cistern such as that would
have supplied a large structure with
water and it is presumed that such a
structure would imply prominence.
Archeologists reviewed a 1940 aerial
photograph of the site vicinity and found
ample evidence of a prominent structure
at the site (larger than any of the other
buildings nearby; Figure 8.131). In
the southern site area, a single multigabled, two-story home stands adjacent
to the recorded cistern while two small
outbuildings are visible to the east. The
barn to the north (Feature 1) is also
visible with a second, no-longer-extant
structure standing inside the animal pen.
A 1960 aerial of the same area shows
that the large house is no longer present
with a plowed, rectangular yard being all
that is left (Figure 8.132).

Figure 8.131. 1940 aerial photograph
of the Site 41NV717 vicinity.

The artifact assemblage, though
limited, did not include any artifacts
that would indicate a higher social standing for the site’s occupants, but extensive archival
investigations were not conducted. The archeology team contacted the current landowner to
request any additional information he may have regarding the site. According to him (personal
communication), the site was occupied by the Pierce family with a Troy Pierce once living in
a house at that location. Mr. Pierce has since passed away and the house itself was not present
in 2001 when the Smiths purchased the property. A review of obituaries shows a William
Troy “Slim” Pierce of Ennis (born in 1923) passed away in 2010, having served as a former
Ennis police officer and animal control officer (waxahachietx.com 2012). Additional archival
research in the form of deed and county historical research are warranted to fully assess whether
the site represents an individual, family, or event of local historical significance.

Site 41NV714 is the the remnant of
a historic-age farmstead. The scale
of the remaining features (barn and
cistern) and corresponding aerial
photograph data suggests that the
site may have been associated with
individuals of some prominence at one
time, though the associated artifact
scatter does not include any items
that would be considered extravagant.
A discernable functional distribution
of the identified artifacts at the site
indicates some lifeway patterning
may be identified through additional
field investigations. Limited archival
and oral history research has tied the
site to a local policeman and animal
control officer who passed away in
2010, though additional research
would be necessary to identify other
family members such as his forebears,
who probably built the site. Since the
site is not proposed for impacts from
IPL-related construction, extensive

archival research was not warranted
for this project. The site, however,
may have components that would
make it eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP, pending further research. If future projects
call for the site to be impacted, such investigations are encouraged.
41NV715
Site 41NV715 is the remnant of a historic-period farmstead. The site consists of a decorative
lily patch, a dry stock pond, and a surface scatter of historic-age artifacts located within the
evaluated, but now abandoned JB-2 West pump station alternative site (Figure 8.133 and
8.134). Occupying an area of approximately 260 x 100 meters (north/south x east/west), the site
is situated on an upland terrace overlooking a slight, westward downslope. Local vegetation
consists of prairie grasses and forbs while stands of mesquite trees intermixed with occasional
live oaks line the periphery. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at 0–10 percent. According
to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Wilson clay loam with 1-3
percent slopes and a clayey alluvium of Quaternary (Pleistocene) age derived from mixed
sources. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of
silty loam (10YR 4/3) containing small gravels overlying clay (10YR 4/4).

Archeologists did not observe any above-ground structural elements nor were any foundations
identified within the site boundary. Features within the site include a 10 x 10-foot decorative
iris patch (Feature 1; presumably associated with a structure of some sort that is no longer
extant; Figure 8.135) and a 100 x 100-foot stock tank (Feature 2) located approximately 300
feet to its north. An old fence line delineated the site’s eastern edge. Near the site’s northern
terminus, archeologists noted an isolated set of two concrete steps that presumably led to a
structure entrance (Figure 8.136). Again, no structural remains were noted.
Surficial manifestations of Site 41NV715 consist of a decrepit horse drawn thresher (Figure
8.137), a modern ceramic toilet, orange paste “Whiteselle Cherry Reds Corsicana” bricks
(Figure 8.138), hog fencing, undecorated whiteware sherds, and colored (i.e. clear, brown,

cultural materials in the upper 20 centimeters of sediments with one undecorated whiteware
sherd recovered from 40–60 cmbs. Shovel Test OT4 contained a single undecorated whiteware

Archeologists reviewed a 1940 aerial photograph of the site vicinity and identified a house
near the road at 41NV715’s southern boundary (Figure 8.140). This structure corresponds
to the areas of highest surficial and subsurface artifact density, as well as the identified iris
patch while the stock pond is also visible as a rectangular depression in an otherwise open
field. Southwest of the main structure regularly-spaced dots on the photograph are likely trees
indicating that the site may have been an orchard at this time. Curiously, no structures are
visible that correspond to the stone steps observed at the site’s northern boundary.

Site 41NV715 appears to be the remnants of a former rural farmstead and historic-period trash
scatter. The site lacks any structural features, though the presence of decorative lilies, a stock
tank, farming equipment, and a set of stairs presumably leading to a structure suggests that
the site represents a domestic space. Included in the recorded artifacts, a small complement
of cut nails mixed with pulled wire varieties suggests an early twentieth century site origin.
Since the site is located in an abandoned IPL facility site, it will not be impacted by proposed
construction. Nonetheless, the site lacks intact deposits and is otherwise of limited research
value. Accordingly, 41NV715 is recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. No further work is recommended at this time.
41NV721
Site 41NV721 is a large,
historic-age
pole
barn
structure with an associated
complement of fencing
and livestock equipment
(watering troughs, feed
troughs, etc.) and surficial
artifacts located outside of
the proposed IPL permanent
easement (Figures 8.141).
Occupying an area of
approximately 15 x 25 meters
(north/south x east/west), the
site is situated within an 80 x
45-foot area once used as a
pasture, but now overgrown
with a dense population of
mesquite and hackberry trees.
Local vegetation consists
of briars, ashe juniper, and
live oak. Overall, surface
visibility was estimated
at approximately 20 to 40
percent with the highest
visibility near the pole barn
structure. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey,

soils within the site vicinity
are Ferris and Heiden clays
with a 5–15 percent slope. Being located on an upland hilltop and clearly limited to historicage components, the site was not shovel tested. However, shovel tests excavated nearby (A137
and B138) suggest shallow, light (10YR 5/6), gravelly clays and clay loams extending to a
maximum depth of 35 cmbs.

The site’s only feature (Feature 1) is a substantial livestock pole barn measuring approximately
40 x 18 feet and standing approximately 15 to 18 feet tall (Figure 8.142 and 8.143). The
structure is supported by stripped log posts supplemented with standard dimension milled
lumber with standard corrugated metal siding around the exterior. The standard-dimensional
lumber suggests a pre-1940 construction date. Archeologists noted that only pulled-wire nails
were used in construction of this feature. The structure is in very good condition and contains
several interior bays and an upper loft along with an interior feeding trough. A small wooden
animal pen surrounding the site’s eastern boundary is surrounded by debris including tires,
lumber, and animal troughs.

Figure 8.142. Photograph of Feature 1, a
livestock pole barn exterior, facing west.

Figure 8.143. Photograph of the pole
barn interior, facing northeast.

In a narrow band surrounding the main feature, archeologists observed a relatively diffuse (one
to two artifacts per 10 square meters) scatter of early to mid-twentieth century artifacts including
relief-decorated milk-glass shards, clear, brown, and green bottle glass shards, stoneware
sherds, a possible pink paste brick fragment, and an assortment of unidentified scrap metal
fragments (Figure 8.144). Along with the various broken vessel pieces, archeologists observed
three whole glass bottles including a green glass bottle, a mason jar with its lid containing an
unidentified black liquid inside (Figure 8.145), and a devitrified clear glass sauce jar (Figure
8.146). Maker’s marks were visible on the mason jar (an unidentified series of numbers: 14 and
67P2) and on the sauce jar (“J” in a Keystone and 1904 ¼). According to Lockhart et al. (2008)
the latter’s maker’s mark is attributed to the Knox Bottle Glass Company of Mississippi, which
was in operation from 1932–1952 (indicating that the 1904 is not a manufacture date).
Site 41NV721 represents a livestock barn and agricultural storage structure that, though
substantial and in good condition, is typical of structures in the region. The associated
artifact assemblage indicates an early to mid-twentieth century (circa 1930s–1950s) period of
occupation and all materials observed are also considered standard for sites of this age in the
region. The site is recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. It is unlikely
that additional field investigations or extensive archival research would yield additional data

A426IF4 is a single tertiary lithic flake
recorded at a depth of 80 cmbs within Shovel
Test B65 in the proposed IPL permanent
easement. The flake was observed on a small
Waxahachie Creek tributary oxbow terrace
(Figure 8.147). Additional shovel tests (C70
and A63) were devoid of cultural materials
and the flake was considered an isolate.
Shovel test observations revealed a typical
soil column consisting of 30 centimeters
of clay loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 50
centimeters of silty clay loam (7.5YR 4/4)
overlying 20 centimeters of clay loam
(7.5YR 4/4). This resource is located within
the IPL permanent easement; however,
lacking any associated features, diagnostics,
or other archeological materials, the find is
not considered SAL- or NRHP-eligible and
no further work is recommended.

A428IF5, similar to A426IF4, is a single tertiary prehistoric lithic flake observed on the
Waxahachie Creek floodplain, outside of the IPL permanent easement (Figure 8.148). This
flake was recorded between 20 and 40 cmbs in Shovel Test F81, which was excavated along the
edge of the tributary within the riparian zone. A modern glass shard recorded from the shovel
test beneath the flake indicates some level of disturbance within the soil column. Adjacent
shovel tests (OT1–OT5) were devoid of cultural materials and the find was considered an
isolate. Shovel test observations revealed a typical soil column consisting of 20 centimeters of
loam (10YR 4/1) overlying 20 centimeters of silty loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 20 centimeters
of silty loam (10YR 6/6) overlying 20 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 7/6). Shovel tests
revealed a variety of silty loams to a depth of more than 80 cmbs. The flake is located outside
of the evaluation corridor and is not considered eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
Accordingly, no further work is recommended.
D431IF1 is a chert nodule with a possible single flake scar recorded in Backhoe Trench 431-1
(see Figure 8.35) located within the IPL permanent easement. The backhoe trench was excavated
along the eastern banks of Chambers
Creek. According to archeologists, the
chert nodule was recorded between 180
and 200 cmbs. It is not evident whether
the nodule is a naturally-deposited stone
or manuport. No other artifacts or features
were recorded within the backhoe trench
(431-1) or neighboring shovel tests (A127,
B133, D255, E261, and F244). Shovel
test observations revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 40 centimeters of
clay loam (10YR 3/3) overlying sterile

isolate and is not recommended eligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
The isolated find will be impacted by the
proposed IPL construction, but no further
work is recommended.
A432IF1 is a historic-age well recorded
adjacent to the channel of a small
Waxahachie Creek tributary west of Oak
Grove Road inside of the IPL evaluation
corridor. The well is composed of brick and
covered in concrete. Several bricks were
labeled “TRINIDAD” and “PALMER”
and were composed of orange and pink
paste (Figure 8.149). The variety of brick
pastes and manufacturers suggests that
the well was opportunistically built with

materials that could be pieced together. According to bricknames.com (2012), Palmer Pressed
Brick works formed in 1902 in nearby Palmer, Texas (in Ellis County) and grew to purchase
Standard Brick Works in 1929, changing their name at that time to Barron Brick Company.
While 1902 is the earliest date the feature could have been built, if the well was built using
randomly-collected brick, it could be younger. Archeologists found no associated features or
artifacts either on the ground surface or in surrounding shovel tests (F230, F231, E247, and
D252). Shovel test observations revealed a typical soil column of 40 cmbs clay loam (10YR
4/2) overlying 40+ cmbs clay (10YR 3/3). Accordingly, the resource was considered an isolate.
Being found on the same parcel as Site 41NV706 the two resources are probably related and
contemporary with one another. Both are likely associated with historic-age tenant farms.
Conversely, a 1940 aerial photograph of the vicinity shows no structure nearby while Site
41NV706 is visible. Based on construction materials and technique and lack of surrounding
artifacts or features, A432IF1 is not considered to be archeologically significant and does not
warrant designation as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. Being located outside of the proposed
IPL permanent easement, the well will not likely be impacted by construction. Thus, no further
work is recommended.
D438IF1 consists of a tentatively-identified flake and a possible burned rock recorded in
Backhoe Trench 438-1 (see Figure 8.38), which is located within the IPL permanent easement.
The backhoe trench was excavated along the western bank of Cummins Creek. According to
archeologists the two tentative artifacts were recorded near the interface between Holocene
deposits and Pleistocene alluvium at a depth of about 1.4 meters below surface. No additional
artifacts were recorded within the backhoe
trench or neighboring shovel tests (A97,
B102, D130, and E147). Shovel test
observations revealed a typical soil column
consisting of 80 centimeters of black clay
(10YR 2/1). The finds are considered isolates
and are recommended ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. The isolates fall
within the IPL permanent easement and will
likely be destroyed, but no further work is
recommended.
C489IF1 is a single, isolated historic
windmill with a square concrete base,
recorded within a densely-wooded portion of
Segment 15-1 in the IPL evaluation corridor
but outside of the proposed permanent
easement (Figure 8.150). The windmill
is in poor condition with only two of its
blades still intact. Archeologists recorded a
square (approximately 8 x 8 foot) concrete
base holding the four legs in place. The
windmill’s pump was still present, imprinted

with “David Bradley Model 241
6136” (Figure 8.151). According to
Smokstak.com (2007b), the model
number is attributed to a windmill
pump jack dating to 1946, though
that estimate was not substantiated by
any catalogs, advertisements, or other
source materials. Two shovel tests
(D141 and E156) excavated nearby
were both devoid of cultural material.
Shovel test observations revealed a
typical soil column consisting of 40
centimeters of silty clay (10YR 5/3)
overlying sterile clay (10YR 5/3).
Being a windmill that provided water,
it is assumed that another structure
may have been present nearby at
one time, but no such features were
observed within the survey corridor.
The find was considered insignificant
and did not warrant designation as
a site. Given the common nature of
windmills such as these and its lack
of associated features or artifacts, the
windmill is not considered eligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
Finally, the resource is located
outside of the proposed IPL 150foot permanent easement and will
not be impacted by project-related
construction. Thus, no further work
is recommended for the isolated find.

C509IF1 consists of two historic artifacts (one amethyst glass shard and one undecorated
whiteware sherd) within the upper 20 centimeters of a single shovel test (OT4) excavated
during the evaluation of the proposed JB-2 East facility site survey (Figure 8.152). The two
artifacts are small and appear to have suffered repeated fractures from modern plowing. An
additional four shovel tests (OT5-OT8) were excavated within the vicinity of the isolated find.
All additional shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials. No features were noted nearby
either. Shovel test observations revealed a typical soil column consisting of 40 centimeters of
sandy loam (10YR 4/4) overlying 40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3) overlying sterile
clay (10YR 5/3). Found within a disturbed, plowed field with no associated artifacts or features
and in very poor condition, the two artifacts were considered isolates and are recommended
as ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is recommended for the
isolated find.

A525IF1 is a small surface scatter
of approximately eight historic-age
amethyst glass vessel shards, four
undecorated whiteware sherds, and
a single transfer-printed whiteware
sherd (Figure 8.153) recorded from a
small tributary channel outside of the
IPL evaluation corridor. All artifacts
were observed on the ground surface
and shovel tests (B219, OT1–OT6)
within the vicinity of the isolated find
were devoid of cultural materials.
Shovel test observations revealed a

centimeters of silty clay with gravel
(10YR 4/2) overlying sterile clay
with gravel (10YR 5/4) . The whiteware sherd is monochromatic (blue) transfer-printed with a
flower motif. The glass shards appear to come from multiple vessels with one partial maker’s
mark identified reading “CO.” on one line and “ED” on the other. According to Lockhart
(2006), amethyst bleaching was replaced by selenium bleaching beginning in the early 1910s
and completely phased out of production by the mid-1930s. No features were noted around
the positive shovel test and it seems likely that these materials are the result of small-scale
household refuse disposal or flood debris carried along the tributary drainage. The find does
not fall within the IPL permanent easement and will not be impacted by construction. Thus, no
further work is recommended.
C562IF1 is an undecorated whiteware sherd recorded outside of the IPL evaluation corridor.
The isolate was excavated from the upper five centimeters of sediments of Shovel Test C17.
The whiteware sherd is located in a plowed field approximately 50 meters southeast of Site
41NV708. The sherd, found downhill from the site, may simply have migrated slowly to its
find location through flooding and plowing activities and is interpreted as out of context. All
adjacent shovel tests (OT4–OT6 and E134) were devoid of cultural materials. Shovel test
observations revealed a typical soil column consisting of 25 centimeters of silty clay (10YR
3/2) overlying sterile clay (10YR 5/4). Likely associated with Site 41NV708, but well away
from it, the find is considered an isolate and is recommended ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. The isolate will not be impacted by the proposed IPL construction, and no
further work is recommended.
C863IF1 is an odd, surficial jumble of rusted barbed wire, cedar fence posts, metal “T” posts and
poured concrete (Figure 8.154) in the now abandoned JB-2 West evaluation site. A very small
complement of non-descript rusted historic metal artifacts (one pipe segment and one machine
part/hinge) were noted within and immediately adjacent to the main jumble. Additional shovel
tests (OT16 and OT17) were devoid of artifacts within the shallow, upland sediments typical of
this parcel. Shovel test observations revealed a typical soil column consisting of 30 centimeters
of sandy clay (10YR 3/4) overlying sterile clay (10YR 3/2). Beyond a brief documentation

Identified Non-Archeological Historic Resources

Along with the varied archeological resources identified during the IPL survey, cultural
resource specialists recorded an additional 20 historic-age resources within Navarro County.
As can be seen in Table 8.22, these resources include primarily agricultural outbuildings
and barns, but also a small complement of residential structures as well. Of that total, eight
resources (NV484-1, 491-1, 505-1, 509-1, 517-1, 879-1, 894a-1, and 894a-2) are located
within the 450-foot evaluation corridor corresponding with the APE indirect effect for nonarcheological properties, while the remainder are found beyond this impact boundary. Brief
resource descriptions are provided below, focusing on those resources that are located within
the APE and could thus be impacted by construction.

being a circa 1950 shed with wood siding that was likely moved to its present location. Other
historic-age buildings include a circa 1970 single-story, metal-sided barn, and a smaller circa
1965 single-story, metal-sided barn with a recent wing addition. The other buildings on the
property are all modern. Although affiliated with mid-century agricultural practices in Navarro
County, the barns lack significance under Criterion A. They have no known association with
important historic events, trends, or persons under Criterion B and is not a noteworthy example
of barn architecture under Criterion C. As such, they are recommended Not Eligible for listing
in the NRHP.

NV879-1
NV879-1 is a small, isolated circa 1900
wood-frame cabin found alone in an
open pasture south of Southeast County
Road 3220 and east of Southeast County
Road 3230 (Figure 8.162). The cabin
features horizontal wood plank siding
under a side-gabled roof. Two doors
opened along the west side while all
other openings (windows) appear to have
been planked-over. The building was not
visible on aerial photographs at the time
of survey and was instead identified by
surveying archeologists. The building is
in poor condition, and appears to have
been moved to the survey corridor from
another location. A review of 2012-dated
aerial imagery shows that the building
has since been removed from the vicinity.
While the resource was historic age with
nominal significance under Criteria A
and C due to its age and construction
technique, as a transplant from another
location the resource lacked the integrity
of location, setting, and association
necessary to convey significance. It is
no longer present within the proposed
IPL corridor. Accordingly, the resource is
recommended Not Eligible for listing on
the NRHP.

NV894a-2
NV894a-2 is a livestock and hay barn
located immediately north of 894a-1
on NR 2090 Road (Figure 8.164). The
barn is a two-story, wood-frame building
likely constructed ca. 1940. Visible
construction includes plywood siding
and a corrugated metal roof, with a wing
extension supported by wood posts. The
building is in poor condition and has a
large section of its roof missing. Although
affiliated with mid-century agricultural
practices in Navarro County, the barn
lacks significance under Criterion A as
there are no other agricultural buildings. It
has no known association with important

Results of Field Investigations
Henderson County
As the proposed IPL pipeline crosses the Trinity River and enters Henderson County, it
completes its transition from the Blackland Prairies to the Piney Woods. All phases of the
proposed project (both the Proposed and Future Actions) call for a single, approximately 40-mile
long pipeline corridor to be built, running roughly east-southeast to the Anderson County line.
As discussed in Chapter 1, the proposed IPL project is being completed in two actions. A short
segment of the pipeline (the eastern terminus of Sections 17 and all of Section 18) are part of
the IPL’s Proposed Action. In addition, the IPL project includes a proposed pump station at
Cedar Creek Reservoir (JCC1) also part of the Proposed Action. The 150-foot Proposed Action
permanent easement occupies an area of approximately 65 acres within the county while the
JCC1 site adds an additional 23 acres of proposed impacts, bringing the total impact footprint
to approximately 88 acres. Ultimately, the proposed pipeline will likely continue east of the
JCC1 site and terminate at Lake Palestine, however, the specific route corridor has not been
finalized at this time. This additional component is included in the project’s Future Action.
Survey crews did investigate all of the Proposed Action locations and an approximate corridor
for the Future Actions that may or may not be utilized for construction.
Given the IPL’s length within Henderson County and the marked increase in environmental and
cultural diversity over areas farther west, TRWD engineers generated a large number of minor
reroutes on this portion of the project. As can be seen in Figures 9.1–9.8, numerous avoidance
reroutes were investigated during the course of field survey in this county. Additional land is
proposed for construction east of Cedar Creek, but the specific corridor is yet to be finalized and
corresponding acreages are not available at this time. Within Henderson County, archeology
crews found deep, sandy soils, rolling hillsides intercut by small tributaries, and dense pine
and other hardwood woodlands. Within Henderson County, archeologists and architectural
historians surveyed approximately 3,819 acres of the proposed IPL project area. Henderson
County contained the largest number of identified resources than any county surveyed (at
95 resources it nearly doubles the next highest tally of 56 from Tarrant County). Through
the course of survey, specialists recorded 35 archeological sites (primarily prehistoric age),
17 archeological isolates, and 40 non-archeological historic-age resources. Below is a brief
summary of Henderson County’s environment, historical background, survey narrative, and a
detailed description of each recorded resource. Though additional coordination, including field
survey, will likely be required once the Future Actions are finalized and a route is identified,
this chapter summarizes all identified resources within the known Proposed Action footprint,
as well as those resources found within the surveyed and yet to be finalized Future Action
corridor.

9.1 	Pipeline Description
9.1.1 Proposed Final IPL 150-Foot Corridor
Within Henderson County, the proposed 150-foot wide IPL pipeline permanent easement
begins at the terminus of the underground tunneled crossing of the Trinity River in Parcel
602. At this crossing, Segment 17 bends northward, moving approximately four miles east to
the “T” intersection of Segments 18 and the Future Action corridor. Segment 18 (0.2 miles in
length) connects the pipeline to the proposed JCC1 site on Cedar Creek Reservoir’s western
bank near Parcel 619. Moving from Parcel 619, the IPL corridor’s Future Action turns south
to skirt the Cedar Creek Reservoir and crosses SH 31 between the communities of Trinidad
and Malakoff. From there, the approximate route continues east/southeast for an additional 15
miles, crossing SHs 59 and 19 before terminating at the Anderson County line.
The majority of the Henderson County impact area (including surveyed portions of the unfinalized
Future Action corridor) is composed of undeveloped, rural landscapes comprised (equally) of
open upland prairies, dense mixed woodlands, and dense riparian zones. The proposed pipeline
corridor avoids the region’s population centers and occasionally passes through isolated farms
and ranches. Like other county segments, the IPL pipeline within Henderson County will be
installed primarily through open-cut trenching to a depth of approximately 35 feet. Subsurface
tunneling is proposed for the pipeline’s crossing at the Trinity River.

9.1.2 Proposed Facility Sites
Cedar Creek Reservoir Pump Station (JCC1)
Located on Cedar Creek Reservoir’s western bank (TRWD-owned property), the proposed
Cedar Creek Pump Station will encompass approximately 23 acres. The JCC1 facility (Figure
9.9) is a newly proposed facility that, when built, will occupy a small peninsula located in
the shadow of the massive Cedar Creek levee to the south and west, overlooking a housing
development to the north. The land on which the proposed facility site will be located is
populated by dense riparian hardwood with minimal open land present (mainly toward the
west). According to current design plans, the proposed JCC1 facility includes an underwater
intake channel, a helipad, a chemical building, the pump facilities, a pig launching station,
a communications tower, and an electrical substation (to be built separately) along with
various access drives and walkways. Impacts (e.g., access roads, buildings, and pipeline) are
anticipated at or immediately below the ground surface. The proposed intake channel will
be dug approximately 60 feet below the ground surface, obtaining water from the 280-foot
elevation contour. Beyond the electrical substation (which is being installed under a separate
project and through different agencies) the facility components are not anticipated to be taller
than a two-story building.

9.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
Henderson County is an environmentally and culturally resource-rich area with varied terrain,
numerous waterways and wetlands, and an increased frequency of archeological resources.
Passing a particularly long portion of the IPL corridor through this region required a large
number of reroutes to avoid the numerous wetlands, archeological sites, and other resources
while adhering to the engineering requirements of the facility itself. Accordingly, as can be
seen in Figures 9.1–9.8, small to moderate reroutes (sometimes multiple iterations through the
same corridor) were common throughout much of the Henderson County portion of the IPL
corridor. One of the most challenging of these reroutes was Segment 17, which went through
several revisions in an effort to avoid identified environmental resources.
The original IPL corridor in Segment 17 began north of the currently-proposed route, crossing
the Trinity in Parcel 602 near Old River Road. TRWD then proposed an alternate route bisecting
an old Trinity River oxbow approximately one mile to the south. Finally, TRWD settled on
the final corridor, which runs between the two former alternatives and rejoins the original
corridor in Parcel 604. Moving east, the IPL corridor underwent a large number of revisions
at the approach to/from the JCC1 facility. In some locations, the IPL line was shifted to
avoid identified cultural resources, such as the historic-age Mankin Cemetery (HN618a-1; see
below). In other instances, alternative corridors were wholly abandoned to meet engineering
requirements (for example, the corridor running from Parcel 610 to Parcel 624).
Environmental teams evaluated two alternative locations for the proposed JCC1 pump station
site. The former alternative is located on the peninsula to the north of the final, and preferred,
alternative. This site, and the then-proposed pipeline approach, was surveyed and ultimately
abandoned for the southern alternative.
Moving east, below the Cedar Creek Reservoir, the survey crew evaluated a number of route
alternatives for the Future Action. Among the more substantial alternatives investigated
are a 2.5-mile-long alternative at the Cedar Creek channel to avoid a variety of identified
environmental resources located between Parcels 938/628 and 641 and a two-mile alternate
between Parcels 655 and 663. Alternate routes were considered to avoid environmentallysensitive lands in the vicinity of Hollywood Lake as well, with teams surveying northern,
central, and southern route alternatives (Parcels 694-701 and 1078-1081). In the vicinity of
SH 19, environmental survey teams evaluated several alternative routes in an effort to find
a resource-free pipeline corridor. The area was particularly challenging due to its location
near natural springs and Mine Creek. Several alternative pipeline corridors were surveyed,
while large portions of Parcels 723 and 1103 were investigated to guide pipeline engineers
on a resource-free route that is yet to be finalized. Moving east, teams evaluated alternatives
in Parcels 730, 731, and 734-744 and surveyed an alternative 150-foot corridor near Caddo
Creek in Parcels 1105 and 750. Finally, near the pipeline’s transition into Anderson County,
the survey team evaluated an alternative corridor within Parcels 791 and 792.

9.2 	Environmental Summary
The project area within Henderson County is located on the Kerens, Malakoff, Mallard Hill,
Athens, Coon Creek Lake, La Rue, and Poynor 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles. Within
Henderson County, the survey corridor transects mostly rural tracts of land with intermittent
residential and commercial development. The project area crosses 12 named creeks, Hollywood
Lake, and the Trinity River at the junction of Navarro and Henderson Counties. From east to
west, these creeks are: Mill Branch, Pierce Creek, Caddo Creek, Catfish Creek, Kile Branch,
Goldman Branch, Mine Creek, Coon Creek, Mill Run, Turkey Creek, Walnut Creek, and Cedar
Creek. Hollywood Lake lies between Mill Run and Turkey Creek.

9.2.1 Henderson County Soil Summary
The survey corridor crosses three geological groups within Henderson County. These are
the Midway and Wilcox Groups, as discussed in the Navarro County soils description, and
the Claiborne Group, as discussed in the Anderson County soils description (Barnes 1992).
Extensive deposits of Alluvium (Qal) and Fluviatile terrace deposits (Ot) are found along the
Trinity River with pockets of Alluvium (Qal) found along Walnut Creek and Coon Creek.
These deposits, particularly the terrace deposits, have a high potential for containing deeply
buried archeological sites. Thirty-five different soil types (Table 9.1) are found within the
APE. The majority of soils present within the APE consist of Pickton loamy fine sand, Axtel
loam, Cuthbert fine sandy loam, and Nahatche loam.

9.2.2 Henderson County Biota
The project area is located within the Texan Biotic Province and the Texan Austroriparian Biotic
Province as defined by Blair (1950). Typical vegetation encountered within APE includes pecan
(Carya illinoiensis), shumard oak (Quercus shumardii), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), black
walnut (Juglans cinera), hackberry (Celtis spp.), bois d’arc (Maclura pomifera), buffalo grass
(Buchloe dactyloides), bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis),
and Texas prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri) (Preston 1976). Mammalian fauna commonly
observed within this region include opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), bobcat
(Lynx rufus), and coyote (Canis latrans) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).

9.2.3 Current Land Use
Henderson County is primarily composed of agricultural land devoted to farming and ranching.
Oil and natural gas extraction also provides a significant contribution to the local economy.
The land remains rural from west to east with urbanization centrally located near the town of
Athens and smaller communities such as Malakoff.

9.3 	Historical Context
Henderson County, like many north Texas counties, began as a lightly-populated rural area
dominated by subsistence and family farming until the arrival of the railroad. The railroad not
only increased the growth rate and prosperity of existing cities, but helped establish new ones
along the rail lines. Unlike neighboring counties, cotton did not overwhelm the agricultural
economy, and farmers grew a variety of fruits, grains, vegetables, and legumes, as well as
raising livestock. Manufacturing clay products to complex machinery, was a constant source
of income for Henderson County.

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

9.3.1 Early Settlement, Civil War, and Reconstruction (1848-1880)
Ample evidence points to long term occupation of what would become Henderson County
by native tribes, particularly along the Trinity River. In 1819–1820, several eastern tribes
such as Cherokees, Shawnees, Delawares, and Kickapoos migrated to the area and occupied
it through the Texas Revolution. White settlers arrived shortly after, and following several
armed conflicts with the tribes, drove them out around 1840. Organized in 1846, Henderson
County adopted its current boundaries in 1848 and received its first courthouse at the new
county seat of Athens in 1850.
Henderson County’s small population of 1,155 people was primarily rural and relied on
subsistence agriculture. Less than 100 slaves lived in the county at the time, and the primary
crops were sweet potatoes and corn. Over the next ten years, the population swelled from
immigrants migrating in from the Deep South, who also brought increased numbers of slaves
and established new settlements such as Malakoff. The immigrants introduced cotton to the
local economy, joining an increasing variety of products that included tobacco, peas, oats,
lumber, leather, and ceramics. Livestock also grew in importance, with ranchers raising milk
and beef cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses.
As with almost all Texas counties, Henderson County supported secession and the residents
were enthusiastic supporters of the Confederacy. Due to its relative isolation, the county did
not have a significant Federal presence during Reconstruction, but still struggled to recover
from the war. The economy was depressed as farm values plummeted and manufacturing
almost disappeared. The population increased, however, with many freed blacks electing to
remain in the county; by 1880, it was just shy of 10,000 people (both white and black) (Hudson
2012).

9.3.2 Agricultural Prosperity and a Diversifying Economy (1880-1940)
As Henderson County’s post-war depression dragged on, many residents turned to the railroads
for economic salvation in 1875. After five years of work and deal-making, the St. Louis and
Southwestern Railroad was finally built through the county. The railroad had an immediate
effect on the county, revitalizing the economy and further increasing settlement. Manufacturing
picked up again, with new clay and ceramic-based industries opening in Athens. The town of
Malakoff moved one mile south to be strategically located along the railroad track and as a
result became prosperous (Long 2012).
By 1890, the agricultural economy was in full swing. Corn, peas, peaches, and cotton were the
primary crops at the time, bringing in over one million dollars annually. Livestock numbers
had rebounded from the post-war depression with poultry joining the mix of cattle, hogs, sheep,
and horses. The county undertook a concerted effort to improve the local roads in the early
twentieth century, and the existing courthouse was built in Athens in 1913 (Hudson 2012). The
first two decades of the twentieth century saw agricultural growth at its peak, dominated by
cotton and livestock.

Agriculture began to decline prior to the 1930s and the Great Depression. The boll weevil,
introduced to Texas in the late nineteenth century, had spread to most of the cotton-producing
areas by 1922, damaging crops and reducing yields (Britton et al. 2010). Government
intervention reduced the amount of cotton that could be grown, and along with increased
foreign competition, many farmers turned away from cotton in the 1920s. The Great Depression
further affected cotton’s prominence, as farmers abandoned fields for other lines of work or
shifted them over to different crops at the urging of soil studies and demonstration farms
(Dallas Morning News 1941: 177, 204–207). Farm sizes remained small during this time—
less than 90 acres on average due to the prominence of animal labor (as opposed to mechanized
farm equipment) (Brooks et al. 1962: 71). The number of county farms remained constant, but
property value dropped by more than half.
Manufacturing suffered during the Great Depression as well, with several county industries
closing between 1920 and 1940. Thankfully, new industries appeared to help ease the impact
of the nation’s economic woes on Henderson County. A power plant at Trinidad opened in
1926, using local lignite deposits for fuel. Oil fields were discovered in 1934, 1937, and 1940,
resulting in the opening of the Lone Star Gas Works gas plant in the late 1930s (Hudson 2012).

9.3.3 Modernization and Prosperity (1940–1970)
As World War II engaged the nation, Henderson County modernized its approach to farming
in response to the demand for labor and goods. Farms began employing mechanized farming
equipment, allowing farmers to work larger fields and grow a wider variety of crops (Dethloff
and Nall 2012). During this period, the average farm size increased to over 250 acres. Buildings
devoted to animal husbandry on farms gave way to machine shops and tractor barns. Fields,
once set aside for feed crops to support draft animals, transitioned to hay production to support
livestock. Tomatoes, peaches, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, and melons slowly replaced
the region’s cotton acreage (the last cotton harvest was in 1969) (Hudson 2012). The number
of farms dropped, but the value and size of those that remained greatly increased.
Canning arrived in the region to take advantage of the increased cultivation of vegetables and
fruits. New manufacturing facilities opened in Athens to support the growing need for modern
goods, such as furniture, chemical and medical equipment, clothing, machinery, and electrical
equipment. The county’s ample clay supply continued to support a ceramic and brick-firing
industry. Although the overall population of the county declined during the mid-twentieth
century, the population of Athens doubled between 1940 and 1970 (Enger 2012).
The small communities surrounding Athens, which had remained economically stagnant after
the Great Depression and during World War II,began to grow with the creation of the county’s
large reservoirs. Severe drought in the 1950s spurred creation of large water catch and storage
basins across the state. Cedar Creek Reservoir, impounded in the mid-1960s, spurred the
growth of Malakoff through increased recreation and tourism opportunities (Long 2012).

9.4 	Previous Surveys and Previously-Recorded
Archeological Sites
9.4.1 Previous Surveys
Previous archeological surveys documented within the IPL corridor in Henderson County
consist of an area survey conducted on behalf of the USACE Fort Worth District in 1978. This
survey transects the IPL corridor at the Navarro County border along the Trinity River. Another
large area survey was conducted on behalf of the same District in 1977 that encompasses the
IPL corridor from City Lake to SH 31. In 1982 an area survey was conducted on behalf of
the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), overlapping the IPL corridor from the railroad to
Lovers Lane. Lastly, a linear survey was conducted for the Federal Housing Administration in
1995, transecting the IPL survey corridor at FM 1305.

9.4.2 Known Archeological Sites
Based on the THC’s Online Sites Atlas, 49 previously recorded archeological sites exist within
one kilometer of the IPL proposed pipeline and facilities (including the approximate Future
Action corridor) within Henderson County. Of these 49 archeological sites, five (41HE199,
205, 221, 223, and 224) fall within the proposed 450-foot evaluation corridor. Another five
archeological sites (41HE26, 27, 29, 60, and 68) are inundated within the Cedar Creek
Reservoir. The remaining 39 archeological sites do fall within one kilometer of the 450-foot
IPL corridor, but are located outside of it.

9.5

Archeological Survey Observations

With the crossing of the Trinity River, the proposed IPL pipeline enters Henderson County and
a much more diverse and topographically-varied region with the generally flat and shallow
upland clays of the west giving way to the wooded, rolling, sandy hills of the east. During the
course of the Henderson County portion of the IPL survey, archeologists investigated some
3,787 acres of land, excavated more than 4,542 shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches, and
documented 35 archeological sites that were primarily prehistoric in age. Due to the density of
archeological resources and the environmentally-varied conditions in Henderson County, the
IPL corridor went through a significant number of revisions with archeologists investigating a
much larger amount of land than the proposed final route. As described in Chapter 1, below is
a brief summary of the survey results within the County. Discussion will focus on the resources
identified during the investigations. In all instances, unless stated otherwise, the reader is
to assume that the accessed parcels were intensively surveyed through surface inspection
and shovel testing in accordance with the methods provided in Chapter 4. Shovel testing
distribution maps are provided in Appendix A along with specific description of identified
archeological resources. A parcel-by-parcel survey review (e.g., shovel test counts, surficial
and soil observations, recommendations for each parcel) is provided for detailed inspection as

9.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
Segments 17 and 18 - Trinity River to Cedar Creek Pump Station (JCC1)
The IPL corridor enters Henderson County at Parcel 602 on the east bank of the Trinity River.
As can be seen from Figure 9.1, this portion of the corridor was particularly challenging to
navigate from an engineering perspective. At the river crossing, AmaTerra surveyors evaluated
four routes between Parcels 602 and 604. Beginning at the proposed bore pit in Parcel 602,
the proposed final pipeline bends gradually northward across the northernmost edge of a relic
Trinity River oxbow and climbs onto a shallow upland that splits the Trinity River (west) and
Cedar Creek (east) floodplains near Parcel 610 and State Highway 274 (Figure 9.10 and 9.11).
Immediately west of Water Oak Road, the IPL corridor’s Segment 17 terminates and Segment
18 continues east for 0.2-miles on towards the proposed JCC1 facility. The land in this area is
characterized as open, broad pastures with grassy fields to the west and less-maintained, smaller
pastures and woods to the east. Some areas were recently plowed and had excellent surface
visibility, but those areas were relatively rare with the prevailing surface visibility estimated
at 20 percent (Parcel 604). Surveying some areas after recent rains, archeologists found the
underlying clay subsoil left many of the pastures soggy and partially inundated, reducing
shovel test density and requiring hand-sorting (Figure 9.12). Additionally, a somewhat recent
storm/tornado had passed through the survey corridor, destroying several homes and littering
the ground surface with debris (Figure 9.13).
Along the 4.1-mile pipeline from Trinity the proposed JCC1 facility, archeologists excavated
approximately 270 shovel tests along the proposed final corridor. An additional 238 shovel
tests were excavated along the various abandoned and final routes and the area surveys in the
immediate final corridor vicinity (i.e. Parcels 604 and 959–961). Thirteen positive shovel tests
were excavated in this section of the survey. Close to the Trinity River, sediments were too
deep to be fully evaluated by shovel testing alone. In these instances, archeologists conducted
extensive backhoe trenching (Trenches 602-1-9; see below). While deeper soils are described
in the trenching section, shallow soil observations made during shovel testing in the floodplain

area revealed a typical soil column of 50 centimeters of silty sand (10YR 6/6) overlying 20
centimeters of sandy clay (5YR 5/6) overlying 20 centimeters of sandy clay (5YR 5/6) that was
interpreted as sterile subsoil (ST B602D275). As the survey continued east and the land rises,
soils become shallower. A typical soil column (Shovel Test A610B272) within this upland
setting consists of 50 centimeters of sand (10YR 6/4) overlying dense clay (5YR 5/6) that was
interpreted as sterile subsoil. Near the proposed JCC1 site, soils continue to be shallow sandy
clay loams overlying dense clay subsoils. Near the proposed JCC1 site a typical soil column
(Shovel Test A619D175) consist of 30 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 5/3, 5YR 5/6, and
10YR 4/4) on top of a sterile layer of clay (5YR 4/6) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil.
Along with the final pipeline route, Figure 9.1 depicts the varied alternate corridors that were
proposed to connect the pipeline from the Trinity River area to the JCC1 facility site and
beyond. From Parcel 610 to Parcel 619 to the east and Parcel 624 to the southeast, AmaTerra
archeologists surveyed 3.3 additional miles of evaluation corridor along three alternatives,
excavating an additional 198 shovel tests. Conditions in these now-abandoned routes were
similar to the proposed final alignment with archeologists encountering grazing pastures
intermixed with unmaintained wooded areas and shallow upland variety silty loams overlying
pronounced, dense sandy clays that were interpreted as sterile subsoil. A typical soil column
(Shovel Test C615C1) within these areas consist of light sandy A horizon sediments (10YR
4/3) overlying a light brown and orange mottled sandy clay at approximately 30 cmbs.
Within this portion of the IPL corridor, archeologists documented three archeological sites
(41HE299, 41HE368, and 41HE369), six non-site isolates (A602IF1-2, C602IF1, B603IF1,
C611IF1, and A618IF1), and conducted intensive investigations in the vicinity of Mankin
Cemetery adjacent to IPL Parcel 618 (see below).
Future Action—Cedar Creek Lake Pump Station to Boatwright Road

Action corridor that is yet unfinalized and is slated to continue across the county line to its

terminus at Lake Palestine. As stated above, investigators surveyed several alternatives south
and east of Cedar Creek Reservoir that may ultimately correspond to the proposed final IPL
alignment once it is finalized. This route will require additional coordination and/or survey
once designers identify a preferred corridor, but that work will take place after this report is
presented. The survey data provided below represents general field observations from the
surveyed corridors along these alternatives for preliminary interpretation and as a setting for
the sites observed.
As the proposed project moves south to
Boatwright Road (a distance of 1.1 miles),
archeologists found a survey corridor that
was mucky with abundant standing water
due to heavy rains at the time of survey
(Figure 9.14).
The land was largely
overgrown with tall weeds and modern trash
scatters in the vicinity of two poor-condition
structures (HN963-1 and 963-2, see below).
Shovel tests in the area (n=72) contained
30–40 centimeters of 10YR 4/1 sand and
clay loams overlying a distinct orange clay
subsoil. None of the shovel tests were
positive for archeological materials.

Figure 9.14. View of the inundated mucky
lowlands and trash scatters in Parcel 963.

Continuing south from Boatwright Road,
the Future Action splits near Parcel 627 at
its crossing of Cedar Creek. This divergence
continues for a distance of approximately
three miles, rejoining the original corridor
in Parcel 640. West of Cedar Creek, the
survey corridor passes through a broad, open
terrace overlooking the creek floodplain
to the east. Along the survey corridor,
archeologists found very few trees with the
land composed of numerous large pastures
and short, manicured grasses (Figure 9.15).
A large artificial tank immediately south of

impacted some of the surrounding landform
(Figure 9.16), but obvious evidence of
significant modern impacts were relatively low. Archeologists excavated approximately 140
shovel tests west of Cedar Creek with shovel tests (Shovel Test D630F82) typically containing
an upper layer of 40 centimeters of silty clay loam (10YR 4/4) overlying 20 centimeters of silty
clay loam (10YR 6/4) terminating at a sterile layer of dense clay (10YR 6/4). Though surveyors
determined that the western bank of the creek at the survey crossing appears to be the erosional
bank (Figure 9.17) and is primarily composed of upland sediments, archeologists noted that

deep, floodplain deposits were present
near Cedar Creek’s eastern bank. Backhoe
trenches were not required, however, as the
area will be bypassed through proposed
subsurface boring beginning approximately
500 meters west of the channel (see Figure
9.2). Along this segment, archeologists did
document four prehistoric archeological
sites (41HE342, 390–392; see below).
East of Cedar Creek, the Future Action
will likely be installed through subsurface
boring. The receiving pit, approximately
100 meters east of the channel, marks the
resumed installation through open-cut
trenching. Sand quarrying along the creek
bank has significantly modified the land in
the vicinity of the proposed bore pit, but
beyond that point, the land is open pasture
that appears unaltered as it rises gradually
from the floodplain into the uplands in
Parcel 1092 and 1093 (Figures 9.18–9.19).
Moving eastward, the open pastures give
way to intermixed, dense woodlands (Figure
9.20). Shovel tests excavated in this area
suggest that deep floodplain deposits are
present within Parcel 1091 which would
require backhoe trenching to fully assess.
Archeologists encountered increasingly
shallow, upland sediments with distance

toward the east. A typical soil column
(Shovel Test C1091C933) for this setting
consists of 10 centimeters of silty loam
(7.5YR 5/4) overlying 50 centimeters of
sterile clay (7.5YR 5/4), while a soil column
(Shovel Test D640B173), typical of the
uplands, was found to contain an upper layer
of wet sand (10YR 4/4) followed by water.
Eventually, the main survey corridor bends
southeastward and crosses SH 31 in Parcel
1118. Within the final corridor, between
Cedar Creek and SH 31, archeologists
excavated 122 shovel tests. Within this
portion of the preferred pipeline corridor,
archeologists documented one historicage archeological site (41HE223) and one
single-flake, non-site isolate (C1094IF1).
This area was surveyed repeatedly due
to route revisions, with archeologists
conducting area surveys in some locales
to investigate the boundaries of identified
environmental constraints. Within this area,
archeologists found a setting similar to the
main survey corridor (Figures 9.21–9.22),
though the depositional and erosional banks
of the creek were reversed (west/east,
respectively). Two-hundred-seventy shovel
tests were excavated along this alternative
route with archeologists documenting three
archeological sites and one non-site isolate
(41HE370/371, 388–389, and D630IF1;
see below). If the route is selected, it will
bisect deep sediments that will require
mechanical trenching to fully assess. Such
investigations were not completed as TRWD
indicated that the southern alterative survey
footprint (above) is more likely.

to FM 3441. Between Parcels 645 and
651, archeologists found the survey
corridor to be composed primarily of
hilly, overgrown woodlands toward the
west and flat, open fields toward the east
(Figure 9.23). Immediately north of the
survey corridor, sand mining operations
are underway though additional impacts
are relatively minimal. The survey
crews excavated approximately 122
shovel tests in this area through deep,
upland sands on the upper landforms
and shallow clays in the lowland areas.
None of the tests were positive, however,
the crews did revisit three previouslyrecorded sites (41HE198–199, 221; see
below).

woodlands in Parcel 645.

East of FM 3441, the survey corridor
again diverges for a distance of
approximately 1.7 miles beginning at
the crest of a high terrace that descends
sharply onto the Walnut Creek floodplain
to the east. One corridor moves east
through Parcels 655, 1071–1077 and on
to Parcel 663, where it rejoins the other
route and continues to the crossing of
FM 2636. A large buried gas line was
observed paralleling the survey route in

this area, partially disturbing the study
area in Parcels 1071–1072. Within
Parcels 1071–1074, the survey corridor
was found to be low and partially inundated with archeologists generally noting “swampy”
conditions (Figure 9.24). Where they could be excavated, shovel tests routinely contacted
the water table at a depth of 50–60 cmbs in dark clayey sands and sandy clays. A soil profile
(Shovel Test C1072F903) typical of this floodplain area, contains an upper 60 centimeters
of sand (7.5Y 4/6) overlying a darker 20 centimeters of sand (10YR 5/1) to depth. TRWD
call for two short tunneled segments to bypass the two Walnut Creek crossings, prompting
archeologists to excavate two backhoe trenches within Parcel 660 on a promontory terrace
between the two channels (see below). Once out of the Walnut Creek floodplain, however,
the survey corridor rises quickly into varied, rolling uplands beginning in Parcel 663 (Figure
9.25). Observations made during shovel testing in this area revealed a typical soil column of
(Shovel Test A663C410) 30 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 10 centimeters of
clay (5YR 5/8). More than 200 shovel tests were excavated along this portion of the IPL survey

with archeologists documenting a single
prehistoric lithic flake, non-site isolate
(C1075IF1; see below).
An earlier alternative corridor passed
through much more varied terrain,
skirting the toe slopes overlooking
the Walnut Creek floodplains (Figure
9.26). Soils in these areas are deep,
uniform floodplain varieties of sands
that generally extended to the maximum
depth of the 151 shovel tests excavated.
Tests dug at the colluvial toe slopes in
Parcel 658 were shallower and less
uniform. In this area archeologists
recorded two prehistoric archeological
sites (41HE372-373) with 19 positive
shovel tests.

Walnut Creek floodplain as seen in Parcel 663.

Future Action—FM 2636
to US Highway 59
Continuing east, the Future Action survey
corridor crosses rolling hills toward the
west to flat uplands near Parcel 676.
Due to the varied terrain toward the west
and the frequent inter-cuts of ephemeral
drainages, survey crews generally
tightened their shovel test intervals
to dig one test per 100 meters. The
vegetation consists of pine with dense
vine and briar undergrowth, inhibiting
movement (Figure 9.27). Archeologists
noted extensive disturbance from oil
and gas exploration activities in this
area, particularly in Parcel 937, where
well pads and graded access roads were
common (Figure 9.28). Farther east, the
land is open pasture with low, gentlyrolling hills (Figure 9.29). Along the
five miles of survey corridor between
FM 2636 and US 59, archeologists
excavated 362 shovel tests (three
positive) with no significant alternative
route evaluated. Soils observed in

shovel tests (Shovel Test A671C404) varied
from 10 to 30 centimeters of tan sandy loams
overlying deep, red sandy clay (7.5YR 5/8)
in Parcels 666–671 to 80 centimeters of
uniform sand (10YR 5/6) throughout the
soil column (C688B290). Archeologists
documented one highly-disturbed historic
archeological site in Parcel 667 (41HE374;
see below). In addition, a historic (1920s)
structure observed on the parcel was initially
recorded as a site (Figure 9.30), but through
further evaluations, it was found that the
structure had been moved to its location in
1971. Being a transplant and ultimately out
of context with no complementing artifact
assemblage, the structure was not formally
recorded.
Farther east, archeologists
recorded Site 41HE393, a historic trash
scatter, in the vicinity of Turkey Creek (see
below).

Future Action—US 59 to State Highway 19
As the Future Action crosses US 59, it enters heavily wooded rolling hills that descend
toward Shelton Mill Branch and Hollywood Lake (Figures 9.31–9.32). TRWD considered
three alternative crossings of Hollywood Lake, before electing to cross the waterway by bore
beneath the Lake at the base of the hill in Parcel 1080. Open-cut trenching resumes east of
the Hollywood Lake bank as the landform rises out of the narrow floodplain. Though deep
sediments were observed in this area, if TRWD tunnel beyond those areas in their final route
plans, backhoe trenching will not be required.

Moving eastward, the terrain continues to be rolling hillsides primarily composed of pine
woodlands with dense riparian understory though occasional open pastures are also present
(i.e. Parcel 701). The vegetation and terrain within this area worked in concert to make this
among the more challenging stretches of the IPL survey. In the lowlands between the hillsides,
archeologists found standing water and very dense understory typical of riparian zones. An
additional alternative route was surveyed between Parcels 711 and 713. Within the 4.8 miles
of the Future Action survey corridor between US 59 and SH 19, archeologists excavated
approximately 371 shovel tests with an additional 253 tests dug along the various alternative
survey corridors. Shovel tests were surprisingly similar throughout the corridor in this area with
archeologists generally finding soft, uniform sand of somewhat varying color (generally 10YR
7/4–7/6). Two prehistoric archeological sites (41HE394 and 41HE395) and two prehistoric
archeological isolates (B719IF1 and A721IF1) were recorded in this, particularly difficult
portion of the survey.
Future Action—State Highway

Crossing SH 19 south of the community of
Virginia Hill, the IPL survey corridor follows
along a high upland ridge overlooking Coon
Creek to the east in Parcels 717 and 940
(Figure 9.33) then crosses into a narrow
eastern floodplain. Shovel testing in Parcel
717 (Shovel Test (A717D318) revealed
a typical soil column of 80 centimeters of
uniform sand (10YR 6/4). Survey along
a northern alternative east of Coon Creek
suggested that backhoe trenching would be
necessary to fully assess project impacts, but

the southern corridor shifted just enough to avoid those deeper sediments with archeologists
routinely contacting dense clay subsoil between a depth of approximately 40 and 80 cmbs
(e.g., Shovel Test A719A519). Archeologists noted several profuse underground springs in the
area draining into Coon Creek even during the oppressive drought conditions of the Summer
of 2011 when the parcels were surveyed. As the survey corridor route continues southward
through Parcels 719, 1082, and 721, it passes through rolling open pastures intermixed with
dense riparian woodlands. Surface visibility varied significantly depending on location as the
woodlands were covered with a dense carpet of leaf litter while the open areas were parched
from drought affording excellent visibility (50 percent or more; Figures 9.34–9.35). Shovel
tests (Shovel Test C721D206) in Parcel 721 were shallower, containing an upper 40 centimeters
of sand (10YR 6/4) overlying a sterile clay (7.5YR 5/8). Overall, from SH 19 to the terminus
of Segment 19-2 (2.2 miles), archeologists excavated approximately 108 shovel tests with one
being positive for archeological materials.

parched grasses in the non-forested
areas of Parcels 719 through 721.

Figure 9.35. Surveyors heading to the IPL survey

The alternative routes to the north passed through similarly-varied terrain and generally lush
woodlands with poor surface visibility intermixed with open grassland pastures and, in the
instance of Parcel 723, an intentionally-planted pine stand. An area survey was also conducted
in Parcel 723 south of the linear survey corridor to potentially find an additional alternative
route. In all, archeologists excavated 226 shovel tests along the various alternative routes in
this area with an additional 33 in the area survey south of Parcel 723. Of these, eight were
positive for archeological materials.
Between all routes, archeologists documented a variety of archeological prehistoric and
multi-component resources including three sites (41HE375, 376, and 381) and two non-site
prehistoric isolates (B719IF1 and A721IF1; see below).

parcels south of Parcel 1133.
Citing
extensive
road-construction-related
disturbance, archeologists did not consider
on-site survey to be necessary. Immediately
east of FM 1615, TRWD requested a large
area survey in an effort to connect alternative
routes to the main corridor. Archeologists

into the uplands to the east (Figure 9.36). Archeologists, concerned that the floodplain may
contain deep sediments that would require backhoe trenching, dug particularly deep shovel
tests in the area, generally contacting sterile subsoil at depths ranging from 100 to 140 cmbs
(Shovel Tests F729B203). While some tests did not reach subsoil in the area the majority did,
indicating that subsoil was likely not much farther beyond the maximum reach of the shovel.
Consistently being devoid of archeological resources, the survey crew concluded that backhoe
trenching was not warranted at this creek crossing.
Continuing east in Parcel 730, shovel testing (Shovel Test D730A98) revealed a typical soil
column of 60 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 6/4) overlying 20 centimeters of sandy loam
(10YR 8/2) that continued to depth. While the final proposed pipeline follows a generally
eastward route, the original corridor passed farther north in Parcels 730 and 731 before
rejoining the final route in Parcel 732. The IPL Future Action corridor continues east through
intermixed series of woods and open pastures then again diverges from the original corridor
in Parcel 734 with archeologists surveying multiple routes to their unification at Parcel 744.
Parcels 736, 738, and 739 are heavily wooded before the land opens up to pasture land in
Parcel 1020 (Figures 9.37 and 9.38). This continues to Highway 2588 as the pipeline passes
north of Hallmark Lake.
Across the survey corridor, between FM 1615 and FM 2588, a distance of approximately
six miles, archeologists excavated approximately 408 shovel tests with an additional 204
tests along the various abandoned reroutes. Of this total, 16 were positive for archeological
resources. In this area, archeologists recorded five archeological sites (41HE378, 383-386) of
varied historic and prehistoric origin (see below).
Future Action—FM 2588 to US Highway 175
Between Parcels 748 and 760—a relatively short 1.7 miles—the Future Action corridor again
reflects several considered and evaluated alternative routes. As a result, this short portion of
the pipeline was subject to relatively extensive survey and a large number of shovel tests (210

along the survey route with 12 positive).
The land in this area is flat, maintained open
pastures throughout with a dense wooded
band along Caddo Creek and the adjacent
historic rail line (41HE397; see below). On
the west side of the creek, archeologists first
found the survey corridor to be too mucky
and inundated with surveyors sinking to
their knees (Figure 9.39). Where shovel
testing was possible in repeated visits, soils
were found to be uniform. Shovel tests
throughout this area generally consisted
of (C749A931) 80 centimeters of sand
(10YR 5/6). On the east side of the creek,

soils were shallower with archeologists
typically encountering sands (10YR 4/6)
that overlie dense clay subsoils at 60–80
cmbs (i.e. Shovel Test C752OT5E). These shallow tests provided sufficient evidence that
backhoe trenching would not be needed in the Caddo Creek floodplain to fully assess project
impacts. Moving east, the survey corridor continues through largely open fields and rolling
terrain before it meets US 175 at a disturbed earthen tank and roadway construction berm.
While the most prominent feature of the area is the abandoned historic Texas and New Orleans
Railroad recorded as Site 41HE397, archeologists also recorded three additional archeological
sites (41HE379, 382, and 387) and three non-site isolates (F750IF1, C752IF1, and C752IF2).
Future Action—US Highway 175 to Anderson County Line
As the IPL’s survey corridor continues for the final 6.7 miles of Henderson County, it passes
through similar rolling hills intermixed with open fields and dense riparian woodlands that
have been the norm for survey in the rural portions of the county (Figure 9.40). In Parcel

767, archeologists observed sand (10YR
5/3) overlying dense basal clay (7.5YR
5/6) at 30–80 cmbs, with similar conditions
observed in Parcels 784 and 789. Along
this segment, archeologists excavated
398 shovel tests with an additional 58 in
two minor alternative routes (Parcel 768
and 792). Archeologists documented one
prehistoric archeological site (41HE396)
and one non-site isolate (C792IF1) before
the survey transitioned to Anderson County.

As stated above, archeology teams evaluated
two alternatives for the proposed JCC1 pump station. Survey of the northern alternative (17
acres) took place in February of 2011 with the southern (23 acres) surveyed the following
April (40 acres total; Figures 9.41–9.43). Both locations were undeveloped, populated with a
lush carpet of grasses, secondary woodlands, and riparian scrub (increasing in density toward
the southeast). The reservoir’s massive earthen levee dominates the viewshed toward the

south and west while a residential neighborhood of recently-built homes lies on the neighboring
landforms to the north (Figures 9.44–9.45). The southern alternative was found to be largely
unaltered aside from recent hardwood growth indicative of land clearing approximately
20–30 years ago. The northern alternative was found to have numerous push piles and a large
artificial spillway extending west from the shoreline (Figure 9.46). Archeologists excavated
60 shovel tests (32 in the southern alternative and 28 in the northern alternative) across the
proposed facility site exposing a local soil column consisting of 20 centimeters of sandy loam
(10YR 4/3) overlying 30 centimeters of basal clay (5YR 5/8) (generally deeper to the west).
Archeology crews identified one prehistoric lithic scatter (41HE377) within the southern
proposed alternative (see Identified Archeological Resources below). Archeologists concluded
that the resource had been previously disturbed and is not considered eligible for listing on the
NRHP or as a SAL. No further work for this facility site is recommended

complement of minor historic structures (primarily agricultural outbuildings and barns)

significance.
Resource 618a-1,
the Mankin Cemetery, lies on the
outer-most edge of the half-mile
buffer. The cemetery is locally
significant and contains graves
dating back to the 1870s, but is not
considered eligible for listing to the
NRHP due to a lack of integrity (see
below). The large, earthen berm that
surrounds the lake fully obscures the
view of the proposed pump station
from the cemetery, and the distance
of the cemetery from the proposed
facility suggests that the revised
pump station will have no effect on
the cemetery’s viewshed.

Figure 9.46. Photo depicting the typical
setting of the archeological survey at the
preferred, southern JCC1 alternative.

Due to shallow, disturbed soils, a restricted viewshed and affected resources that are not
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP or as SALs, the cultural resource survey team has
concluded that the proposed JCC1 pump station site will not affect Historic Properties and
should proceed with no further cultural resource consultation.

9.5.3 Backhoe Trenching Effort
Along with traditional pedestrian archeological survey and shovel testing, the AmaTerra
archeology team also conducted extensive backhoe trenching along various reroute areas at the
Trinity River’s eastern floodplain and at Cedar and Walnut Creeks farther to the east. Within
the county, 10 trenches were excavated, three of which contained archeological materials
attributable to Site 41HE299.
Trinity River Crossing
As discussed previously in Chapter 8, the IPL’s crossing of the Trinity River was a keenly
anticipated portion of the archeological survey. In this area, the pipeline corridor was found to
cross a relic oxbow that would have served as an excellent terrace for prehistoric occupation. In
this area, archeologists expected deep Holocene floodplain deposits and abundant opportunity
for intact site preservation. While archeologists identified components of the ancient Carrollton
alloformation unit on the western river bank in Navarro County (Trenches 949-1-2), the eastern
bank’s IPL components crossed through a broader temporal range and reflected a generally
younger depositional environment (see Figure 8.45). In this location, archeologists monitored
excavation of nine backhoe trenches (Trenches 602-1-9), the first six being dug along a nowabandoned route corridor and the remainder placed along the proposed final centerline (see
Figure 8.53). Geomorphologist Brittany Gregory was present during much of the monitoring
in this area, assisting with trench interpretation and recording.

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

As described above, once out of the channel, the Trinity River’s eastern bank at the IPL
corridor is broad, flat and mostly open (Figures 9.47–9.49). The most extensive investigations
were conducted along the now-abandoned southern survey corridor, where the abandoned line
crossed a relic oxbow then rises to the older terraces toward the east (Figures 9.50-9.52).
Crossing a shorter span of the Trinity floodplain, trenching investigations along the preferred
final route (Trenches 602-7-9) served to support earlier interpretations and to identify buried
archeological deposits.
According to Gregory and Frederick (this volume), the IPL’s eastern Trinity River approach
crosses through three allostratigraphic units west of the oxbow including a thin drape of
modern floodplain overlying
(progressively) Pilot Point, and
Sanger units while Carrolton
deposits were first observed east
of the oxbow and presumably
underlay the Sanger materials
closer to the channel (Figures
9.53–9.55; Tables 9.2–9.4).
The thin (30–110-centimeter)
modern alluvium is characterized
as uniform, light buff colored,
dating from the Late Prehistoric
through Historic Periods. Below
this modern deposit, the Pilot
Point formation is noted in every
trench excavated with the deepest
components observed close to

in Trench 602-2 versus generally
100–200 centimeters in other
trenches). This deposit is
roughly 1,000 to 4,500 years old
and is characterized with a dark
cumulic A horizon followed by
a Bk horizon containing siltcoat nodules and slickensides.
Archeological sites dating from
the Middle Archaic through the
Late Prehistoric periods have
been documented within these
deposits. Sanger deposits are the
deepest sediments observed west
of the relic oxbow. These 4,500–
11,500-year old soils consist of a

most components of this deposit are too deep to fully assess in normal survey contexts, they
are known to contain Paleoindian through Middle Archaic-age occupations.
East of the relic oxbow, the landform rises gently, and excavated trenches increasingly
encounter older deposits including the Pleistocene-age Carrolton units described in Chapter
8 (Tables 9.5–9.7). As can be seen in Figures 9.56–9.58, sediments vary significantly from

route, archeologists did encounter
diffuse, deeply buried materials
that are consistent with a buried, in
situ occupation. These materials
were recorded as components of
Site 41HE299 (see below).
Along the preferred pipeline
corridor,
archeologists
found
a similar floodplain to the one
observed to the south. However, this
floodplain is narrower, measuring
approximately 600 meters wide
versus the southern alternative’s
900-meter-wide floodplain. In

this area archeologists excavated
three backhoe trenches (Trenches
602-7–9)—all of which were devoid of archeological resources. These trenches were largely
excavated in the pre-cultural Carrolton formation deposits observed both west and east of the
river. Subsequent to trenching, TRWD designed the proposed tunneling segment and placed
the receiving pit (the start of open-cut trenching) east of Trench 602-7, in turn, bypassing most
of the deepest, youngest floodplain deposits. As can be seen in Tables 9.8–9.10, this area
contains a similar profile to the Pleistocene-age Carrolton formation deposits observed in the
outer edges of the Trinity floodplain; particularly in Trench 602-9 (Figures 9.59–9.61). Citing
a lack of archeological materials within a floodplain deposit that is ancient and pre-cultural, it is

unlikely that the preferred pipeline
corridor route will impact intact,
significant archeological deposits.
Additional, detailed investigations
in this area are not recommended.
Cedar Creek
Moving farther east, archeologists
encountered a smaller floodplain
south of Cedar Creek Lake’s
spillway along the original Cedar
Creek channel (Figure 9.62). As
described above, archeologists
were able to assess sediments

through shovel testing. The TRWD
engineers plan to subsurface tunnel
the pipeline beneath the channel resulting in the deeper Holocene soils west of Cedar Creek,
to be bypassed entirely. East of the creek, archeologists excavated one backhoe trench within
Parcel 1091 (Trench 1091-1; Figure 9.63). This trench, dug in a broad, open floodplain,
reached a maximum depth of 220 centimeters through five depositional zones, the upper four
of which (Zones 1–4) are progressive layers of pale gray to brown (10YR 5/2 to 3/1) silty
clays that appear to be of Holocene age (Figures 9.64 and 9.65; Table 9.11). Only Zone 5,
extending from 180 centimeters to the terminus, is likely pre-cultural, containing a dense,
pale yellow sandy clay with heavy mottling and manganese redox filaments. Citing a lack
of archeological materials and a relatively shallow Holocene depositional zone, additional
backhoe trenching was considered unwarranted and construction in the area, if ultimately
proposed (this is in the unfinalized Future Action corridor), will not likely impact unidentified,
deep, intact archeological deposits.

Walnut Creek
An additional segment of the Henderson County IPL survey corridor that was investigated
through backhoe trenching is within Parcel 660, where the survey briefly parallels Walnut
Creek along its north bank (Figure 9.66). At this location, archeologists monitored two
backhoe trenches (Trenches 660-1-2) with neither containing archeological materials (Figures
9.67–9.69; Tables 9.12–9.13). Being excavated on similar topographic settings, the observed
soil profiles were very similar with archeologists recording five soil zones (Zones 1-5) and
terminating beneath the water table at approximately 200 centimeters below the surface.
Within a represntative profile, archeologists observed approximately 60–70 centimeters of fine
sandy clay and sandy loams overlying a thin (20 centimeters) layer of heavily-mottled sandy
clay with seeping water. This layer likely represents the terminus of archeologically-viable
sediments as all layers beneath this are described as wet, mottled clays with large calcium
carbonate nodules and increasing moisture content. With water seeping into the base near the
200-centimeter terminus, both trenches were terminated in likely Pleistocene terrace deposits

that pre-date human occupation in the region. Lacking any archeological materials within
an inundated, relatively shallow Holocene depositional environment north of Walnut Creek,
archeologists determined that additional trenching investigations were unwarranted. Proposed
construction in this area, if ultimately selected (this is in the unfinalized Future Action corridor),
is unlikely to impact significant, intact deeply-buried archeological resources.
Mill Run Creek
The final segment of the Henderson County IPL survey corridor that was investigated through
backhoe trenching is within Parcel 710, as the proposed investigation briefly crosses Mill Run
Creek (Figure 9.70). The backhoe trench is situated along the western bank of Mill Run within
a low lying area. The backhoe trench was located along the periphery of a pasture, adjacent
to a treeline to the east (Figure 9.71), a stock pond to the southwest, and a southerly trending
two-track road to the west. At this location, archeologists briefly monitored the excavation
of one backhoe trench (Trench 710-1), which contained one tertiary chert flake between
30 and 40 cmbs (D710IF1). While trenching was permitted by the landowner, he became
more oppositional to the work once excavation of the trench began. With tempers rising, the
archeologists made the decision to complete the excavation as expediently as possible and
detailed recordings were not completed. Backhoe Trench 710-1 terminated at 1.4 meters

below ground surface. Within a representative profile, archeologists observed approximately
50 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 5/2) overlying 30 centimeters of sandy clay loam (10YR
4/2) overlying 60 centimeters of heavily-mottled sandy clay (Figure 9.72 and 9.73). This layer
likely represents the terminus of archeologically-viable sediments as all layers beneath this are
described as wet, mottled clays with increasing moisture content. Despite recording a single
tertiary chert flake, field archeologists elected against additional backhoe trenches as a result of
a relatively shallow Holocene depositional environment and a lack of additional archeological
materials in surrounding shovel tests. Due to the relatively shallow sediments, the Principal
Investigator recommends that additional trenching is not necessary at Mill Run. Proposed
construction in this area, if this corridor is ultimately selected (this is in the unfinalized Future
Action corridor), is unlikely to impact significant, intact deeply-buried archeological resources.

Archeological Resources

As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, Henderson County was by far the most
resource-rich county within the IPL evaluation corridor. Archeology crews recorded 35
archeological sites (10 historic; 21 prehistoric; 4 multi-component) and 17 minor isolated finds
within the Ccounty’s various survey corridors. Unlike previous counties, as can be seen in
Table 9.14 below, those resources documented within Henderson County were predominantly
of the prehistoric-variety (most often Woodland or Caddo artifact scatters and occupation
sites). Below is a summary of the archeological resources that were recorded during the IPL
field survey effort. Though not recorded as an archeological site, intensive archeological
investigations in the vicinity of Mankin Cemetery, located west of the proposed JCC1 site,
warrant a detailed and direct discussion. Formal archeological sites will be discussed later.

9.6.1 Mankin Cemetery Area
Immediately south of the IPL’s
evaluation corridor within Segment
17, archeologists and historians
investigated the Mankin Cemetery
(Resource HN618a-1), a historic-age
community cemetery located near the
northeast corner of Joe Andrews Road
and Key Ranch Road (Figures 9.74
and 9.75). The cemetery is located just
outside of the 450-foot IPL evaluation
corridor. In addition to the proposed
subsurface pipeline, the design includes
an above-ground electrical transmission

line that passes north of the cemetery.
Cemetery entrance gate.
The transmission line will supply the
proposed JCC1 pump station site with
power. Archeologists and architectural historians intensively surveyed the 450-foot survey
corridor around the cemetery in an effort to identify potentially unmarked burials within the
fenced limits of the cemetery and the IPL permanent easement. Archeologists also noted that
the resource is located just outside the edge of the 1/2-mile indirect effects APE.

According to Jasinski (2004), Mankin
Cemetery was established around the
same time the community of Mankin
was founded, with the earliest interment
dating to 1871. Originally, the cemetery
included a small church that was
also used as a school, however that
building is no longer extant (Malakoff
News:9). Many of the community’s
founders and prominent families are
buried here including the Mankin
(Louisa and William), Hurt, Taffe (also
spelled “Taafee”), McShan, and Quinn

9.79). Overall, the cemetery contains
approximately 590 individual burials
dating from the 1870s through present
day, though site use is declining following the inundation of the Mankin community with
the creation of Cedar Creek Lake in 1960 (Freeman 2007; Malakoff News:9). Other notable
features include a communal pavilion used for funeral services and an iron lich gate at the west
entrance (see Figure 9.74). Neither of these features are believed to be of historic age.
The layout of the cemetery is typical of a Judeo-Christian cemetery with headstones laid
facing east (Figure 9.80). Most of the early interments (dating from the 1870s to 1900s) are
found in the north-central area of the cemetery and many of the previously mentioned families
have family plots, marked by wrought iron fence or concrete, located within or near this area
(Figure 9.81). More recent burials (1920s to present) are found outside the perimeter. This
suggests that any older unmarked graves would be located closer to the cemetery’s center
rather than near the periphery, potentially beyond the modern boundary. Of particular note
from an archeological survey perspective is a small two-track maintenance road which forms
a visual and physical interior buffer between the interments and the fenceline (Figure 9.82),
further reducing the likelihood that unmarked graves may be located outside of the survey
marked boundary.
Archeologists excavated six shovel tests in the IPL corridor surrounding the Mankin Cemetery.
None contained archeological materials or any indication of subsurface disturbance that might
be consistent with an unmarked burial, though soils in the area were dry and extremely dense
and difficult to penetrate. Shovel Test B618D89 is typical of the area, containing an upper
40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR 4/3) on top of sterile clay (10YR 4/4). Within the survey
corridor, archeologists found the land to be open, with no clear indications of possible unmarked
graves (depressions, fencelines, etc.) and concluded that the potential for such was relatively
low (Figure 9.83)
Along with the direct impacts in the area, crews evaluated the project’s potential to indirectly
impact the cemetery through the proposed electrical transmission line installation. According

Austin, Texas (letter Denton to Dobson-Brown 11/24/2009).
With AmaTerra finding: 1) the oldest interments near the cemetery’s center and progressively
younger dates radiating outward from there; 2) the lack of subsurface or surficial indications of
unmarked graves within IPL survey corridor or more specifically the proposed IPL permanent
easement; and 3) the impact footprint’s location 150 feet from the outer edge of the cemetery
(double the buffer proposed by the THC in previous project coordination), we believe there is
low potential for the project to affect marked or unmarked graves associated with the Mankin
Cemetery nor will the proposed construction cause any indirect visual effects to this resource.
The resource is historically significant as it represents one of the last elements of the Mankin
community. However, with multiple modern additions, including modern interments mixed
amongst older plots, the resource lacks the associative integrity needed for NRHP eligibility.
No further work is recommended.

9.6.2 Henderson County Archeological Sites
As discussed previously, due to the large survey corridor and the multiple revisions of the
proposed IPL permanent easement, a higher number of archeological sites were recorded than
are actually located within the proposed 150-foot permanent easement (considered the direct
impact footprint and the APE for direct effects to archeological resources). In addition, a
significant portion of the IPL corridor through Henderson County is included in the Future
Action, which is not finalized at this time. Without a known route in place, it is impossible to
assess the project’s effects to identified archeological resources. Unlike in previous chapters,
the archeological sites found during survey along the Future Action are described as fully as
possible, but regulatory recommendations (if provided) are considered preliminary and will
require revision once, or if, a final route is selected east of the JCC1 site. The following
archeological site discussion is accordingly divided into two sections: 1) those sites that at least
partially are found within the proposed final permanent easement (and have the potential to
be impacted by the project), and 2) those that lie outside of the identified permanent easement
(including sites that are found well outside of the known pipeline corridor and those sites
that are adjacent to the approximate Future Action route that may ultimately be impacted
by construction). Sites found within the impact footprint will include detailed regulatory
recommendations (including NRHP/SAL eligibility findings) and, in the instance of historic
archeological sites, archival research summaries. Those sites lying outside of that corridor will
largely be presented for inventory purposes only with minimal interpretation and/or regulatory
recommendations offered. Additional coordination will be required to formally identify and
assess project impacts along this Future Action once it has been determined.
Archeological Sites within Current Henderson County Impact Footprint
41HE369
Site 41HE369 is a small, diffuse, short-term prehistoric occupation site consisting of two lithic
flakes. Occupying an area of approximately 80 x 60 meters (north/south x east/west), the site
is located on a small rise overlooking two ephemeral drainages along a low lying terrace east
of the Trinity River (Figures 9.85 and 9.86). The land, blanketed by short, mixed grasses,
currently serves as a grazing pasture. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately
20 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are an
Axtell loam-Burleson clay, clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mixed sources.
Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 60 to 80 centimeters of
coarse sandy loam (7.5YR 4/6) overlying dense clay (5YR 5/8) that was interpreted as sterile
subsoil. Shovel tests typically terminated between 80 and 100 cmbs. Modern disturbances
were minimal, limited to animal grazing activities.
Lacking any surficial manifestations, Site 41HE369 is limited to subsurface contexts.
Archeologists excavated 14 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41HE369, two of
which contained artifacts (A281, B284, and OT1-12; Table 9.15). Shovel Test A281 contained
one dark grey chert flake (possible burin) excavated between 60 and 80 cmbs, while Shovel Test
B284 contained one red quartzite modified flake recorded between 80 and 85 cmbs (Figures

9.87 and 9.88). All other shovel
tests were devoid of cultural
materials and no features or
other site-related materials were
observed.
From available information, Site
41HE369 is indicative of a shortterm, ephemeral prehistoric
occupation site. With no other
archeological elements noted
within the current site boundary,
the resource is considered fully
investigated within the proposed
IPL permanent easement. Due
to a lack of formal features,
diagnostic artifacts, or additional
complementary archeological
resources, Site 41HE369 is
considered ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP.
Though the site may be impacted
by construction, no additional
work is recommended at this
time.

some grasses increasing with distance
from the shoreline. Overall surface
visibility was estimated at nearly 100
percent. According to the USDA’s Web
Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity
are an Axtell loam with 1–5 percent
slopes. Observations from site shovel
tests revealed a typical soil column of 30
centimeters of sand (10YR 7/2) overlying
20 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR
6/1) overlying dense clay (5YR 4/6) that
was interpreted as sterile subsoil. Shovel
tests typically terminated between 50 and
60 cmbs upon encountering the sterile
subsoil layer. Archeologists documented
site disturbances in the form of natural
erosion (wave action), as well as wet-dry cycling.

Figure 9.90. General overview of Site
41HE377 terrain and setting.

Surficial manifestations of Site 41HE377 include fire cracked rocks and multiple lithic flake
concentrations along the edge of the peninsula’s bank (Figure 9.91). Each concentration
contained 25–50 artifacts. Archeologists could not discern any functional patterning within
any of the concentrations and, in turn, did not define them as features. Additionally, though
spatially separate from one another, the concentrations appear to correspond to natural wave
action rather than cultural activity. The majority of artifact concentrations consist of tertiary
quartzite flakes ranging in size from 0.5–2 centimeters in length. A large tested cobble or early
stage biface and a single Stage 2 biface fragment were also observed within the site boundary
(Figure 9.92). No prehistoric ceramics were observed within the site area. The artifacts are
located within a wave action zone, which implies that the resources are either eroding out of
the shoreline terrace or all of the artifacts are in secondary placement having been washed up
from a site that is currently under water. Archeologists briefly inspected the inundated ground
surface beyond the beach and found additional flakes, indicating that the materials continue
below the waterline.

lithic flakes and cobbles from Site 41HE377.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Archeologists excavated 11 shovel tests during their investigations at Site 41HE377 (OT1,
OT2, OT3, OT4, OT6, OT9, OT16, OT22, OT28, OT29, and OT35). All shovel tests were
devoid of cultural materials and terminated in sterile subsoil.
Site 41HE377 likely represents the disturbed, outer edge of a larger prehistoric archeological
site that is now inundated. Based on the variety of lithic reduction stages observed (from
primary cobbles to tertiary flakes) and the presence of burned rock, the resource represents
a secondary lithic reduction and occupation site of (citing a lack of ceramics) pre-woodland
age that overlooked a lithic procurement outcrop somewhere below (now well under water).
Lacking any formal features, diagnostics, or potential for organic preservation due to the
constant wet-dry cycling at this location, the components of the site observed during the current
survey are not considered eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. Additionally, shovel
testing indicates that deeper components are unlikely. Though the components are likely to
be disturbed through IPL-related construction, the site has been thoroughly investigated in
accessible areas and no further work is recommended at this time.
Archeological Sites Outside of the IPL Impact Footprint
As discussed in previous chapters, archeologists documented a large number of sites during
the course of the IPL-related survey that lie outside of the proposed final permanent easement,
the majority of which are located within the vicinity of the Future Action corridor, yet to be
finalized. These sites are located either within the proposed 450-foot evaluation corridor, or
they are found on pipeline segments that are incomplete. These sites are presented below
for inventory purposes. Regulatory recommendations are, where presented, preliminary and
(with historic sites) extensive archival research is not provided. Additional coordination and/
or survey will be necessary to formally assess impacts once a Future Action route is selected
(if at all).
41HE198
Site 41HE198, previously recorded by Espey, Huston and Associates archeologists in 1981,
is a historic debris scatter dating to the 1900s. Occupying an area of approximately 16 meters
in diameter, the site is situated on a sandy bluff overlooking an unnamed waterway. Local
vegetation consists of short grasses and oak trees. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the site vicinity are a Styx loamy fine sand with 1–5 percent slopes. Observations
from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of sand (10YR 4/2)
overlying 20 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 2/2). Typically, shovel tests extended to a depth
of more than 80 cmbs. Modern disturbances include various agricultural activities and cattle
grazing.
Cultural materials identified in 1981 consists of decorated whiteware including a blue transfer
printed sherd, a red rim sherd with a floral pattern, brown/cream glazed pottery, clear glass
shards, unidentifiable metal fragments, and brick fragments. IPL survey archeologists
excavated four shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE198 (A902, A903, C886,
and E893; Table 9.16). Of these, one shovel test (A902) contained two glass shards (clear and

9.93 and 9.94). Archeologists could not determine conclusively if the glass was historic in age
or modern, but consider it likely historic due to its location. All other shovel tests were devoid
of cultural material. No surface scatters or features were observed.

route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE199
Site 41HE199, previously recorded by Epsey, Huston, and Associates in 1981, is the remnants
of a small historic farmstead. The site consists of both surficial and subsurface household
debris and construction material, a large decorative lily patch (Feature 1), and the segment of
a historic fence line (Feature 2). During AmaTerra’s revisit to the site, archeologists recorded
a southward extension of Site 41HE199 extending into the proposed 150-foot IPL permanent
easement. The site is located within Parcels 645-647. Occupying an area of approximately 140
x 80 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated on a rise within a wooded pasture
with heavy secondary growth, indicative of a formerly cleared field. Overall, surface visibility
was estimated at approximately 20 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils
within the site vicinity are a Styx loamy fine sand with 1–5 percent slopes. Observations from
site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 20 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/2)
overlying 20 centimeters of mottled sandy loam (10YR 4/2 and 7.5YR 4/6) overlying sand
(7.5YR 4/4) reaching a depth of 80+ cmbs. Based on previous documentation of the site,
AmaTerra archeologists concluded that site conditions are largely unaltered since its initial
recording in 1981 (Figures 9.95 and 9.96) suggesting minimal disturbances.
Surficial manifestations of Site 41HE199 include a scatter, measuring 60-square feet in size,
of diffuse, historic domestic debris and construction material. Cultural materials include 11
patinated clear and brown glass shards, two undecorated whiteware sherds, a lightning rod
fragment, six pulled wire nails, one buff colored Malakoff brick fragment, an unidentified tin
can, and ten rusted metal fragments (Figure 9.97). Additionally, archeologists documented a

AmaTerra archeologists conducted deed research in an effort to identify a link between the site
and any individual(s) of historical significance. From the associated artifact assemblage, the
site likely dates to the early twentieth century so researchers used that age range as their target
for personal identification. Archival research suggests that the parcel, part of the P. Tumlinson
Survey (Abstract 756, Tract 44) has been owned by varied industrial interests from the present
into the 1920s as the parcel was included in a large (98-parcel) land purchase by Malakoff
Fuel Company of Delaware in 1926 (Volume 126, pg. 180). Within that purchase some 15

individual parcels were transferred from private landowners within the Tumlinson survey, the
dimensions of which, unfortunately, could not be linked to the current parcel’s size.
Accordingly, the names of the specific landowner who may have lived on or used the site could
not be identified. Subsequent to that date, the land transferred to Texas Power and Light (1935;
Volume 256, pg. 279), then Houston Light and Power (1982; Volume 1000, pg. 398), and
ultimately Reliant Energy (2002; Volume 1740, pg. 558). It is most likely that Site 41HE199
is linked to one of the private land owners who sold their property to Malakoff Fuel in 1926
and the site itself likely precedes that sale. Due to the massive size of the purchase and the
ambiguous details of prior ownership, more details of who may have lived at the site could not
be identified.
Archeologists compared the recorded site boundary with a February 1947 aerial photograph
and found no standing structures or distinct evidence of such at the mapped location (Figure
9.99). A two-track road is visible leading to the site area from the northeast, while a dark
jumble of trees may correspond to a former structure but such details could not be coaxed from
the image.
From available information, Site 41HE199 is believed to be a destroyed, twentieth century
(approximately the 1920s) historic farmstead. Though the site lacks formal domestic foundation
elements, the presence of fencing, brick, a lightning rod, and other construction debris indicates
that such a structure stood nearby. Artifacts observed on the ground surface and within the
four positive shovel tests does not suggest that extensive new data could be identified through
additional field investigations. Furthermore, the portions of the site situated within the IPL
permanent easement consist of scattered, surficial debris that are only indirectly associated
with the main occupation,
which is believed to be
located farther north,
away from the potential
impact footprint. Efforts
were made to tie the
site to contemporary
individuals,
however
the scale of the land
purchase associated with
this (and 95 other) parcel
did not allow such data
to be accessed. The site,
however, is most likely
associated with a small
family farm or tenant
farm that was sold to
industrial interests and
abandoned in the mid

considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is recommended
for the components of the site expected to be impacted by IPL-related construction. These
interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be
required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected
in the site vicinity.
41HE205/221
Sites 41HE205 and 41HE221, previously recorded by Espey, Huston, and Associates in 1981,
was recorded as the remnants of two, related historic-period rent houses in close proximity
to one another (approximately 100 meters apart). Though the sites were recorded as two
distinct resources consisting of different artifact assemblages, the IPL survey revisit to the
area revealed some overlap between the reported and observed assemblages with materials
described in one site being found in the mapped location of the other (and vice versa). Due
to this confusion and their close proximity, archeologists considered the two sites one larger
resource and recorded it as such.
According to Espey, Huston, and Associates archeologist Pegi Jodry (1981), surficial
manifestations of Site 41HE205 consisted of a 15 x 50 meter (north/south x east/west) historic
debris scatter consisting of clear and blue glass, undecorated whiteware, white glazed crockery,
and round [sic] nails located in a bermudagrass pasture. The site’s original recorder interviewed
Paul Bankston (1981), who noted that this site was the location of a “pretty frame house” that
was torn down when the property was owned by T. A. Bartlett Senior. Site 41HE221, located
approximately 120 meters east of 41HE205 consisted of a small surficial scatter of clear and
brown glass, Malakoff brick fragments, glazed brown and white crockery, scrap metal, and
the head of a hatchet. Mr. Bankston informed recorders in 1981 that the site was the location
of a small rent house that he had torn down when he owned the property. According to the
1981 field form, the landowner had previously plowed the area near the vicinity of the artifact
scatter. Also, archeologists from Espey, Huston, and Associates did not document the presence
of any standing structures or foundations associated with these two archeological sites.
During the IPL survey archeologists found that the site consists solely of a small surficial
brick scatter near the site’s western terminus (Figures 9.100 and 9.101). Occupying an area of
approximately 60 x 145 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated within a cleared
field with a quarry pond to the north and a stock pond to the west. Local vegetation consists
of heavy brush and large oak trees. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately
0–20 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are an
Axtell loam with 5–12 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 80 centimeters of uniform sand (7.5YR 4/6). Shovel tests typically terminated at
80 cmbs. Modern disturbances to the area consist of cattle grazing and general agricultural use.
During the current field survey, archeologists found no remnants of Site 41HE221 within the
survey corridor. A brick scatter consisting of approximately 12-15 multi-hole tan bricks of
unknown age was found on the surface under an oak tree (Figure 9.102) near the stock tank in
the location of Site 41HE205. Site records did not include any bricks in its recorded assemblage,

did.
Archeologists excavated six
shovel tests (OT2, C891,
C892, C893, E899, and
E900) in the area where the
historic site and features
were first recorded. All
shovel tests were devoid of
cultural materials.
Like the previously-discussed
historic Site 41HE199, Site
41HE205/221 was included
in the large 98-tract Malakoff
Fuel Company land purchase
in August of 1926 (Volume
126, pg. 180). As mentioned
above, the site is found
within one of the Tumlinson
tract parcels privately owned
and sold to the company,
but the specific name of the
individual/family could not
be identified due to numerous
and vague tract descriptions.
Accordingly, it can only be
concluded that the site most
likely pre-dates 1926 and
was most likely abandoned
after the land was sold for
industrial use.

The sites could not be clearly

through the 41HE205 boundary
and a cleared area is visible near
the site’s southwestern edge. The large barn visible in the 1940 aerial to the east, approximately
170 meters from the currently-mapped site boundary, is still evident seven years later but this
structure is well outside of the possible site vicinity. If the 1981 informant was correct, the
structures were likely gone well before this 1947 aerial photograph.

Site 41HE205/221 is a destroyed historic occupation site common in this region. Being
composed solely of a small surficial scatter of brick with no associated features or additional
artifacts, the site is nearly destroyed and lacks any research potential. Though researchers could
not tie the resource to an individual of historical significance, previous informant’s information
suggests that these were tennant farm sites, which are quite common throughout the state,
including Henderson County. Accordingly, components of Site 41HE205/221 identified during
the current IPL survey are considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. These
interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be
required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected
in the site vicinity.
41HE223
Site 41HE223, previously recorded by archeologists from Southern Methodist University
(SMU) participating in the Tennessee Colony Project in 1974 (Figure 9.105), is a decayed
log cabin with an associated historic trash scatter (both now no longer extant). Occupying
an area of approximately 20 x 30 feet (north/south x east/west), the site is situated within a
semi-wooded pasture with a stock pond to the northwest. Local vegetation consists of mixed
hardwoods. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Styx
loamy fine sand with 1–5 percent slopes. Observations made from site shovel tests revealed a
typical soil column of 80 centimeters of sandy clay (7.5YR 5/6). Modern disturbances include
structure removal and possible bulldozing.

Figure 9.105. Site 41HE223 plan map.

The original recording describes the site as a decayed log cabin that was, at the time of recording,
12 x 15-feet in size with partially standing walls and an associated historic trash scatter. Historic
artifacts dating to the early to mid 1900s observed by the 1974 field archeologists included light
colored bricks with scoring and glazing, round logs 5-6 inches in diameter, iron, pottery, brick
(White Corsicana), tile, bottles dating to approximately 1910, and glass shards with maker’s
marks (Kerr Glass Manufacturing Company, Sand Springs). The initial research potential was
interpreted as fair, supported by the presence of a one-foot-high historic trash midden. Based
on archival research, the Kerr Glass Company relocated to Sand Springs, Oklahoma in 1913.
During the 2011 IPL Site 41HE223 revisit, AmaTerra archeologists noted that the site was misplotted (see Figure 9.139). The centroid, illustrated within the Atlas database is approximately
150 meters west of its actual location (interestingly, archeologists located a historic-age isolated
find (C1094IF1) at the Atlas-plotted site location; see below). Archeologists noted that the
site area (east of the THC Atlas mapped location) has been heavily altered since its original
recording. Today, the log cabin and the trash midden are no longer present. All that exists in
this area is a surficial, low-density historic artifact scatter and an approximately 20 x 30-foot
wide depression roughly one foot deep. The only artifacts observed on the surface were within
the eroding depression and consist of a light scattering of debris (n=<20) similar to those noted
in the 1974 recording: scrap iron, historic ceramics, and clear glass. Archeologists excavated
six shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE223 (E961, F935, C940, OT1, OT2,
and OT3), all of which were devoid of cultural materials. Despite thorough inspection, no
evidence of the log cabin (or any logs) could be found.
From available information, Site 41HE223 is interpreted to be a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century domestic site that has been completely disturbed. As a result of the destructive activities
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

the site lacks integrity and is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. These
interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be
required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected
in the site vicinity.
41HE224
Site 41HE224, previously recorded by archeologists from SMU as part of the Tennessee
Colony Project in 1974, is a prehistoric artifact scatter. Occupying an area of approximately
200 x 200 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated on a circular bluff at the
intersection of Cedar Creek and an unnamed drainage. Local vegetation consists of grasses,
opportunistic-growth weeds in the plowed fields, hardwoods and riparian scrub along the creek
bank. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Gladewater
clay frequently flooded and Eufaula fine sand with 1–8 percent slopes. Observations from
neighboring shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 10 centimeters of silty sandy loam
(7.5YR 4/3) overlying 70 centimeters of sandy loam (7.5YR 5/4). At the time of its first
recording it was acknowledged that the site was heavily disturbed as a result of gravel and sand
quarry operations, as well as plowing.
At the time of the site’s initial recording, identified artifacts included lithics (e.g., debitage
and cores), groundstone (e.g., hammerstone, mano, and metate), three plain ceramic sherds,
a fire cracked rock concentration, and a projectile point believed to be an Archaic Gary point.
The mapped site centroid is recorded just outside of the IPL survey corridor, but archeologists
intensively evaluated the survey corridor within the site’s vicinity for additional components.
AmaTerra archeologists found no evidence of the site.
Site 41HE224 does not exist within the IPL survey corridor. Archeologists, unable to assess
the resource described by SMU, are unable to make a recommendation regarding SAL or
NRHP eligibility at this time. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and
if, a Future Action route is selected within the site’s vicinity.
41HE299
Site 41HE299, previously recorded by SMU in 1976, is a multi-component site consisting of
a supposed steamboat wreck and a newly-added prehistoric component. SMU archeologists
recorded the site solely as a steamboat wreck site. Occupying an area of approximately 88 x
500 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated within the broad, open Trinity River
floodplain in a relic oxbow (Figure 9.106). Local vegetation consists of short grasses with
hardwoods along the periphery. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the
site vicinity are a Trinity clay, frequently flooded. Observations from site trenching efforts
revealed a typical soil column of 30 centimeters of sandy clay loam (10YR 4/3) on top of
30–70 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 3/2) on top of 70–140 centimeters of clay (10YR
3/1) on top of 140–190 centimeters of clay (10YR 2/1). Modern disturbances include heavy
agricultural use of the area.

According to the 1976 site
records,
41HE299
was
marked as the approximate
location of a steamboat
wreck reported to surveyors
by the landowner. Beyond
basic locational data, no
formal investigations were
conducted that could verify
if the wreck existed at this
location (or any other location
along the river) and no further
work was recommended for
the site.
During the current field
investigations, archeologists
did not find any evidence of
a buried steamboat within
the survey corridor, but did
expand Site 41HE299 to
encompass a broad, diffuse
assemblage of prehistoric
occupational materials and
manuports deeply buried
within several Trinity River
floodplain trenches, dug
along the now-abandoned
southern crossing (Figure
9.107). Trench locations and
general setting are provided
in detail in the Backhoe
Trenching section above.
However, an additional
discussion
of
Backhoe
Trenches

and
602T6 (Figure 9.47–9.57) is
provided below.

Figure 9.106. Overview of Site 41HE299 vicinity and flat terrain.

Figure 9.107. Plan map of Site 41HE299.

Within Backhoe Trench 602-1, archeologists observed a small cluster of burned quartzite
and burned clay at approximately 140 cmbs and a manuport cobble immediately below the
burned quartzite. At approximately 200 cmbs, archeologists noted a small collection of mussel
shells with a diffuse scatter of out-of-place gravels and lithic flakes that are likely culturallygenerated (Figure 9.108). Within Trench 602-2, excavated approximately 200 meters to the
east, archeologists encountered a small mussel shell lens in the trench’s northwest wall, this

time at a depth of 240 to 270 cmbs (Figure
9.109). Mussel shells were also observed
in Backhoe Trench 602-6 at a depth of 157
cmbs. In all instances, the observed items
and/or lenses are found in isolation of one
another with no clearly culturally-generated
debris (debitage, tools, features, etc.) and
attribution to prehistoric occupations is
tentative. With that said, according to
the consulting geomorphologist (Brittany
Gregory personal communication), the
mussel shells observed within Trenches
602-2 and 6 are channel species that should
not naturally be found on the non-relicchannel floodplain. The shells, therefore,
had to be brought to the site area, presumably
by prehistoric site occupants. The artifacts
observed west of the relic oxbow are found
within the Sanger alloformation sediments
that date to the Archaic period.
East of the oxbow remnant, site components
continue as archeologists observed the
eastern-most terminus of Site 41HE299
within Backhoe Trench 602-3. At this
location, approximately 40 meters east
of the relic channel, monitors recorded
a small (approximately 100-centimeter
diameter) cluster of bone and burned clay
at approximately 80 cmbs and a second
bone cluster and one piece of burned clay
approximately 50 centimeters deeper
(Figure 9.110). The observed bone
fragments from the upper cluster were found
to be thick and vascular (mammal) and flat
suggesting rib bones while the lower ones
were more fragmentary and difficult to
identify (Figures 9.111 and 9.112). None
of the bones appeared to be human and are
more likely associated with medium-sized
game mammals such as deer. Again, no
formal tools or clearly-defined features were
observed in this portion of the site.

According to Brittany Gregory (personal
communication) all observed archeological
materials within Site 41HE299 lie within Pilot
Point alloformation sediments that extend
three meters below the surface. West of
the relic oxbow, culturally-viable sediments
extend much deeper. Additional occupational
lenses are likely to be found throughout the
floodplain area and extensive additional
investigations through backhoe trenching
would be warranted in this area if IPLrelated impacts were anticipated. The final
proposed permanent easement is, however,
located farther north, away from the mapped
boundary of 41HE299. The site is not likely
to be impacted by proposed construction and
additional fieldwork is not warranted at this
time. If future regulated projects pass in the
site vicinity, additional field investigations
are strongly recommended to fully assess the
site’s SAL/NRHP eligibility.

Site 41HE342 is a previously-recorded prehistoric occupation site. The site consists of lithic
flakes, cores, and FCR primarily scattered across the ground surface (Figures 9.113. and
9.114). There are no records available through the online Sites Atlas indicating who recorded
Site 41HE342 or what components of the site were present at the time of their initial recording.
During the IPL-related revisit, the site was found occupying an area of approximately 80 x 25

meters (north/south x east/west),
while situated on a low-lying,
largely inundated terrace within
the Cedar Creek floodplain that
is likely a relic creek bank. Local
vegetation consists of older
growth hardwood trees with a
relatively clear understory of
grass, leaf litter, palmetto, and
other small shrubs. Overall,
surface visibility was estimated
at approximately 50 percent
with some areas (deer feeder)
retaining 100 percent visibility.
According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within
the vicinity are a Gladewater
clay that experiences frequent
flooding. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 40 centimeters
of clay (10YR 4/2) overlying
subsoil. Shovel tests typically
terminated at 60 cmbs. Modern
disturbances were observed
and include animal grazing
activities.
Surficial manifestations of Site
41HE342 include a scatter of
lithic debris measuring 15 meters
in diameter, observed near a
deer feeder, where animal foot
traffic has exposed a bare ground
surface. However, archeologists
did note the presence of surficial
lithic debris extending for
another 30 meters north and
south of the feeder area (see
Figure 9.89). Artifacts observed
around the deer feeder consist
of chert flakes, quartzite cores,
and burned rock (Figure 9.115).
No prehistoric ceramics were
observed within the site area. No

other artifacts were recorded
outside of the site boundary,
although it is likely that

present on the terrace farther
south, outside of the IPL

excavated
eight shovel tests during their
investigations of Site 41HE342
(OT1, OT2, OT3, A1, B2, B3,

these, one shovel test (OT2)
contained a single novaculite

deeper deposits.
41HE368
Site 41HE368 is a buried prehistoric lithic scatter consisting of quartzite and chert debitage.
The site extends across the entire survey corridor (north to south) within abandoned Segment
17. Site 41HE368’s northern and southern termini were defined by the edge of the IPL survey
corridor and archeologists at the time were not permitted to chase the site beyond the 450-foot
boundary. Occupying an area of approximately 150 x 80 meters (north/south x east/west), the
site is situated on a raised western terrace edge leading to a drainage slope of the Trinity River
(Figures 9.117 and 9.118). Local vegetation consists of short planted grass, sparse oak trees on
the western slope, and a mixed riparian scrub along the river bank which marks the site’s western
boundary. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 50 percent. According to
the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Styx loamy fine sand above a
sandy loam alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mixed sources. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 50 centimeters
of sandy loam (10YR 4/3)
overlying 10 centimeters
of sandy clay (10YR 6/6)
overlying clay interpreted
as sterile subsoil. Shovel
tests typically terminated
at 70 cmbs. Subsurface
disturbances appear shallow
and moderate in intensity
with evidence for agricultural
seeding and plowing.

Evidence suggests that this is the
northern fringe of a larger site that
originates south of the survey corridor
and follows the eastern T2 terrace of the
Trinity River. The integrity of recorded
subsurface material is moderate.
Cultural material recorded in the upper
levels of shovel tests may be mixed due
to modern agricultural activity, while
some cultural material recorded between
40 and 60 cmbs indicates artifacts have
moved down from their original location
through the sandy matrix, ultimately
resting on top of compact clay.
Due to the lack of diagnostics, distinct
tool assemblages, and formal features,

41HE368’s age and function from the
data gathered during survey. Though the
site lacks diagnostics or features, it does bear some evidence for organic preservation through
the abundant charcoal observed, while the overall density of prehistoric artifacts is relatively
high. Overall, additional investigations are warranted in order to make a formal assessment
of SAL/NRHP eligibility, but such investigations are not warranted in this case as the site is
located outside of the proposed 150-foot IPL permanent easement. Accordingly, no further
work is recommended at this time. If regulated construction is proposed within or near the site
vicinity, additional survey and/or testing at Site 41HE368 are recommended.
41HE370/371
Site 41HE370/41HE371 is a multi-component historic and prehistoric site consisting of a
subsurface prehistoric lithic and charcoal scatter, a historic road, and a historic house site located
along the Future Action survey route (Figures 9.120 and 9.121). Initially, the two sites were
assumed to be separate and were recorded individually, but after further investigation, Sites
41HE370 and 41HE371 have been combined into one site trinomial (41HE371). Occupying
an area of approximately 200 x 500 meters (north/south x east/west), the prehistoric component
of the site is located on a cluster of pimple mounds and terraces interspersed with low swales
to the east and an old creek drainage to the west. The historic component is located within
the site’s northern and western boundary, along an abandoned and largely overgrown road
(see below). Local vegetation consists of tall grasses. Overall, site visibility was estimated at
10 percent due to the survey area’s lush carpet of pasture grasses and clover. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are an Axtell loam, clayey alluvium of
Quaternary age derived from mixed sources. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a
typical soil column of 100 centimeters sand (10YR 4/4) throughout most of the site. Typically,
shovel tests terminated between 100 and 120 cmbs. Modern disturbances are minimal with the

Trinidad, but was in disrepair when he bought the property in 1955. The road is approximately
20 feet wide and delineated by trees, mostly oak and hickory approximately 50 years old
with a few scattered oak trees estimated at 75–100 years of age. A surface scatter of historic
materials was also observed to the north along a tributary creek drainage. The surface scatter
included multiple types of historic artifacts: tan “FERRIS” bricks; two enamelware bowls—

Figure 9.122. Sample of prehistoric
artifacts recovered from Site 41HE371.

Archeologists excavated 98 shovel tests
during their investigation of Site 41HE371
(Table 9.20). Of these, 27 contained
artifacts, including both prehistoric and
historic materials. Prehistoric artifacts were
recorded throughout the soil column, from 0
to 100 cmbs. It should be noted that FCR and
carbon were located well below 100 cmbs,
with shovel tests unable to reach the base of
quaternary sediments through shovel testing
alone. Shovel tests collectively contained 55
lithic flakes composed of jasper, quartzite,
and chert, one piece of angular debitage,
four pieces of FCR, and one piece of carbon.
Within the site’s prehistoric occupation
area, archeologists noted two distinct lenses
of artifacts containing small lithic flakes
between 20 and 80 cmbs, while FCR was
noted between 40 and 80 cmbs. The density
and depth of deposits, however, suggest that
these resources are likely present in untested
portions of the site as well. Though no
features were observed in any of the shovel
tests excavated, broad exposures from
backhoe trenches (particularly in this sandy
soil) would be more successful in finding
them.

The site’s historic subsurface components
were consistent with the surficial materials,
with concentrations noted around a likely

compact soils that are consistent with a
regularly-travelled road, and one shard of green glass between 20 and 40 cmbs. Shovel Tests
F318, OT1, OT10C2, OT12C2, OT77, and OT80 also contained historic cultural materials.
Within these tests, archeologists found a relatively high density of historic domestic debris that
would suggest a house once stood nearby. In this area, shovel tests collectively contained two
brick fragments, one old hook, one brown glass medicine bottle, five clear glass shards, two

A house built along this historic Malakoff

location with easy access to either town in
the early 1900’s.
The road is plainly visible in a 1958 aerial
photograph of the site area (Figure 9.126)
though beyond that element, no other
historic-age aspects of the site can be seen.
A darkened area in the open field in the

be used to refine the age though such
investigations were not conducted. The

41HE372
Site 41HE372 is a buried high-density prehistoric site dating from the Late Prehistoric through
the Caddo periods. The site is located on a small knoll in the middle of a pasture between Walnut
Creek to the south and the remnants of an old oxbow to the north within the southern portion
of an IPL evaluation corridor alternative. The site occupies an area approximately 50 meters
in diameter (Figure 9.127, 9.128, and 9.129). Local vegetation consists of short, mixed grasses
on the knoll and pasture land with heavy trees and brush along the creek banks. Overall, surface
visibility was estimated at approximately 25–30 percent with mixed grasses and wildflowers
the most common obstructions. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the
site vicinity are a Nahatche loam, frequently flooded, loamy alluvium of Holocene age derived
from mixed sources. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of
120 centimeters of uniform sandy loam (10YR 6/4). Modern disturbances include various
agricultural activities.
Cultural materials identified at Site 41HE372 include were limited to subsurface contexts
with archeologists recovering more than 200 individual artifacts (Figures 9.130 and 9.131).
Archeologists excavated a total 11 shovel tests during their investigations at Site 41HE372
(A145, B154, C152, and OT4-OT11; Table 9.21; Figure 9.127). All of the shovel tests dug
within the site boundary contained cultural material. Artifacts were found throughout the site
area with two distinct high-concentration lenses. The first lens of artifacts was noted in most of
the shovel tests from a depth of 20–60 cmbs (60 centimeters being the deepest any pottery was
found). The second concentration was excavated from a depth of 80–120 cmbs with artifacts
declining in number between 120 and 140 cmbs.
As can be seen in Table 9.21, the overwhelming majority of artifacts observed are various
lithic flakes (n=129), burned rock (n=34), and bone fragments (n=120); generally vascular
long bone fragments; likely of a medium sized mammal such as a deer. Archeologists recorded
two bifacial tools during excavations, as well as one complete Catahoula point from Shovel
Test OT11 (20-40 cmbs) and one unidentifiable point fragment from Shovel Test C152 (40–60
cmbs). Additionally, archeologists observed a single bifacially-worked lithic flake that was
interpreted as a biface fragment. Observed debitage represented a variety of reduction stages
from primary flakes to finished tools, including modified flakes and likely burins. The majority,
however, were identified as secondary and tertiary flakes and flake tools with only a small
proportion of early reduction stage examples noted. An abundance of petrified wood identified
in many of the shovel tests is considered partially naturally occurring, as well as culturallydeposited as numerous flakes were produced from petrified wood and several other specimens
were burned. Additionally, burned rock was found to be limited to similar vertical lenses
described above. Only two ceramics were noted at the site: a sandy tempered parallel incised
sherd (approximately 7mm thick) excavated between 40 and 60 cmbs in Shovel Test OT7, and
one fingernail punctated utilityware sherd (reddish, grog-tempered paste, also approximately
7 mm thick), excavated between 20 and 40 cmbs in Shovel Test B154 (Figure 9.132). With
such a small proportion of prehistoric ceramics, it is likely that the site’s Caddo component is
a minor one.

While no thermal features were found while excavating shovel tests, the amount of fire cracked
rock and the general density of the prehistoric occupation suggests that such resources are
present within the site boundary in unexcavated areas.
From available information (e.g., diagnostic projectile point and ceramics) Site 41HE372 is
assumed to have been occupied as late as the Caddo and as early as the Early Late Prehistoric
periods as an open campsite overlooking Walnut Creek. The site is likely eligible for SAL
and NRHP status due the amount of artifacts, preservation of faunal material and charcoal,
and the density of burned rock though formal NRHP/SAL evaluation testing is recommended

41HE373
Site 41HE373 is a diffuse, subsurface.
prehistoric lithic scatter within a
survey corridor alternative (Figures
9.133 and 9.134). Occupying an
area of approximately 140 x 180
meters (north/south x east/west), the
site is located along the lower edge
of the southward-rising slope of a
hill at the confluence of two creek
branches. Local vegetation consists
of mixed grasses with mesquite and
cedar scrub around the edges of the
slope. Overall, surface visibility
was estimated at approximately 20
percent. According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within the
site vicinity are a Nahatche Loam,
frequently flooded, of Holocene age
derived from mixed sources. Shovel
tests on the site tend to vary in their
soil composition. Observations from
site shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 50 centimeters of
sandy loam (10YR 4/4) overlying
10 centimeters of silty clay (10YR
5/3 and 7.5YR 5/8) overlying 10+
centimeters of clay (7.5YR 5/8) that
was interpreted as sterile subsoil.
Within the smaller drainages on the
slope, the basal clay was found at a
much shallower depth of 10 to 20
cmbs. Modern disturbances in the
area include cattle grazing and a gas
pipeline that passes nearby.

these, eight shovel tests (A151,
B159, C158, OT10-OT13, and
OT17) tested positive for prehistoric
artifacts with the majority of cultural
material in the upper 40 centimeters
(see Table 9.22). With the exception
of one artifact, all flakes are late
reduction stage examples made of
quartzite and chert (Figure 9.135).

Figure 9.135. Sample of lithic artifacts recovered from
Site 41HE373 during archeological investigations.

Due to the low frequency of artifacts and the absence
of surface material and features, relatively little can
be deduced regarding the site’s function. Today, the
observed cultural material suggests an ephemeral
colluvially-buried lithic scatter eroding downslope
from a site that rests on a hilltop landform outside
of the IPL survey corridor. With the site being
located in secondary context, it is unlikely to yield
intact, significant deposits. Accordingly, the site is
recommended as ineligible for listing on the NRHP
or as a SAL and as no further work is recommended
at this time.

41HE374
Site 41HE374 is a newlyrecorded small, ephemeral
historic trash scatter likely
associated with a nearby
farmstead structure (Figures
9.136 and 9.137). Occupying
an area of approximately 50
x 35 meters (north/south x
east/west), the site is situated
on a small upland knoll along
a small terrace overlooking
a creek in a dense forest.
Local vegetation consists
of large oak trees and briar.
Overall, surface visibility
was estimated to be 26 to 50
percent moving across the
site area. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the site vicinity
are an Axtell loam, a clayey
alluvium of Quaternary age
derived from mixed sources.
Observations from site shovel
tests revealed a typical soil

of clay loam (5YR 5/6)
overlying dense clay (5YR

sterile subsoil. Shovel tests
terminated at varying depths
(20–80 cmbs). Modern
disturbances are extensive,
with bulldozing and blading
evident over the site area, as
well as multiple push piles
nearby.

2 unidentified earthenware
sherds, undecorated whiteware
sherds, a leather boot heel, and unidentifiable scrap metal (Figures 9.138 and 9.139). According to
Lockhart (2006), manganese-bleached/amethyst glass was in wide use across the United States as
early as the 1870s and waned dramatically with the introduction of automatic bottle machines
and the use of selenium (versus manganese) as a decolorization agent (1920s–1930s). With
artifacts lacking maker’s marks, the amethyst-bleached glass provides the only temporal
indication of site occupation (late nineteenth to early twentieth century). All artifacts were
found in push piles and/or are small and uniform in size suggesting that they were plowed over
multiple times.
Archeologists excavated 11 shovel tests during their investigations at Site 41HE374 (Shovel
Tests E300, E301, E302, B313, B314, F297, F298, F299, C316, C318 and C317), all of
which were devoid of cultural materials. According to the property’s current owner (personal
communication), a small house had been demolished to the north of the site many years ago.
The landowner has bladed over the area where the house once stood in an effort to clear a

path through the property. This information has led archeologists to conclude that the site is
associated with the house described by the current property owner. The artifacts either represent
a small trash scatter or were brought to the area by the tractor during road construction or house
demolition.
According to the Henderson County Clerk’s Office records, the parcel is included in the J.C.
Neill Survey (Abstract 577, Tract 15). While the property changed hands occasionally from
the present to 1970 (Volume 2131, pg 831; 1977, Volume 804, pg 86), prior to that date, the
land remained in the Hansel family, presumably into the nineteenth century. The land, called
the “Hansel Block” in deed records prior to 1970, was willed by H.F. Hansel to his son, Louis
in January of 1917 (Volume 91, pg. 462), who retained ownership until it was sold out of
the family to Richard Holland in 1970 (Volume 648, pg. 217). With amethyst-bleached glass
among the artifact assemblage, it is most likely that this site can be attributed to this Hansel
family and more specifically to either H.F. or Louis Hansel. The house referred-to by the current
landowner, was likely occupied by either (or both) of these individuals. No Hansels are included
in any of the Henderson County U.S. Census records from 1880 through 1940. Also, none of
the Hansels’ names returned
results during a search of the
Handbook of Texas Online
or TexGenWeb sites.
Archeologists inspected a
1947 aerial photograph of
the site area for evidence of
standing structures. While
no buildings or ancillary
structures were observed, a
prominent dirt road is visible
leading to the site area from
the north, terminating at the
northern edge of the site
(Figure 9.140). The dirt
road forms a driving loop at
this northern terminus which
likely serviced a house that
once stood there (though
clearly long gone even as
early as 1947).
From available information,
Site 41HE374 is considered
to be a destroyed, minor
historic trash scatter that
(from the amethyst-bleached
glass shards) dates to the late

nineteenth or early twentieth century. The site is likely associated with the Hansel family,
who were early immigrants into the region, but are not considered historically significant.
According to the current landowner, the house was located outside of the IPL survey corridor,
indicating that the observed artifacts are likely out of context. Accordingly, Site 41HE374 is
considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. These interpretations are considered
preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project
impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the vicinity of the site.
41HE375
Site 41HE375 is a very small, buried prehistoric ceramic and lithic scatter. The site is located
within a northern Future Action survey alternative. Occupying an area of approximately 6 x
5 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated along a wooded slope on a large finger
ridge that originates south of the survey corridor and overlooks a prominent creek toward the
east (Figures 9.141 and 9.142). Local vegetation consists of a mix of old live oak and pine
trees with a few dense patches of smaller undergrowth brush. Overall, surface visibility was
less than 10 percent due to dense
accumulations of leaf litter
and deadfall. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils
within the site vicinity are a
Cuthbert Series, which is a fine
sandy loam of Holocene age
derived from mixed sources. The
Cuthbert Series is typified by
approximately 20 centimeters of
Holocene sandy deposits over a
hard-pan clay layer. Observations
from site shovel tests revealed
a typical soil column of 50
centimeters of sandy loam (10YR
5/2) overlying clay loam (2.5YR
5/3) of Pleistocene age. Shovel
testing generally terminated
at 60–80 cmbs. The increased
thickness of sandy deposits at
Site 41HE375 is likely the result
of colluvial deposition across
the site. Modern disturbance
is minimal with the land used
primarily for hunting with the
greatest disturbances attributed

Site 41HE375 consists entirely
of
subsurface
prehistoric
materials located within a small,
isolated area. Negative shovel
tests served to delineate the
site’s boundary. Archeologists
excavated 11 shovel tests
during their investigation at
Site 41HE375 (E298 and OT110; Table 9.23). Of these, two
(E298 and 1OT8) contained
cultural materials between 0 and
60 cmbs. In Shovel Test E298,
two prehistoric utilityware body
sherds (one plain and burnished

brushed, approximately 6 mm
thick) were recorded, as well
as one late stage chert flake
(Figures 9.143–9.144). In Shovel Test OT8 a single piece of decorated utilityware ceramic,
measuring four centimeters in diameter and seven millimeters thick, was recorded at a depth
of 0–20 cmbs. The exterior of the ceramic is incised with numerous parallel lines forming a
triangle design with possible burnishing.
Site 41HE375 is considered to be a small, isolated scatter of late Prehistoric (Caddo) ceramics
with a single flake. Lacking a dense, interpretable artifact assemblage or associated features,
the site is not, from survey data, considered to be NRHP or SAL-eligible. Additional, more
substantial, site components may be found beyond the survey corridor that could positively
contribute to the site’s significance. These interpretations are considered preliminary and
additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource
once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the vicinity of the site.

route. Occupying an area of approximately 100 x 50 meters
(east/west x north/south), the site is situated on top of a
large ridgeline landform that rises approximately 10 meters above two surrounding drainages
(Figures 9.145 and 9.146). The drainage to the east has a gentle slope while the drainage to the
west is steeper and has a 300 meter long floodplain and swamp. Local vegetation consists of an
oak and pine forest along the northern periphery and a grassy cattle pasture that encompasses
the site to the south. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 20 percent due
to the mixed grasses. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity
are a Wolfpen loamy fine sand, loamy residuum. Observations from site shovel tests revealed
a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of sand (10YR 4/4) overlying 40 centimeters of clay
(5YR 5/8). Shovel tests were terminated between 20 and 80 cmbs, due to variation in the depth
of the sterile clay layer. Modern disturbances are minimal.
Cultural materials identified include prehistoric ceramic sherds, a lithic flake, and three cut
nails (the latter all from a single shovel test). No features, or indications thereof, were observed
within the site boundary. Archeologists excavated 14 shovel tests during their investigations at
Site 41HE376 ( B183, C181, C182, C324, D316, D317, E302, F284, OT1-6; Table 9.24). Of
these, six shovel tests (C181, E302, F284, OT1, OT2, and OT4) were positive (Figures 9.147–
149). Prehistoric resources observed were predominantly found between 40 and 60 cmbs. The
recorded prehistoric artifact assemblage consists of one chert flake, six plain ware sherds, one
incised possible rim sherd, two parallel-brushed utilityware sherds, and occasional charcoal.
Ceramics were typically sand paste of red to tan color with the two parallel-brushed examples
composed of a darker gray color. Sherds were 7–9 millimeters thick with a prominent dark
band in the center, suggesting a period of reduction firing (Figure 9-148).

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

The historic site component is
found entirely within Shovel Test
C181, which included three cut
nails between 60 and 80 cmbs. It
is important to note that the cut
nails are below two prehistoric
ceramics that were recorded
from the 40–60-centimeter
level.
This indicates that
some of the site, particularly
on the upper ridgeline of the
landform on which this test was
excavated, has been disturbed.
Archeologists briefly compared
the recorded site boundary to
a 1946 aerial photograph and
found no evidence of a structure
or structural remnant in the site
vicinity, suggesting that such a
structure was long destroyed
before
the
mid-twentieth
century, or the nails are out of
context. The remaining shovel
tests were devoid of cultural
materials.
Though archeologists did not
encounter any particularly dense
accumulations of prehistoric
materials, nor could they find
any features, the relatively large
complement of artifacts and its
location on an occupationallyadvantageous landform overlooking two creeks suggests
that additional site materials
may be found nearby that were
not included in the IPL-related
survey. These interpretations
are considered preliminary and
additional coordination and/
or survey may be required to
assess project impacts to the
resource once, and if, a Future

Site 41HE378 is a broad, diffuse,
deeply-buried prehistoric artifact
scatter of debitage and charcoal
with a small possibly-historic-age
component. The site is located
within one of the Future Action
survey corridors. Occupying an
area of approximately 50 x 250
meters (north/south x east/west),
the site is situated on a low terrace
landform overlooking a narrow

horse pasture (Figures 9.150).
Local vegetation consists of
mixed grasses and scattered trees. Overall, surface visibility was estimated to be zero percent
due to the amount of grasses blanketing the site. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey,
soils within the site vicinity are Pickton loamy fine sand and loamy residuum. Observations
from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 100 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR
7/4). Based on USDA soil data, sterile subsoils are typically found at 106 cmbs in this area,
just beyond shovel tests’ terminus. An adjacent county road has likely destroyed approximately
a third of the site as shovel tests were routinely positive nearest to the roadway (see below).
Additionally, a small private drive may have also negatively impacted some components.
Archeologists excavated 13 shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE378 (A365,
A366, A367, A368, A369, B347, B348, B349, C388, C389,and OT1-3; Table 9.25). Of these,
seven shovel tests (A365, A366, A367, A368, A369, B347, and B348) contained cultural
materials consisting of lithic flakes, charcoal, and brown bottle glass. Lithic artifacts were
recorded between 40 and 100 cmbs, while carbon was recorded between 0 and 40 cmbs.
Shovel Test A367 contained six brown bottle glass shards (0–20 cmbs) that, though possibly
of historic age, are likely modern trash (Figure 9.151). All other shovel tests were devoid of
cultural materials.
Due to a lack of artifacts and the absence of features little, can be deduced from the data
gathered from survey alone regarding the site’s function or research potential . Observed
cultural material suggests an ephemeral, deeply-buried lithic scatter that could have been
a single-occupation prehistoric campsite. Additional investigations are warranted if future
projects are proposed for the site vicinity to fully assess the site’s SAL and/or NRHP potential.
These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey
may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the site vicinity.

41HE379
Site 41HE379 is a newly-recorded, small
historic farmstead remnant. The site consists of
subsurface household and construction debris, a
cement-lined well (Feature 1), and a brick pile
(Feature 2). Occupying an area of approximately
25 x 30 meters (north/south x east/west), the site
extends down a hill and into the bottom lands of
Pierce Creek (Figure 9.152 and 9.153). Local
vegetation consists of oak and dense riparian
scrub and brush. Overall, surface visibility was
estimated at approximately 20 percent with
grasses and leaf litter being the most common
obstructions. According to the USDA’s Web
Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are
a Cuthbert fine sandy loam, clayey residuum.

loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 15 centimeters of
sandy clay (5YR 8/3) overlying a hardpan clay
(5YR 8/3) interpreted as sterile subsoil. Shovel
tests typically terminated at 40 cmbs. Archeologists documented modern disturbances of
general agricultural use and structure demolition.
Archeological materials observed on the surface at Site 41HE379 include ten clear glass
shards, one stoneware sherd, and one green checkered transfer whiteware sherd. Additionally,
archeologists documented a partially-collapsed cylindrical cement-lined brick well, recorded as
Feature 1, near the site’s centroid standing approximately 32 inches above the surrounding grade
(Figure 9.154). The diameter of the well-mouth is approximately 40 inches and is encircled
by a hog wire fence that was likely installed at a later date. Where observed, the bricks were
stamped with “Globe”, which can be attributed to the Globe Pressed Brick Company of Ferris,
Texas, which was in operation between 1905 and 1923 (bricknames.com 2012). The well’s outer
cement face has been inscribed, presumably by the site’s occupant, with the date of “Aug 29

condition, with the exception of a
few large cracks. The bricks are
all uniform (4 x 8 x 2 1/4 inches)
in size and range in color from red
to orange to grey. At least in the
above-ground portions of the well,
the interior face was not cementlined with the well composed of
exposed brick courses. A brick

observed approximately 45 feet to
the southeast of Feature 1. Feature

name “Standard” (Figure 9.155).
The “Standard” bricks are attributed to the Standard Brick Company of nearby Palmer, Texas,
which was in operation from 1902 to 1929 before changing their name to the Barron Brick
Company (bricknames.com 2012). It is unclear what purpose this feature served as it is too
small to have been a structure and may simply be a dump pile from a razed structural component
somewhere else outside of the survey area.

indicates that the site likely represents
an early to mid-twentieth century
home site that has been destroyed.
Archeologists reviewed 1947 aerial
photography of the area and found
that the site’s true components and
function are clearly visible. As can be
seen in Figure 9.157, Site 41HE379
corresponds to a modest cross-gabled
residence and an associated barn

mark on the bottom of the glass artifact.
Feature 1, the well, is located closer
to the pen than the house, suggesting
that it provided water for livestock
(though functional/accessible necessity may have dictated its positioning as well). The small
brick scatter atop the 4 x 6-foot concrete slab (Feature 2) are located near the northern house
wall and likely correspond to a chimney. Additional structural elements visible in the photo
were not observed during field investigations.
Deed research into past property owners suggests that the site is likely associated with the
Crews family, more particularly Clifford (C. D.) Crews. According to the Henderson County
deed records, as early as 1903, a C. D. Crews began permitting multiple easements through the
parcel (Tract 109C of the R. Hunter survey) to various entities including Henderson County
(Volume 55, pg. 584) and Texas Power and Light (Volume 174, pg. 321). Crews and his wife,
Willie, continued to retain the property until February of 1946, when the land was sold to an
Arthur Bristow (Volume 298, pg. 624) who would eventually sell the land to an Alton Berryhill,
who would ultimately transfer the land to the current owner in 2008 (Volume 2906, pg. 205).
With an early-to-mid-twentieth century artifact assemblage and a brick lined well feature dated
to August of 1944, two years prior to its sale to Arthur Bristow, the site can be safely associated
with Mr. Crews and his wife. Archival research suggests the Crews family were among the
earliest landowners in LaRue, Texas. C. D. (Clifford) Crews owned a lumber store in LaRue
during the early twentieth century (Corder 1989). In the 1930 U.S. Census, he is listed as a
53-year old farmer married to a Willie Crews (age 48) with two daughters: Bonnie (age 23) and
Stella (age 21). It is unclear if Mrs. Crews passed away and Clifford remarried prior to 1946
as a Lelah Crews presided over the land sale to Mr. Bristow. It is possible that Lelah is C. D.’s
sister as she is listed in the same area as then-widowed Willie Crews, at 59 years of age in the
1940 Census. The Crews family is not considered to be historically significant.
From available information, Site 41HE379 is considered to be the remnants of an early-tomid-twentieth century historic house site. All extant features are in moderate to poor condition
while observed artifacts are diffuse and generally very common among sites of this type in the
region. No formal structural features could be found within the vicinity of the site, although
a well (Feature 1) likely serviced livestock and possibly the main residence. Feature 2, the
scattered brick pile with concrete slab, corresponds to the house’s northern wall and likely is

the remnant of the structure’s chimney. Lacking dense, functionally distinct artifact clusters
and being composed of only two minor features, it is unlikely that new data can be extracted
from the site. The site lacks integrity and is not known to be associated with an individual or
event of historical significance. Accordingly, Site 41HE379 is considered ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and
if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.

41HE381
Site 41HE381 is a prehistoric open campsite consisting of an isolated cluster of prehistoric
lithic debitage and a single prehistoric ceramic sherd. The site is located in the southern portion
of an IPL survey corridor along the Future Action route. Occupying an area of approximately
50 x 70 meters (north/south x east/west) and rising two to three meters above the prevailing
low flat grade, the site is situated on a pimple mound overlooking Coon Creek (Figure 9.158
and 9.159). Local vegetation consists of tall grasses in an otherwise dense riparian woodland.
Despite being recorded in a summer of historic drought, a spring was found flowing from the
cut bank of one of the Coon Creek tributaries a short distance to the north. This could have
served as a permanent water source and likely contributed to occupation in the area. According
to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Pickton loamy fine sand
with 1–8 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of
40 centimeters of sand (10YR 6/5) overlying 20 centimeters of mottled sandy clay (10YR 6/3
and 10YR 5/5). Typically, shovel tests terminated at a depth of 100 cmbs. Modern disturbances
(if any) are considered minimal in this area.
Archeologists excavated six shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE381 (B526,
C608, and OT2–OT5; Table 9.27). Of these, two shovel tests (B526 and C608) contained
cultural material (Figure 9.160). Shovel Test C608 contained one tertiary chert flake located
between 40 and 60 cmbs. Shovel Test B526 contained one chert flake located between 0 and 20
cmbs and one undecorated grayish tan ceramic rim sherd (approximately 6 mm thick, temper
undetermined) between 20 and 40 cmbs. The tertiary flake from Shovel Test B526 may also
have served as a punch or burin given a prominent pointed edge. The artifacts from lower
elevations were all found directly above the soil transition from the upper soft sand to the lower
mottled orange and gray sandy clay subsoil. All other shovel tests were devoid of cultural
material.
Though archeologists did not encounter particularly artifact-rich contexts within Site 41HE381,
the prevailing significance of sites on similar landforms in similar contexts near plentiful water
suggests that significant site components are likely to be found if additional, more extensive
field investigations are conducted. These interpretations are considered preliminary and
additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource
once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE382
Site 41HE382 is a prehistoric open campsite containing a lithic flake and five prehistoric
ceramic sherds. Occupying an area of approximately 61 x 30 meters (north/south x east/west),
the site is situated on a small finger ridge extending north, above a small floodplain (see Figure
9.152, Figure 9.161). Local vegetation consists of mixed grasses with a small grove of cross
timbers. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Cuthbert
fine sandy loam with 8–20 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 80 centimeters of sand (10YR 4/4). Typically, shovel tests terminated at a depth
of 80 cmbs. Wood push piles led field archeologists to estimate that approximately 25 percent
of the site has been disturbed.

Archeologists excavated nine shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41HE382
(A19, B18, C26, and OT1-OT6; Table 9.28). Of these, four shovel tests were positive for
archeological material (A19, C26, OT5, and OT6; Figure 9.162). Shovel Tests OT5, OT6, and
A19 contained undecorated and incised utility ware ceramic sherds between 40 and 80 cmbs.
Though the recorder did not specify thickness or temper, artifact photographs indicate the
sherds were dark gray in color approximately seven millimeters thick. Lastly, a chert flake was
excavated between 40 and 60 cmbs in Shovel Test C26. Archeologists found no temporally
diagnostic tools or features during their investigations at the site, nor were there indications of
organic preservation.

Site 41HE382 likely represents a briefly-occupied open prehistoric campsite. The site lacks
diagnostics and distinguishable features, is limited in size, and has suffered from extensive
modern disturbance. Current survey could not conclusively define the significance of Site
41HE382 and investigators recommend the resource’s NRHP/SAL eligibility to be considered
undetermined at this time. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and

steps (Feature 2) are also present at the site,
presumably leading to a house that has been
demolished. The well is located about 500 feet
west of the historic artifact scatter. The property
owner reported that after a hard rain, flowers,
including daylillies, sprout in the woods where
the historic scatter was first observed.

Archeologists excavated fifteen shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE383 (C573,
C574, D536, D537, D538, E521, E523, E533, F519, F520, OT1-OT5; Table 9.29). Of these,
five shovel tests (E523, F520, and OT1-OT3) contained historic-age artifacts, all from the
upper 20 centimeters of sediments. Recorded artifacts consist of wire nail (n=4), an amethyst
glass shard, an aqua glass shard, a brown glass shard, a scrap metal fragment, and a red brick
fragment.
Archeologists briefly compared the site’s finds to a 1947 aerial photograph and determined that
the areas of archeological deposits correspond to wooded portions of an otherwise plowed field
(Figure 9.167). The eastern portion of the site (away from the well) does include a two-track
road leading to the location of the steps and a possible structural remnant is visible, but that
remnant is either too small or in too poor of condition to be identified as a house or outbuilding.
With amethyst-bleached glass and aerial photos showing the site in poor condition in the
mid-twentieth century, Site 41HE383 can be interpreted as an early twentieth century former
residence with an associated household debris scatter. The site is in poor overall condition
and will not likely yield additional data through extensive field investigations. Accordingly,
Site 41HE383 is recommended as ineligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL at this time.
These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey
(including archival review) may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and
if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.

Site 41HE384 is a small prehistoric ceramic and lithic scatter within a Future Action survey
corridor (Figures 9.168 and 9.169). Occupying an area of approximately 35 x 14 meters (north/
south x east/west), the site is situated on a level bench near the apex of a prominent hilltop within
a mixed wooded area. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at approximately 0–10 percent.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site area are Pickton loamy fine sand
with 1–8 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of
sandy loam (10YR 8/1) to a depth of more than a meter. Surveyors did not note extensive modern
disturbance in the area.

Archeologists excavated 19 shovel tests during their investigation of Site 41HE384 (C550
and OT1-OT18; Table 9.30). Of these, three tests (C550, OT1, and OT4) contained
prehistoric archeological materials (Figures 9.170 and 9.171). Shovel Test OT1 contained
one undecorated ceramic sherd (approximately 6 mm thick and composed of a reddish tan,
sand-tempered paste) recorded between 0 and 20 cmbs. The sherd’s section suggests that it
is a plain bowl base. Shovel Test C550 contained eight pieces of incised ceramics with grog
temper measuring approximately nine millimeters thick between 20 and 40 cmbs. These sherds
were brown to grayish tan in color. Shovel Test OT4 contained two small tertiary chert flakes
excavated between 60 and 80 cmbs. Investigators encountered no features in any of the tests,
nor did they record any charcoal, burned organics, or soil discoloration that would suggest the
presence of features.

Site 41HE385 is the remnant
of a historic-period house
with an associated trash
scatter. The site consists of
varied historic-period glass,
ceramic, and metal trash
materials along with a scatter
of unidentified red brick
fragments (Figure 9.172 and
9.173). Occupying an area
of approximately 100 x 80
meters (north/south x east/
west), the site is situated
on a broad upland ridge.
Local vegetation consists
of live and post oaks with a
variety of other hardwoods
and an understory of mixed
grasses, yucca, cacti, and
leaf litter. Overall, surface
visibility was estimated at
approximately 40–50 percent
with higher visibility in areas
where trees and vegetation
were previously cleared.
According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils
within the site vicinity are a
Tonkawa fine sand with 1–5
percent slopes. Observations
from site shovel tests
revealed a typical soil column
of 12 centimeters of fine
sand (10YR 6/3) overlying
68 centimeters of (10YR
6/4) fine sand. Shovel tests
typically terminated at 80
cmbs. Modern disturbances
include vegetation clearing
and terrain grading.

Very little of Feature 1 remains,
which has made determining its

alignment consists of large oak trees. Based on the diameter of the oak trees, the alignment
appears to be older than approximately 75 years. This alignment of trees corresponds to a twotrack road that is visible on the USGS quads and in 1944 aerial photographs (see below), but
was not observed during the delineation of the site. Artifacts observed on the surface include

to be grouped into two distinct artifact clusters: a northern can scatter and a western glass and
ceramic scatter.

Seven shovel tests were excavated during the delineation of Site 41HE385 (C518, D480, E480,
OT1, OT2, OT3, and OT4; Table 9.31). Of these, two shovel tests (C518 and OT3) contained
cultural materials at an approximate depth of 20 to 80 cmbs. Subsurface artifacts are consistent
with materials observed on the surface: an unidentified nail, bailing wire, 10 orange paste brick
fragments, two brown and one clear glass shards, one white earthenware sherd, and a burned
peach pit. The upper 40 centimeters of Shovel Test OT3 exhibits evidence of burning, which
may be associated with the destruction of the site or possible activities associated with Feature
1 (chimney).

Archeologists
reviewed
1947 aerial photographs of
the site area and compared
them to the recorded site
boundary. As can be seen
in Figure 9.177, the site is
located at the crossroads of a
prominent two-track road to
the west and smaller singletrack trails to the south
and east. A large cluster of
trees near the site’s central,
eastern edge may correspond
to a former structure,
while an “L”-shaped right
angle is visible just south
of the small tree mott.
The linear arrangement
of trees observed in the
field correspond with the
edge of the two-track road
while Feature 1 is located
at the slight “L” visible on
the aerials. No standing
structures are observed in the
photograph, suggesting that
if a structure was present,
it had been destroyed prior

to the date the image was
captured.
Additionally,
archeologists do not note any
of the artifact clusters observed in the field on the 1947 photograph. Being right off a two-track
road with no apparent house nearby, this site may have served as an impromptu trash dump.
Given the use of barbed wire on site, the milk glass mason jar insert, and the apparent age
of the trees that have overgrown the wire, the site likely dates to the early twentieth or late
nineteenth centuries. Contemporary deed records pertinent to the property on which the site is
located (Volume 1054, pg. 42) indicate that 41HE385 can be tied to either W. C. Harrison and
wife S. E. Harrison or Sammie L. McClendon who received the property from the Harrisons
in November of 1912 (Volume 74, pg. 64). A William C. Harrison is listed as a 49-year-old
farmer on the 1910 U.S. Census, married to a Mary with nine children. None of the other
names returned census records and none were found on the TxGenWeb site. Additionally, the
site may be linked with a G. W. Matthews who sold the land to the Harrisons in 1902 (Volume
49, pg. 570).

Within the boundaries of Site 41HE385, archeologists found an extremely diffuse, nearly
destroyed remnant of a minor historic occupation. Of the site’s two features, only a highlydisturbed scant brick pile that likely is a wall or chimney remnant directly indicates an occupation
though it is in such poor condition that further functional interpretation is impossible. The
associated fenceline/tree alignment denotes the likely access road to the house but no other
features or non-artifact indications of occupation are known. Although the majority of the site
components are composed of diffuse surface artifacts scattered throughout, archeologists did
note two distinct clusters: a northern can scatter and a western glass and ceramic scatter. Though
this does suggest some functional patterning is present at the site, to what end would additional
investigation of this patterning bring? It is unlikely that additional intensive investigations
would yield new data about the site’s occupants and the assemblage itself does not include
particularly unique or distinct components. Finally, archival research does not indicate that the
site is associated with individuals or events of historical significance. Accordingly, the site is
not recommended as eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. These interpretations are
considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess
project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the vicinity of
the site.

Site 41HE386 is a surficial historic-period domestic debris scatter. Occupying an area of
approximately 20 x 10 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is located in an upland setting
within a mixed deciduous and pine forest (Figures 9.178 and 9.179).

Local vegetation consists of deciduous forest. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at
approximately 10 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site
vicinity are Tonkawa fine sand with 1–5 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel tests
revealed a typical soil column of 80 centimeters of sand (10YR 6/3). All shovel tests terminated
at 80 cmbs. The site does not appear to be disturbed, yet a road running north to south is present
approximately 10 meters to the east of the site.
Archeologists
excavated
four shovel tests; all of
which were devoid of
archeological
materials
(E478 and OT1–OT3).
Surficial
manifestations
of Site 41HE386 include
three clear glass bottles, an
unidentifiable mason jar, a
red unidentified brick, three
church key metal cans, a
metal bucket, rusted barbed

and an unidentifiable metal
container (Figure 9.180).
One of the bottles is labeled
for Sun Crest orange soda,
which was introduced to
the market in 1938 (Dad’s
Rootbeer 2013). From a

Nine shovel tests (E976, F949, OT3,

in the vicinity of this surface find. Of
these, one shovel test (OT3) contained
cultural materials. Two lithic flakes and
one prehistoric plain utilityware ceramic
sherd (paste and thickness unspecified)
were recorded in the upper 20 centimeters
of Shovel Test OT3. All other shovel
tests were devoid of cultural materials.
Archeologists did not observe any features
within the site boundary and delineated the
boundary largely by the landform on which
the materials were found.

From available information, Site 41HE387
is a diffuse, shallowly-buried prehistoric
artifact scatter that lacks associated features, diagnostics, or additional complementary
archeological resources. Research potential for the resource is considered low and additional
investigations at the site would not likely yield new data about late prehistoric lifeways in this
region. Accordingly, Site 41HE387 is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or

9.187). Occupying an area
of approximately 200 x 50
meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated on an upland ridge running roughly north/
south west of Cedar Creek. The majority of the site is situated within an open field with a
portion of the site located in woods. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within
the site vicinity are a Silawa fine sandy loam with 1–5 percent slopes. Observations from
site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 30 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/3)
overlying clay loam (10YR 6/4). Shovel test depth varied from 40 to 60 cmbs with a few
shovel tests terminating at 100 cmbs. Modern disturbances were primarily limited to a caliche
road running through the northern portion of the site.
Archeologists excavated 23 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41HE389 (A88,
B87, C82, D82, D83, E81, E82, F80, F81, F82, OT1–OT13; Table 9.34). Of these, nine shovel
tests (C82, D83, E82, F82, OT1, OT5, OT7, OT8, and OT12) contained cultural materials
(Figure 9.188) consisting of 22 lithic flakes, one core fragment, and a clear glass shard that
was recovered from positive shovel tests. The prehistoric lithic material was recorded between
0 and 100 cmbs, while the historic clear glass shard was recorded between 20 and 40 cmbs.
After assessing the 22 pieces of lithic debitage, it became clear that all stages of lithic reduction
are present at this site, as well as multiple raw material types (chert and quartzite). The depth
of the artifacts suggests a possible extended occupation with stratified deposits.
Site 41HE389 likely represents an open campsite, but due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts
and features archeologists were unable to assess cultural or temporal affiliation. Through
the current survey effort, archeologists were unable to determine 41HE389’s NRHP/SAL
eligibility. Additional coordination and/or field investigations are recommended to assess
project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.

41HE390
Site 41HE390 is a highly-disturbed,
surficial prehistoric occupation
site consisting of lithic and burned
rock scatters. The site is located
in Parcel 630. Occupying an area
of approximately 120 x 20 meters
(north/south x east/west), the site
is situated on a north/south running
ridgeline west of Cedar Creek
(Figures 9.189 and 9.190). Local
vegetation consists of short, mixed

was estimated at approximately 100
percent in exposed areas and 30
percent in vegetated areas. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site’s
vicinity are described as ‘Pits” derived from clayey residuum. Pit soils are common in areas
that have been disturbed. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column
of mottled sandy clay loam (10YR 5/4 and 5YR 4/6). Shovel tests typically terminated at
20 cmbs. Most shovel tests were terminated at 20 cmbs as a result of disturbed sediments,
shallow basal clays, and/or modern trash inclusions. Archeologists documented evidence for
extensive modern grading and dozing near the site boundary.

Surficial manifestations of Site 41HE390 include a scatter of prehistoric lithic refuse. The lithic
debitage includes a Stage 2 biface composed of chert, as well as FCR. The complete Stage 2
biface, 6 x 5 centimeters (length x width) (Figure 9.191), was observed at the northern end
of the survey corridor near a gravel pile. The large tool is composed of a light brown chert
containing inclusions. Approximately 15 to 20 pieces of FCR were also observed eroding
down slope at the southern end of the site. No soil stains were observed that would have
indicated the presence of a more defined thermal feature. All observed cultural materials were
located among disturbances. Specifically, the eroding areas along the two-track road and the
southern extent of the ridgeline.
Archeologists excavated seven shovel tests (A2, B4, C4, C5, D6, E5, and F5). All of the shovel
tests were devoid of cultural materials. One shovel test (C5) was excavated to a depth of
approximately 80 centimeters, but was determined to have been placed on an old push pile.
Due to the lack of subsurface cultural materials and features, as well as its highly disturbed
nature, little can be deduced regarding the site’s original function. Site 41HE390, similar to Site
41HE342, was likely a briefly-occupied prehistoric campsite along Cedar Creek. The presence
of FCR (versus ceramics) suggests that this site could date to Early Woodland or earlier, though
no diagnostics could be found that would confirm this assumption. Though a more significant
site may have been present at this location in the past, due to the severity of local disturbances,
the surficial nature of artifacts, a lack of formal features and diagnostics, and the generally low
artifact density, archeologists concluded that Site 41HE390 is considered ineligible for listing
as a SAL or on the NRHP. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and
if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE391
Site 41HE391 is a buried prehistoric
lithic debitage and burned rock
scatter on a small knoll outside of
Malakoff (see Figure 9.217; Figure
9.192). The exact site boundary
was not determined during the IPL
survey since the majority of the
site is located south of the 450foot survey corridor. The site is
separated from Site 41HE390 by
a small drainage leading to Cedar
Creek. Local vegetation consists of
mixed hardwoods. According to
the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils
within the site’s vicinity are Eufaula
fine sand. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical soil

column of 100 centimeters of uniform sand (10YR 5/3). All shovel tests were excavated to a
depth of 100+ cmbs. Modern disturbances include land clearing and cattle grazing activities.
Archeologists excavated nine shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41HE391 (A3,
B5, OT1-OT7; Table 9.35). Of these, three shovel tests (A3, OT3, and OT5) contained cultural
materials. Shovel Test A3 contained a chert flake between 40 and 60 cmbs. Shovel Test OT3

Site 41HE391 is considered to be a deeply buried open campsite that appears to contain intact
cultural materials, has the potential for yielding diagnostic tools, organic materials, and possibly
intact features. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination
and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future
Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE392
Site 41HE392 is a small, subsurface accumulation of prehistoric lithic debitage and FCR debris.
Occupying an area of approximately 25 x 15 meters (north/south x east/west), the site is situated
on a portion of a southerly-facing bench within the slope of a large hill near Malakoff (Figure
9.193 and 9.194). The site’s boundaries were determined using double negative shovel testing
surrounding positive tests and topography. Local vegetation consists of short mixed grasses.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site’s vicinity are a Eufaula fine
sand. Observations from site shovel tests revealed a typical soil column of 80 centimeters of
sand (10YR 5/3). Soils within the bench are deep, extending to at least 80 cmbs; while soils
surrounding the site are shallow and contain sterile clay at depths ranging from 30 to 55 cmbs.
Modern disturbances were minimal and limited to minor vegetation clearing.

Archeologists excavated eight shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41HE392 (A10,
OT1-7; Table 9.36). Of these, two shovel tests (A10 and OT5) contained cultural materials.
Shovel Tests A10 and OT5 contained FCR and quartzite flake debitage between 0 and 80
cmbs (Figure 9.195). The low density of FCR and debitage at Site 41HE392 suggests a briefly
occupied or disturbed open campsite of pre-Caddo age. It is unclear if the site has multiple
components or represents a single, yet mixed component. The sandy soils within the site
would allow for movement through the column (a common problem in interpreting sites in this
region), and therefore, materials may not be in their original context.

Although Site 41HE392 contains deeplyburied cultural material, the size of the site
and the low density of cultural material
overall leaves little room for obtaining
additional data. Significant site components
may, however, be located outside of the
current survey corridor (to the south).
Accordingly, Site 41HE392 cannot be
determined for NRHP/SAL eligibility from
current field data. Additional coordination
and/or survey may be required to assess
project impacts to the resource once, and if,
a Future Action route is selected in the site
vicinity or if future projects are proposed
nearby.

41HE393
Site 41HE393 is a multi-component site containing a diffuse historic trash scatter and a single
lithic flake. Occupying an area of approximately 45 x 60 meters (north/south x east/west), the site
is situated on an open, flat pasture that gradually slopes toward Turkey Creek (Figures 9.196 and
9.197). Local vegetation consists of a variety of short grasses and older mixed hardwoods near the
creek and fence boundaries. Overall, surface visibility was estimated at 25 percent. According
to USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are a Nahatche loam that floods

minor trash scatter with individuals of historical significance, but encountered some difficulty
in tying the property to particular individuals at particular times. According to Henderson
County deed records (Tract 51 of the S. Sylvester survey), the earliest readily accessible record
of ownership suggest that a D. M. Tidwell bought the land from B.A. and S. Cantrell in October
of 1923 (Volume 113, pg. 636). The Tidwells would eventually sell the land to a Jeff Lewis
some time later (a specific date could not be found, but other parcel records attributed to Mr.
Lewis suggest some time in the late 1970s or 1980s) who eventually sold the land to J.E. Ryon
whose descendants own the land to the present day. With a scant assemblage that can, at best,

be attributed to the early-to-mid-twentieth century the site is most likely associated with either
the Tidwells or the Cantrells. D.M. Tidwell is listed in the 1920 United States Census as a
23-year-old farmer married to his wife, Willie (22 years old) with two young daughters, Lorean
and Bernice. Tidwell’s parents, L.E. and Mimie (50 and 42 years old, respectively), lived next
door with D.M.’s eight other siblings. The 1900 United States Census lists Shadric (“Shade”,
63 years old) and wife, B. Allen Cantrell (33 years old) as residents in the area. According to
his headstone, Mr. Cantrell, who died in 1925, fought in the Civil War as a Private in the 13th
Texas Cavalry and is buried in the Hopewell Cemetery in nearby Anderson County (Mandlin
2008). Beyond their association with the Civil War, none of the individuals associated with the
property are considered to carry historical significance.
A review of a 1958 aerial photograph of the site vicinity revealed no structures, roads, or any
other evidence of any historical activity in the area (Figure 9.199). With no historic-age roads
leading to the site, it is unlikely that a structure of any substance stood here.

Site 41HE393 is an isolated, destroyed, low density historic-age trash scatter with a single
prehistoric flake. The site’s prehistoric component is a single flake with no additional artifacts,
features, or other indications of prehistoric occupation while the historic component, though
more extensive, lacks functional integrity and would not likely yield significant additional data
beyond that generated through this investigation. Accordingly, Site 41HE393 is considered
ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. These interpretations are considered preliminary
and additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the
resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE394
Site 41HE394 is a prehistoric open campsite consisting of FCR, lithic flakes, ceramic sherds,
a biface, and a nutting stone. The site is located outside of the IPL evaluation corridor
along a prominent

running ridgeline in
the survey corridor
(Figure 9.200). The
site occupies an area
of approximately 200
x 80 meters (north/

Local
vegetation
consists of moderate

Thirty-five lithic flakes, two pieces of FCR, one tested cobble, one undecorated prehistoric
ceramic rim sherd, one pitted stone, and one piece of petrified wood was excavated from
positive shovel tests (Figures 9.201 and 9.202). Archeological materials were recorded
between 0 and 90 cmbs. Lithic raw material was dominated by chert, but some quartzite was
present within the assemblage. The ceramic sherd measures approximately 4 x 2.5 centimeters
in size and is approximately seven millimeters thick. It is composed of orange to tan sandy
paste with some black spots. All other shovel tests were devoid of cultural material.

Site 41HE394 is a buried, open campsite containing a fairly sizable collection of artifacts.
Through additional survey and/or excavations, it is likely that the site will yield more significant
components including features, temporal diagnostics, and evidence of organic preservation.
The site likely represents a relatively longer-term occupation where a wide variety of activities,
including food processing, were conducted. From the current field effort, 41HE394 does contain
data that would suggest it may be NRHP/SAL-eligible, but formal testing would be necessary
to conclusively assess the resource’s
significance. These interpretations
are considered preliminary and
additional
coordination
and/or
survey may be required to assess
project impacts to the resource
once, and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the vicinity of the site.
41HE395
Site 41HE395 is a multicomponent
site containing both prehistoric
(e.g., lithic debitage) and historicperiod debris (e.g., whiteware).
The site is located on a northward
trending finger ridge overlooking
Hollywood Lake. Occupying an area
of approximately 250 x 315 meters
(north/south x east/west), the site
is situated on a grassy hilltop. The
site boundary was identified through
negative shovel tests and topography
(Figures 9.203 and 9.204). Local
vegetation consists of shortgrasses

with spase trees throughout the area.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil
Survey, soils within the site vicinity
consist of Pickton loamy fine sand
with 1–8 percent slopes and Wolfpen
loamy fine sand with 1–5 percent
slopes. Observations from site shovel
tests revealed a typical soil column
of 20 centimeters of silty (10YR 4/3)
sand, over 60 centimeters of sand
(7.5YR 4/4). Typically, shovel tests
terminated at a depth of 100 cmbs.
Based on field observations, 20–25
percent of the site has been disturbed
as a result of erosion and livestock
trampling.

three amber glass shards and one undecorated whiteware sherd. Archeologists also recorded a
buried burned rock hearth (Feature 1) in Shovel Test OT7. The feature was characterized by a
four-centimeter-thick lens of burned sandstone buried at roughly 60 cmbs. Throughout the site,
prehistoric artifacts were located to maximum depth of 80 cmbs while historic-period artifacts
were located primarily between 20 and 40 cmbs. Historic-period materials were found below
prehistoric cultural material in Shovel Test OT4, suggesting disturbance, but this disturbance
is shallow and is likely associated with farming activities.
The site is a potential candidate for a prehistoric, pre-Woodland period campsite with a much
later historic-period component (possibly a farmstead). Despite the presence of historic material
below the prehistoric component in Shovel Test OT4, the majority of the site does appear to be
intact, evidenced by an in situ FCR feature. The presence of diagnostic artifacts, features, and
a moderate artifact density indicates the site was likely intensively occupied and could yield
significant data pertaining to human settlement within the region. At the moment, less than
10 percent of the site falls within surveyed IPL evaluation corridor. These interpretations are
considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess
project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41HE396
Site 41HE396 is an ephemeral,
shallowly-buried
prehistoric
ceramic scatter. The site is
located on a gently sloping
terrace overlooking a drainage
to the east (Figures 9.208 and
9.209). Occupying an area of
approximately 100 x 85 meters
(north/south x east/west), the site
is situated on an open grassy field
with occasional hardwoods dotting
the eastern periphery.
Local
vegetation consists of short grass
and oak and pine trees. Overall,
surface visibility was recorded at 50
percent due to grasses blanketing
the site. According to the USDA’s
Web Soil Survey, soils within the
site vicinity are a Bernaldo fine
sandy loam with 1 to 4 percent
slopes. Observations from site
shovel tests revealed a typical
soil column of 30 centimeters of
sand (10YR 4/2) overlying clay

modern disturbance or prehistoric trampling (likely the former). All other shovel tests were
devoid of cultural materials.
Site 41HE396 is considered to be a low density prehistoric ceramic scatter composed solely of
non-diagnostic plain utilityware sherds scattered diffusely across a broad area. Archeologists
found no other artifact classes (decorated ceramics, lithics, tools, etc.) nor were any features
observed. NRHP/SAL eligibility for Site 41HE396 could not, however, be determined through
the current field effort alone. Additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess
project impacts to the resource once,
and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the site vicinity.
41HE397
Site 41HE397 is a historic railroad
grade located along an artificial
berm in a low-lying landform east
of Caddo Creek (Figures 9.211 and
9.212). The site is solely a surficial
manifestation retaining the remnants
of creosote shoring, railroad ties,
and granite fill. The railroad grade
runs roughly north to south across
the centerline of the proposed IPL
permanent easement extending
beyond the survey corridor in Parcel
752. Since the site is located within
two survey corridors, archeologists
were able to visually assess a
relatively long portion of the resource,
covering an area of approximately
300 meters (north/south) x 20 meters
(east/west). The site boundary was
arbitrarily extended to the edge of

the accessible property (the limit
of visual confirmation at the time
of survey) making the total north to
south length nearly 700 meters. Overall, surface visibility at the time of survey was estimated at
approximately 75 percent. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site area
consist of Cuthbert fine sandy loam with 8–20 percent slopes. Observations from site shovel
tests revealed a typical soil column of 23 centimeters of loamy sand (10YR 5/6) overlying 57
centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 5/6). Typically, shovel tests extended to a depth of 80+ cmbs.
Modern disturbances include fluvial erosion and general disrepair.

Figure 9.212. General overview of the
railroad grade terrain and setting.

Figure 9.213. Photo of concrete drainage
culvert with eroding berm.

The berm is approximately 15
feet wide and roughly 10 feet tall.
Archeologists noted a small concrete
culvert directing water beneath the
berm that is contemporaneous with the
rail line. At the water crossing, most
of the raised grade has collapsed or
eroded away (Figure 9.213), though
creosote shoring is still present
on the east side. Archeologists
excavated seven shovel tests during
their investigations of Site 41HE397
(OT1, OT4, OT5, OT6, D959, C995,
and A964), all of which were devoid
of archeological material.
According to the current landowner
(personal communication 2012), the
site is a remnant of the Texas and New
Orleans Company Railroad, which
ceased operation at this location
during the late 1970s or early 1980s.
Completed in 1905, this portion of
the line was utilized as a freight line
connecting Beaumont with Dallas
(Williams 2012). According to the
landowner, this segment of the rail
line brought livestock and tomatoes
to and from LaRue, Texas, as well
as passengers, one of which was the
landowner’s grandfather.

The portions of the historic-age
Texas and New Orleans rail line
located within the proposed IPL
survey corridor, recorded as Site 41HE397, are in poor condition overall. General disrepair
has left primarily only the earthen berm in place and, due to unabated erosion, that berm is
collapsing and washing away. Though other portions of the structure outside of the survey
corridor may be in better condition and therefore could be considered eligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP, within the currently-evaluated corridor, it is recommended as ineligible
for listing. Construction in this area would simply remove a segment of the resource while miles
of additional segments remain unaltered. These interpretations are considered preliminary and
additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource
once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the vicinity of the site.

9.6.3 Archeological Isolated Finds
As described above, along with the numerous archeological sites recorded within and outside
of the proposed IPL permanent easement, archeologists found many other archeological
resources during their survey that did not meet the predetermined site recording criteria. These
generally isolated, single, historic, and/or prehistoric artifact finds on the surface or in shovel
tests were recorded as non-site isolates and are considered ineligible for listing on the NRHP
or as SALs. For detailed maps showing find locations, the reader should refer to Appendix A.
C602IF1 is the base of a snuff bottle (Figure 9.214). The brown glass snuff bottle base is
square in section with three embossed dots on the bottom indicating that it was filled with
light to moderate-strength snuff. The bottle, measuring approximately 2.5 inches in diameter,
was recorded from a depth of 35 cmbs in Shovel Test OT2. The shovel test was excavated
outside of the IPL evaluation corridor east of the Trinity River. Observations made during
shovel testing revealed a typical soil column
of 40 centimeters of clay loam (10YR
3/3) overlying 25 centimeters of clay
loam (10YR 5/3). Additional shovel tests
(E967, OT1, and OT3-OT7) were devoid
of cultural materials. The snuff bottle
fragment is located outside of the IPL
permanent easement and lacks associated
features, diagnostics, or complementary
cultural materials. Accordingly, the isolated
find is considered ineligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.
A602IF1 is a single prehistoric, tertiary
quartzite flake recovered from 40-60
cmbs in Shovel Test B606, excavated on a
ridgeline east of the Trinity River (Figure
9.215). Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of
30 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 6/4)
overlying 15 centimeters of silty sand
(10YR 7/3) overlying silty sand (10YR 7/2).
Additional shovel tests (A597, A594, C691,
OT1, and OT2) were devoid of cultural
materials. The quartzite flake is located
outside of the IPL permanent easement and
lacks associated features, diagnostics, or
complementary archeological resources.

Accordingly, the isolated find is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No
further work is recommended.
A602IF2 is a prehistoric quartzite flake
located in Parcel 602 approximately 300
meters from A602IF1 (Figure 9.216).
The lithic flake was excavated between
a depth of 30 and 40 cmbs in Shovel Test
B609. Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of
30 centimeters of silty sand (10YR 4/4)
overlying 40 centimeters of silty sand (10YR
7/3). An additional shovel tests (OT1, A602,
A600, D636, C693) were devoid of cultural
materials. The quartzite flake is located
outside of the IPL permanent easement
and lacks complementary archeological
resources. Accordingly, the isolated find
is considered ineligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.
B602IF1 is an isolated prehistoric chert
flake observed on the ground surface within
a heavily disturbed cow pasture (Figure
9.217). Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of
50 centimeters of silty clay (10YR 6/6)
overlying 20 centimeters of silty clay (5YR
5/6). Additional shovel tests (OT1, OT2,
OT3, and B285) was devoid of cultural
materials. The chert flake is located in
a disturbed setting outside of the IPL
permanent easement and lacks additional
complementary archeological resources.
Accordingly, the isolated find is considered
ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the
NRHP. No further work is recommended.
C611IF1 is a small cement structure that
is likely a historic-age box latrine or septic
tank (Figure 9.218). The cement structure
is located within an open pasture along an
abandoned IPL evaluation corridor. The
structure is a rectangular box measuring 10

circular hole in its center that now has trees growing out of it. Shovel tests excavated around
the find (D183, D184, E200, F203, and F204) were devoid of cultural materials. The cement
structure is located outside of the IPL evaluation corridor and lacks additional associated
features, diagnostics, or complementary archeological resources. Accordingly, the isolated
find is ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.
A618IF1 is a piece of heat-treated chert
debitage excavated between a depth of 40
and 60 cmbs in Shovel Test C512 (Figure
9.219). The shovel test was located on
an elevated landform within Parcel 618.
Additional shovel tests (D474, B463,
F85 and E472 ) were devoid of cultural
materials. Observations made during
shovel testing revealed a typical soil
column of 40 centimeters of sandy loam
(10YR 7/2) overlying 40+ centimeters
of clay (7.5YR 4/6). The chert debitage
is located within the IPL evaluation
corridor, but falls outside of the IPL
150-foot permanent easement, and
lacks associated features, diagnostics,
or
complementary
archeological
resources. Accordingly, the isolated find
is considered ineligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.

A704IF1 is a chert tertiary flake fragment
(Figure 9.221). The tertiary flake was
excavated between a depth of 60 and 80
cmbs in Shovel Test A296. The shovel test
was excavated on top of a landform in Parcel
704. Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of 40
centimeters of 10YR 6/3 sand overlying 20
centimeters of sand (10YR 5/3). Additional
shovel tests (B276, and OT1-OT6) were
devoid of cultural materials. The tertiary
flake lacks associated features, diagnostics,
or other complementary archeological
resources. Accordingly, the isolated find
is considered ineligible for listing as a
SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.

flake fragment recorded as A704IF1.

D710IF1 is a chert tertiary flake. The tertiary flake was excavated between a depth of 30–50
cmbs in Backhoe Trench 710T1. Observations made during shovel testing revealed a typical
soil column of 80 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 5/4) with gravel. Additional shovel tests
(OT16, OT18, and OT20) as well as backhoe trenches excavated nearby were devoid of cultural
materials. The tertiary flake is located along the Future Action corridor and lacks associated
features, diagnostics, or complementary archeological resources. Accordingly, the isolated find
is ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No further work is recommended.
B719IF1 includes two artifacts, an incised prehistoric ceramic sherd and a chert flake (Figure
9.222). The lithic flake fragment was excavated between a depth of 0 and 20 cmbs in Shovel
Test B526, while the punctuated and linear incised ceramic sherd (dark gray in color and
approximately eight millimeters thick) was found on the surface adjacent to the Shovel
Test B526. Observations made during shovel testing revealed a typical soil column of 60
centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 6/4) overlying 20 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 5/4).
Additional shovel tests excavated in the
immediate vicinity (C608, and OT1–OT5)
were devoid of cultural material. The
cultural materials are located along the
Future Action survey corridor and may
be impacted by future construction. The
artifacts were found in shallow, surficial
contexts that are likely disturbed. Lacking
any additional artifacts or associated
features, the prehistoric artifacts are
isolated finds and are considered ineligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No

A721IF1 includes two artifacts:
a small (1.5 x 2 x 0.8 centimeters)
incised ceramic sherd (dark gray,
sandy paste) and a chert flake
(Figure 9.223). The lithic flake
was excavated between a depth
of 40 and 60 cmbs in Shovel Test
E543, while the ceramic sherd was
excavated between 60 and 80 cmbs.
Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column
of 60 centimeters of silty sand
(10YR 6/3) overlying 20 centimeters
of silty clay (10YR 6/3). Additional
shovel tests (F538, F539, and F540)
were devoid of cultural material.
The isolated find was recorded
during survey along the Future
Action corridor. It lacks associated
features, diagnostics, or additional
complementary
archeological
resources. Accordingly, the isolated
find is considered ineligible for
listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No
further work is recommended.

archeological resources. The flake, however, is found on the same parcel as an equally isolated,
shallowly-buried prehistoric ceramic (C752IF2). The two finds were considered too far apart
to be encompassed in to a single site and more likely are displaced from historic railroad
construction in the immediate vicinity. Accordingly, the isolated find is considered ineligible
for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
No further work is recommended.
C752IF2, an isolated prehistoric
ceramic sherd located on the opposite
side of the Future Action survey
corridor near the Texas and New
Orleans Rail Line (Site 41HE397),
is found approximately 100 meters
south of C752IF1 (Figure 9.226).
Recovered in the upper 20 centimeters
of sediments (in Shovel Test OT5),
the sherd is approximately three
centimeters in diameter with plain,
undecorated interior and exterior
faces. Archeologists excavated an
additional three shovel tests in the
immediate find vicinity (Tests A694,
OT7-OT8) with none containing any
additional artifacts. Soils in this area
were comparable to those observed
at C752IF1. The sherd is likely
displaced from an archeological
site that may have sat on the
banks of the ephemeral drainage
that has been destroyed during
railroad construction. Lacking any
associated features or artifacts, the
find is considered a non-site isolate
and is ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. No further work is
recommended.
C792IF1 is the proximal end of a
biface (approx. 2.5 cm in width)
excavated between a depth of 30
and 40 cmbs in Shovel Test A982
(Figure 9.227). The shovel test
in which the tool fragment was
identified is located on a deflated
hillside slope near Site 41HE396.

Observations made during shovel testing revealed a typical soil column of 50 centimeters of
silty sandy loam (10YR 3/1). Additional shovel tests excavated in the vicinity (OT7, OT9,
and OT10) were devoid of cultural materials. The biface fragment is located along the Future
Action corridor and lacks associated features, diagnostics, and complementary archeological
materials. Accordingly, the isolated find is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the

C1075IF1 is a quartzite flake (1.5 cm diameter) recorded from the surface within a slightly
brushy parcel which rises toward the west and overlooks a Walnut Creek tributary (Figure
9.228). Observations made during shovel testing revealed a typical soil column of 80 centimeters
of sand (10YR 4/4). Additional shovel tests in the immediate vicinity (C899, D910, D911, and
OT1–OT3) were devoid of cultural materials. The flake was recorded within a Future Action
survey corridor and may be destroyed if a route is selected, but it lacks associated features,
diagnostics, and complementary archeological resources. Accordingly, the isolated find is

C1094IF1 is a chert flake excavated between a depth of 40 and 60 cmbs in Shovel Test
D943. The shovel test is located approximately 23 meters to the northeast of previously
recorded Site 41HE223. The prehistoric isolate does not match the recorded data for
Site 41HE223 and archeologists elected to record it as a non-site isolate, since the actual
remnants of Site 41HE223 are located approximately 100 meters to the east. Observations
made during shovel testing revealed a typical soil column of 10 centimeters of silty sand
(7.5YR 4/4) overlying 50 centimeters of silty, sandy clay (7.5YR 5/3) overlying sandy
clay subsoil (7.5YR 5/8). Additional shovel tests dug in the vicinity (OT1–OT6) were
devoid of cultural materials. The chert flake is located along the Future Action survey
corridor and may be impacted by construction once a route is selected, but it lacks any
associated features, diagnostics, and complementary archeological resources. Accordingly,
the isolated find is considered ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP. No further
work is recommended.

9.7	Historical Resources
Along with the archeological sites, AmaTerra architectural historians documented 43 individual
historic structures along various portions of the IPL APE, with one in the final 450-foot APE.
As stated previously, much of the Henderson County portion of the IPL is the unfinalized Future
Action. Impacts in these areas cannot be determined at this time. While the majority are midcentury home sites and agricultural outbuildings as is typical of the region, a few properties
date to the early twentieth century. Below is a summary of the resources documented. (Table

9.229). The house is a circa 1975
Ranch style building with brick veneer
and wood shingle siding under the roof
gables, and aluminum-sash windows.
The cross-gabled roof has composite
shingles. The outbuildings consist of
two mid-century (circa 1965) barns and a
small modern shed. The barns are frontgabled buildings with metal roofing

and siding, with wing additions on the
north sides. Although it has nominal
association with agricultural practices in Henderson County, the property lacks significance
under Criterion A. It has no known association with important historic persons under Criterion
B, and is not a noteworthy example of the Ranch style under Criterion C. As such, it is
recommended Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP.

9.7.2 Identified Properties Outside of the Final 450-foot APE
HN615-1 is a circa 1940 bungalow on a private drive off SH 274 (Figure 9.230). The building
has asbestos shingle siding and modern replacement windows under a standing seam, frontgabled roof.
HN618-1 and HN618b-1 are two barns near the intersection of Joe Andrews Road and Key
Ranch Road (Figure 9.231). The two mid-century (circa 1960) one-story barns both have
corrugated metal siding and roofing, and feature front-gabled roofs with substantial wing
additions. HN618-1 is within the indirect effects APE of JCC1, the Cedar Creek Pump Station,
but is beyond a large earth berm that separates the two locations.

HN618a-1 is the Mankin Cemetery, one of the last vestiges of the community of Mankin which
was inundated by the Cedar Creek Reservoir in the early 1960s (Figure 9.232). The cemetery
contains burials dating back to the late 1880s, and includes the 1900 grave of Louisa Mankin,
wife of William Mankin. The cemetery is within the indirect effects APE of JCC1, the Cedar

Results of Field Investigations
Anderson County
The eastern-most terminus of the proposed IPL pipeline project is expected to pass briefly into
the northeastern portion of Anderson County. Being entirely composed of unfinalized Future
Action corridor, the final alignment has not been determined at this time and locations and
distances provided are approximations based upon the investigated survey corridor and not
a proposed alignment or facility footprint. Traveling approximately six miles (west to east),
the IPL’s Future Action is expected to enter Anderson County near CR 300, pass north of
the community of Frankston at SH 155, and terminate at Lake Palestine at the proposed LP1
Water Pump and Intake Station (also included in the Future Action). Similar to Henderson
County, the IPL corridor largely encounters open agricultural fields, grazing pastures, and
areas of dense riparian woodlands along rolling hills typical of the Piney Woods. Additionally,
the IPL corridor occasionally passes near residential and commercial locations especially
in and around Frankston, particularly at its crossing of SH 155. Overall, archeologists and
architectural historians surveyed approximately 444 acres of the proposed IPL project within
Anderson County along the various iterations of the evaluation corridor. From their efforts
five archeological sites, two archeological isolated finds, and 16 non-archeological historic-age
resources were documented within the county. Below is a brief summary of Anderson County’s
environmental and historical background along with a survey narrative and detailed account of
identified cultural resources recorded during survey along the yet-unfinalized corridor.

10.1	Pipeline Description
10.1.1 Future Action Corridor
The preferred pipeline corridor begins in an open agrarian parcel north of SH 175 and extends
As stated above, all of the IPL components within Anderson County are not finalized at this
time and a proposed final alignment can not be presented. Accordingly, the survey corridors
presented in Figures 10.1 and 10.2 depict the general route the Action is likely to take once
it has been identified. Since the route has not been finalized, specific installation methods
can not be identified, however, it is assumed that engineers will install the pipeline through
a combination of open-cut trenching and/or tunneling at waterway and roadway crossings.
Archeologists employed linear survey methodologies throughout much of the APE while areal
survey was used at the proposed LP1 Pump Station site candidate and at one environmental
resource avoidance investigation area (see below).

10.1.2 Lake Palestine Pump Station and Intake (LP1)
As mentioned above, the IPL is eventually proposed to terminate at Lake Palestine, with
engineers installing the Lake Palestine Pump and Intake Station on its western bank, which
will serve to pump water from Lake Palestine into the TRWD and DWU infrastructure.
The final proposed facility site is yet to be determined, but general pipeline trajectory suggests
that it will be located near the southwest corner of Lake Palestine (Parcels 848, 850, and
851). Like the other pump stations, LP1 is expected to measure approximately 10 acres in
size. Within this location, proposed project components include a pump station, chemical
building, electrical substation, turbidity curtain, intake channel, and an access road (see the
latest proposed schematic: Figure 10.3). As can be seen from Figure 10.3, over half of the
facility site falls within the waters of Lake Palestine.

10.1.3 Alternatives Evaluated but Now Abandoned
The IPL survey corridor within Anderson County underwent a few, mostly small route
modifications as engineers and environmental specialists determined the least cost path. The
first route revision occurred at the SH 155 crossing where engineers elected to pass the pipeline
south of Frankston High School versus the original northern route. The second IPL survey
corridor modification occurs just west of the aforementioned reroute in Parcel 814, where
engineers elected to alter the pipeline path to avoid identified environmental resources. All
other route modifications within Anderson County are minor in nature and do not warrant
additional, detailed discussion.

10.2	Environmental Summary
The project area within Anderson County passes through the Berryville and Poynor 1:24,000
topographic quadrangles. The survey corridor transects mostly rural tracts of land with
intermittent residential and commercial development within the vicinity. The project area
crosses no major named creeks, but does cross two intermittent streams, which drain into
Caddo Creek to the south. The LP1 site candidate is situated at the southern end of Lake
Palestine along its western banks and serves as the IPL’s projected eastern terminus. Facility
components (intake channel and turbidity curtain) extend into Lake Palestine.

10.2.1 Anderson County Soil Summary
The IPL survey route crosses one geological group within Anderson County, the Claiborne
group. This group consists of three different formations: Weches Formation (Ew), Sparta Sand
(Es), and Queen City Sand (Eqc) (Fisher 1992). All three formations derive from the Eocene,
one of five epochs making up the Tertiary geological period. Soils formed during this epoch
have moderate to low potential for deep archeological deposition and/or preservation. Twentyfour different soil types (Table 10.1) exist within the survey. The majority of soils consist of

10.2.2 Anderson County Climate
The project area is located within two climatic environments: subtropical and continental. The
subtropical environment is characterized by humid and hot summers, while the continental
environment is characterized by a wide range of annual temperature extremes. Total annual
precipitation in Anderson County is 32.1 inches, 59 percent of which falls between the months
of April and September. Snowfall occurs during approximately 72 percent of the winters
(Ressel 1981).

10.2.3 Anderson County Biota
The project area is located within the Texan Austroriparian Biotic Province as defined by Blair
(1950). Typical vegetation encountered within the APE includes pecan (Carya illinoiensis),
shumard oak (Quercus shumardii), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), black walnut (Juglans
cinera L.), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), bois d’arc (Maclura
pomifera), buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), and blue
grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Preston 1976). Mammalian fauna commonly observed within this
516

region include opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and
coyote (Canis latrans) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).

10.2.4 Current Land Use
Anderson County is primarily composed of agricultural land devoted to farming and ranching.
The land stays rural from west to east with urbanization centrally located near the town of
Frankston.

10.3	Historical Context
Anderson County has a long and rich history which is defined by EuroAmerican and Native
American conflict along with the establishment of Palestine as a center of operations for
the International & Great Northern Railway in addition to the growth of the lumber and
agricultural industry. The project crosses the north corner of Anderson County which was
sparsely inhabited until the twentieth century. Industry and agriculture centered largely around
the town of Frankston.

10.3.1 Railroads and Lumber (1902–1970)
Settlers established communities in what would become Anderson County as early as 1833,
although the current project area did not undergo any kind of significant settlement until the
turn of the twentieth century (Caraway 2012). In 1902, the Texas & New Orleans railroad was
built in the area, portions of which were recorded within neighboring Henderson County (see
Chapter 9). A small community named Kickapoo moved two miles northwest of its original
location in order to establish a new town along the railroad tracks. Originally called Ayers, the
new community was renamed Frankston in honor of Miss Frankie Miller, who donated land for
the town’s first park (Dempsey 2012). Other neighboring communities, such as Goodsonville,
Berryville and Sand Flat served as freedmen communities in the surrounding area (Frankston
Bicentennial Committees 1976).
With a rail connection and shipping hub established, the local lumber industry began to
grow. Anderson County, part of the east Texas “piney woods,” had ample stands of pine and
hardwoods suitable for lumber although it was not one of the top producing lumber counties.
Nonetheless, between 1880 and 1930 all of east Texas experienced a lumber boom, the effects
of which helped Frankston grow (Maxwell 2012). By the mid-1920s, the population was
somewhere around 1,500 and the town supported numerous businesses including a basket
factory (Dempsey 2012).
Although railroad operations declined in the latter half of the twentieth century, Frankston
continued to support a small lumber industry, along with small-scale agriculture production.
The construction of US 175 between Dallas and Jacksonville in 1932 resulted in the construction

Chapter 10

Results — Anderson County

of a modern paved highway out of what once was a dirt road (TxDOT Highway Designation
Files 2012).

10.3.2 Cotton, Vegetables, and Other Agriculture (1902–1960)
Agriculture in the project area was small scale and primarily restricted to subsistence crops
until the arrival of the railroad. Prior to that, area farmers had no means of transporting their
goods to markets, while demand for textile and produce products remained minimal. The
construction of the Frankston railroad depot provided locals with the ability to buy and sell
products in a larger market. This ultimately led Anderson County farmers to shift to more
lucrative cotton production. By 1925, cotton was a major part of the local community
(Dempsey 2012). However, the boll weevil epidemic of the 1920s and Great Depression of
the 1930s soon forced farmers to turn to other crops. By the 1950s, peaches and tomatoes were
important products cultivated in the region’s fields (Dempsey 2012). Ranching also rose to
prominence during and after the depression as livestock proved easier to raise, requiring less
labor than farming.

10.4	Previously-Recorded Archeological Sites and Survey
10.4.1 Previous Surveys
Previous archeological surveys documented within the IPL survey route in Anderson County
consist of a linear survey conducted on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) in 1992, which crossed the IPL corridor at S. Frankston Highway. Another linear
survey, conducted on behalf of Rural Electric Administration in 1992, crossed the IPL survey
corridor at County Road 305.

10.4.2 Previously Recorded Archeological Sites
Based on the Atlas, 15 previously recorded archeological sites exist within one kilometer of
the IPL Future Action corridor and facility site area within Anderson County. Of these 15
archeological sites, only two previously recorded archeological sites (41AN10 and 41AN11)
are mapped within the proposed IPL corridor and will be discussed below. Another three
archeological sites (41AN66-67, and 71) are inundated within Lake Palestine near the proposed
LP1 site. The remaining ten archeological sites (41NV4, 16, 23, 28, 65, 68–70, 73–74) do
fall within one kilometer of the IPL survey route, but are located outside of the 450-foot IPL
evaluation corridor.

10.5 Archeological Survey Observations
10.5.1 Terrestrial Field Survey
Archeologists excavated 565 shovel tests within the county. Five archeological sites—four
prehistoric and one historic—were recorded or revisited by archeologists. Two of the four sites
were previously recorded, but due to an array of factors discussed below, field archeologists
were unable to locate both sites. As described in Chapter 1, below is a brief summary of
the survey results with a discussion focusing on the resources identified during survey. In
all instances, unless stated otherwise, the assessed parcels were intensively surveyed through
surface inspection and shovel testing in accordance with the methods specified in Chapter
4. Shovel test distribution maps are provided in Appendix A along with a specific depiction
of identified archeological resources. A parcel-by-parcel survey review (including shovel test
counts, surficial and soil observations, and recommendations for each parcel) is provided in
Appendix C.
Segment 19-1
Henderson County Line to SH 155
The IPL survey crosses into Anderson
County at Parcel 794, north of SH 175
in an open pasture dotted with cedar
trees. Observations from shovel tests
(A794C405) revealed a typical soil
column consisting of 50 centimeters
of sandy gravel (10YR 5/4) overlying
20 centimeters of sand (7.5YR 4/4)
overlying a compact clay (5YR 5/6)
that was interpreted as sterile subsoil
(Figure 10.4). In Parcel 797 the IPL
crosses into a heavily wooded drainage,
rising into pasture land again in Parcel
798. Observations from shovel tests
(A797F604) revealed a typical soil
column of 30 centimeters of clay (10YR
5/8) with gravel that was interpreted as
sterile subsoil. The IPL then crosses CR
1305 into Parcel 805 and, for 800 meters,
the north half of the ROE is in a heavily
wooded area in parcels 803, 804, 808
and 811 (Figure 10.5). Observations
from shovel tests (A808E415) revealed
a typical soil column of 65 centimeters
of sandy loam (10YR 6/4) overlying 20

centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 6/8). When the survey route crosses CR 303 the trees thin
out for a very short segment before Parcel 814. Here the evaluation corridor veers south
around a small site before rejoining the original corridor in Parcel 816 where the land stays
heavily brushy and then crosses through a field behind Frankston High School and through a
highly disturbed area in the school’s horse arena (Figure 10.6). Observations from shovel tests
(A814A623) revealed a typical soil column of 100 centimeters of sand (10YR 7/3).
Over this portion’s 2.9-mile survey corridor length, the survey crews excavated 316 shovel
tests in various abandoned segments and smaller area survey localities. Two prehistoric
archeological sites were documented in this segment (41AN190–191).
SH 155 to Lake Palestine Pump Station (LP1)
Crossing the Frankston Highway (SH
155), the proposed IPL Future Action
survey corridor continues the final 3.4
miles to its terminus at the proposed
LP1 pump station site candidate.
Along this length, the survey crew
excavated 211 shovel tests along linear
routes, an additional 28 tests in area
survey localities and 10 tests in a small
abandoned segment near SH 155. The
survey crosses into Parcel 821 and 822
which are both relatively open pasture
land (Figure 10.7). Observations from
shovel tests (D822A95) revealed a
typical soil column of 30 centimeters
of sandy loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 50
centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 6/3).
From Parcel 823 east, the pasture land
is tree covered in the lower areas and
along most fence lines (Figure 10.8).
At parcel 832 the Future Action route
generally runs parallel to CR 309 to
Parcel 839. Observations from shovel
tests (C839B231) revealed a typical soil
column of 60 centimeters of sand (10YR
5/4) overlying 20 centimeters of sandy
clay (7.5YR 5/6). The IPL Future Action
will terminate at Lake Palestine at the
proposed pump station. Site 41AN192
was recorded in this portion of the survey
(see below).

10.5.2
Lake Palestine
Pump Station (LP1) Survey
In the summer of 2011, survey crews
investigated the vicinity of the proposed
LP1 Pump Station candidate (IPL Parcels
846–850). Archeologists investigated
the entire proposed pump station area
through a 100 percent pedestrian surface
survey accompanied by the excavation
of 63 subsurface shovel tests (28 areal
survey tests within the main footprint
and an additional 35 linear tests along

found the proposed LP1 candidate site
to be flat to gently-sloping and densely
wooded with tall pines and riparian scrub reducing surface visibility and the ease at which
the land could be traversed (Figures 10.9–10.10). Farther west, within the staging area, the
survey corridor is much more open, composed of a lush carpet of short grasses that again left
surface visibility relatively low (<20 percent; Figure 10.11). Based on shovel test observations
(848OT1) soils in the evaluated main pump station candidate area were found to consist of 40
centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 6/3) overlying 26 centimeters of sandy clay (10YR 6/3
with 7.5YR 4/4) overlying 20 centimeters of clay (7.5YR 4/6). On the hilly uplands to the
west, the sediments (Shovel Test E847OT11) are described as 60 centimeters of sandy loam
(10YR 5/4) overlying 20 centimeters of clay (7.5YR 4/6). During the process, the team did
not encounter any archeological sites within the LP1 survey footprint; however, one locality
containing a chert flake and fragments of bottle glass was documented as an isolated find. This
was documented within a disturbed access drive portion inside the staging area (E847IF1, see
below).

Results — Anderson County

Concurrent with the archeological survey,
a historical structure survey was conducted
to evaluate the station candidate’s potential
for direct effects and indirect visual impacts
to properties eligible for- or listed on the
NRHP. Several buildings were initially
identified on modern aerial photographs
as potentially 50 years of age or older.
When field-verified, however, they were
all determined to be of modern origin and
not significant (Figure 10.12). Accordingly,
archeologists and historians completed
their respective surveys and do not believe
follow-up investigations are warranted.

No backhoe trenches were excavated within
Anderson County during the course of IPL
survey.

10.6 Identified
Archeological Resources

From an archeological perspective,
Anderson County, as mentioned in the
introduction of this chapter, contained a
low number of cultural resources within the
Future Action evaluation corridor (Table
10.2). This is primarily attributed to the fact
that the IPL corridor crosses a very limited
portion of the county. Survey crews assessed
four prehistoric archeological sites within
the IPL evaluation corridor and one historicage cemetery, as well as an additional two

historic-period artifacts. With no proposed
pipeline or pump station site finalized along
the Anderson County portion of the survey, it is impossible to determine which, if any, of
these sites will be impacted by construction. Accordingly, all descriptions provided below are
intended for general inventory purposes only. Determinations of impacts and potential effects
through coordination and/or additional field survey will be required once the Future Action
route is formalized. Below is a summary of the sites and isolated finds that were recorded
during the IPL field survey effort in Anderson County.

10.6.1 Anderson County Archeological Sites
41AN10
Site 41AN10 is a previously recorded
prehistoric (Caddo) site documented
in the 1930s. Reportedly, ceramic
vessels had been found at this
location prior to its designation as
an archeological site. The site’s
recorded centroid is located within
the IPL project’s survey corridor, in a
disturbed cow pasture with semi-dry
disseminating creek drainages and
high banks (Figure 10.13). Local
vegetation consists of grasses, mixed
oak, and sweetgum trees. Overall,
surface visibility was estimated at
50-75 percent. According to the
USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils

loam. Observations made during
shovel testing revealed a typical soil
column of 30 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 4/3) overlying 20 centimeters of sandy clay
(10YR 6/8) that was interpreted as sterile subsoil. Modern disturbances include livestock, foot
traffic, erosion, and previous pipeline construction (markers and a pump station were noted in
the site vicinity).

Archeologists excavated six shovel tests in the mapped location of Site 41AN10 (B367-B369,
C407, A387, and A388). All shovel tests were devoid of cultural materials. Negative shovel
tests led archeologists to believe one of two things: the site was inaccurately plotted during
its first recording or the site has been completely destroyed. Based on the area’s use as an
agricultural field, as well as the presence of underground pipelines, both possibilities can be
interpreted as equally plausible.
Based on investigation within the survey corridor, Site 41AN10 has been either destroyed
altogether or was mis-plotted during its original recording 80 years ago. The evaluated
corridor in the site vicinity does not contain any significant archeological resources that could
be considered SAL- or NRHP-eligible, however, a final route has not been selected at this time.
These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey
may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the site vicinity.
Site 41AN11
Site 41AN11 is a prehistoric ceramic scatter site recorded in 1931 by A. T. Jackson. The site
description mentions “an unlabeled tributary of an unnamed tributary of Caddo Creek...[where]
pots washed out of a bank a number of years ago (Jedry 1983).” The site centroid is mapped
on an undulating landform within a pine plantation and a hardwood forest. An abundance of
secondary growth and deadfall exists resulting in zero percent ground visibility at the time of
survey. According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are sloping
Kirvin-Sacul Association and Hannahatchee sandy loam. Observations made during shovel
testing revealed a typical soil column of 40 centimeters of sandy gravel (10YR 5/2) overlying
another 40 centimeters of sandy gravel (7.5YR 4/6). Modern disturbances within the area
include livestock trampling and natural erosion.
In an attempt to relocate the site from vague descriptions, archeologists excavated 10 shovel
tests in the mapped site vicinity (C395, E385-E390, F369, F371, and F373). All of the shovel
tests were devoid of cultural material, nor were any materials observed on the surface.
If the site is correctly plotted on the Atlas, it no longer exists, as subsurface testing and surface
survey revealed no cultural material. Another possibility is that it has been misplotted, like Site
41AN10. Both sites were recorded more than 80 years ago and their locations may have been
poorly documented. In any case there are no features or artifacts in the vicinity of the mapped
41AN11 boundary within the survey corridor. These interpretations are considered preliminary
and additional coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the
resource once, and if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
41AN190
Site 41AN190 is a prehistoric site with a dense ceramic assemblage. The site is located on
a sporadically tree-covered rise that descends onto an open floodplain that is an abandoned
pasture. The site measures approximately 100 x 150 meters (north/south x east/west) (Figures

10.14 and 10.15). Overall, surface visibility was estimated at 0–25 percent across the site area.
According to the USDA’s Web Soil Survey, soils within the site vicinity are Darco fine sand
with 1–8 percent slopes and sloping Kirvin-Sacul Association. Observations from site shovel
tests revealed a typical soil column of 80 centimeters of uniform sand (10YR 5/1). Modern
disturbances include natural erosion, a two track road, as well as a power line (the latter two
bisect the site area).

Results — Anderson County

Archeologists excavated 16 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41AN190 (A622,
A623, B632, D656, and OT1–OT12; Table 10.3). Of these 16 shovel tests, five (A622, A623,
B632, D656, and OT7) contained subsurface cultural materials. Based on shovel test data, the
cultural deposit is located between 0 and 80 cmbs. The artifact assemblage recovered by field
archeologists includes four lithic flakes (Figure 10.16), one piece of fire-cracked rock, and
more than 75 prehistoric ceramic sherds. From similarities in sherd decoration, paste, and
other attributes, these sherds are believed to make up four to six different vessels. All of the
ceramics were found within Shovel Test A622 between 40 and 60 cmbs.

brown hue on the exterior while the interior is a dark black transitioning to a dark grayish brown
(Figure 10.19) . Vessel 3 contains 42 body sherds (grog temper), one rim sherd, and one base
sherd (Figure 10.20) . All sherds from this vessel are heavily brushed vertically to just below
the outward-flaring rim (Figure 10.21). One sherd also contained an isolated geometric incised
decoration on the exterior consisting of an “X” with a vertical line connecting the two right

while the interior is pale brown (10YR 5/4) suggesting an oxidizing firing environment. Vessel
4 (Figure 10.23) contains six body sherds (unknown temper) with one sherd exhibiting deep,
parallel brushing. These have a light brown exterior and a light gray interior. Vessel 5 (Figure
10.24) consists of one body sherd (grog temper) showing signs of light brushing. The ceramic
sherd is similar to Vessel 4, but is decorated unlike any of the other vessels.
Site 41AN190 is believed to be a prehistoric Caddo occupation site with an extensive ceramic
assemblage. The site, based on shovel test observations, appears to be intact, containing a
possibility for features, organic preservation, and diagnostic materials, the general hallmarks
of a NRHP and/or SAL-eligible resource. Furthermore, the site may correspond with a burial
or cemetery. These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/
or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future
Action route is selected in the site vicinity.

Site 41AN191 is a prehistoric lithic and
ceramic scatter. The site is located within
the IPL evaluation corridor on a graduallysloping terrace near a drainage (Figures
10.25–10.26). Archeologists estimated site
size, based on shovel testing and the extent
of the landform, at 20 x 60 meters (north/
south x east/west). Local vegetation includes
mixed hardwoods, such as pine trees and
greenbriar. Overall, surface visibility was
estimated at 0–25 percent across the site
area. According to the USDA’s Web Soil

sloping Kirvin-Sacul Association sands.
Observations from site shovel tests revealed
a typical soil column of 70 centimeters of sandy loam (10YR 7/3) overlying 10 centimeters of
clay subsoil (7.5YR 4/6). Shovel tests on average terminated at 80 cmbs. Modern disturbances
include the use of the area as a cattle pasture along with natural erosion.
Archeologists excavated 20 shovel tests during their investigations of Site 41AN191 (A500,
A879, B504, B881, B883, B879, C586, E879, E881, E882, E883, and OT1-OT9; Table 10.4).
Of these, four shovel tests (B881, OT1, OT4, and OT6) contained subsurface cultural materials.
Artifacts recorded include two prehistoric utility-ware ceramic sherds, one incised ceramic
body sherd, one incised ceramic rim sherd, five ceramic base sherds, and six tertiary lithic
flakes (Figure 10.27). According to site recorders, sherds ranged from six to ten millimeters
thick with a sandy paste and gray temper that—with the exception of an incised body sherd
from OT4—was very dark gray to black in the interior and tan to reddish brown on the exterior.
Despite the density of ceramics observed, archeologists did not observe any features beyond
the clear concentration of ceramic sherds within Shovel Test OT4.

Site 41AN191 is likely a Caddo period occupation site that is dense enough to likely contain
additional resources that could be considered eligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey
may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the site vicinity.
41AN192
Site 41AN192 is a small early twentieth century cemetery that likely served African-American
tenant farmers living on the surrounding land. It is located approximately two kilometers (1.25
miles) northeast of the community of Frankston, on the northern edge of Anderson County
(Figures 10.28 and 10.29). The site occupies an area of approximately 20 x 25 meters (east/
west x north/south) in unmaintained land that is heavily overgrown and thick with pine trees,
scrub, briars, occasional oaks, and cedars. Ground surface visibility was very low and rarely
exceeded 10 percent in most areas. The landform on which the cemetery is located slopes
gradually downhill from the ridgeline north of the site essentially marked by a two-track road
(visible on modern aerials) with a three foot drop over 50 feet or so then descends more rapidly
south and east of the site (approximately 8–10 feet over 70 feet). The descent is not sharp, but
it is a noticeable change south of the interment area.

Within this area, archeologists recorded
four features including one main
interment (Feature 1) that includes a
headstone and footstone, a second likely
interment (Feature 2) consisting of a
single temporary grave marker, and two
east-west-oriented depressions (Features
3 and 4; Figure 192.2). Additionally,
some secondary indicators of burials
were also noted including very large
oak trees and cedars. No fences, gates,
ornamental flowers, or other cemetery
indicators were observed.
Feature 1 is an east-west-oriented (86
degrees) headstone and footstone, both
of portland cement (Figures 10.30 and
10.31). The stones stand at the foot of
a very large oak tree (approximately
8-foot circumference at chest height).
The 17-inch-tall (exposed) headstone
(located on the east side) is nine inches
wide at the top and widens gradually
outward toward the ground on one face
(approximately 11 inches wide at the
ground surface) and is rectangular in
section (4.5 inches thick). The back
face of the headstone has faint lines
denoting the original wooden mold the
cement was poured into. The front face
is marked with cast, sans serif, all-caps
lettering reading:

Someone appears to have shot the headstone and the last
letters of the first name and possibly the first letters of the
last name are missing. Though the marker has been shot,
moss growth that is comparable to the entire slab suggests
the damage was done some time ago rather than recently.

The footstone is found approximately
7.25 feet to the east of the headstone and
is similar in form but smaller, measuring
nine inches tall and widening outward
from a 7-inch-wide top (again, 4.5 inches
thick). Archeologists did note a slight
rise along the midline between the two
markers but this could simply be from
the tree roots of some of the saplings
growing at this spot.
Feature 2 is a small, 5.5-inch temporary
grave marker made of tin standing
approximately 18 feet northeast of
the headstone (Figures 10.28, 10.32–
10.33). The marker stands alone with
no other accompanying markings and no
card remaining in place. Though it faces
north/south, the sign’s post appears to
have been twisted and once faced east/
west. The marker is embossed in reverse
with the following patents:

Both patents are attributed to temporary grave markers invented and improved upon by a
William F. Norman of Missouri (USPO 1918, 1926). With a temporary marker in place near
the headstone and a marker patent date of 1926 - eight years after the first interment - this
suggests a second burial at this location (Figure 10.34). Like Feature 1, the temporary marker
has been placed at the foot of a very large oak tree that likely was standing at the time of
interment.
Approximately seven feet farther north (approximately 25 feet/7.8 m from Feature 1) is Feature
3, a distinct, shallow depression in the soil that measures approximately 2.5 feet across (Figure
10.28). The depression is linear and oriented east-west. While the depression’s total length is
approximately 10–12 feet, the main portion of the feature measures approximately seven feet

from east to west. Seven feet farther
north (32 feet/9.7 m from Feature
1), is a second, smaller linear eastwest depression. This depression
is shallower than that of Feature 3
and shorter (east-west), measuring
six feet across from east to west and
again approximately two feet wide.
This was documented as Feature 4.
Neither depression was associated
with a marker of any kind and, as
such, may be the result of natural
action; however, their orientation,
size, and association with other,
marked interments suggests that
these are unmarked graves.
In addition to the formal features
recorded at the site, archeologists also
noted other indications of burials in
the vicinity. Large oak trees - much
larger than the prevailing vegetation
in the vicinity - stood at the foot of
Figure 10.34. Schematic drawing
accompanying Patent 1573268.
Features 1 and 2 (to the east) while
an additional three large oaks were
noted along the northern, southern,
and eastern site periphery. Additionally, the site included seven cedar trees, primarily along
the eastern and western site boundaries. No other possibly ornamental vegetation (irises, etc.)
were observed, nor were any other features (particularly south of Feature 1).
Though no subsurface tests were excavated within Site 41AN192, archeologists conducted
twelve close-interval linear surface survey transects across the site area spaced approximately
three meters apart. Surface transects covered an area of approximately 30 x 20 meters (east/
west x north/south). Along each transect, archeologists walked slowly and scanned the ground
surface, sweeping vegetation and leaves away with their feet as they moved forward. No
additional artifacts, features, or depressions were observed along these transects.
During linear archeological survey within the proposed permanent easement south of the
marked site boundary, archeologists found the proposed IPL impact corridor in the site vicinity
to be open and grassy with a hummocky, highly-disturbed ground surface (Figure 10.35).
While the extent of modern disturbance was highest near the cemetery, shovel tests (n=9) in the
surrounding area were all devoid of historic-age resources and none contained any evidence
for the presence of additional unmarked graves (Figure 41AN192.1).

From an indirect-effects
perspective, the site is found
tucked deeply into a thick,
wooded area. Even knowing
exactly where the markers
are located, it is impossible
to see them through the
vegetation even during the
winter when the site was
recorded (Figure 10.36).
The pipeline, being an almost
entirely-subsurface facility,
will not be visible from the
site (or vice versa).

Archival and Oral
History Summary

Archeologists
consulted
a variety of sources in an
effort to identify who is
buried at this site as well as
determine whether or not
the site is a recorded, known
cemetery. First visiting the
Anderson County Clerk’s
office, researchers traced the
parcel’s title as far back as the
early 1900s (as early could be
readily accessed within the
Clerk’s office). According to
the deed records, the parcel
on which the site is found
is a 27.4-acre plot within

by members of the Bizzell
family, whose members have
retained the property since Earl “E.G.,” J. B., and Ethel Bizzell purchased the land from J. B.
Martin et ux. in August of 1919 for $3,000 (Volume 129, Pg. 203–304), paying off the note
on the property three years later (Volume 303, Pg. 175). The deed record skips approximately
seven years as there is no record of the Martin’s purchasing the property or from whom, but R.
E. Brock is recorded in a 1912 deed record for the property as the grantee, purchasing the land
from M. J. Goodson (January 27, 1912; Volume 303, Pg. 175). Jake Goodson, along with a
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Josie Miller subdivided the land a few weeks before in December of 1911. Goodson and Miller
both had a large number of land purchases in the years prior, including many in the Ferguson
League and archeologists could not pinpoint earlier, directly relevant land transactions as a
result. It is likely that the land was in their hands into the late 19th century.
According to Frankston and its Neighbors (Frankston Bicentennial Committees 1976), both
the Miller and Goodson families are prominent in the Frankston community. The town of
Frankston is named after Frankie Miller (a presumed relative of Josie), who donated land for a
public park in 1902 (Frankston had been previously named Ayers). More specifically to this
property, Jake Goodson was the founder of the Goodsonville community located east-northeast
of Frankston (Dempsey 2013; Frankston Bicentennial Committees 1976:264). Goodson is
reported to have operated a 1,400-acre farm in the area into the 1880s and later served as the
Goodsonville Postmaster (ETGS 2006). Site 41AN192 is approximately midway between
Frankston and Goodsonville though Jake Goodson’s sale of the specific parcel on which the
site is found suggests that it is more closely associated with the Goodsonville community.
The current landowner (personal communication) has never actually seen the cemetery but
does recall her grandfather, E. G. Bizzell, telling her that slaves once lived on the land (closer
to a large water tank on the property and well north of the survey corridor) and buried their
dead on the land. According to the owner, the slaves’ granddaughter eventually marked the
burials. While it is more likely a cemetery of freedmen rather than slaves, this would explain
the temporary grave marker on site dating at least eight years after the concrete headstone.
Other members of the Bizzell family familiar with the area (personal communication) knew
of the cemetery and knew that it was used by African-American inhabitants of the land. The
Mount Olive Cemetery was the official African-American cemetery for the community of
Goodsonville (Frankston Bicentennial Committees 1976), but other impromptu burials made
by tenant farmers would be anticipated as well. The family informants recalled four burials at
the cemetery, which would be in accord with field observations. According to the landowner’s
cousin (personal communication), there used to be more markers at the site but occasionally
one would be removed between visits. He recalled the latest burial being some time in the
1950s. With no records of such, it is difficult to verify this information.
As to the name inscribed on the headstone, archeologists reviewed Anderson County birth and
death records at the County Clerk’s office in and around the dates provided on the headstone
and found no record of anyone matching the partial name given. Missing the last letters of the
first name and the first letters (possibly) of the last made name searches difficult. The space
on the headstone suggests that there are maybe three characters that have been removed and a
space so the last name could be Ross, Cross, or Gross. According to the 1900 and 1910 U.S.
Census, there are many Rosses and Grosses (all african-american) living in the vicinity though
none have first names that start with “Du.” A quick search online of common “Du-” first names
shows several good male candidates: Duane, Dub (Irish), Dug, Dugan, Duke, Dumas, Duncan,
but corresponding female names were too obscure to be considered.
Researchers did find a birth record for a Durnal Cross, Jr. in the Anderson County archives
dating to September 1, 1920 (Record of Births Volume 3, Pg. 253). Being a “Junior,” he was
536

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

born to Durnal Cross, Senior. Though the name is a good match to the headstone, the birthdate
does not correspond to the timeline of pregnancy and birth of Durnal Cross, Jr.
Though it does not depict a clear indication of a burial, evidence of Site 41AN192 is visible in
a 1947 aerial photograph of the area. As can be seen in Figure 10.37, the two large oak trees
are visible while a small, white dot near the site’s center may correspond to Features 1 or 2.
Parcel boundaries (particularly to the south) are well-defined even at this somewhat early date
with large trees growing along a fenceline. This suggests that such a boundary was also clearly
visible to those utilizing the area for burials 20–30 years earlier. Plow marks or terracing south
of the cemetery suggests that this land was disturbed as early as the 1940s and further indicates
that unmarked burials within this parcel are unlikely. Since it is not depicted in the historic
aerial, it is evident that the two-track road surrounding the site to the north, was likely diverted
to avoid the site when it was built and, in turn, serves as a reliable northern cemetery boundary
(Figure 10.38).
Summary and Recommendations
Overall, from research conducted, it is evident that Site 41AN192 is an early 20th century
freedmens’ cemetery site containing approximately four interments. Given the site’s location

at the southern edge of
a southward descent,
it is most likely that
additional
interments
(if any) are not located
farther to the south, but
are rather limited to
the flatter upland ridge
farther north, away from
the survey corridor.
Additionally,
though
only two markers are
visible, marker dates
suggest a northward

north. Informants also
recall only four burials
at the site, which would
indicate that all such interments were identified during the site visit and additional burials are
unlikely to extend well beyond the marked site boundary.
Given its association with locally significant historical trends (African-American freedmen
communities of northeast Texas and Goodsonville in particular), the resource could be
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP and could be listed as a SAL as well; however,
more extensive archival research (not conducted for this effort) would likely enhance such
recommendations. The resource is known to the current landowners and is tucked deep into
the woods. Survey data, archival research, and local informants all suggest that the site is
limited to the upper landform 75 feet north of the property boundary. With a proposed final
route yet unselected, it is not possible to determine what IPL-related impacts to the site would
be anticipated. As such, these interpretations are considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and
if, a Future Action route is selected in the site vicinity.
Regardless of location, we recdommend that construction crews be informed to pay particularly
close attention to their operations in the immediate site vicinity and, in the unlikely event that
an additional unmarked interment(s) is found, all work in the site vicinity should cease until
such time as the THC can be informed, the identified resources can be assessed, and a plan for
treatment can be developed. If future projects are anticipated that have the potential to pass
in the cemetery’s vicinity, additional intensive archeological survey is recommended to assure
that additional, previously-unknown interments are not disturbed.

10.6.2 Isolated Finds
A823IF1 includes two quartzite flakes
excavated from two separate shovel tests
(B387 and D436). Shovel Test B387
contained a quartzite flake recovered
between 40 and 60 cmbs, while in the
second shovel test (D436) a quartzite
flake was recorded between 60 and 80
cmbs (Figure 10.39). Seven additional
shovel tests (D435 and OT1–OT6)
were devoid of cultural materials.
Observations from shovel tests revealed
a typical soil column of 100 centimeters
of sand (2.5YR 5/8). The isolated find
lacks associated features, diagnostics,
or overall quantity to warrant additional
investigation or avoidance. Thus, the find
is not considered part of an archeological
site and is ineligible for listing as a SAL
or on the NRHP. These interpretations are
considered preliminary and additional
coordination and/or survey may be
required to assess project impacts to the
resource once, and if, a Future Action
route is selected in the site vicinity.
E847IF1 consists of a small number of
historic-period artifacts along with a
single prehistoric lithic flake adjacent
to a graded private drive in Parcel 847.
A single tertiary flake was excavated
(Shovel Test C1) between 20 and 40 cmbs.
Historic-period debris was recorded
between 0 and 40 cmbs in a neighboring
shovel test (OT3). Historic materials
include a clear “Duraglas” bottle shard
and a shellac 78 rpm record fragment. In
addition to these materials, modern clear
and brown bottle glass shards (OT1) and
pull tabs were observed on the surface
(Figure 10.40–10.41). Additional shovel
tests (OT2, OT4, OT5, and OT6) were
devoid of cultural material. Observations

column of 60 centimeters of sand (10YR 5/2) overlying another 10 centimeters of mottled
sand (7.5YR 5/6). These materials are temporally-mixed, not associated with any features, and
are found within a disturbed setting. They are also too few in number to be considered part
of an archeological site. Therefore, the find is ineligible for listing as a SAL or on the NRHP.
These interpretations are considered preliminary and additional coordination and/or survey
may be required to assess project impacts to the resource once, and if, a Future Action route is
selected in the site vicinity.

10.7	Historic-Age Resources
Along with the archeological sites, AmaTerra architectural historians documented 16 historicage resources older than 50 years of age along various portions of the IPL Future Action
corridor and facility site candidate. With no final route selected, it is impossible to determine
which resources lie within and which lie outside of the 450-foot APE. As such, the resources
presented below are presented with regulatory recommendations outstanding. While the
majority are mid-century home sites as is typical of the region, a few properties date to the
early twentieth century. Below is a summary of the resources documented (Table 10.5).

an open plan. The gabled roofs have no
eaves and are covered with standing seam
metal roofing. The south building has
cattle pens attached to it. The buildings
have no known association with important
historic events, trends, or persons under

siding, and feature pairs of modern three-over-four-light vinyl sash windows. The cross-gabled
roof has two wings bookending a raised, inset, concrete porch with replacement wood ionic
columns. The gable ends have small vents and shallow eaves. Roofing is composite shingle.
A small addition is located on the northwest side of the house. AN805-2 is a circa 1960 onestory metal barn with metal siding and roofing. It has a small shed addition on the south side,
and the side-gabled roof has no eaves. The residence has no known association with important
historic events, trends, or persons under Criteria A and B, and is not a noteworthy example of
architecture under Criterion C. As such, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
AN813-1
AN813-1 is a small, modern multi-family cemetery on CR 3000, approximately a tenth of a
mile north of CR 300, outside of Frankston (Figure 10.46). The cemetery has four modern
grave markers surrounded by a modern chain link fence. In addition to human interments, the
cemetery also contains family pets. Burial dates range from the 1980s to 2011, and all appear
to be related. This resource, being of modern origin, is recommended not eligible for listing

moderate eaves have open soffits but no exposed rafter tails, knee braces, or other Craftsman
styling details. A projecting raised concrete porch has square wood support columns on brick
masonry piers. AN837-2 and AN837-3 are open wood barns or animal shelters, both with
corrugated metal roofing. Both are also in poor condition and no longer in use. The complex
has only nominal association with agricultural practices of Anderson County under Criterion
A, but lacks most of the associated outbuildings that a farmstead would otherwise have. It
has no known association with persons of historic importance under Criterion B, and is not a
particularly noteworthy example of a bungalow (Craftsman or otherwise) under Criterion C.
As such, it is recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Cultural resource specialists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. evaluated potential
construction-related impacts to archeological and non-archeological historic-age resources
that may result from the TRWD and DWU’s IPL project in Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Navarro,
Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas. The field effort was a unique opportunity for
AmaTerra’s cultural resource staff to assist in the pipeline design process, providing feedback
on route selections that ultimately contributed in minimizing adverse effects to cultural
resources. As the data provided in the preceding chapters attests, the cooperative environmental
team succeeded in doing just that. Despite crossing through such environmentally-varied and
culturally-rich terrain, no known or identified Historic Properties or SALs will be impacted
by construction. Through the roughly two years of fieldwork, archeologists and architectural
historians surveyed or desktop-cleared more than 14,000 acres of land on more than 1,100
individual parcels as the line was ultimately refined to its final 93-mile, 1,700-acre currentlyproposed construction footprint of the Proposed Action. An additional 15.7 miles (285.3 acres)
of proposed pipeline construction areas are anticipated as part of the project’s Future Action.
These areas are primarily known corridors (Pipeline Section 9) and facility sites (JB-4) that
are deferred for later construction. Still another approximately 40 miles/740 acres of pipeline
corridor (Pipeline Section 19) and facility sites (Lake Palestine Intake Pump Station) may
be included in the Future Action as well if a route east of the Cedar Creek Pump Station is
eventually finalized. The scale and variety of this effort is brought into focus when the report’s
authors review photographs and field notes, recalling surveyors fighting heat exhaustion in
record-breaking summer heat on the same segment that would earlier have single-digit wind
chill. Other notes from a single surveyor detail surface inspection across a vast, open, plowed
field in Tarrant County followed by deep sandy riparian hillsides more than 100 miles away.
The team consulted with design and permitting representatives on the 278 individual resources
identified that spanned a significant proportion of the region’s heritage, prioritizing those finds
that carried the greatest cultural significance. The AmaTerra team appreciated the opportunity
to contribute their part to this effort and provide the following summary and conclusions to
carry the regulatory process over to the project’s ultimate implementation as smoothly as
possible.

11.1 Archeological Survey Summary
As would be expected on a project of such scale, archeologists traversed a varied natural and
cultural environment along the IPL survey. Survey tactics, in turn, reflect that diversity. The
shallow uplands and plowed fields west of the Trinity River allowed teams to fully evaluate
large swaths of land quickly through surface inspection and limited shovel testing, but dense
riparian woods and lush grasses along the rolling hills in Henderson and Anderson Counties
required an increase in survey intensity to identify resources and assess their significance. To
supplement the intensive surface survey, archeologists excavated more than 12,200 shovel

tests in the roughly 14,000-acre survey, equating to an overall shovel test density of slightly
less than one test per acre (0.9 per acre) for the entire project (Table 11.1). This is more than
twice the minimum density recommended by the THC of 0.33 tests per acre and more than the
THC standards for linear survey (16 tests/mile/100-foot corridor).
Backhoe trenching at the pipeline’s numerous floodplain crossings added data on the potential
for deep site impacts. Archeologists and consulting geomorphologists monitored 42 backhoe
trench excavations during the course of IPL survey. While the overwhelming majority of those
trenches (n=36) were devoid of archeological materials, trenches excavated on the Trinity
River floodplain did exhibit a diffuse scatter of prehistoric occupational debris. With TRWD
electing to shift the pipeline away from the finds, the resources will be avoided. Archeologists
consider 100 percent of the proposed final IPL permanent easement and all proposed facility
sites to be fully assessed at this time and the resources identified during that survey can be
considered a complete inventory.

11.2 	Historic Survey Summary
Much of the land surveyed by the project architectural historians was rural or semi-rural, with
only portions on the west end of the project area in Tarrant County qualifying as suburban.
Parcels were typically large and open and devoted to cultivated fields, active or fallow pasture,
or reclaimed by vegetative growth. The majority of historic-age resources documented by the
survey were thus rural residences and agricultural-related properties. Most parcels did not
have any historic-age resources within the project APE, and many were devoid of buildings
entirely. Others showed evidence of once supporting historic-age resources that had since been
replaced by modern construction, particularly residences. Due to the sparse distribution of the
built environment, TRWD was able to avoid most of the built environment and made an effort
to route around historic-age resources whenever possible. As stated previously, the letting date
for the proposed Future Action is not currently known. With NRHP guidelines providing a
cutoff of historic-age resources at 50 years or more, buildings, etc. recorded during this survey
that correspond with these Future Action areas can not be assessed until it is determined if they
indeed will be of historic age at the time of construction. Accordingly NRHP eligibility can not
be determined for these resources at this time. Furthermore, additional structures in the vicinity
may not have been 50 years old at the time of the current survey that may be that age once a
letting date is determined.

Conclusions and Recommendations

11.3	Resource Summary
11.3.1 General Overview
The 71 archeological sites recorded during the IPL survey represent a broad temporal and
cultural range (Table 11.2; Figure 11.1). Individually, the sites reflect distinct historic and
prehistoric materials and activities along the IPL pipeline but collectively they represent
broader trends in cultural development and lifeways from prehistoric site location and resource
procurement preference to historic sharecropper occupational patterning. While some sites
contained components that would be clearly considered significant (Sites 41HE299, 41AN191,
41NV714, etc.), others were minor, most often consisting of historic trash scatters or isolated
prehistoric debris (Sites 41NV715, 41HE375, and others). As a rule, all sites located within the
project’s permanent easement or facility site footprint fall into the latter category and project
construction will not impact SAL or NRHP-eligible resources. Finally, TRWD avoided all
archeological resources that had any potential for significance, applying a 50-foot avoidance
buffer around those resources that has, to this point, seen no design incursion. With those
avoidance zones respected in the remainder of the pipeline design process and the subsequent
construction phase, these significant historic and prehistoric sites will not be impacted by the
IPL project.

Of the 128 non-archeological historic-age properties identified by cultural resource specialists
in the defined project APE (all portions of the IPL project east of the proposed Cedar Creek
Pump Station are yet to be finalized and resources identified in these areas are not included
in this tally), the majority are not NRHP-eligible due to a lack of significance under the four
Criteria. Other properties have some level of significance, typically under Criteria A or C, but
suffer from integrity issues that interfere with the properties’ ability to convey significance
(Table 11.3). A number of properties identified by survey efforts have NRHP potential, but
none of these potentially eligible properties are within the final project alignment APE. All
properties within the final project alignment APE are recommended not eligible for NRHP
listing.

11.3.2 NRHP Historic Districts
Survey efforts did not identify any eligible historic districts within the final project alignment
APE. One potential district may encompass part of the community of Bardwell, but none of the
potential contributing properties surveyed during investigations of previous proposed project
alignments are in the final project alignment APE.

11.3.3 Rural Historic Landscapes
The Department of the Interior defines a rural historic landscape as “a geographical area that
historically has been used by people, or shaped or modified by human activity, occupancy,
or intervention, and that possesses a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of areas
of land use, vegetation, buildings and structures, roads and waterways, and natural features.”
They commonly reflect the lives of those engaged in agricultural pursuits such as farming,
ranching, or fishing, but not necessarily so. Rural historic landscapes are defined by eleven
characteristics (National Park Service 1999):
• Land use and activities are the major human forces that shape and organize rural communities.
• Patterns of spatial organization define the relationships among major physical components,
predominant landforms, and natural features.

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

551

Chapter 11

Conclusions and Recommendations

• Responses to the natural environment are reflected in the siting of buildings, construction
materials, and the location of clusters of buildings and structures, as well as traditions in land
use, construction methods, and social customs.
• Cultural traditions in the form of religious beliefs, social customs, ethnic identity, and trades and
skills may be evident today in both physical features and uses of the land.
• Circulation networks are systems for transporting people, goods, and raw materials from one
point to another, varying in size from footpaths to railroad lines.
• Boundary demarcations delineate areas of ownership and land use through the use of fences,
walls, tree lines, hedge rows, drainage or irrigation ditches, roadways, creeks, and rivers.
• Vegetation related to land use includes not only crops, trees, or shrubs planted for agricultural
and ornamental purposes, but also trees that have grown up incidentally along fence lines, beside
roads, or in abandoned fields.
• Buildings, structures, and objects are the various types of buildings, structures, and objects serve
human needs related to the occupation and use of the land.
• Clusters are groupings of like features resulting from function, social tradition, climate, or other
influences, cultural or natural.
• Archeological sites may provide valuable information about the ways the land has been used,
patterns of social history, or the methods and extent of activities such as shipping, milling,
lumbering, or quarrying.
• Small-scale elements such as foot bridges, sign posts, or hay bales add to the historic setting of a
rural landscape, and may be characteristic of a region.

Rural historic landscapes follow the same general guidelines for evaluation as other properties
under the Criteria, although due to their complex nature they are commonly significant under
more than one of the Criteria and may have to meet one or more of the Criteria Considerations
depending on the composition of contributing elements. Rural historic landscapes must also
retain sufficient integrity to convey their significance. While no landscape will appear exactly
as it did during the historic period due to their variable and mutable nature, the landscape must
retain the general character and feeling of the historic period. Which aspects of integrity must
be retained will vary depending on the reasons behind the landscape’s significance, but in
general the aspects of setting, feeling, and association are particularly important.
The area covered by the proposed Integrated Pipeline alignment is vast and stretches across
numerous separate counties, all with strong historic traditions of agriculture, ranching, and
other rural industries. To facilitate an analysis of potential rural historic landscapes, historians
divided the project area up by county with the understanding that some overlap could occur
along county lines.
Tarrant County
Of the counties investigated for the project, Tarrant County has undoubtedly undergone the
most significant changes over the past fifty years. The south end of the county, once dominated
by farm and ranch acreage, has been slowly transformed by suburban growth and the oil
industry. Cultivated fields have given way to scrubby grazing land, which in turn has been
552

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

left fallow or subdivided and developed into modern residential suburbs. In areas where
suburbia has not yet gained a solid foothold, gas and oil wells dot the landscape. Transportation
networks, in the form of roads, highways, and railroads, have changed as well. Railroad lines
have been abandoned and removed, roads have been straightened and widened, and freeways
have replaced some lower capacity highways. Where once large empty tracts of land separated
neighbors, small isolated houses now dot the landscape. Some of these residences have picked
up the historic practices of ranching, but on a much smaller and more casual scale than the
ranches that historically made their living off the trade. What agriculture remains is largely
in the realm of large-scale agribusiness rather than the family farms that helped build the
county. New reservoirs and tanks dot the landscape, a response to the mid-century droughts
that plagued the state.
Overall, while pockets of rural activity remain in south Tarrant County through which the
proposed alignment runs, the landscape has changed sufficiently to significantly alter the
historic setting. With changes to almost every one of the eleven characteristics of a rural
historic landscape, project historians recommend that no rural historic landscapes fall within
the project APE.
Johnson County
Unlike Tarrant County, Johnson County has remained relatively rural. As a whole, the county
still retains an agrarian feel, with large farms, limited suburban growth, and roadways following
historic routes. Parts of the county reflect some changes in land use, from crop cultivation to
ranching and back (or left fallow), or increased oil and gas exploration. In the northeast corner,
through which the proposed final project alignment cuts, change has been more apparent. This
corner is in close proximity to Tarrant County and Mansfield, and while it has not experienced
the level of growth of its northern neighbor, it has experienced notable change in the past 15-20
years. Particularly, small subdivisions and residential developments now dot roadways that
once bordered only cultivated fields. The rural character has shifted somewhat from large tracts
of land devoted to one or two crops, to smaller subdivided parcels occupied by newer homes
with limited agricultural activity, primarily small-scale cattle or horse ranching. Overall, the
changes in the northeast corner of Johnson County impact the eleven characteristics to a degree
that historians recommend no rural historic landscapes fall within the project APE.
Ellis County
Ellis County, like Johnson County, has remained relatively rural over the past several decades.
The county still supports a healthy agricultural economy and related industries. Suburban
development has been mostly restricted to the major cities, including Waxahachie, Midlothian,
and Ennis. The two interstate highways, IH 35E and IH 45, also support significant levels of
development (particularly in the north end of the county, approaching Dallas County). In these
urban areas and transportation corridors, changes have been significant, with altered roadways,
subdivision and development of agricultural land, and and expansion of the “semi-rural”
lifestyle that includes a domestic residence on agricultural land, with small-scale ranching
operations. Outside of the cities, however, the landscape is more static. Agricultural industries

553

Chapter 11

Conclusions and Recommendations

have changed to some degree, with different crops and a shift to agribusiness as opposed to
smaller-scale individual holdings. Or, the shift has been from crop cultivation to ranching.
Some FM roads have seen increased development, but the fields beyond the houses remain.
Around the community of Bardwell in particular, the landscape has undergone only minor
alterations over the past several decades, with the largest changes again being variations in crop
agriculture, changes in parcel size and fence lines, and an uptick in residential development
along roads.
Overall, the changes to the rural landscape in Ellis County have been significant enough to alter
the historic setting while retaining the overall rural character of the county. Around Bardwell,
there is moderate potential for the existence of a rural historic landscape within the project
APE due to the relative static nature of land use, transportation networks, apparent parcel
boundaries, human activities, and the built environment.
Navarro County
Navarro County, another rural county similar to Johnson and Ellis counties, has nonetheless
seen more changes overall to its make-up than some of its neighbors. Like many rural Texas
counties with an agricultural economy, Navarro County’s landscape has changed with the
move from small-scale family farms to large-scale agribusinesses and ranching operations.
Interspersed among the larger agricultural businesses are small residential plots supporting
modern or recently historic houses and small-scale, personal ranching operations (horses,
cattle, or mixed livestock). Fallow or under-used land is also more prominent in Navarro
County, with increased vegetation growth apparent along water courses and across oncecultivated fields. Near population centers, residential development into the neighboring fields
is more pronounced than in the county hinterlands. Roadways and transportation corridors
have changed, with many roads being straightened through the elimination of 90-degree turns,
jogs, and T-intersections to create unified routes. Other roads have been abandoned or reduced
to seldom-traveled pathways upon the disappearance of the farms and ranches that once sat
along the roads or at their termini. While the north part of Navarro County is still distinctly
rural, the changes to land use patterns, vegetation, parcels, transportation networks, and the
built environment has impacted the historic setting to a degree that historians feel there is
limited potential for a rural historic landscape within the project APE.
Henderson County
Henderson County, like other rural counties in north Texas, has experienced changes over the
past several decades as the economy has shifted and evolved. Early county agricultural efforts
were mainly focused on cotton and grain crops, but began shifting to vegetables and fruits in
the mid-twentieth century. Timber was never a strong industry as the piney woods are limited
to the east end of the county, so early tree clearing was mainly done to open acreage for crop
cultivation. With the reduction of large yield crop agriculture such as cotton, livestock ranching
increased significantly in the second half of the twentieth century. As a result of these shifts in
agriculture, tree and vegetation cover increased as more land was turned over to grazing, and
cultivated areas shifted from near water courses to flatter areas. Oil exploration and production
554

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

also increased, introducing new elements to the historic landscape that were not present where
they now exist. Transportation corridors transitioned from railroad-based to highway-based,
although the existing roadways remained relatively stable. One of the largest changes to the
historic landscape was the impounding of county rivers and streams to create large reservoirs
in response to the droughts of the 1950s. Suburban development has been mostly limited to
Athens and the shorelines of the reservoirs, with scattered homesteads throughout more rural
areas. Many of these land-use changes occurred between 1950-1990; since then, the landscape
has been more static.
As a result of these shifts, land use and vegetation patterns have been altered significantly from
the historic period. The built environment has also changed to a lesser degree, with newer
agricultural outbuildings replacing historic barns and sheds. While Henderson County is still
primarily rural with an agricultural base, the historic usage patterns have been changed to a
degree that historians recommend no rural historic districts exist within the project APE in
Henderson County.
Anderson County
The IPL’s Future Action may pass through the northwest corner of Anderson County including
the land north of the town of Frankston. Long a timber producing county, Anderson County
nonetheless supported a modest agricultural economy. Historic land use patterns in the north
part of the county have remained relatively static over the past several decades, with the
largest changes lying with vegetation and tree cover and the built environment. Historically
the area had little population, with most residents living within Frankston and only scattered
farmsteads in the surrounding area. In recent decades, increasing numbers of homes and small
establishments, industrial complexes, and other facilities have been built along county roads.
Fields have been converted to grazing land or left fallow in places, creating an ever-changing
patchwork of land use and vegetation patterns over the past several decades. Historians require
a formal APE and letting date to confirm the presence or absence of rural historic landscapes
in this area.
Rural Historic Landscape Recommendations and Potential Effects
Of the five counties covered by the proposed project alignment and APE, project historians
recommend only Ellis County has any potential for hosting a rural historic landscape around
the community of Bardwell, as noted above. The remaining five counties have all undergone
changes to land use, vegetation patterns, circulation networks, the built environment, patterns of
human activity, and related characteristics such that the historic character of the rural landscape
has been adversely impacted, and no rural historic landscape exists within the project APE for
Tarrant, Johnson, Navarro, and Henderson counties.
Project historians did not perform a full analysis of the rural historic landscape around
Bardwell and the boundaries of a potential district have not been defined. However, the
proposed project’s potential for adverse effect to the historic characteristics of the landscape is
minimal. The proposed pipeline would be underground and not visible for the majority of its
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

555

Chapter 11

Conclusions and Recommendations

length. At access points and other limited areas where it would be visible, the impact would
be minimal. Around Bardwell, the proposed pipeline parallels an existing natural gas pipeline.
With no visible physical impacts to the landscape and little change to the historic patterns of
use aside from ROW for the pipeline alignment, the proposed project has limited potential to
significantly alter the eleven characteristics of a rural historic landscape.

11.3.3 County Archeological Summaries
Covering such a large area across a highly-varied physiographic landscape, the IPL survey
affords the opportunity to explore both historic and prehistoric occupational trends for the
region on a broader scale. Though constrained by engineering preference (avoiding populated
areas, major water crossings, highly-varied terrain, etc.), the compiled archeological resource
information collected from this survey is noteworthy when viewed with this perspective in
mind. While hardly revolutionary, archeological site trends depicted in Table 11.2 and Figure
11.1 do indeed confirm understood prehistoric and historic archeological site distribution
models for the region (Perttula 2004; Prikryl 1990). Viewing Figure 11.1 as a regional density
trend from west to east across the IPL corridor, it is easy to identify understood cultural patterns
in north-central and northeast Texas (see Chapter 2) as occupations progressively increase in
number with distance toward the east (depicted as a decline in the acres/site vertical bars) while
prehistoric site proportions jump significantly east of the Trinity River. The anomalous Tarrant
County is likely the result of survey taking place near denser population centers that, in turn,
provided a larger number of sites.
With all lands available for both prehistoric and historic occupation, these patterns indicate
cultural preference through time. Adjusting for sites per acre, historic sites stay roughly the
same throughout the survey’s various counties, ranging from as little as 276 acres per site
(Navarro County) to as much as 590 acres per site (Johnson County) and returning a standard
deviation of 108.6. Prehistoric sites, on the other hand, vary widely with site densities ranging
from as few as 111 acres per site in Anderson County to more than 3,000 acres in Navarro
County (and possibly beyond as Johnson and Ellis County’s tally of 0 prehistoric sites were
excluded from calculation). With a standard deviation of nearly 1,500, prehistoric occupational
preference is much more obvious with prehistoric individuals, families, and communities
preferring to live farther east, in the more resource-rich lands and varied terrains of Henderson
and Anderson Counties and avoiding (at least for longer-term occupational purposes) the flat,
dry, open blackland prairies of Ellis, Johnson, and Tarrant Counties. This hypothesis must,
however, be tempered with the understanding that many prehistoric sites were destroyed by
erosion and deep burial long ago and historic farming activities also invariably dispersed site
remnants, making them more difficult to find by archeologists.
Tarrant County
Within both the Proposed and Future Action corridors, archeological resource quantities within
Tarrant County were middling compared to all of the remaining survey areas, coming in at 145
acres per recorded resource (versus the project average of 124 acres per resource; see Table
11.2 and Figure 11.1). This density does not match the overall occupational trend observed in
556

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

the remaining five survey counties, but this is most likely the result of the survey being so close
to population centers that included several of the recorded historic-age archeological sites. The
nine total resources recorded included three historic farmsteads (41TR243, 41TR251-252),
a historic railroad bed (41TR238), one prehistoric lithic scatter (41TR137, missing from the
survey corridor), and four minor isolates. Of these, five resources (41TR238, 251–252, and
A66IF1-2) are located at least partially within the proposed IPL permanent easement and may
be impacted by construction. The sites identified are primarily minor historic surface structural
ruins with a small complement of surficial and shallowly-buried early-to-mid-twentieth century
domestic debris, resources that are ubiquitous in rural areas across the state. Through thorough
surface inspection, shovel testing, and complementing archival review, none of these sites
are recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP or as SALs. Work conducted during the
current survey has, by the estimate of the Principal Investigator, exhausted the viable research
potential of each site and more extensive investigations are unwarranted in each case. Site
41TR238, the historic-age interurban railroad bed, is considered a more noteworthy resource
because of its heritage in the region, but is in too poor of condition and lacks integrity of
feeling, materials, and other elements necessary for consideration as NRHP/SAL-eligible.
Johnson County
The small portion of the IPL corridor that crosses into Johnson County had the lowest density
of archeological resources in the survey at 295 acres per resource (see Table 11.2 and Figure
11.1). Though archeologists surveyed only 590 acres within the county, the dearth of recorded
resources follows the recorded density trends of the other counties quite well, suggesting it is
an accurate assessment of overall occupation within the county as a whole. The county’s two
recorded resources include one small historic-age trash and brick scatter (41JN71) and one
additional, extremely diffuse surficial trash scatter (A230IF3). Both sites are being avoided by
the IPL Proposed Action (the only action proposed in the county), and their scant assemblage
suggests relatively low integrity and research potential, making them ineligible for listing on
the NRHP or as SALs.
Ellis County
Moving east into Ellis County, the Proposed and Future IPL Actions cross into very lowdensity historic-age occupational areas that are devoid of prehistoric resources. Covering the
largest area of any county in the survey, Ellis’ tally of 18 archeological resources (11 sites and 7
isolates) in more than 4,400 acres (248.6 acres per recorded resource; see Table 11.2 and Figure
11.1) is indicative of a particularly sparsely-occupied region (historically and prehistorically)
in the state. With surveyors crossing vast stretches of open, plowed fields that have likely been
actively cultivated for more than a century, this site paucity is understandable. The 11 sites
(41EL88, 101, 248–249, 255, 259, 257, 259–262) are all various iterations of relatively minor
late nineteenth and early twentieth century rural farmsteads and associated trash scatters. In
some instances (41EL259, for example) the site contains several substantial structures that are
collectively a functional remnant of an active farmstead. In others, such as Site 41EL248, there
is virtually nothing extant; the site having been destroyed by years of repeated plowing and (in
that site’s particular case) gas pipeline construction. Site 41EL155, recorded previously in the
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

557

Chapter 11

Conclusions and Recommendations

area, did not contain components within the survey footprint. Of the 18 resources recorded,
nine are located within proposed easements/construction footprints and may be impacted by
construction. Investigations conducted during the survey suggest that all of these sites lack the
integrity and/or data potential to be considered NRHP- or SAL-eligible.
Navarro County
Continuing into Navarro County, the Proposed IPL action moves into increasingly
archeologically-rich areas of the survey. Investigations within Navarro County covered a
relatively broad area, with investigators not only evaluating the east-west-trending main corridor,
but also the two north-south-trending IPL Section 16 alternatives, both of which parallel the
Trinity River a few miles to its west. With a tally of 23 resources (13 sites - 41NV599, 706–
710, 714–715, 717–721 - and 10 isolates) in 3,313 surveyed acres (144 acres per resource),
the archeological assemblage continues to be decidedly historic-dominant (see Table 11.2 and
Figure 11.1). Where observed, evidence of prehistoric occupation is limited to isolated flakes
and/or individual burned rocks (IFs A426IF4, A428IF5, D431IF1, and D438IF1) or are more
dense occupations along the banks of the Trinity River (Site 41NV599). An isolated, likely outof-context biface fragment (D905IF1) completes the prehistoric components of the Navarro
County resources recorded during survey. With the exception of Site 41NV599, which is being
avoided by the current IPL design plans, these prehistoric resources lack artifact density or
integrity and would not likely yield significant new data from additional investigations.
The county’s historic-age element continues to be consistent with broad regional trends of
isolated late nineteenth and early twentieth century farmsteads, though many of the resources
recorded during survey were decidedly better-preserved. Site 41NV718, located in the proposed
JB2 facility site, contains the scant remnants of a prominent local family’s early twentieth
century farmstead with the outline of a main residence, a barn, and a storage structure built
from reclaimed, hand-hewn lumber of an earlier structure. Survey at the site, however, revealed
non-diagnostic, redundant artifact collections of broken glass and nails that do not indicate
a significant research potential. A short distance to the south, and outside of the proposed
impact footprint, Site 41NV707 contained an equally broad variety of occupational features
including a well, house foundation piers, and a WPA-era sanitary privy (among others). Site
41NV714, located in a now-abandoned facility site candidate, contained a cistern substantial
enough to be likely linked to individuals of some prominence while the surficial ash and
charcoal scatter mixed with artifacts nearby indicates a residence may have burned down and
potentially preserved a large amount of data. As a result, there is a high potential that additional
investigations could be fruitful in expanding our knowledge of the early twentieth century
occupations in the region. None of the sites that have the potential to be impacted by IPL
construction are, however, considered eligible for NRHP/SAL listing.
Henderson County
Crossing the Trinity River, the archeological landscape changes rather abruptly with prehistoric
resources now outnumbering historic ones (actually more than doubling them). Furthermore,
density of those resources increase significantly as well (see Table 11.2 and Figure 11.1). With

archeologists surveying slightly more land in Henderson County than in neighboring Navarro
County (3,787 acres versus the previous 3,313) and recording more than twice the number of
archeological sites and isolates (53 in Henderson County [including recorded Sites 41HE198199, 205/221, 223-224, 299, 342, 368-379, 381-397] - 71.45 acres per resource - versus
23 in Navarro - 144.04 acres per resource), the cultural landscape is indicative of a much
more desirable region for prehistoric groups. In Henderson County, archeological sites often
contained buried components (common in sandy mantle settings such as this) with a wider
variety of prehistoric artifact classes including lithics (41HE368), tools (including projectile
points; 41HE372), and ceramics (primarily plain and decorated utility wares attributed to
Caddo-period occupations; e.g., 41HE375). Within Henderson County, the IPL project corridor
is divided into the Proposed Action west of Cedar Creek Reservoir, including the proposed
Cedar Creek Pump Station, and the yet-unfinalized Future Action (east of the proposed Cedar
Creek Pump Station). Accordingly, at this time it is impossible to define trends in potential
IPL-related site impacts until such time as the Future Action in this area is identified.
Anderson County
With archeologists surveying less land than Johnson County, Anderson County’s tally of seven
recorded archeological resources (five archeological sites - 41AN10-11, 190–192 - and two
isolates) suggests that occupation near the eastern terminus is proportionally the densest of
the survey (63 acres per site). With the exception of the historic-age cemetery site recorded
during survey (41AN192), all recorded resources within Anderson County were prehistoricaged containing varying complements of prehistoric lithics (flakes) and ceramics (most notably
at Site 41AN190). Sites 41AN10 and 11, though intensively investigated within the survey
corridor, could not be relocated. At this time, all of the proposed Future Action’s Anderson
County components have not been finalized and it is likewise impossible to define trends in
potential IPL-related site impacts until such time as the Future Action is identified in this area.

11.4	Regulatory Recommendations
11.4.1 Proposed Action
As described in detail in Chapter 1, the IPL’s Proposed Action spans most of the total project
footprint with components in Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, and Henderson Counties
(depicted in blue in Figure 1.1). New facilities proposed as part of this Action include Pipeline
Segments 10-18 (93.5 miles in length to be constructed within a 150-foot-wide permanent
easement), the Midlothian Balancing Reservoir (223 acres), the JB-2 and JB-3 Booster Pump
Stations (280.5 and 365 acres, respectively), and the Cedar Creek Pump Station (22 acres). In
addition, the Proposed Action includes expanded capacity within the existing boundaries of
the Richland-Chambers Pump Station (16 acres). A total of approximately 1,701 acres of land
are proposed for impacts as a result of this project component. Archeologists and architectural
historians have fully evaluated the Proposed Action’s potential for direct and indirect effects
to significant cultural resources and have determined that the engineers’ resource-avoidance
strategy has been successful (Table 11.4). Although potential exists for a rural historic landscape

Cultural Resource Survey of the Proposed Integrated Pipeline
Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Chapter 11

Conclusions and Recommendations

around the community of Bardwell in Ellis County, the proposed undertaking would have no
adverse effect on such a district. In accordance with 36 CFR 800 and the ACT, the IPL’s
Proposed Action is recommended to proceed with no Historic Properties or SALs affected and
no further cultural resource coordination required. If, following this submittal, design plans
change substantially from those described in this volume, additional coordination and possibly
field investigations may be required to assess these possible deviations from evaluated areas.
Additionally, in the unlikely event that significant cultural resources are identified during
construction that have not been included in this volume, all work in the area should cease until
such time as those materials/buildings can be assessed by specialists and the findings from
those assessments coordinated with representatives of the THC.

11.4.2 Future Action (Known but Deferred)
Many components of the IPL’s proposed Future Action are currently defined and will be
constructed within the design parameters outlined in previous chapters (depicted in red in
Figure 1.1). These deferred-but-known components include the proposed Pipeline Segment
9 (15.7 miles in length, also installed within a proposed 150-foot-wide permanent easement)
and the JB-4 Booster Pump Station (49.3 acres). These Future Action components will require
approximately 285.3 acres of additional lands within Tarrant and Ellis Counties. As with the
Proposed Action, archeologists fully assessed these components’ potential to impact significant
resources. The Principal Investigator recommends that these components do not have the
potential to impact archeological Historic Properties or SALs, and construction should proceed
with no further archeological resource coordination required under the guidelines of 36 CFR
800 and the ACT (see Table 11.4). With no defined letting date for this proposed Future Action,
however, non-archeological cultural resource impacts can not be determined at this time.
Additional coordination and/or survey is recommended to determine effects to above-ground
resources once a specific timeline can be defined. The data relevant to these components that
are provided in this volume will go a long way toward this assessment but additional data may
be required.

11.4.3 Future Action (Undetermined)
Approximately 40 miles of IPL pipeline and the projected Lake Palestine Pump Station are
also proposed as part of this Future Action in Henderson and Anderson Counties (depicted in
black in Figure 1.1), but the specific locations of these components are not known at this time.
Archeologists and architectural historians did survey approximately 3,580 acres of potential
APEs within these counties; however with no project APE defined, it is not possible to assess the
project’s impacts to cultural resources. Accordingly, additional cultural resource coordination
and/or field investigation is recommended once component designs are known and proposed.
If these Future Action components ultimately fall within the cultural resource survey footprints
depicted within this volume, observations made during this survey can be applied to effects
determinations (particularly for archeological resources). As TRWD ultimately selects a final
route, they will adhere to the successful avoidance strategies utilized on the project up to

564

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

this point. It is expected that no Historic properties or SALs will be adversely affected by
construction in these areas but further coordination will be required.

11.4.4 Kennedale Balancing Reservoir (Independent Action)
As stated in previous chapters, TRWD is also proposing to expand the existing KBR facility
near the community of Kennedale in southern Tarrant County as an independent action. While
surveyed under the same antiquities permit as the IPL project, this construction will proceed as
an independent action. Archeologists surveyed the proposed expansion footprint and found it
severely disturbed by others from previous borrow activities with only small, isolated pockets
of intact, shallow sediments. No archaeological sites or isolates were observed in this area.
Project historians adopted an APE of adjacent parcels for the KBR expansion as the independent
action involves improvements to an existing facility as opposed to new construction, minimizing
the potential for adverse effects to properties in the vicinity of the facility. The historic-age
Hudson Cemetery was documented south of the existing KBR site as KBRa-1 while KBRa2-4 were three modified historic-age residential structures immediately north of the proposed
facility. None of the resources are considered NRHP-eligible.

11.4.5 Additional Recommendations and Comments
If, following this submittal, design plans change substantially from those described in this
volume, additional coordination and possibly field investigations may be required to assess
these possible deviations’ potential for impacts to significant cultural resources. Additionally,
in the unlikely event that significant archeological resources, including but not limited to human
remains, are identified during the course of construction, all work in the vicinity should cease
until details of the find can be coordinated with representatives of the THC and, if necessary,
additional data is gathered from the site.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of Antiquities Permit 5826. All project-generated
notes, photographs, forms, and other materials will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archaeological Studies at Texas State University in San Marcos.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND WORK PLAN FOR ARCHEOLOGICAL
SURVEY FOR THE LAKE PALESTINE TO BENBROOK LAKE
INTEGRATED PIPELINE (IPL), TARRANT, JOHNSON, ELLIS,
NAVARRO, HENDERSON, AND ANDERSON COUNTIES, TEXAS
Prepared by
Ecological Communications Corporation
Austin, Texas
November 17, 2010

1.0

INTRODUCTION

This research design and work plan has been developed by Ecological Communications
Corporation (EComm) in response to a request by Freese and Nichols, Incorporated (FNI) to
conduct a cultural resources survey in advance of a new water supply pipeline that has been
proposed by the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD). The proposed pipeline has been
designated as the “Integrated Pipeline” (IPL) because it will serve both the City of Dallas and
TRWD. The proposed pipeline will run approximately 147 miles across north-central Texas
between Lake Palestine in Anderson County and Benbrook Lake in Tarrant County. The
pipeline will transport water for the City of Dallas from Lake Palestine to Joe Pool Lake. The
pipeline will also transport water for the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) from Cedar
Creek Lake and Richland Chambers Reservoir to Benbrook Lake and various water treatment
plants on the line. Location of the proposed pipeline is shown in Figure 1.1.
Because the TRWD and the City of Dallas are governmental jurisdictions of the State of
Texas and because the pipeline will require purchase of permanent easements, the IPL will be
subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Most of the pipeline route
is private property, owned by more than 900 individual property owners. For pipeline
permitting purposes, TRWD serves as landowner and has signed the Antiquities permit
application. Importantly, no survey will take place on private property for which a signed
right-of-entry agreement has not been obtained. The goal of the survey will be to locate,
identify, and assess any archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the proposed
development and to evaluate such resources for their eligibility for potential designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
In addition, because the pipeline will require a 404 permit from the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE), it will also be subject to the provisions of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA). The USACE, Fort Worth District will serve
as the lead Federal agency in the Section 106 consultation process. The goal of the survey will
be to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources including standing structures as well
as archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the proposed development and to
evaluate such resources for their eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).

THE STUDY AREA AND AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT

The study area crosses six counties (Anderson, Henderson, Navarro, Ellis, Johnson, and
Tarrant) and 23 USGS 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles (Berryville, Poynor, La Rue, Coon
Creek Lake, Athens, Mallard Hill, Malakoff, Kerens, Goodlow Park, Bazette, Chatfield,
Emhouse, Cryer Creek, Ennis West, Forreston, Boz, Midlothian, Venus, Britton, Mansfield,
Burleson, Primrose, Benbrook). The APE is depicted on these quadrangles in Appendix A,
sheets A-1 through A-22.
The pipeline design includes eight engineering segments. These range from 72 inches (1.83
m) in diameter to 108 inches (2.74 m) in diameter (Table 1-1). Total length of all pipeline
segments is 147.4 miles (237.2 km). Complete engineering details are not available at this
time. However, most of the pipeline will be installed in an open trench excavated to about 1330 ft (4-10 m) below the ground surface. In selected locations, including primary river and
stream crossings and under TxDOT rights of way, the pipeline will be tunneled. Width of the
excavated trench will be approximately 11-15 ft (3.4-4.6 m) wide and all pipeline construction
activities will be restricted to a 150 ft (46 m) wide construction easement (75 ft/23 m on either
side of the construction centerline).

centerline) within which the 150-foot construction easement will be located for pipeline
placement. This 450-foot corridor is the proposed archeological Area of Potential Effects
(APE) for the project. The APE contains approximately 8,027 acres along the pipeline route
(Table 1-1).
In addition, the APE includes three intake pump stations and two, or possibly three, booster
stations. The three booster stations total 334 acres and range in size from 11 acres to 132
acres (Table 1-2). Of the six stations, five would be new developments while the Richland
Chambers Pump Station is an existing facility and has been previously inventoried for cultural
resources (Raab and Moir 1981). Subtracting the 18 acres of the Richland Chambers Pump
Station, a total of 316 acres will be surveyed. Impacts at the booster stations will involve
significant ground disturbance to depths of 15-30 ft (4.6-9.1 m) to create impoundment
basins.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

3.1

Natural Environment and Geology

Within the 147.4 miles of the proposed IPL route, the alignment traverses across two
physiographic regions known as the Gulf Coastal Plains and Grand Prairie. The Gulf Coastal
Plains is the largest physiographic region in Texas, which stretches from North Central Texas
to the Gulf of Mexico. The region is further divided into three subprovinces; the Coastal
Plains, Interior Coastal Plains, and Blackland Prairies (Wermund 1996). Due to the vast
amount of land the Gulf Coastal Plains and Grand Prairie occupy, five different vegetative
zones are present within the proposed project area, including: the Pineywoods, Post Oak
Savanna, Blackland Prairies, East Cross Timbers, and Ft. Worth Prairie (Diggs et al. 1999)
(Figures 2.1).
Interior Coastal Plains

Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

Based on the underlying geological formations, soil composition, and vegetative setting, it
appears the segment spanning from the pipeline’s eastern terminus at Lake Palestine, in
Anderson County, to just east of I-45, in Navarro County, is located within the Interior
Coastal Plains (Coffee 1975; Diggs et al. 1999; Hatherly and Mays; 1979 Meade et al. 1974).
The Interior Coastal Plains contain two distinct vegetative zones known as the Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savanna. Within the proposed APE, the Pineywoods are limited to an area
stretching from Lake Palestine, west toward the city of Athens. Naturally forested areas
within the Pineywoods include mature pine and mixed pine-hardwood stands with secondary
growth and briar (Soil Survey Staff 2010). As the IPL route progresses westward, the
Pineywoods transitions into Post Oak Savanna vegetation. The Post Oak Savanna is
characterized by a deciduous overstory containing oak, hickory, sweetgum, elm, and cedar.
The understory is characterized by mixed grasses, secondary growth, and briar (Soil Survey
Staff 2010).

Figure 2.1 IPL alignment (marked in red) with physiographic regions and vegetation zones.

Geologically, the Interior Coastal Plains are characterized as containing “alternating belts of
resistant uncemented sands among weaker shales that erode into long sandy ridges”
(Wermund 1996: 1). The APE crosses three geological groups within the Interior Coastal
Plains: Claiborne, Wilcox, and Midway. These geological groups contain nine different
formations that have created this setting. These formations are Eocene in geological age and

include the Weches Formation (Ew), Sparta Sand (Es), Queen City Sand (Eqc), Reklaw
Formation (Er), Carrizo Sand (Ec), Wilcox undivided (EPawi), Fluviatile terrace deposits
(Qt), Alluvium (Qal), and Willis Point Formation (PAwp) (Barnes 1972) (Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.2 Proposed IPL alignment (marked in red) with physiographic regions
and geological groups.

Blackland Prairies
The central portion of the proposed IPL alignment from I-45, in Navarro County to the
Johnson-Tarrant County line, is within the Blackland Prairies physiographic and vegetative
regions (Brooks et al. 1992; Chervenka and Greenwade 1974; Coburn 1985; Diggs et al.
1999). Topographically, the Blacklands are described as containing gently undulating or
rolling prairies. Although tall grass prairies dominate the Blacklands’ vegetation, wooded
areas are also present along primary rivers and streams, in isolated patches within particular
soils, and within abrupt topographic transitions (Diggs et al. 1999). Bordering the Blacklands
zone, to the west, is the East Cross Timbers vegetative area. Similar to the Blacklands
environment, the East Cross Timbers contain gently rolling uplands. However, this zone is far
narrower than the Blacklands zone, and, in stark contrast, the area has woody vegetation
primarily of the post oak and blackjack oak variety (Diggs et al. 1999).

Ecological Communications Corporation

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

The Bureau of Economic Geology defines the soils of the Blackland Prairies as “the
innermost Gulf Coastal Plains, chalks and marls weather to deep, black, fertile clay soils”
(Wermund 1996: 1). The Blacklands is underlain by four geological groups that were
deposited during the Upper Cretaceous period and increase with age from east to west. The
youngest formation belongs with the Navarro Group, which includes Kemp Clay and
Corsicana Marl undivided (Kkc) and Nacatoch Sand (Kns). Boarding to the west is the Taylor
Group. This group is characterized by marls and sandy marls pertaining to the Neylandville
and Marlbrook Marls undivided (Knm), Wolfe City Sand (Kwc), and Ozan Formation (Ko)
(Barnes 1972). The next oldest formation is the Austin Chalk (Kau), which forms “the
elevated backbone or axis of the Blacklands” (Diggs et al. 1999: 38). The Eagle Ford
Formation (Kef) is the westernmost and oldest geological group of the Blackland Prairies.
Fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) and Alluvium (Qal) are present along the Trinity River and
other primary waterways (Barnes 1972).
Grand Prairie
Extending from the I-35W corridor to the alignment’s western terminus at Benbrook Lake is
the Grand Prairie physiographic region (Ressel 1981). This region is characterized by “gently
sloping, almost level, and usually treeless dip plains, broken only by the valleys and of the
transecting drainage” (Diggs et al. 1999:50). Within the Grand Prarie, the proposed pipeline
alignment crosses though the Ft. Worth Prairie vegetative zone. This area contains a
“continuous body of open grasslands, roughly 10-30 miles wide, from near the Red River in
the north”, to near the Johnson-Hill County line (Diggs et al. 1999:43).
Geologically, the primary difference between the Grand Priarie and Blackland Prairies is “that
the Grand Prairie is established upon firm, persistent bands of limestones, which are harder
than the underlying clay substructures of the Black Prairie region” (Diggs et al. 1999:50). The
proposed IPL alignment passes through two of the Grand Prairie’s geological groups, the
Woodbine and undivided Washita. Within these groups are four formations that increase with
geological age from east to west (Diggs et al. 1999). The easternmost formation is the
Woodbine Formation, which belongs with the Upper Cretaceous period. The Lower
Cretaceous period is represented by Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone undivided
(Kgm), Weno Limestone (Kpw), and Duck Creek Formation (Diggs et al. 1999). Similar to
the Blacklands, Fluviatile terrace deposits (Ot), and Alluvium (Qal) are present along a few
major waterways (Barnes 1972).
3.2

Soils

According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Soil Conservation Service, the soils
within the study area vary from deep sandy loams to shallow clays. As discussed above,
several different vegetative zones are traversed by the proposed IPL alignment. As the
vegetation transitions from predominately pine forests in the east, to post oak, and finally to
prairies in the west, the soil types change as well. For example, the Interior Coastal Plains
contain sandy soils ranging from 80-203 inches below surface (ibs), and the Blackland
Prairies are comprised of deep clayey soils that range between 60-104 ibs. Primarily, the
Blacklands are comprised of very clayey soils. However, small areas on the eastern and
Ecological Communications Corporation

pg 7

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

western boundaries contain different soil than the interior Blacklands. Soils within these
formations contain slightly less clayey soils; composed of deep clays and clay loams
exceeding 80 inches below surface, with the exception of soil located within the Woodbine
Formation, which contain sandy soil ranging from 5-37 inches below surface that is typically
above a clay layer. Similar to the Blacklands, the Grand Prairie region has clayey soils
between 20-80 ibs (Soil Survey Staff 2010).
Due to the expansive nature of the proposed IPL, 86 soil series were cataloged during the
background research. Of the 8,027 acres within the pipeline component, about 44.5 percent
are classified as clay or clay loams, while 40 percent contain sandy or sandy loams, and 14.8
percent are classified as silty loams or loam. Location of possible Pump Station #3 is
currently undetermined1, but of the 234 acres at the two pump station components that are
currently mapped, 64.1 percent are silty clay or clays, 29.9 percent are sandy, and 5.1 percent
are silty loams. Table 3-1 summarizes the soils found along the IPL route and Table 3-2
summarizes those in the pump station locations. Soils are listed by decreasing total acreage.
Excludes are minor soil associations comprising negligible acreage and totaling 0.4%.

Potential for Archeological Sites

The proposed pipeline alignment has the potential to encounter archeological sites in a variety
of topographic and geographic settings. Each setting within a particular region has a certain
potential for containing cultural deposits. Not each setting has the same potential. This section
summarizes the potential for archeological sites within both the upland and lowland settings
for each physiographic region traversed by the proposed alignment. Due to the size of the
project area, all levels of disturbance are expected within the proposed APE. Disturbances are
expected to include extensive clearing and plowing of land, existing infrastructure, land
modification (i.e. stock ponds, agricultural terracing, dams, etc.), as well as localized erosion.
Regional deposits within this section are discussed using the natural setting. Table 3-3
indicates 13 stream or river crossings that are considered to have a high or moderate potential
for containing deeply buried deposits. These locations are indicated on Appendix A as
backhoe trench (BHT) areas.

Interior Coastal Plains
Within the Interior Coastal Plain, the potential for archeological sites is variable across the
topography. Based on Soil Staff Survey Official Series Descriptions, upland soils within the
APE range from 6-84 inches thick and are derived from Holocene-age eolian or colluvial
processes (Soil Staff Survey 2010). These soils have high potential to contain archeological
resources and are recommended for surface survey, which includes subsurface shovel testing.
Several stream or river crossings within the project APE are located within the Interior
Coastal Plains physiographic region. These stream or river crossings potentially contain
deposits that could remain undetected by a pedestrian survey, or from shovel testing.
Backhoe trenching provides the most efficient method for establishing the presence or
absence of deeply buried deposits. Crossings that are considered to have a high potential for
deeply buried archeological deposits are at Coon Creek, Walnut Creek, and the Trinity River.
Crossings that are considered to have a moderate potential for containing deeply buried
deposits are Caddo Creek, Catfish Creek, Mill Run, Cedar Creek, and Rush Creek.
Blackland Prairies
The gently rolling uplands of the Blackland Prairies contain soils with extremely high
amounts of clay known as ultraclay soils. “Sites formed in these soils are subject to extreme
disruption through soil process (pedoturbation)” (Collins 2004:108). The Blacklands are
dominated by the Houston Black series, which have the potential to form gilgai. Gilgai refers
to the rolling vertical movement of soil that can affect deposits to approximately 2 meters
below the ground’s surface (Collins 2004). Thus, these soils have little potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits and would be adequately investigated through surface survey.
Unlike the upland soils, which can be surface surveyed, the Blacklands contain several stream
crossings that through time have deposited large amounts of sediment and have the potential
for containing deeply buried cultural resources. Stream or river crossings that have a high
potential for deeply buried deposits include Cummins Creek and Waxahatchie Creek.
Crossings that are considered to have a moderate potential to contain deeply buried deposits
include Mountain Creek, and Walnut Creek.
Grand Prairie
A small percentage of the proposed APE crosses through the Grand Prairies physiographic
region. The gradually sloping layers of the cuesta topography within this region contain “thin
soil over resistant limestone” (Diggs et al. 1999: 51). Due to the shallowness of the limestone
bedrock within the uplands, these soils have little potential for deeply buried cultural deposits
and would be adequately investigated through surface survey.
However, more recent terrace and stream alluvial deposits, which contain low to moderate
amounts of disturbance, provide the best potential for deeply buried cultural veneers. Stream
crossings with high potential for containing deeply buried cultural deposits include Village
Creek and Deer Creek.

Land Use and Ground Disturbance

The preferred pipeline route was selected to purposely avoid developed areas (Tarrant
Regional Water District and City of Dallas 2010a). Examination of recent aerial imagery
(Tarrant Regional Water District and City of Dallas 2010b) reveals that most of the project
area is open, undeveloped agricultural land, especially in the central and western portions of
the route. These areas are expected to have agricultural disturbance to the depth of the plow
zone, typically about 30 cmbs. In the eastern portions of the route, especially Anderson and
Cherokee Counties, undisturbed wooded terrain comprises up to about 30% of the route.

Archeological Background

4.1

Previous Archeological Investigations

Investigations within the APE
According to the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the “Atlas”) maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), at least 18 archeological surveys have been previously
conducted within the APE (Table 4-1). Fourteen of these have been linear surveys for
transmission lines, roadways, pipelines or similar projects that have crossed the current
project area. Four of the projects have been block surveys. Of the 18 surveys, four were
conducted in the 1970s, six in the 1980s, six in the 1990s, one since 2000, and one is undated.
Investigations within One Mile of the APE
At least 106 previous archeological investigations have occurred within one mile of the
centerline. These include 39 linear surveys (for roads, pipelines, transmission lines, etc.) and
67 areal (or “block”) surveys. These occurred as early as 1931, although most (about 75%)
are more recent surveys, dating to about the last 30 years.
4.2

Known Cultural Resources

National Register Properties
No National Register Properties are located within the study area or within one mile.
Cemeteries
One cemetery is located within close proximity to the current project centerline. The Mankin
Cemetery (HE C070) is located about one-half mile southwest of the Cedar Creek Pump
Station, in Henderson County. According to engineering plans, the known cemetery
boundary passes approximately 75-100 feet north of and beyond the current 150-foot
proposed easement, but does lie within the 450-foot evaluation corridor. The cemetery
contains headstones that date from the 1890s through the early 20th century (Jasinski 2004).
An additional 30 cemeteries are located within one mile of the study area. None of these will
be affected by the currently proposed route of the pipeline.

Historic Markers
One historic marker is located within the study area. This marker (#10369) commemorates
the Owens Cemetery, named for David Allen Owen who served as County Judge from1860 to
1869. The Owens Cemetery has marked graves ranging from 1873 to 1947. While the
historic marker is within the APE, the cemetery itself is located more than 850 ft (260 m)
from the centerline and is not within the APE
An additional 14 historic markers are located within one mile of the study area. These
commemorate six churches, five cemeteries, a city park, a railroad depot and the location of
the final review of the last Confederate military unit (Table 4-2). None of these markers will
be affected by the currently proposed route of the pipeline.

Archeological Sites
According to the Archeological Sites Atlas, 127 archeological sites have been previously
recorded within one mile of the study area. This number calculates as slightly less than one
site per two square miles. None of these sites will be affected by the currently proposed route
of the pipeline.
Twelve sites have been previously recorded within the project area. This number calculates
as slightly less than one site per square mile. The 12 sites include three prehistoric sites and
nine historic sites.
1) Site 41AN10 is located on the centerline between IPL stations 320+00 and 330+00
Line Segment A and is a prehistoric campsite recorded in the 1930s with a possible
Caddoan burial.
2) Site 41AN11 is located 30 meters south of the centerline at IPL station 210+00 Line
Segment A. Also recorded in the 1930’s, a whole ceramic vessel was recovered,
suggesting possible Caddo burials.
3) Site 41AN16 is located some 60 meters south of the centerline near IPL station 300+00
Line Segment A and represents another prehistoric habitation site and possible
Caddoan burial. The site was excavated in 1935 and one ceramic vessel is curated at
TARL
4) Site 41HE199 is located 35 meters north of the centerline between IPL stations
1920+00 and 1930+00 Line Segment A and is a historic homesite and trash scatter. No
standing structures are present but further investigation was recommended.
5) Site 41HE205 is located about 50 meters north of the centerline between IPL stations
1880+00 and 1890+00 Line Segment A and represents a historic trash scatter. No
further work was recommended.
6) Site 41HE221 is located 45 meters north of the centerline at IPL station 1880+00 Line
Segment A and represents a historic trash scatter. No further work was recommended.
7) Site 41EL88 is located 45 meters north of the centerline between IPL stations 4920+00
and 4930+00 Line Segment C and represents a 20th century homesite and stock tank.
No further work was recommended.
8) Site 41EL101 is found 70 meters northeast of the centerline near IPL stations 4950+00
Line Segment C and is a historic homesite and trash scatter for which no further work
was recommended.
9) Site 41EL155 is a large historic scatter that extends into the project area around IPL
stations 4070+00 Line Segment C. The site contains early 20th century domestic
refuse and no further work was recommended.
Ecological Communications Corporation

10) Site 41EL248 is located on the centerline between IPL stations 4040+00 and 4050+00
Line Segment C. It is a scatter of early 20th century historic trash and no further work
was recommended.
11) Site 41EL249 is located 20 meters northeast of the centerline between IPL stations
4050+00 and 4060+00 Line Segment C. The site is similar to 41EL248 and no further
work was recommended.
12) Site 41TR238 is a large historic site that extends into the project area near IPL stations
6470+00 Line Segment D. It represents a raised earthen berm used as a rail bed for the
former Ft. Worth Southern Traction Company Interurban Electric Railway that ran
between Ft. Worth and Cleburne, Texas between 1912 and 1931. Limited additional
research was recommended for site 41TR238.
4.3

Expected Resources

Since the proposed alignment is not collocated along existing corridors or surveyed right-ofways (ROW) relatively few previously recorded sites are present within one mile of the APE.
Apparent site density within the proposed APE is largely a product of survey intensity.
Approximately 83 out of the 127 sites that have been recorded are concentrated around
commonly required surveyed areas, such as, lakes, major rivers, and urban areas.
Topographically, 59 percent of sites recorded within one mile are located in upland settings;
while the remaining 41 percent are in lowland areas. Due to the previously mentioned
geographic skew, supplemental data from surveys, testing, and mitigations, regarding sites
farther than one mile from the APE, were consulted to provide a more accurate depiction of
potential prehistoric and historic period resources. Using these parameters, an expectation of
cultural resources, that could be potentially encountered, can be estimated.
Prehistoric
Occupation across East and North-Central Texas stretches back more than eight thousand
years. Since that time, a variety of landscapes have been inhabited by numerous groups
through distinct chronological periods (Perttula 2004; Prikryl 1987). A review of the TARL
archeological site records indicates that the majority of known sites within one mile of the
proposed APE primarily fall primarily within the Archaic, Transitional Archaic (Woodland)
and Late Prehistoric periods; with a two sites (41AN28 and 41HE300) possibly containing a
Paleoindian components. Cultural material within these sites varies from isolated finds to
generic lithic scatters to multi-phase Caddoan habitation sites. Cultural resources recorded
include, debitage, flakes, formal lithic and bone tools, ground stone, projectile points, burned
rock middens, mussel shell middens, post holes, pitted stones, conch shell, pottery sherds,
vessels, pipes, faunal remains, human bone, possible cemeteries, and isolated burials. Fortyfour percent of the known sites contain only lithic and/or ceramic scatters, while 36 percent
are habitation/open campsites, and 28 percent are unspecified on the TARL Sites Atlas. Site
dimensions range from .025 to 88-acres in size. Resources recorded from sites outside the one
mile buffer, but within similar geographic location, contain similar cultural resources, but also
Ecological Communications Corporation

pg 16

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

include: multi-phase mounds and villages, wattle-and-daub concentrations, bison processing
sites, discrete burials and cemeteries with grave goods, and wood working sites (Pertulla
2004; Fields 2004; Anthony and Brown 1994). Although these resources are not recorded
within one mile of the APE, they could potentially be encountered.
Historic
Although historic period influences began during the early 16th century, all recorded sites on
the TARL Sites Atlas, which are within one mile of the APE, date to the 19th and 20th
centuries. These sites range in size from 0.05-acres to more than 70-acres. Thirty-nine
percent are one acre in size, 11 percent are less than one acre, 11 percent are greater than one
acre, while 39 percent have no specified size. All but three sites (all with non-defined spatial
parameters) pertain to standing structures. Thus, it can be assumed that the majority of sites
with no specified size fall within the less than one acre range. Approximately 63 percent of
previously recorded historic period sites contain at least one prominent feature. Many of these
features are partially standing; and include cisterns, wells, foundations, corrals, homesteads,
barns, log cabins, outhouses, and a railroad bed.

5.0

PROPOSED METHODS

5.1

Pedestrian Survey

Pedestrian archeological survey work will consist of careful examination of the ground
surface and existing subsurface exposures within the APE by crews of archeologists walking
over the landscape. EComm’s Field Director will define logistical survey segments based on
access points. Multiple crews of three persons each will survey each survey segment,
examining one-half of the 450 ft (137 m) wide corridor, then flipping over the centerline and
surveying back to the starting point. This tactic will result in survey transects being spaced at
about 23 meters apart (137 m ÷ 6).
Survey crews will have identification badges and will wear blaze orange. The Field Director
will verify right-of-entry (RoE) for each parcel from the TRWD website and each crew will
have in their possession a hard copy of the signed RoE prior to accessing any private property.
5.2

Shovel Testing

While conducting the pedestrian survey, shovel testing will be conducted at a rate of no less
than one test per three acres. This rate of testing calculates to about one shovel test by each
person of the three person survey team in an area about 176 m long on one side of the
centerline (69 m wide x 176 m long = ~ 3 acres). An estimated 2,750 shovel tests will be
excavated (8,243 acres of APE ÷ 1 ST/3 acres).
All tests will be manually excavated in 20-cm levels to 80 cmbs, or to the pre-cultural clay
horizon, whichever is higher. Tests will be 30-cm in diameter and all excavated sediments
will be screened through ¼-inch mesh; artifacts will be field inventoried and returned to the
Ecological Communications Corporation

pg 17

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

location in which they were found. The locations of all shovel tests will be recorded using a
hand-held GPS receiver. Tests containing prehistoric or historic artifacts (exclusive of recent
debris) will be further investigated with additional shovel tests placed at 5- to 10-m intervals.
All previously recorded archeological sites located within the survey corridor will be revisited
and investigated at a level appropriate for their content and setting. For the purposes of this
survey, an archeological site will be defined as five or more surface artifacts within a 15-m
radius, a cultural feature observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, a positive
shovel test containing two or more subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests
located within 30 m of each other. All newly-documented sites will be assigned a temporary
field number and recorded on State of Texas forms, photographed, sketch mapped, and
plotted on the USGS topographic quadrangle. Previously-recorded sites will be recorded on
site re-visit forms and recorded in a similar manner. Following field work, sites will be
logged with the registry at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and will be
assigned a permanent site number or updated.
5.3

Backhoe Trenching

Prior to field operations, a total of 13 water crossings were identified as having a high to
moderate potential to contain deeply buried cultural deposits (see Table 3-3; “BHT” locations
in Appendix A). Of these 13 crossings, six are considered to contain high potential, while
seven contain a more moderate potential. Data sources that were used to differentiate
between high and moderate probability areas included soil composition, width of floodplain,
surface stability, proximity to known sites, and potential for deep disturbance.
While conducting the pedestrian survey, crews will further ground truth the previously
identified water crossings thought to contain elevated potential. In addition, ground-truthing
of all crossings will be conducted through on transect shovel testing and a detailed analysis of
the topographic setting. When a crossing is determined to potentially contain deep cultural
deposits, and the area can be accessed by a backhoe, it will be documented and given a
specific identifier. The field director and principal investigator will then review the crossing
and determine appropriate field investigations. Conversely, some crossings thought to contain
elevated potential for deep deposits may be removed from the potential trenching list based on
field observations.
Once the water crossings have been ground truthed, reviewed, and land access is obtained,
deep trenching operations will be conducted. A backhoe will excavate an approximate 4 to 6meter long trench. Depending on soil stability, when the trench has been excavated to a depth
of approximately 4 ft, an OSHA competent crew member will asses the stability of the trench.
As necessary, once the stability of the trench has been deemed safe, the crew will collect data
through a column sample, stratigraphic soil properties, profile map, and photographs. The
column sample will be excavated in arbitrary 20 cm levels to the base of the trench or sterile
soil and screened through ¼ -inch wire mesh. If soil stability is low, the trench may be
widened through benching and/or kept to a safe depth for recordation.

Ecological Communications Corporation

pg 18

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

After the trench has been recorded, the backhoe will continue to excavate deeper. During this
stage, excavated dirt and trench walls will be monitored for any sign of cultural material. If
cultural material is observed, it will be collected and an approximate depth will be recorded.
Once the trench has reached sterile soils, bedrock, or approaches the maximum depth the
backhoe can safely excavate, the trench will be photographed, backfilled, and geospatially
recorded using Trimble XT handheld GPS.
5.4

Site Assessment

The assessment of sites will run concurrently with field operations. As sites are encountered,
the recorded data will be processed in the field and submitted to the EComm office. The sites
will then be evaluated to determine site significance and potential eligibility for the NRHP. A
variety of data will be used to assess site significance including date(s), artifact density,
artifact variety, features density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity,
and amount of disturbance.
5.5

Re-Survey

TRWD desires to avoid impacts to all NRHP/SAL listed sites or those that will require further
investigation to determine their eligibility. In addition, the final pipeline will need to
accommodate other environmental constraints such as wetlands. As a result, it is anticipated
that some portions of the originally surveyed route will be rejected for environmental
concerns and that new alignments will need to be surveyed outside of the current 450 ft wide
corridor. Upon their identification by project planners, these reroutes will be delineated in an
amendment to this permit application. At this time, we anticipate that such amendment will
be submitted to the THC for review sometime during February through May of 2011. No
archeological field work will be conducted on any of the proposed reroutes until the
Antiquities permit is formally amended.
Following amendment of the permit, additional survey will be conducted pursuant to sections
5.1 through 5.4, above.
5.6

Electronic Data Management

To facilitate access coordination between multiple, remote crews, as well as to process field
data in as timely manner as possible, EComm intends to utilize a small assortment of online
tools in conducting the IPL field survey. Where warranted field data (scanned forms, GPS
data, electronic photographs, and daily progress reports, etc.) will be loaded onto online
repositories for remote access by field crews and office personnel during the course of survey.
Since some of the data that will be transmitted will contain sensitive site locational
information, EComm will only use password-protected services such as Google Docs
(http://docs.google.com) and/or Dropbox (http://www.dropbox.com), and will only grant
EComm archeology staff access to login information. EComm will not provide access to any
individual who would not meet the THC’s minimum requirements for access to restricted site
data. Once fieldwork is completed and all remaining work can be completed in-house, all
online data will be deleted permanently.
Ecological Communications Corporation

pg 19

Research Design and Work Plan for Archeological Survey of the Integrated Pipeline (IPL), Tarrant,
Johnson, Ellis, Navarro, Henderson, and Anderson Counties, Texas

EComm’s archeology staff met briefly with THC staff to discuss this prospective use of
online tools and received no objection from that agency.
5.7

Reporting

EComm will prepare a complete technical report describing the work accomplished and
presenting the technical results. All archeological sites will be fully described, illustrated, and
evaluated, and explicit management recommendations will be provided regarding eligibility
for SAL designation and listing in the NRHP. All newly discovered sites will be registered
with TARL and site updates will be filed for all revisited sites.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as required under
Chapter 26 of the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure. The report will describe the study
area conditions and cultural background, existing and newly-documented sites (including
newly-produced site trinomials), ownership of the site properties and SAL eligibility of these
sites based on the requirements of 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1) and 13 TAC 26.20(2).
This report will be submitted to the THC for review and comment. Upon acceptance of the
draft report by the THC, 10 copies of the final report will be prepared to satisfy the conditions
of the permit.
5.8

Curation

All archeological sites located during the survey will be recorded at TARL, and any specific
site-related photographs, records, and artifacts will be curated at that facility according to their
standards.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During the course of investigations for the Integrated Water Pipeline project in Tarrant County, project
historians encountered a number of concrete culverts with Works Progress Administration medallions
and plaques. Initially identified as potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places, project engineering firm Freese & Nichols, Inc., requested an intensive survey of the culverts
to determine their eligibility in order to facilitate project planning.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. conducted an intensive survey of the project Area of Potential Effects
and beyond to determine the scope of the culvert distribution in south Tarrant County.

After

identifying numerous culverts, bridge-class culverts, and bridges in and around the project area,
AmaTerra conducted research at Tarrant County offices into the history of the culverts and the motives
behind their construction. Based on this additional survey and research, the culverts are recommended
as not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, either individually or as part of a
larger historic district or collection.

INTRODUCTION
Project Summary
In an effort to meet projected water demands of an increasing metropolitan north-central Texas
population, the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) has partnered with the City of Dallas (COD)
to construct the proposed Integrated Water Pipeline (IPL) that would pull water from reservoirs in
rural northeast Texas to the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. During the course of cultural resource
investigations of the proposed IPL alignment, project historians encountered a number of concrete
culverts with Works Progress Administration (WPA) medallions and plaques in south Tarrant County,
Texas (Figure 1).
Project historians initially identified the culverts as potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion A for their association with WPA relief efforts in
Tarrant County, and made the recommendation to IPL project engineers to avoid the culverts to
minimize potential adverse effects. As the eligibility of the culverts came into question upon further
review, however, the IPL project engineer requested an intensive survey of the culverts to finalize a
recommendation of eligibility for listing in the NRHP to help facilitate pipeline design.
Summary of Proposed Facilities
According to design engineers, the proposed IPL facility would utilize a variety of new and existing
infrastructure to construct a water pipeline beginning at Lake Palestine in Anderson County and
extending westward over approximately 150 miles of generally open, rural land in Anderson,
Henderson, Navarro, Ellis, Johnson, and Tarrant Counties, terminating prior to a connection to
TRWD's existing raw water pipeline to Benbrook Lake in southwestern Fort Worth. The actual
proposed pipeline would be the main component, consisting of various diameter pipes being installed
within a 150-foot-wide permanent easement to a depth of 13-30 feet within an 11-15-foot-wide
primarily open-cut trench. Subsurface bores would allow portions of the proposed line to cross larger
roadways or waterways. While TRWD proposed to install only one pipeline at this time, design
guidelines allow for two additional parallel pipes to be installed within the same 150-foot permanent
easement at a later date to meet future demands.
General Setting
The overall project area is generally rural. The area of concern within south Tarrant County is a mix
of semi-rural and suburban development, with most of the WPA culverts located on minor surface
streets or smaller Farm-to-Market (FM) roadways in semi-rural regions of the county.

METHODOLOGY
Area of Potential Effects and Study Area
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the IPL project is 450 feet, or 225 feet on either side of the
proposed alignment centerline. As only a small number of WPA culverts or bridges are within the
APE, project historians examined an expanded study area to identify additional culverts for
comparison and study. The study limits extended along roadways outside of the project APE in the
vicinity of two of the WPA culverts (TN975-2 and TN985-1) (Figure 2).
Previously Identified Resources

National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
There are no listed or known eligible NRHP properties within 1,300 feet of the study area.

State Archeological Landmarks (SAL)
There are no non-archeological SAL within 1,300 feet of the study area.

Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL)
There are no RTHL properties within 1,300 feet of the study area.

Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHM)/Local Historical Markers
There are no OTHM or local historical markers within 1,300 feet of the study area.
Field Investigations
Field surveyors performed a windshield survey of the study area in January 2013 to identify additional
WPA-branded culverts. The field survey consisted of:


Identifying and photographing all WPA culverts in the study area;



Keying all identified culverts to a survey field map taken from the most recent Google Maps
aerial photography;



Recording UTM coordinates for each culvert; and



Noting major relevant architectural or engineering features for each identified culvert.

Archival Research
Historians also conducted archival research at the Tarrant County offices of the County
Commissioners Court, the transportation office, and the County Clerk in order to find more
information on WPA activities in Tarrant County.

National Register of Historic Places Evaluation Criteria
In order to be considered for listing in the NRHP, buildings, structures, objects, sites, and districts
must meet standards of historic significance defined by the Keeper of the National Register (36 CFR
60). Each property must be evaluated within the framework of its historic context and it must retain
characteristics that make it a good representative of properties associated with that aspect of the past.
The NRHP Criteria for Evaluation state that:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
A.

Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or

B.

Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

C.

Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction; or

D.

Have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history. 1

Criterion A
A resource that is representative of an important trend or event may be eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion A. This broad definition provides flexibility when determining the kinds of significant
historical associations. However, a property is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP simply because
it was built during an important era in history or if it fulfilled its historic role. In order for a property
to be eligible under Criterion A, it must be significant under one or more defined historic context(s),
convey a sense of the past, and remain recognizable to the period in which it was first constructed or
achieved significance.
Criterion B
Criterion B applies to properties associated with individuals whose specific contributions to history
can be identified and documented. However, it is important to determine not only what contributions
are associated with the individual and how they compare with those of other persons, but also how the
property represents or is linked to that individual and his or her accomplishments. The extent and
1

Intensive Survey Report

duration of that association is particularly important for determining NRHP eligibility. Moreover, the
significance of that person must be associated with defined contextual themes. Properties significant
under NRHP Criterion B should be those most closely associated with a person who has made
important contributions to the past, be associated with the person during the time he or she achieved
significance, and convey a strong sense of the past and remain recognizable to the period in which the
person achieved significance.
Criterion C
Properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C derive significance from the physical qualities of
their design, construction, and/or craftsmanship, including such disciplines as architecture, landscape
architecture, engineering, and art.

To be eligible under Criterion C, a property must embody

distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; represent the work of a master;
possess high artistic value; or represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction (a historic district). A property significant under Criterion C is one
that clearly represents a noteworthy example of a defined property type, dates from the period of
significance of one or more historic context(s), and exhibits the character-defining features of its
property type. Therefore, a property must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as having
significance in the historic context.
Criterion D
Criterion D is applied most often to archeological resources, but it also may be used to evaluate the
significance of extant buildings and structures. Properties significant under this Criterion are those
that have the ability to yield important historic information, such as a rare type of construction. In
order for these types of properties to be eligible under Criterion D, they must themselves be, or must
have been, the principal source of the important information, such as how construction expertise
affected the evolution of local building development. Due to the nature of the reconnaissance level
survey, evaluation under Criterion D is generally excluded unless historians feel a particular property
warrants additional investigation or consideration by an archeological professional.
Criteria Considerations
On occasion, certain types of resources are also evaluated that are not normally considered eligible for
the NRHP. These resources include religious properties, structures moved from original locations,
birthplaces and graves, cemeteries, reconstructed buildings, commemorative properties, and properties
achieving significance within the last fifty years. These properties can qualify for inclusion in the

WPA Culverts of South Tarrant County

7

Tarrant County, Texas

Integrated Water Pipeline

Intensive Survey Report

NRHP if they meet specific Criteria Considerations, in addition to meeting the regular requirements.

A.

A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic
distinction or historical importance; or

B.

A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant
primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly
associated with a historic person or event; or

C.

A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no
appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life; or

D.

A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of
transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from
association with historic events; or

E.

A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and
presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other
building or structure with the same association has survived; or

F.

A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic
value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or

G.

A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional
importance. 2

Seven Aspects of Integrity
In addition to being significant under one or more of the Criteria listed above, an NRHP-eligible
property must also retain historic integrity of those features necessary to convey its significance. 3 The
Keeper of the National Register has identified and defined seven aspects of integrity by which
potential candidates for the NRHP must be measured:


Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the
historic event occurred.



Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure, and style of
a property.



2
3

Setting is the physical environment of a historic property.

Ibid, p. 25.



Intensive Survey Report

Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular period
of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a historic property.



Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture of people during any
given period in history or prehistory.



Feeling is a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of
time.



Association is the direct link between an important historic event, person, or period and a
historic property. 4

Determining which of these aspects of integrity are most important to a particular property requires
knowing why, where and when the property is significant. 5 For Criteria A or B eligibility, the aspects
of location, feeling, setting, and association take on greater importance in determining a property’s
integrity. To be eligible under these criteria, a property must be able to clearly convey its significant
associations with the historic context. This often requires that a property’s overall environment
remain relatively unaltered from its period of significance. Properties eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion C must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as retain some relation to the
historic context. The most important aspects of integrity for Criterion C eligibility are location,
design, materials, workmanship, and feeling.
At a minimum, a property eligible under Criteria A or B must retain its basic original form that
identifies its property type and must be generally recognizable to its period of significance. However,
the significance of properties under Criteria A or B is not derived mainly from their design or
construction value. Therefore, a greater amount of alteration to a building’s historic physical features
is allowable when compared to the more stringent standards set for Criterion C eligibility. Some
minor alterations to the physical fabric of the building do not necessarily preclude Criterion C
eligibility, although they may result in some loss of integrity. Such acceptable alterations could
include replacement of roof materials or replacement of a minority of exterior doors and windows
within the original fenestration pattern of the building. In some cases, non-historic outbuildings or
landscape features could also be considered acceptable modifications to the property, if they are
visually unobtrusive and compatible in design and scale with the original building and its setting.
Major changes to a building’s roofline, form, or overall massing are generally considered
unacceptable, and would render a building not eligible under NRHP Criteria A, B, and C.

BRIEF HISTORIC BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT AREA
Tarrant County was long seen as a frontier county in Texas history, part of the boundary between
“civilization” and “the wilds.” Fort Worth began as a military fort, and later earned fame as the
premier cattle shipping and processing point in the state. Despite the growth of Fort Worth as a major
city, much of Tarrant County remained rural until the mid-twentieth century, when post-World War II
development began the rise of suburbia. In the early twentieth century, it was still rural with generally
poor roads, and received its fair share of WPA funding during the Great Depression.
Early Tarrant County, 1876-1940
The arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railroad (T&P) in Fort Worth in 1876 opened the doors to
development and eventually helped remake Fort Worth as a meat packing and shipping center. 6
Although not used for shipping cattle for another ten years after it arrived, the railroad nonetheless
provided a shipping point for local products as well as a source of goods from out of town and out of
state. As the cattle industry shifted from trail drives to meat packing, more railroads joined the T&P.
In 1880, railroad baron and Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (Katy) controller Jay Gould transferred
track rights from the T&P to the Katy, providing the Katy with a connection to Fort Worth from
Denton (this route would soon become part of the IH 35 fork from Hillsboro to Denton, forming IH
35W and IH 35E). Other railroads included the St. Louis, Texas and Arkansas in 1887 (later the St.
Louis Southwestern, or Cotton Belt) 7 and the Chicago, Rock Island and Texas in 1894 (later the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific). 8 By the turn of the century, eight railroads connected to Fort
Worth.
As the railroads improved transportation in the county and the cattle markets improved the economy,
the various settlements surrounding Fort Worth began to grow. Crowley moved to its current site in
the early 1880s when the Gulf, Colorado, & Santa Fe Railroad built through the area and built cattle
pens. Dairy farming, cattle ranching, and the railroad provided the biggest factors in the community’s
development. Rendon began as a small agricultural community in the 1880s but did not receive a post
office until 1891. It soon gathered other agricultural industries such as flour mills and cotton gins.
Mansfield continued to prosper and grow. In 1886, the Fort Worth and New Orleans Railroad
connected the city to Fort Worth and Waxahachie (shortly bought by the Houston and Texas Central,

and later transferred to the Texas and New Orleans Railroad). By the last decade of the nineteenth
century, Mansfield was a prosperous agricultural hub with a population of 1,000. 9
Cotton remained the dominant crop through the first decades of the twentieth century, although several
factors began driving prices down. The boll weevil, introduced to Texas in the late nineteenth century,
had spread to most of the cotton-producing areas by 1922, damaging crops and reducing yields. 10
Government controls also reduced the amount of cotton that could be grown, along with increased
foreign competition. Although World War I produced a short spike in demand, many farmers turned
away from cotton by the 1920s. The Great Depression further affected cotton’s prominence, as
farmers abandoned fields for other lines of work or shifted them over to different crops at the urging of
soil studies and demonstration farms. 11 Farm sizes remained small during this time, less than 90 acres
on average due to the prominence of animal labor (as opposed to tractors and other forms of
mechanization). 12 Even with the effects of the Depression, the area was still primarily rural with an
agrarian economy on the eve of World War II.
Works Progress Administration (1935-1943)
Although public works programs were not new to the county thanks to the first wave of New Deal
legislation pushed forth by President Roosevelt, the Works Progress Administration (WPA)
nonetheless represented a second attempt at something new. Previous relief efforts such as the Public
Works Administration (PWA) and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) hired skilled workers for
construction projects, building things such as roads, bridges, schools, infrastructure, parks, and other
products of lasting value. These programs embraced the notion of self-reliance and helping the greater
good, in contrast to the Civil Works Administration (CWA) which was derided as a “make-work”
program (raking leaves or other labor) for the unskilled and unemployed and perceived as only a step
above government hand-outs. 13
With rising numbers of tenant farm workers leaving fields due to drought, mechanization, and the
shrinking number of farms, demand for government-sponsored work programs increased. Roosevelt
and a new Democratic majority in Congress responded with a flurry of new programs, including the
WPA in 1935. Like the PWA and CCC, the WPA created lasting works for the public good, but it was

similarly a “make-work” program for unskilled labor much like the CWA. 14 However, many WPA
projects were tailored to the abilities of those employed, so construction-type projects dominated. In
Texas, one quarter of all monies needed to come from sponsors, a state requirement that may have
been enacted to encourage greater local participation and involvement in the WPA. 15
The WPA helped over 600,000 Texans provide for themselves or their families. The number on the
state rolls increased through the 1930s as drought and farm closures drove more farmers to cities in
search of work. The peak year was 1939, when over 218,000 Texans were on the WPA relief rolls.
Even with the start of World War II and the accompanying boom in industry, enrollment in Texas’
WPA program (name changed to the Work Projects Administration in 1939) remained high through
most of 1942. The WPA program was finally phased out in early 1943. 16

SURVEY FINDINGS
Field Observations
The field survey identified eight WPA culverts and bridges within the project study area. Five of the
culverts are simple single box culverts, and three are multi-box concrete bridges. Two of the culverts
did not have a WPA medallion, but in both cases historians identified missing sections of concrete
where the medallion would have been affixed. One culvert and one bridge had been previously
identified by IPL survey efforts. The largest bridge had a WPA plaque; the smaller bridges only have
a WPA medallion. The identified resources have been keyed to a location map (Figure 3). Photo
inventory forms of the surveyed resources are located in Appendix A. A list of surveyed historic-age
properties is presented in Table 1.

Culverts
The culverts are all one-box culverts made from board-formed cast concrete. They are similar in
general appearance outside of length and depth of the water channel. Most have flush abutments with
no embellishment, although Map ID 3 and 7 display projecting abutments. The WPA medallions are
brass disks approximately three to four inches in diameter. Each medallion reads “Tarrant County
WPA” around the edges, with the date 1938-1939 in the upper center. Below the date are two raised
sections for a number (presumably serial or other identifier) and the elevation. Two of the culverts
lacked a WPA medallion, although damage to the concrete curb on each indicated the former presence
of one. Map ID 3 and 8 were previously identified by IPL survey efforts as TN975-2 and TN985-1,
respectively.
Bridges
The three bridges differ in length and form, although they are all multi-channel and made from boardformed cast concrete. The longest bridge (Map ID 4) has four box culverts in a simple slab formation,
with flush concrete abutments. The two shorter bridges (Map ID 5 and 8) have two box culverts in a
cantilever slab formation, with projecting wing or flush abutments. All three bridges have similar cast
concrete railings. The decks of Map ID 5 and 8 are far thicker than that of Map ID 4. While the
shorter bridges only have a simple WPA medallion akin to the culverts, Map ID 4 has a brass plaque
with expanded information. The plaque has the words “Tarrant County W.P.A.,” the dates 1939-1940,
and a bridge identification number and elevation (marked out). It also includes the name of the
Tarrant County judge (Dave Miller), county commissioners (James M. Scott, Joe C. Thannisch, Hugh
Hightower, Frank Winters), and the county engineer (Henry Cook).
Archival Research
The culverts and bridges were all constructed in 1939-1940 using aid provided by WPA Project No.
10293. Approved at a special meeting of the county commissioners’ court on August 29, 1938, the
project called for the replacement of 1039 “wooden drainage structures” across Tarrant County with
permanent concrete and steel structures. 17 With unanimous approval, construction on the culverts and
bridges began the following year. Southwestern Brass Works of Fort Worth was awarded the contract
to produce the brass medallions and 200 markers. 18 Information the previous wood culverts replaced

by the concrete versions was limited, but most appeared to date from the mid to late 1920s, according
to county transportation records. 19
Analysis
Although the culverts and bridges are associated with the WPA, the connection is localized and not
directly related with the activities of the WPA in Tarrant County. The funds used to build the culverts
came from a WPA grant for which Tarrant County successfully applied. The culverts in question are a
handful of over 1,000 such culverts scattered across the county, all built as part of the same project. A
full inventory of surviving WPA culverts and bridges in Tarrant County is beyond the scope of this
project. Some have likely been replaced in the intervening years, but many others (particularly in
more rural areas) remain as evidenced by the culverts identified during both the IPL reconnaissance
survey and this intensive survey.
Physically, the culverts and bridges are not particularly noteworthy.

They are of a standard

engineering design with some minor differences between them. Although historians did not uncover
evidence of the plans used for their construction, the similarities between the surveyed culverts shows
that they were likely produced by the contracted companies using similar blueprints.

Archival

research did uncover labor rates for construction works, draftsmen, and foremen, as well as various
work orders and requests for materials.

None of the materials seemed unusual or hinted at

construction methods outside of common practice at the time, which relied on steel reinforced board
form concrete.
Under Criterion A, the culverts and bridges are associated with WPA activity in Tarrant County, but
are not significant under this association. They are merely an example of the types of public works
that used WPA funds. Although associated with members of the Tarrant County Commissioners’
Court, the culverts are but one project approved by the court and do not appear to have stand-out
association with any of the persons involved. The culverts and bridges are of a standard engineering
design with limited architectural or engineering significance under Criterion C. As such, the culverts
and bridges are recommended Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP either individually or as part of a
larger historic district.

POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS TO NRHP LISTED OR ELIGIBLE PROPERTIES
Under Section 106 of the NHPA [800.16(i)], an effect is any alteration to the characteristics of a
historic property qualifying it for inclusion in or eligibility for the National Register. In practical
terms, if a historic property is located within a project APE, then it is considered affected, and must be
analyzed for adverse effect. An adverse effect, per §800.5(a)(1), is found when an undertaking may
alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for
inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property's
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association.
Examples of adverse effects include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 20
1. Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;
2. Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance,
stabilization, hazardous material remediation and provision of handicapped access, that is not
consistent with the Secretary of the Interiors’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic
Properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines;
3. Removal of the property from its historic location;
4. Change of the character of the property’s use or of physical features within the property's
setting that contribute to its historic significance;
5. Introduction of visual, atmospheric or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the
property's significant historic features.
If analysis concludes project action would have an adverse effect on one or more historic properties,
then per §800.6, the federal agency involved or its duly appointed representative (in this case, the
FHWA and TxDOT, respectively) must explore options to avoid, minimize, or mitigate harm to the
affected historic properties. Consulting parties, including SHPO, affected Native American tribes (and
the Tribal SHPO), other affected federal or state agencies, and any other duly recognized public or
private entities must have the opportunity to review and comment on the findings of adverse effect and
any proposed measures to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate harm. Upon review and resolution
of any disagreement among the parties, the lead agency and consulting parties may sign a MOU
covering the adverse effects and their resolution (if any).

construction. Through previous coordination, a larger, 450-foot evaluation corridor is considered the area
of potential effects (APE) for non-archeological historic-age resources. The cultural resource survey
under way for this project is required for compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended (NHPA; required for US Army Corps of Engineers permitting) and the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT; required due to TRWD easement ownership). Cultural resource survey has been ongoing on
this project for the past two years and a formal report detailing the findings (including this resource) is
forthcoming.
Site 41AN192 Location and Field Observations
Site 41AN192 is located approximately two kilometers (1.25 miles) northeast of the community of
Frankston, on the northern edge of Anderson County (Figures 1 and 2). The site occupies an area of
approximately 20 meters east-west x 25 meters north-south near the southeast corner of IPL Parcel 820.
In this area, TRWD-contracted land surveyors noted a headstone and footstone outside of the AmaTerra
survey corridor and about 25 meters (75 feet) north of the property boundary (the northern edge of the
proposed permanent easement in this location).
The land is heavily overgrown and thick with pine trees, scrub, briars, and occasional oaks and cedars.
Ground surface visibility was very low and rarely exceeded 10% in most areas. The landform on which
the cemetery is located slopes gradually downhill from the ridgeline north of the site essentially marked
by a two-track road (visible on modern aerials) with a three foot drop over 50 feet or so then descends
more rapidly immediately south and east of the site (approximately 8-10 feet over 70 feet). The descent is
not sharp, but it is a noticeable change immediately south of the interment area.
Within this area, archeologists recorded four features including the main interment (Feature 1) that
includes a headstone and footstone, a second likely interment (Feature 2) consisting of a single temporary
grave marker, and two east-west-oriented depressions (Features 3 and 4; Figure 3). Additionally, some
secondary indicators of burials were also noted including very large oak trees and cedars (as mentioned
above). No fences, gates, ornamental flowers, or other cemetery indicators were observed.
Feature 1 is an east-west-oriented (86 degrees) headstone and footstone, both of portland cement (Figures
4 and 5). The stones stand at the foot of a very large oak tree (approximately 8-foot circumference at
chest height). The 17-inch-tall (exposed) headstone (located on the east side) is nine inches wide at the
top and tapers gradually outward toward the ground on one face (approximately 11 inches wide at the
ground surface) and is rectangular in section (4.5” thick). The back face of the headstone has faint lines
denoting the original wooden mold the cement was poured into. The front face is marked with cast, sans
serif, all-caps lettering reading:
DU... …ROSS
BORN MAR 22 1888
DIED APRIL 29 1918
GONE BUT NOT
FOR GOTTEN

2

Someone appears to have shot the headstone and the last letters of the first name and possibly the first
letters of the last name are missing. Though the marker has been shot, moss growth that is comparable to
the entire slab suggests the damage was done some time ago rather than recently.
The footstone is found approximately 7.25 feet to the east of the headstone and is similar in form but
smaller, measuring nine inches tall and tapering outward from a 7-inch-wide top (again 4.5 inches thick).
Archeologists did note a slight rise along the midline between the two markers but this could simply be
from the tree roots of some of the saplings growing at this spot.
Feature 2 is a small, 5.5-inch temporary grave marker made of tin standing approximately 18 feet
northeast of the headstone (Figures 3, 6-7). The marker stands alone with no other accompanying
markings and no card remaining in place. Though it faces north/south, the sign’s post appears to have
been twisted and once faced east/west. The marker is embossed in reverse with the following patents:
Patent Number 1276798
Filing date: Aug 21, 1917
Issue date: Aug 27, 1918
Patent number: 1573268
Filing date: Jul 6, 1925
Issue date: Feb 16, 1926
Both patents are attributed to temporary grave markers invented and improved upon by a William F.
Norman of Missouri (USPO 1918, 1926). With a temporary marker in place near the headstone and a
marker patent date of 1926 - eight years after the first interment - this suggests a second burial at this
location (Figure 8). Like Feature 1, the temporary marker has been placed at the foot of a very large oak
tree that likely was standing at the time of interment.
Approximately seven feet farther north (approximately 25 feet/7.8 m from Feature 1) is Feature 3, a
distinct, shallow depression in the soil that measures approximately 2.5 feet across (Figure 3). The
depression is linear and oriented east-west. While the depression’s total length is approximately 10-12
feet, the main portion of the feature measures approximately seven feet from east to west. Seven feet
farther north (32 feet/9.7 m from Feature 1), is a second, smaller linear east-west depression. This
depression is shallower than that of Feature 3 and shorter (east-west), measuring six feet across from east
to west and again approximately two feet wide. This was documented as Feature 4. Neither depression
was associated with a marker of any kind and, as such, may be the result of natural action; however, their
orientation, size, and association with other, marked interments suggest that these are unmarked graves.
In addition to the formal features recorded at the site, archeologists also noted other indications of burials
in the vicinity. Large oak trees - much larger than the prevailing vegetation in the vicinity - stood at the
foot of Features 1 and 2 (to the east) while an additional three large oaks were noted along the northern,
southern, and eastern site periphery. Additionally, the site included seven cedar trees, primarily along the
eastern and western site boundaries. No other possibly ornamental vegetation (irises, etc.) were observed,
nor were any other features (particularly south of Feature 1).

3

Though no subsurface tests were excavated within Site 41AN192, archeologists conducted twelve closeinterval linear surface survey transects across the site area spaced approximately three meters apart.
Surface transects covered an area of approximately 30 x 20 meters (east-west x north-south). Along each
transect, archeologists walked slowly and scanned the ground surface, sweeping vegetation and leaves
away with their feet as they moved forward. No additional artifacts, features, or depressions were
observed along these transects.
During linear archeological survey within the proposed permanent easement south of the marked site
boundary, archeologists found the proposed impact corridor in the site vicinity to be open and grassy with
a humucky, highly-disturbed ground surface (Figure 9). While the extent of modern disturbance was
highest near the cemetery, shovel tests (n=9) in the surrounding area were all devoid of historic-age
resources and none contained any evidence of possible additional unmarked graves (Figure 2).
From an indirect-effects perspective, the site is found tucked deeply into a thick, wooded area. Even
knowing exactly where the markers are located, it is impossible to see them through the vegetation even
during the winter when the site was recorded (Figure 10). The pipeline, being an almost entirelysubsurface facility, will not be visible from the site (or vice versa).
Archival and Oral History Summary
Archeologists consulted a variety of sources in an effort to identify who is buried at this site as well as if
the site is a recorded, known cemetery. First visiting the Anderson County Clerk’s office, researchers
traced the parcel’s title as far back as the early 1900s (as early could be readily accessed within the
Clerk’s office). According to the deed records, the parcel on which the site is found is a 27.4-acre plot
within the John Ferguson League (Block 721, Tract 6). The land is currently owned by members of the
Bizzell family, whose members have retained the property since Earl “E.G.”, J.B., and Ethel Bizzell
purchased the land from J.B. Martin et ux. in August of 1919 for $3,000 (Volume 129, Pg. 203-304),
paying off the note on the property three years later (Volume 303, Pg. 175). The deed record skips
approximately seven years as there is no record of the Martin’s purchasing the property or from whom,
but R. E. Brock is recorded in a 1912 deed record for the property as the grantee, purchasing the land
from M.J. Goodson (January 27, 1912; Volume 303, Pg. 175). Jake Goodson, along with a Josie Miller
subdivided the land a few weeks before in December of 1911. Goodson and Miller both had a large
number of land purchases in the years prior, including many in the Ferguson League and archeologists
could not pinpoint earlier, directly relevant land transactions as a result. It is likely that the land was in
their hands into the late 19th century.
According to Frankston and its Neighbors (1976), both the Miller and Goodson families are prominent in
the Frankston community. The town of Frankston is named after Frankie Miller (a presumed relative of
Josie), who donated land for a public park in 1902 (Frankston had been previously named Ayers). More
specifically to this property, Jake Goodson was the founder of the Goodsonville community located eastnortheast of Frankston (Dempsey 2013; Frankston Bicentennial Committees 1976:264). Goodson is
reported to have operated a 1,400-acre farm in the area into the 1880s and later served as the
Goodsonville Postmaster (ETGS 2006). Site 41AN192 is approximately midway between Frankston and

4

Goodsonville though Jake Goodson’s sale of the specific parcel on which the site is found suggests that it
is more closely associated with that community.
The current landowner (Laurie Bizzell, personal communication) has never actually seen the cemetery but
does recall her grandfather, E.G. Bizzell, telling her that slaves once lived on the land (closer to a large
water tank on the property and well north of the survey corridor) and buried their dead on the land.
According to the owner, the slaves’ granddaughter eventually marked the burials. While it is more likely
a cemetery of freedmen rather than slaves, this would explain the temporary grave marker on site dating
at least eight years after the concrete headstone. Other members of the Bizzell family familiar with the
area (Ryan and Dana Bizzell, personal communication) knew of the cemetery and knew that it was used
by African American inhabitants of the land. The Mount Olive Cemetery was the official African
American cemetery for the community of Goodsonville (Frankston Bicentennial Committees 1976), but
other impromptu burials made by tenant farmers would be anticipated as well. The family informants
recalled four burials at the cemetery, which would be in compliance with field observations. According
to Dana Bizzell, there used to be more markers at the site but occasionally one would be removed
between visits. He recalled the latest burial being some time in the 1950s. With no records of such, it is
difficult to verify this data.
As to the name inscribed on the headstone, archeologists reviewed Anderson County birth and death
records at the County Clerk’s office in and around the dates provided on the headstone and found no
record of anyone matching the partial name given. Missing the last letters of the first name and the first
letters (possibly) of the last made name searches difficult. The space on the headstone suggests that there
are maybe three characters that have been removed and a space so the last name could be Ross, Cross, or
Gross. According to the 1900 and 1910 U.S. Census, there are many Rosses and Grosses (all African
American) living in the vicinity though none have first names that start with “Du.” A quick search online
of common “Du-” first names shows several good male candidates: Duane, Dub (Irish), Dug, Dugan,
Duke, Dumas, Duncan, but corresponding female names were too obscure to be considered.
Researchers did find a birth record for a Durnal Cross Jr. in the Anderson County archives dating to
September 1, 1920 (Record of Births Volume 3, Pg. 253). Being a “Junior,” he was born to Durnal Cross
Senior. Though the name is a good match to the headstone, the birth date does not correspond to the
timeline of pregnancy and birth of Durnal Cross Jr.
Though it does not depict a clear indication of a burial, evidence of Site 41AN192 is visible in a 1947
aerial photograph of the area. As can be seen in Figure 11, the two large oak trees are visible while a
small, white dot near the site’s center may correspond to Features 1 or 2. Parcel boundaries (particularly
to the south) are well-defined even at this somewhat early date with large trees growing along a fence
line. This suggests that such a boundary was also clearly visible to those utilizing the area for burials 2030 years earlier. Plow marks or terracing south of the cemetery (within the proposed permanent pipeline
easement) suggests that this land was disturbed as early as the 1940s and further indicates that unmarked
burials are unlikely within the proposed permanent easement. Since it is not depicted in the historic
aerial, it is evident that the two-track road surrounding the site to the north, likely intentionally diverted to
avoid the site when it was built and, in turn, serves as a reliable northern cemetery boundary (Figure 12).

Summary and Recommendations
Overall, from research conducted, it is evident that Site 41AN192 is an early 20th century freedmen’s’
cemetery site. With approximately four interments, the site is set well away (75 feet/23 m) from the
northern-most edge of the proposed IPL permanent easement. Given the site’s location at the southern
edge of a southward descent, it is most likely that additional interments (if any) are not located closer to
the proposed impact corridor but are rather limited to the flatter upland ridge farther north, away from the
impact corridor. Additionally, though only two markers are visible and two instances hardly make a
pattern, marker dates suggest a northward burial trend with the 1918 burial farthest south and the 1926patented temporary marker to its north. Informants also recall only four burials at the site, which would
indicate that all such interments were identified during the site visit and additional burials are unlikely to
extend well beyond the marked site boundary.
Given its association with locally significant historical trends (African American freedmen communities
of northeast Texas and Goodsonville in particular), the resource could be considered eligible for listing on
the NRHP and could be listed as a SAL as well; however, more extensive archival research (not
conducted for this effort) would likely enhance such recommendations. The resource is known to the
current landowners and is tucked deep into the woods, well away from project-related impacts (both
direct and indirect). Survey data, archival research, and local informants all suggest that the site is limited
to the upper landform 75 feet north of the northern-most edge of potential project-related impacts. Citing
this information, the Principal Investigator recommends that Site 41AN192 will not be impacted by IPLrelated construction and no further work is required at this time for NHPA and/or ACT compliance.
Construction crews will be informed to pay particularly close attention to their operations in the
immediate site vicinity and, in the unlikely event that an additional unmarked interment(s) is found, all
work in the site vicinity will cease until such time as the THC can be informed, the identified resources
can be assessed, and a plan for treatment can be developed. If future projects are anticipated that have the
potential to pass in the cemetery’s vicinity, additional intensive archeological survey is recommended to
assure that additional, previously-unknown interments are not disturbed.
If you have any additional questions about the site or about the larger project, please feel free to contact
me at 512-329-0031 or by email at mmiller@amaterra.com at your earliest convenience. Thank you very
much for your continued assistance with this project and your time in conducting review of this resource
in particular.
Sincerely,

Mason Miller

Parcel 280: The survey area within this parcel is primarily comprised of a large landform that overlooks a vast lower
lying area to the west, which expands more than 20 miles. The landform had steep slopes that were not shovel tested,
but we documented through photos. The apex of the landform contained very shallow soils overlaying limestone
bedrock at approximately 10 -20 cmbs. The area has obviously been cleared during modern times and has served as
agricultural land, which is apprent through the remanats of on out of context agrcultural harvestor from the early 1920's
and stock pond. Several abandonded and rutted roads are present within the APE. The 1920's agricularal equipment
was identified as a isolated find and not a site due to negative shovel tests and its apprent out of context setting.
PARCELS 282, 283, and 284: These parcels share very similar topographic settings as 280. Area is primarily
comprised of a large limestone hill that has a deep and steep sided drainage. Modern debris was observed within the
APE including modern brick scatter. Shovel testing indicated soils are extremely shallow. Surface visibility in all parcels
ranged from 10-40 percent.

Shovel Tests in parcels 153, 154, 155, 160, and 161 consisted of
a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam terminated by depth or by bedrock
ranging from a depth of 35 cm. to 80 cm.
For Parcels 153, 154, 155, 160, and 161, the topography consisted of gradual sloping hills within residential areas with
the soil consisting of a sandy loam.
For parcels 3, 4, and 5, the soils consisted of typical blackland
prairrie soils that were a 10 YR 2/2 to a 10 YR 2/1 clay loam in
areas that were not disturbed.

A lot of transect A was either disturbed, blocked by a creek, or
existing pipeline. In the open fields, the soils consisted of typical
black land prairrie soils, and there were disturbances along
transect F and E in parcel 55. In Parcel 56, there is an old

railroad ties were used for some fencing around it. There was
also an abundance of modern trash along side the grade. We
shovel tested around it and there were no subsurface artifacts.

The crew started the day at the N. end of Parcel 7. The N. end of P7 had heavy surface disturbance including large
sandstone debris with embedded rebar, most likely excess from construction around the area as well as parts from
road construction as well. The subsurface og the area was a dark clay loam ~30cmbs to an older, slightly lighter, clay
gravel below. There is a large rise in the landform to the SE covered with tall grass. Little topsoil remains on the
landform with a sandy loam on top of a very shallow sandstone bed rock. The area was an unutililzed tall grass field
alongside residential and petroleum tracts. Reisling Rd. is to the N. of the tract. A total of 5 shovel tests were conducted
in the parcel, mostly on the landform, and some mitigation due to disturbance on transects.
Parcel 8 encompasses most of the high landform and slope. Again little topsoil, 5-15cmbs, to bedrock below; again
sandly loam on top. Still the same large discard on B-transect towards the fenceline into Parcel 9. Tall grass on top of
rise of bladed, disturbed, with exposed gravels; roughly 20% ground visibility. The top of the rise was the most bladed
of the landform most like for use of gravel in surrounding development. A total of 4 shovel tests were conducted in the
area.
Parcel 9 was a rolling tall grass, and scrub, field with slopes to the W. towards a drainage/creek. There were few taller
brush/trees in the area. Subsurface was a clay loam ~5-15cmbs above bedrock. A total of 13 shovel tests were
conducted in the area.
Parcel 11 was a High School complex complete with practice fields and ancillary facilities. No shovel tests were
conducted in the area due to this; photos were taken.
Parcel 10 is a bladed part of the downslope of the high landform; a lot of surface disturbance. The subsoils were much
the same as P7 and P8.
Parcel 12 was the front short grass manicured lawn area of the H.S. photos were taken; no shovel tests were
conducted.
Parcel 24 starts E. of Clebourne Rd. It was a tall grass semi-wild pasture with many shurbs and short trees; as well as
pear cactus. Parts of the area are a very shallow bedrock. The area is disturbed with a manmade/ modified drainage
system. Parts of the area were dry low areas clearly prone to flooding and water retention. Some of the area shows
heavy cattle traffic and compaction due to grazing. The landform gradually rises to the E. then slopes down to a
lowland, and flood prone area, before intersecting the Barnett LP pipeline to the E. of the parcel. Most of the subsoil
consists of a compact dark clay loam to depth or to a varying level of bedrock. On the E. slope bedrock was shallow
with ~5-15cm of topsoil of the same type. A total of 37 shovel tests were conducted, some mitigation of transects due
to the shift in the pipeline to the south into the currently inaccessable parcel 25.

Parcel 62 was a flood terrace populated with mixed hardwoods and tall grass/shrubs. A short grass existing pipeline
corridor parallels the proposed pipeline for most of P62. Terrace T2 was leveled for development with rock erosional
barrier walls in some areas of the slope to T1. The W. curve of the PL follows on the slope of T2 for a few hundred
meters leading to some transect mitigation due to access restrictions, walk but cannot dig above flood plain.
Subsurface soils were 0-40cm thick light brown SALO with gravels above a dark CLLO with gravel; below which, ~4070cmbs, large gravel CLLO.
Parcel 63 had a wooded drainage west of very tall grassy field, with gentle slope. Subsurface remained consistent with
P62 until the field where it became a dark brown CL/SI-LO to depth, 80cmbs. An existing PL seems to parallel the
Prop. PL N. of D transect. Cutbank of the area showed this SILO extended down ~2m.
On the return of E&F transect interals were changed from 150m to 170m. The creek boundary of a "No" parcel to the
N. extends into the E&F transects in P63. Intervals were changed to accomodate. In P62 of the return the existing
Barnett Gathering LP& the creek N. both ran through the E&F transects respectively; shovel tests were placed on the
transects where ever they could fit. This mitigated most of parcel 62 from E&F transect shovel testing. Subsurface
shows no sandstone gravels in the compact lighter brown SILO close to the creek branch. The surface vegetation was
the same as previously described.
Trenching is suggested in P63 but not P62 due to disturbance and soil types.

Crew B, consisting of D. Rodriguez, T. Cornish, and N. Steinle, started the day at 8am and drove from the office in
Austin to the field at 12:30pm. We arrive at P116,117 in Tarrant county. The tracts were obliterated from heavy topsoil
removal; leaving exposed red basal clay and depressions throughout. An unfinished house sits on the top of the land
form in P116. Photos were taken but no shovel tests were conducted.
P118 was a short grass mowed field with a slight down slope to the south. A barn sits on the E. side of the transects of
segment D. Subsurface of the area was a deep red-yellow sand with some gravels. One shovel test was conducted on
each transect.
The crew then moved to segment I, P120 and 118. P120 was a short grass field with a barn followed by a pond to the
south and abandoned equipment to the west near A transect. The area was clearly heavily disturbed having been
leveled much lower than the adjoining northern parcel, as seen by the tall wall of compacted red soil along the northern
fence line (see photos). Subsoil in the area showed a lack of any real topsoil with the crew encountering either a
compact red clay or a highly compact, horizontally mottled, sand, or sand stone formation.
The survey continued into the east side of P118. The parcel was a rolling grassy field with a few groups of trees to the
south. The subsoil was deep redish sand on the rises in landform. Below that was a red clay sitting on top of the
sandstone formation which were more shallow in the lower parts of the area. The crew returned to the hotel at 3:30pm.

For parcel 3, we had to revisit site 41TR137 which was recorded in 1994. The general landscape of Parcel 3 as well
as the apparent site area consisted of short brush among a small flood zone presumably from the un-named creek
located just south of parcel 3 and separates parcels 3 and 4. To the west, there is a large artificial rise comprised of
gravel, possibly built up for future housing development projects like the ones found to the north and east. In reading
the site form the description of the location of the site did not match the UTM coordinates, however there was a small
rise that matched the crude sketch map given with the site form as well as the description given. We dug four shovel
tests and all were extremely disturbed and consisted of a 10 YR 5/6 or a 10 YR 7/8 silty clay with gravel. Ground
visibility was approximately 0-1% and given the sparse nature of the site when it was recorded in 1994 it is safe to
assume that whatever site was there has mostly likely been eradicated by modern development.
Parcel 43 consists of a young hardwood forest south of a housing development area. There is a creek that runs
along Transect A that eventually cuts north towards the housing development. There is no transect F due to a gravel
road/disturbance. Soils consisted of a 10 YR 2/2 to a 10 YR 4/3 silty clay found in a typical black land prairie setting,
and some disturbance was found in shovel tests that were near the creek and some tar paper/modern disturbance can
be seen in the cut bank of the creek which indicates artificial modification of said creek.

Crew B started out the day at 7:30am; the weather was clear but low 30"s with wind 10-15mph. The crew started at
P123 surveying south for segment I with survey intervals set at roughly 150m. The area was a short grass pasture
starting with a rise in land form to the north east of the parcel and sloping down SSW. A perennial creek lines the west
of the parcel alongside an existing buried gas pipeline collocated with high power lines heading SSE; to the south of
the parcel is a large pond. The area appears disturbed with some surface debris of building materials as well as
asphalt gravel chunks in low areas. The subsoil was a redish brown sandy clay with gravels to depth.
The crew then moved to the north side of P121 and begun surveying south on segment D. The slope and crest of the
land form in P121 was covered with debris, trailers and barns; all of these mostly falling on A transect. The parcel is
mainly thick grass with some standing water in low-lying areas. Trees follow the banks of the creek that abuts up
against the parcel's east side. The subsoil of the land from was a shallow bright red basal clay at surface. The low area
southeast of the hill contained mixed young trees around the creek with soils of sandy loam containing gravels to
depth.
In P124 the northern section was a brushed lowland with SALO to water table at ~40cmbs. The southern portion was a
tall grass rise in field paralleling the road with SALO with gravels to a strong red basal clay at ~30-40cmbs. The
proposed pipeline continues to parallel the road eventually crossing the natural gas and power line corridors. Atransect was discontinued when it eventually drifted into the adjoining road.
The crew crossed the road, south, to P169-172,174,175. The parcels in question were either existing buildings with
parking lots or heavily disturbed leveled land. Photos were taken but no shovel tests were conducted.
P177 was an existing power line corridor running through a short grass inundated pasture. Photos were taken but no
shovel tests were conducted.
The crew returned to P168 and conducted the returning three transects. P168 was young elm woods divided by the
creek with light brown SALO to depth. On the return survey the perennial creek meandered through both E and F
transects so some mitigation of the intervals was warranted. Vegetation and subsoil remained consistent with the first
three transects.
The crew returned to the hotel at 2:00PM.

Parcels 133 and 135 are grassy pasture lands
Parcels 134, 142, and 143 are residential houses which were not shovel tested.
Parcel 136 and 137 consists of mostly grassy fields, a modern barn and some other modern structures found towards
the southern end of the parcel by Gibson Cemetery road.

shovel tests in the general vicinity also yielded no artifacts with a shallow basal clay. Judging by it's association with the
modern dumping ground found in parcel 138 just west of it, as well as some modern equipment amongst the debris, it
is most likely a secondary trash dumping ground with some historic equipment with no merit for it to be a site.
Parcels 140 and 141 consist of a young cross timber woodland with an abundance of secondary growth.

Crew B left the hotel for the field at 7:30am. The temperature was 26 with a high of 37 degrees. We arrived at P213214. The parcels were situated between a Y shaped intersection of FM917 and Heritage Rd. The ground seemed to
have been highly disturbed and leveled from this construction. The vegetation consisted of short grasses with a ground
visibility of 10-20%. The soil was a compact pale brown clay loam with small sand stone gravel and fossilized shell
fragments. It was determined that this clay was basal as well as disturbed so minimal shovel tests were conducted in
the parcels.
P215-216 was bordered to the west by Heritage Rd. Along the push terrace of the road was a tilled spot of land,
perhaps part of a wheat field, then a linear push pile populated by mixed young trees. The land form slopes upwards to
the southeast. On the rise is a short grass, cut, rolling fields. On visual assessment of the tracts it was determined to
survey 160-170m intervals for A,B,C transects then 180m intervals on the return transects. Most of the eastern half and
all of P217 are tilled grassy rolling fields. The subsurface of all P215-219 remained the same consistency, varying only
on the amount of ground disturbance from agricultural or husbandry use. It was a pale dark brown CLLO with small
sand stone gravels. Beneath this at roughly 40-60cmbs lay a lighter pale brown CLLO, which I believe to be a basal
clay. Due to the cold weather the first 10cmbs were frozen/frosted and as the day progressed it thawed into a very
sticky clay.
P218 was a un-tilled sparse grassy field with pump station access roads crossing it, along with natural gas pipelines.
P219 was again a tilled partially grassy field with mixed brush and trees only along the fencelines.
After the return survey, which was much the same as the first 3 transects, the crew then moved to P285.
P285 was a tall grass pasture dotted with sparse brush. The landform itself was a gentle slope to the southeast. To the
north of the parcel a newer cell tower sits. Subsurface of the area was a strong brown CLLO with gravels to a shallow
sandstone bedrock ~40-60cmbs.
P286 was a tall grass yard southeast of the landowner's house. He was concerned that our digging might hit his water
pipe that was buried shallow in the ground of that yard. The yard was photoed but no shovel tests were conducted.
P288 was a well manicured and highly disturbed yard around a large house to the southeast. It was determined not to
dig in the yard; photographs were taken.
The crew returned from the field at 3pm.

87

Parcels 229, 230, and 231 consist of agricultural fields with a gentle slope to the north and south that is separated
by a drainage that is parcel 232. Ground Visibility within the agricultural fields ranged from 80-95%. Within the
drainage,ground visibility dropped to around 20% and the vegetation was of a typical flood plain setting and had an
artificial pond and drainage system running east/west.
Soils within Parcels 229, 230, 231, and 232 were mostly a 10 YR
While surveying back towards the truck, we found a small historic scatter within parcel 230. The scatter included some
3/3 or 10 YR 4/3 clay. Some shovel tests within 232 yielded some
small glass sherds, a couple brick fragments, a square nail, other some pieces of metal, and a couple sherds of white

this point in time.
For Parcel 225, it is a very short (approximately 100m wide) parcel that consisted of mostly tall grasses with some
hardwood trees towards the northern section of it. There is some modern trash and a couple of small modern
foundations found among the trees as well.

Crew B started the day at 7:30am and drove to P261. P261, 260 were divided by a perennial creek drainage as the
parcel boundary. P261 was a tall grass lowland created by the creek. The subsoil of the area, P261-258, was a dark
pale CLLO with tiny gravel inclusions. Below that level ~40cmbs or deeper was a lighter brown CLLO with gravels that
is believed to be basal clay.
P259 was a exposed soil fenced in horse pen. It had tall grasses with 50% ground visibility.
P258 was a lumber business with many cut trees stacked in the ROW. A shovel test was conducted in the morning but
once the machinery started up the tract was avoided. All of these tracts look disturbed either by man-made or water
deposition/erosion means. I called Dale Harmen with the steel mill that owns P263-263. A monitor came out with us to
P263. A few shovel tests were conducted in P263 however the area is small and between Weatherford Dr. and HWY
67. The vegetation of the area was tall scrub/grasses with a tilled field to the north. Subsurface remained the same as
the previous surveys, dark brown CLLO with small gravels. After talking to the monitor we learned that we were not
permitted to dig in nearly the entirety P264-265. This was due to the hazardous material berm that was constructed
surrounding the parcels. This was noted and a photograph was taken.
We then moved to P249-250. We started the survey from the North with intervals of 170m staggering the transects.
The land was rolling tall grass cow pastures throughout most of the parcel. Near the southern end of the parcel along
with P250 the area was a tilled short grass southern slope. Soils in the area were a dark brown CLLO with few gravels
to a thin layer of light brown CLLO with gravels at roughly ~40-50cmbs above bedrock at ~40-60cmbs. On the ridge
of the high land form in P249 we found a possible site and documented it. The site consists of a standing water tank,
an adjacent telephone/power pole, a corral, the surrounding fences, and a collapsed barn/shed a little farther away. It
was hard to gauge the age of the features due to little diagnostics found, and admittedly limited knowledge of rural
historics. The water tower is roughly six meters tall and 2 meters in diameter with heavy corrosion. Juniper trees grow
close to it and may be 20-30yo at least. The adjacent telephone pole looks to have old insulators on top as well as
rusted circuit boxes attached. The corral was made of rusted metal pipes, some (spare?) lay embedded in the ground
from cattle traffic, cemented in the ground. The surrounding fences had on corroded barbed wire with hog fencing. The
posts looked much like railroad ties and were attached with non-galvanized large nails. The barn was found on the
returning E transect. The barn/shed was collapsed with only the roof to be seen; no real evidence of walls. The roof
was corrugated tin on a frame of 2x4's with the used of non-galvanized wire cut nails. The crew then returned to the
office to write up the site forms and scan documents.

Parcels 206 and 208 consist of a grassy field with a modern processing plant which prevented any shovel tests to be
dug along parts of transects B, and C and all of transect A. Ground visibility was 10-15%
Parcel 248 consists of small rolling hills that are cow pastures and parts of it have short hardwood trees scattered
Mostly all shovel Tests among all parcels were typical black land
among the grasses. The ground visibility was about 20% and some of the drainages lead to nearby ponds that act as
prairie soils which were a 10 YR 3/2 or a 10 YR 2/2 clay to a clay

the fact that there was a "No" parcel that jetted into the pipeline corridor.
Parcel 245 is a large grassy field that overlooks parcels 244 and 242. There are a few small artificial ponds within
the parcel along the E and F transects, as well as some small modern dumping mounds in Parcels 244.

35

We started the survey of P163-166 on from the NW portion of the line working south. Due the the angry landowner I
decided to space the intervals at 180m so that we would be off the land quicker. The area was a level high grass field
with areas of thick juniper woods. P166 is a power line corridor intersecting the property. Alongside the northern end of
the pipeline was a buried seismic sensor line, while in the south the pipeline crosses and existing gas line by the fence
of P164. Throughout the survey shovel tests had a yellowish red sand on top of a degraded sandstone. Depths varied
with the shovel tests in 165 much deeper, sand 40-80cmbs, depth while the subsoil of 164 were shallow with degrading
sandstone ~40cmbs.
In 165 the pipeline crosses an existing standing historic house on the A B transects and will be documented fully on
1/17/11.
The crew then moved to P110,109 to help crew A finish their survey scope for the day. We started the transects DEF
working west at an interval of 160m. The area was a short grass compact cattle pasture with a pump station north of
the survey area. There was a creek to the south of the line crossing the survey area in 109. The subsoil was a dark red
brown sandy clay to depth. A relatively intact rise in land form exists in 109 that may be eligible for trenching. The crew
reached the end of the survey and began surveying ABC transects back. There was some ST mitigation due to the
creek. Crew A arrived and finished all the transects in P111 and surveyed ABC west meeting Crew B in the middle of
P110. No cultural materials were found.

deep sandy loam within the majority of the parcels.

Parcels 187 and 188 consist of a gentle slope to the south and is abundant with modern trash that makes up most of
the parcel. There is a small portion that seemed to be still natural deposition among young cross timbers in the
northern portion of 187, however the rest of the parcel and part of 188 is overgrown with bamboo which has piles of
modern asphalt, and trash throughout. Just south of that is a small junkyard of cars that was photographed and not
shovel tested. The one shovel test that we did manage to put in parcel 187 yielded a 10 YR 3/2 compact clay and was
most likely disturbed.
Parcels 150, 148, 147, and 146 consist once again of a gentle slope to the south. They are all situated in a
residential area and parcels 150 and 146 were not shovel tested due to the houses and modern structures residing on
them but were photographed. Parcel 148 is a small wooded area with an abundance of secondary growth that sits just
north of 147 which is a cleared grassy field between Parcels 148 and 146 separating the two residential blocks. Both
parcels 148 and 147 had a 7.5 YR 4/4 sandy loam and the shovel tests were terminated by depth.
Parcel 127 is a residential house with a horse pasture in the north and western portions that made up transects D, E,
and F. The soil was a 10 YR 4/3 sandy loam and shovel tests were again terminated by depth.
Parcel 130 is an abandoned house with a grassy field that is resident to cows, donkeys, and horses. There is an
existing pipeline the runs east/west within the parcel and there is a small collection of junked cars in the northern
portion. Soils were again a 10 YR 4/3 sandy loam to depth.
Parcels 109, 110, and 111 are parcels that run East/West along a named creek.In collaborating with Team B, we
finished each others transects. We dug in parcels 111, and 110 while Team B dug primarily in parcels 110 and 109.
Parcel 111 has a large well pad that encompasses transects A, B, and C within that parcel while the other transects
were mostly dug along or close to the creek. In Parcel 110, the A, B, and C transects ran mostly along the creek while
the D, E, and F transects were dug by Team B. The soils found in the area were a deep 10 YR 4/3 or a 10 YR 3/4
sandy loam. Through looking at the stratigraphy seen in the cut bank of the creek, the alluvial deposits in the area
seem to be fairly deep. With deep deposits and good access to the parcels, testing through trenching is very possible.

Crew B started the day meeting at the office at 8:00am and driving to the field. We arrived at C298 around 12:00pm
and began survey heading NW. C298 was a tall grass, slightly muddy, cow pasture with sparse tall mesquite trees. We
survey this area, and all other parcels, at 160m intervals. The land form had a very gentle downward slope to the NW.
Subsoil of the area was a thick pale brown CLLO W/GR above a thin basal layer of lighter brown CLLO W/GR situated
on top of a sandstone bedrock at ~40cmbs or deeper.
C297 was a short grass level field with a wooded creek area near the fenceline of C298. The crew kept the same 160m
intervals surveying through the parcel. The subsoil was a dark gray/brown CLLO to at basal pale gray brown CLLO w/
GR at ~30-50cmbs. Near the edge of C297 and C296 a built stock pond exists crossing the C-F transect lines; as such
shovel tests were mitigated around it.
C296 was a gravel driveway with fences on both sides, it was not deemed necessary to shovel test it so a photo was
taken.
The DEF transects back revealed much the same information as ABC transects. No cultural material was present. The
crew returned to the hotel at 4:00pm.

compact clay south of the landform with shallow bedrock on top
of the landform

Parcels 291 and 292 sit atop a landform that gently slopes to the south and overlook parcel 295. Parcels 291 and
292 are residential grassy fields with cedar trees scattered throughout. The soils in these parcels were mostly a 10 YR
4/4 silt loam and gravel that sits atop a shallow bedrock found between 20 and 40 cmbs.
Parcel 295 consists of two grassy fields that are separated by a named creek (possibly armstrong creek) that runs
along the southern portion of transect A then cuts to the east. Within the area by the creek is a modern donkey pen
and is surrounded by modern disturbances such as a gravel road that runs north/south and cut through the creek, a
gazebo to the southern end of the parcel, numerous corrugated metal pipes that direct the water in various places, as
well as a few modern buildings just north of the creek. The soils in this parcel were mostly a 10 YR 4/3 clay with gravel,
or clay loam with gravel that sits atop a 10 YR 2/1, or a 10 YR 2/2 compact clay.

For parcel 400, it was very foggy when we arrived and the combination of the 4 inches of recent rain and 4 inches of
snow a few ago according to local reports left the agricultural field that makes up parcel 400 incredibly saturated with
water. There was a lot of standing water in many of the low parts of the parcel and it gently slopes to the south to
where part of the site 41EL155 was supposed to be then looks to drain into a modern artificial drainage that continues
under route 35. We dug six shovel tests along each transect within the designated site boundary as indicated on the
aerial map and conducted a pedestrian survey of the area but found no evidence of any site in this particular parcel.
Judging by the fact that the parcel itself is a plowed field, and the nature of the way the water seems to run off of the
parcel and flow through the field, if there were any remnants of the site in this parcel, it is either destroyed by plowing or
erosion into a modern drainage which is now full of modern trash. The soil was a 10 YR 4/1 or a 10 YR 4/2 clay and all
shovel tests were terminated by a shallow water table found 5-30 cmbs.
Parcel 345 is a grassy cow pasture with small rolling hills and a small drainage that runs north/south and cuts
through the middle of the corridor for the pipeline. The soil in this area was a 10 YR 3/2 or 10 YR 4/3 that sat atop a 7.5
YR 5/6 or 10 YR 2/1 compact clay
Parcel 346 is an agricultural field that gently slopes to the west and once again had some standing water in spots,
but was not nearly as saturated as Parcel 400. The soil was mostly a 10 YR 4/3 clay with gravel that sat atop a 10 YR
3/4 or 7.5 YR 5/4 compact clay.

Crew started survey of D103 on the eastern side moving west on the ABC transects. The parcel was a short grass cow
pasture with many agricultural berms along the rise in land form to the north. A perennial creek flanked on both sides
by mixed woods meanders through the eastern AB transects. In the middle of the parcel was an existing pecan grove,
~30-50yo trees. A fenced driveway separated two pastures of the parcel.DEF transects run close to the existing house
complex and EF had to be mitigated due to a horse corral and built stock ponds. Shovel test intervals were kept at
160m throughout the survey. The subsoil of the area was a thick layer of red SA to 60-80cmbs above a red brown
SACL 80+. After the survey we moved to C390. There we encountered a tilled wet CLLO level field. The mud was so
bad our boots were sinking into the clay ~15cmbs. A photo was taken and after consulting with K. Stone it was decided
to revisit the area after it had dried some. Parcels 392, 393 were the same. The crew returned to the hotel at 1:30pm.

57

The crew left the hotel at 7:30am and proceeded to travel to C29-34. C29,30 were fenced in back yards to houses,
photos were taken. The crew started the shovel tests on C31-33 working east. The area was a tall grass cow pasture
with scattered trees. The land form undulated little throughout the survey. Shovel tests were conducted in 160m
intervals with some mitigation due to no access properties to the south and pump stations located on the A line.
Subsoil of the area was a red brown CLLO gradually becoming a strong red CLLO with depth. Few areas in the survey
had a brown CLLO to a shallow bedrock at 30cmbs. C34 was an existing power line ROW paralleling a gravel road to
the west and rail road tracks to the east. The return survey, DEF transects, experienced much of the same vegetation
and subsoil, however, near the western side of C31 the transects came upon a highly disturbed zone. It appeared to
be wide troughs dust out of a rise in land form through the sand stone bedrock and then filled with trash. Also in the
area are scattered large pieces of concrete and concrete piping. I believe that this area was either a stone quarry or
taken for fill in the surrounding residential developments. This area was highly disturbed and photos were taken. No
cultural materials were present.

Parcel 403 is a small agricultural field north of Waxahachie road. Due to the close proximity of site 41EL248, we
kept a close eye out for any sign of the site in the parcel but found nothing. The ground visibility was 80-85% and the
ground was not as saturated as Parcel 400 to the north which was surveyed on 1/18/10.
Parcels 404 and 405 consist of an existing pipeline that runs north/south with mesquite woods to the east and the
land gently rises to the south to an agricultural field within parcel 405 that sits on top of the landform. The Mesquite
woods act as a grazing land for the cows that reside within parcel 404. There was some standing water among lower
parts of the parcels however the ground did not seem to be very saturated and some modern trash was scatter about
in the northern area of parcel 405. Ground visibility among the mesquite woods was 5-10% while the ground visibility
in the agricultural field was 75% and within the existing pipeline corridor it was 60-70%.
Parcel 426, 423, and 425 are all amongst the parcels that are to be considered for backhoe testing. Parcel 426
consists of a hill that overlooks a large flood plain which makes up parcels 423 and 425. Much of Parcel 423 was
inundated with water and could not be surveyed, and it should be noted that if a backhoe were to trench this particular
parcel, it would have to be dry for at least a month before approached. Parcels 425 and 426 however are prime
candidates for backhoe trenching with the land rising towards the hill found in parcel 426, as well as deep soils and
fairly easy access through roads found on the properties. While surveying Parcel 426 on top of the landform
overlooking the floodplain, Shovel Test A426B65 was positive with a tertiary flake found at 80 cmbs. It was
photographed and we proceeded to finish the survey making sure to shorten the intervals for each transect while on
the landform. On the D, E, and F transects, the last shovel tests of the day were on the apex of the landform and all
came up negative however some mussel shell fragments were found in shovel tests A426E72 and A426D71 in the top
20 cm among a 10 YR 4/3 silty clay loam and shovel test A426C69 had a whole mussel shell and a heat altered piece
of sandstone that was also found within the layer. This layer sits on top of a 10 YR 6/6 silty clay loam found 40-70
cmbs and within it is where the flake was found.
The soils found on top of the landform were certainly different than the soil found in the floodplain which was a 10 YR
3/3 clay loam that sat on a 10 YR 2/2 or 10 YR 3/2 compact clay. Determination of wether or not this will be a site or an
isolated find will be made in the coming days.

Crew B started the day at 7:30am and drove to parcel 349. The parcel, including 347,348,349, were a part of an
agricultural field as well as adjoining residential and utilitarian parcels. Parcel 350 was a known historical house still
currently in use. It looked to be a ranch style house possibily from the 50's-60's with an addition on the back/west side.
South of the house, 350-349, was a pen for goats. On the NW end of 347 a water filled quarry was found and can be
seen on aerial maps. P348 was a disturbed parcel south of a creek with an existing cell tower on it. Most of P349 was a
active agricultural field with planted grass. The weather was 30-40 degrees with light rain and high, 20-30mph, wind.
Subsoil of the area was a brown CLLO with small gravels. Transect intervals were set to 180m with some mitigation
due to the quarry, tower, and house/residential yard.
The crew then moved to P344 and 343. The road bisecting the two parcels rests on the highest point on the local
land form, as such P344 slopes downward to the east and 343 slopes to the west. P344 was a cut grass field and was
surveyed at 180m intervals. Subsurface of the parcel was a deep pale brown CLLO with small gravels to depth. P343
was a plowed field with planted grass around a wooded creek basin. Subsoil on the top of the land form found a brown
CLLO with gravels to 70cmbs, 70-80cmbs was a pale yellow brown CLLO with gravels, 80+ was bedrock; the rest of
the ST on the parcel never found bedrock. The creek on the parcel created a deep cutbank to bedrock; a cutbank
photo was taken revealing a dark CLLO ~2-3m in depth before bedrock.
The crew then moved to P337-336. This area was a tall grass field with areas of scattered brush. A high land form
sat to the south east of the survey area so ABC transects were shortened to 160m then lengthened back to 180m on
the return. The land form had a brown CLLO with gravel to a bedrock at ~60m. The rest of the survey the subsoil was a
dark brown CLLO with gravel. A pond exists on the north part of 336 and F was mitigated. No cultural material was
found.

All positive shovel tests were OT's, 1,3,4, from historic house
delineation.

The crew traveled to P281 and began survey. The parcel was slope from a high land form to the NW down to a dry
creek bed and then up slope again near the road to the southeast. Vegetation in the area was a mixed juniper woods
on the slope with many briars; the tops of the land forms was tall grass scattered patches. Soil on the tops of the land
forms was a SALO to shallow bedrock at 25cmbs. On the slope and near the creek the soils were a CLLO with gravels
to depth or deep bedrock. Shovel tests were spaced more on a judgmental interval based on the top of land forms but
generally conformed to a 160m spacing.
The crew then traveled to P165 to document a previously discovered mid 20th century historic home. This will be
talked about more on the attached site form. The crew left the field at 12:30 to return to Austin and unpack gear.

Parcel 423 consists of a grassy fields small slope on the edge of a flood plain with some standing water. The portion
we visited today is the western side of the parcel that we did not survey before due to running out of time. Soils
consisted of a compact 10 YR 3/2 clay
Parcel 433 is a grassy young hardwood woodland and scattered secondary growth with a slope that rises towards
the top of a landform in the Eastern portion of the parcel. The soils at the bottom of the slope consist of a 10 YR 2/2 or
a 10 YR 3/2 clay loam that sits atop a 10 YR 2/1 or a 10 YR 2/2 compact clay. On the top of the landform amongst the
running hogs and spread out trees, the soils consist of a 10 YR 4/3 or a 10 YR 5/2 clay with calcium carbonate nodule
inclusions at 10-30 cmbs.

Parcel 556 generally consists of a plowed field with a grassy field among young crosstimbers that sit atop a landform
that gently slopes to the south towards a named creek that runs east/west in the southern most portion of Parcel 557.
Since it was a steep cut bank and water still sat in the creek, it was not possible to cross, hence it was a good thing we
surveyed from 556 rather than 558 which was the original plan. The soils within the plowed field are a thin plow zone
with a 10 YR 2/1 clay underneath it. Among the grassy field and secondary growth within a young crosstimber woods,
the soils are a 10YR 4/3 silty clay that sits on a 10 YR 5/2 compact clay with some 5 YR 5/8 clay motteling.
Parcel 557 mostly consists of a series of dried up small creeks that feed into the named creek in the southern end of
the parcel and for this reason was designated as a potential backhoe trenching area. The deposition is deep and is
mostly a 10YR 3/2 silty clay loam atop a 10 YR 5/2 silty clay. We took a couple pictures of the cutbank and it would be
a perfect place to backhoe trench if a way of getting there with said backhoe could be found. Judging by the aerial, it
may be possible to get one there by county road 4050, however in investigating if the road was accessible, we found a
gate, which I presume belongs to the landowner which would have to be contacted for any trenching to be conducted.

Historic Corral
Factility

The crew started the day packing up and driving to the field from the Austin office. We arrived at 573 and began
survey to the south with ABC transects. Immediately we found many existing PL's on the BC transects and mitigated
them until the proposed pipeline stopped paralleling them. In 574 on the EF line we saw a possible historic corral and
proceeded to document it as a site, see attached site description. 574 was a Semi-wooded area with high grass and
mixed woods. The soils in the area was a brown SA w/ GR to a red yellow basal clay at ~60-80cmbs. Due to the sites
in the area, as seen on the given aerials, we conducted the entire survey at 150m intervals.
575 was a short grass field with a few trees dotting the landscape. Soils in the area were a SA to a red CL at ~3050cmbs. The pipeline turns in this parcel coming near an existing barn and house before positioning itself between an
existing power line and an existing water line in the turn in 576.
The center line continues between these two for the remainder of the PL to the pump station. The area is a cleared
short grass ROW. Due to the disturbance of the existing lines BCD transects were stopped throughout 575-584. We
continued on A line to the south, until it began to enter the existing road, and EF lines on the return. These transects
were in a mixed woods area with brown SA to red basal CL at 30-60cmbs.
Afterward we traveled to 556 to help crew A finish it's survey. We planted one shovel test each in a plowed dark
CLLO field to 50cmbs.

Crew B started the day at 7:30am and drove to the west side of parcel 516. There we began survey to the SE at
150m intervals; each of the four crew members were on their own transect, ABCD. 516 is a slope to a rise in land form
to the SE with a constructed pond to the NW. The area was disturbed, being previously tilled and planted with winter
wheat grass that now is a cattle pasture. The soil was a brown SACLLO to a red yellow basal CLLO at ~30-40cmbs. In
the upper layer some large gravel/cobbles were intermixed in the SACLLO.
The crew continued survey into 517. The NW portion of this area is the crest of the rise in land form gradually sloping
down SE and becoming a rolling pasture. Again most of this area is a previously tilled winter wheat cattle pasture. As
the survey continued E it passed around another stock pond, there are 3 total in 517, and partially into a barn with
ancillary structures. None of the structures looked particularly historic of threatened by the proposed PL. Soils in the
lowest portion of the parcel had areas of deep dark brown CLLO to depth while others had a brown SACLLO to red
brown basal at ~40-60cmbs.
In parcel 518 the land form remained relatively level with the E fence line resting ~2m above the elevation of the
constructed road. Vegetation in the area changed to a short grass with taller scrub and patches of briar-ridden mixed
woods. Soils in this area were a lighter brown SACLLO to a shallower basal at ~25-35cmbs. In some areas in the
wooded portion of F line the basal clay was at surface.
For the return survey the crews doubled up on the remaining two transects. The crew finished the survey around
noon. Afterward we drove back to the hotel and proceeded to upload data, scan documents, sharpen shovels, and fix
any errors or gaps in the paperwork. The crew finished office work at 1:30pm.

Parcel 505 and 506 are a backyard to a residential house and are grassy pastures cow pastures. The soil is a 10 YR
4/4 sandy loam atop a 10 YR 2/2 clay at around 40 cmbs.
Parcel 507 is a grassy cow grazing area among some short mesquite. The soil in this parcel was the same as 505
and 506.
Parcel 508 is a large grassy field with a couple older trees scattered about and is a pasture for the cows that reside
on it. The field gently slopes to the east towards a drainage that separates parcels 508 and 509. The soil in the field is
a 10 YR 3/2 clay loam to 80 cmbs.
Parcel 509 consists of a landform that overlooks two drainages on either side of it (both the eastern and western
sides). Within the drainages, there is an abundance of modern trash and the soil on the downslope towards the
drainages are a 10 YR 5/4 clay with gravel inclusions while on top of the landform, the soils are a 10 YR 4/4 sandy
loam atop a 10 YR 5/6 or 7.5 YR 5/8 clay which is found between 50 and 65 cmbs.

We started the morning with parcels 616,617,618,852. Parcels 616 and 617 were flat pasture land with short
grasses, mixed brush and small mesquite trees. The road is to the west and a small stand of large oak trees is to the
south. A small tank with man made burms is to the west of the houses and road, there are some low laying areas with
standing water and small trees. The land was level with silty clay loam from 20-80 cm deep varying from 10YR5/1 to 10
YR4/4 in color. The clay layer could be found roughly 30-50 cmbs and ranged in color from 10YR 4/3, 10YR7/4 and 7.5
YR 5/6. Parcel 617 was also open pasture land with little brush and no trees, the grasses remained short through out
the parcels. Mankin cemetery was to the North of parcel 617 and the road leading to the cemetery between 617 and
852 was routinely used while we were surveying. Starting in 852 a grey mottled clay was aprox 20 cm below the
surface. Power lines ran East to West across this parcel and 617. A tractor barn was to the South East of parcel and
contained round hay bales. Parcle 619 was also open field land with large paks arcound the edge of the fence. A
corrigated tin barn with cattle and a small stand of oak trees were in the center of the parcel. Red clay was found at
40cmbs in some areas of 619 and white clay was found at 20cmbs. Transects A,B,C and D were dug individually at
150 meter intervals through out the block of parcels and transects E and F were dug in groups of two at 150 meter
intervals.
At 10:30 am we moved to the second block of parcels 567,568,569 and 570. Parcels 567-569 are all one open
previously plowed field, that had been recently mowed. 4 ag terraces cross through 567 and 568. There is also a very
gradual South West slope to the land. 569 has a man made pond with built up berms and medium sized trees around
the edges. Parcel 570 is a small field behind a house. There is a red barn next to the fence separating 570 from 569
and is outside the ROW. A man made pond in 570 interrupts transects E and F. The soils through out the block of
parcels are a silty clay loam to aprox 40cmbs and range in color from 10YR 4/4 to 7.5YR4/6. The clay layer ranged
from 20-40cmbs and was 10YR3/4 to 5YR5/6. The Silty clay loam contained round pebbles and gravels. Transects
A,B,C and D were each dug individually at 150 meter intervals while transects E and F were dug in two person teams.
Site 569B1 was found while excavating along transect F and delineated according to protocal.

For Parcel 548 and 549, they are grassy fields in between route 31 to the north and train tracks to the south with a
residential house to the east.
South of the train tracks are where parcels 550, 551, and 552 reside and are all grassy cow pastures with very little
topographical change. Soils within these parcels were a 10 YR 3/3 silty clay to depth.
After calling Mr. and Mrs. Wright who showed us where unmarked waterlines were within parcels 856 and 857 which
are just north of route 31. Since most of the parcels were either disturbed in the western portion or had a house
residing in the eastern portion it was not shovel tested.
Parcels 855 and 853 are hardwood forests on either side of cow creek within parcel 854. The soils near the creek are
a 10 YR 4/3 sandy loam atop a 10 YR 5/2 clay that is mottled with a 5 YR 5/8 clay. While further away from the creek,
soils were a 10 YR 3/2 clay loam that went to depth.
Parcel 537 was a short parcel that was mostly a grassy cow pasture with a small wooded area to the north. The soils
were a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam with gravel.

Parcels 424 and 420 are part of back hoe trenching assessment area. The general land scape of 420 was a very flat
cultivated field that had previously been used for growing corn and had been fairly recently plowed. Two, 2 track roads
cut through the parcel.The east portion of 420 on the opposite side of the 2 track road that we drove in on was less
disturbed than the west side of the road which was the field. 6 shovel tests were dug on the east side of the road
between a dry creek bed and the flowing creek . The soils were eroding away close to the beginning of Transect A and
building up near Transect D. This is the only area that might have potential for being trenched. The soil in this area is a
10YR4/4 silty clay loam to Depth with no evidence of Basel Clay. On the west side of the two track road the main
portion of 420 was the very long plowed field that was very very muddy which hindered the crews ability do dig to
depth. All shovel tests in this portion of the parcel were dug to 30 cmbs, the soil was a uniform 10YR3/2 silty clay loam.
The western boundry of the Parcel was a second two track road running Se/NW ending in a drainage area. South of
the ROW was drainage area running E/W with a very gradual slope to the SW. At the west end of the Parcel the main
two track road we drove in on had trees on either side of it. The field was basically at water level with the roads acting
as levees. Transects A,B,C and D were dug individually at 160 m intervals while transects E and F were leapfrogged in
two teams also at 160 intervals. A small segment of 420 is currently unreachable and will have to be surveyed when
either parcel 421 or 422 becomes available.
Parcel 424 is a small cotton field that has not been plowed recently. The west portion of the parcel is a thick stand of
trees, brush and brier's on the wrong side of an electric fence. The soils nearest to the treed area were a silty clay loam
10YR3/2 turning in to a clay 7.5YR 6/8. Farther in to the field the soils stayed a uniform silty clay loam to depth. This
area was very flat with no changes in the landscape. Transects A, B, C and D were dug individually at 150 m intervals
while transects E and F were dug in teams of 2 also at 150m intervals. This does not seem to a viable area to be
trenched .

General Observations

Parcel 519 is a landform that slopes down toward a drainage found in the eastern portion of the parcel. The drainage
extends through most of parcels 520 and 521 then rises to a landform that overlooks the drainage and separates it
from another drainage found in parcel 522 which turns into a cow pasture in the eastern portion. The soils varied, and
in parcel 519 the soil consisted of a 10 YR 3/4 sandy loam on top of a 5 YR 5/8 clay on the landform with a 10 YR 4/3
silt loam found within the western drainage. Within parcels 520, 521, and 522, the soils were a 10 YR 7/6 compact
clay.
Parcel 538 is a cow pasture with a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam to 60-80cmbs that sat on top of a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay.

Parcels 510 was a small cow pasture with some small trees out of the ROW. The large Farm house and barn were to
the south of the ROW. Parcel 511is also an open cattle pasture that slopes gently to the South and East. There is a
tank to the North with man made berms around it, and trees in all the low laying areas. The East end of the parcel is
heavily treed and contains brush and a thin deep drainage with standing water on the E and F transects. Parcel 511
also has a low rolling landscape . The soils in both parcels were a silty clay loam to 40 or 60CM and 10YR3/2 to 10
YR5/2 in color. Clay was found at 60-80 cmbs and ranged in color from 10YR 4/5 to 10YR3/2. Transects A, B, C and D
were dug individually at 150 M intervals while transects E and F were leapfrogged in two teams at 150 m intervals.

The crew started the day at 8am and traveled from Austin to the field arriving at parcel 615 roughtly 12:30pm. We
began survey on the west side moving east across the eastern branch of the PL in parcel. The western area was a low
elevation short grassy pasture with high cattle traffic. There was evidence from the deep hoof-prints that the area
retains water and had a soft clay layer at the surface. Subsoil in the area was as follows: a brown SICLLO from surface
to ~20-30cmbs mottled with a reddish dark brown 10-20%; below which is a dark brown SICL to depth. No cultural
materials were found.
The land form then slopes up a little in the middle wooded portion of the parcel to a higher level pasture. In the
wooded middle portion of the parcel there was a residential road from the north leading to a few trailer homes with
yards. Shovel tests were no conducted around these homes due to disturbance and shovel tests were resumed in a
fenced short grass pasture area east of the residential road. The pasture continues east, in a level land form, until it
hits the end of the parcel at SH274. In the pasture there is a small pond near the F line around which an aggressive
donkey was encountered; shovel tests were not conducted near the animal on the return survey. Running
perpendicular to the proposed PL is a high voltage power line, paralleling SH274. The subsoil in this area is as follows:
a brown SILO mottled with a darker brown, ~20% large mottle, from surface to ~30-40cmbs; below which a red yellow
SICL with a pale brown motttle is found. Shovel test intervals were kept at 140m throughout the entirety of the
survey. No cultural materials were found

Parcel 615 was an open manicured pasture with a gentle slope to the west and a low laying area in the center to the
pasture. One stock tank was located on the A transect as well as a man made berm that could have been a road or rail
road tracks at one point. The soil in this parcel was a sandy 10YR 4/6 to aprox 40 cmbs ending in a 2.5YR 4/6 clay.
There were oak trees along the fence line with some large trees scattered through out the field. A line of Oaks
bordered the south fence into Parcel 620, Transects D,E and F in parcle 615 to the south were in a wooded area with
light brown sandy soils ending in light brown clay with orange motteling 30-45cmbs.
Parcel 620 was open pasture land with mixed grasses, brush and misquite trees. The soils were very shallow and
disturbed. The upper soil was a sandy clay loam turning in to a clay loam around 20-30cmbs befor turning in to clay at
40-50cmbs. The colors of the sandy clay tended towards 10YR4/3 or 4/2 with the clay color 10YR3/1-5/3. This area
had probably been a plowed field at one point but has not been used as such for 5-10 years as shown by the treen
growth in the area. A small stock pond with man made berm around it was located between the E and F transects. This
area seemed to be flat with no noticable slope to it. All transects were dug individually at 140 m intervals.

Today due to bad weather we were unable to conduct field work, instead we did recon for areas that we will have to
survey later in the following weeks. We stayed in Henderson County looking for other road ways to reach parcels 631,
632 and 633, only Hwy 31 and Forehand road are viable options all other roads in the area are gated or do not
exist.When the PL crosses to the south side of hwy 31 it has a 1.5 km length till it reaches lovers lane, or County Hwy
1300. FM 3441 is just East of Hwy 1300 and the two roads are seperated by parcels 650,651 and 652. Farther to the
East is Hwy 2636 which is the next road that crosses the PL at parcels 664,665 and 666. It is slightly more than 2KM
to the next road that crosses the PL which is FM753, many small roads branch off from this road, but all end in gates
and none come near enough to the PL to be useable.

The crew started the morning and drove to parcel 543. There we began survey heading south at an interval of 150m.
We started survey with the DEF transects as they were the closest to where we parked. Parcels 543-545 were all short
grass cow/horse pastures with a gentle slope to the south. The area had areas of puddles of standing, now frozen,
water indicating a thick clay content. Subsurface of the area was a brown SILO with gravel from surface to ~30cm,
under which a dark brown SICLLO rests to ~50cm.
In some areas a pale brown and red mottled CLLO was found at >50cmbs. As the survey continued closer to the
south and the water source, S. end of 544 and 546, below the brown SILO was a dark SICL from 30-70cmbs before
finding the pale brown red mottled SICL. Above the mottled red SICL the soil became very moist and sticky indicating
that the mottle below was due to a water table and long term water submersion. The vegetation in 546 was a tall scrub
and grass field with scattered mesquite trees; a powerline also runs perpendicular to the ROW in the parcel. Trenching
in this area is not recommended due to the water table found.
After finishing the DEF transects Kevin moved the crew over to help finish the parcels of Crew C. We parked on the
road and began surveying 515 heading west at 150m intervals. The area was a highland with tall grass and scattered
juniper trees; some wooded areas thick we briars were by some ephemeral drainage in the transects. The subsurface
was a lighter brown SICLLO to a high compaction at 50cmbs. The crew conducted 2-3 shovel tests on each transect,
DEF, before meeting up with crew C.
After we had finished the parcels with Crew C we then moved, with Crew C and K. Stone, to help Crew A finish their
survey. We conducted shovel tests in conjunction with Crew C with crew C keeping the paperwork. Either C or A crew
chief will produce a write-up of that area, 562.

Parcel 515 had scattered trees of oak, misquite and ceder through out. It was a open cattle pasture iwht a
transmition line running NE-SW through the ROW the transmition line doubled as a two track road in this parcel. Just
west of the TL was a thick stand of trees with many drainages going in various directions, the trees were thickest along
the lower areas of the drainages.The land sloped slightly twords the South of the parcel. The soils in 515 were fairly
deep with a sandy loam that ended 40 to 70 cmbs to be followed by basel clay. The sandy clay loam varied in color
from 10YR 4/2 to 10YR4/8. The clay layer was anytbhing from 10YR3/4-4/5-4/6. Parcel 514 was not seperated from
parcel 515 in any way, this area was also a open cattle pasture with a gently rolling landscape with the same soil
topograpy as 515. Parcel 513 was the largest area covered today. The parcel was split in to many different segments,
those to the E were sectioned off in to small animal pastures or pens, the soils in this area were very compact and
being frozen were almost impossible to dig.The parcel then opens up in to a very large fieldwith a slope to the SW and
a transmition line running NE across the parcel. A Two track road runs through this area going from a house in the SW
corner of the parcle, to a man made lake to a Barn on the NE portion of the parcel. A small stock pond also inside a tall
fence was on Transect lines E and F. The area around the lake was full of drainages all heading to the low area. This
area was full of oak, misquite, pecan and cedar trees. There was heavy brush and brambles also in the area. A very
steep slope leading to a drainage along the W portion of the portion prevented us from digging near the end of our
transect lines. The soils in the Western part of Parcel 513 are very shallow and rocky with clay at aprox 10-15 cmbs
was yellowish grey in color. All transects were dug individually at 140 m intervals unless the area was inundated with
water or impassible.
Parcel 562 was surveyed by all three crews in teams of 2 the area was an open field with medium tall grasses and
some trees around the fence lines

Parcel 564 is a low lying juniper woodland that runs just to the east of state highway 309 with subsurface soils that
consist of a 10 YR 3/3 compact clay.
Parcel 562 in the southern portion consists of a gravel driveway and what is essentially a residential front yard with
soils in this area that are generally disturbed and extremely gravelly. As you head toward the northern end of the
parcel, it gently rises and eventually plateaus and slopes downward toward a drainage that separates parcels 562 and
561. At the apex of the landform just west of the proposed APE, there is what looks to be an old cistern or some sort of
underground storage area build from brick and mortar. This was found with the help of Crews B and C at the end of the
day. While we were heading south from parcel 558, the other crews came and headed north along transects A, B, and
C and we met at the drainage. The crews also had a couple of positive shovel tests near the brick cistern within the
APE that had a piece of white ware in one, and a piece of glass in the other. We (Crew A) will go and delineate the
shovel tests and assign a site number at a later date. We also took a picture of one of the bricks that has "Whiteselle
Corsicana" printed on it and will request that some background research be done to determine any possible dates that
could be associated with the company that manufactured the brick. On the landform, the soils were generally a 10 YR
4/3 or a 10 YR 3/3 compact clay.
In shovel testing the wooded areas just to the north and south of the creek found between parcels 561 and 562, we
found that this section is a very likely candidate for back hoe trenching. Our shovel tests on either side consists of a 10
YR 4/3 clay loam atop a 10 YR 4/4 silt loam that went to depth and the bank of the creek is at least 15 feet deep.
Parcel 561 to the north of the creek rises to the north and plateaus to a large cow pasture that extends into parcels
560, 559 and 558. Then within 558, it gently slopes downward towards a large creek and an area that is already
designated as high probability for back hoe trenching. The south side of the creek however doesn't have that much soil
deposition and the wooded area to the south is only around 15m in width with soils that consist of 10 YR 3/2 clay loam
that go to depth while within the cow pasture just to the south has soils that consist of a 10 YR 4/3 compact clay that sit
on a 10 YR 5/6 clay with calcium nodule inclusions.

Parcel 502 was open pasture land with small misquite trees, flat land and tall thick grasses, the soil was a silty clay
loam to 40 or 50 cmbs turning in to clay. Parcel 501 was a well manicured field that had been recently mowed. It had a
man made stock pond with berm on transect F. There were also some planted trees with fencing around them to keep
the live stock from eating them. The area was gently rolling and had been previously plowed some years before.
Parcel 500 was a wild game area, with a 9 foot game fence that had to be climbed. There was a large cleared area
around the fence line for driving around the property.The rest of the parcel contains thick misquite and brush , after ST
F21 is a 2 trac road running N/S and a heavy slope down to the West twors a stock tank. The area aroud the tank is
heavily disturbed with berms and dugouts. The drainages that run out of the tank are full of tires and modern
trash.There are other drainages that run E/W that are S of the ROW.The soil in this area is getting thinner with a silty
clay top soil turning in to clay at 20 to 30cmbs.
Parcel 499 is still within the wildgame area and contains many hills. We tried to place as many shovel tests on top of
the hills as possible.The area was thick with misquite trees and some small cedars. Many drainages and 2 trac roads
criss cross this parcel. A large stock tank cuts through transects E and F, this area is also highly disturbed. with large
berms, 2 trac roads, animal usage, Deer feeders, cattle troughs and a hog trap. Parcel 498 is very slopey with many 2
trac roads crossing the transect area, all of the shovel tests in this area were very shallow with clay very near the
surface. This area was still covered with heavy vegitation. Parcel 497 had less slope than any of the previously
mentioned parcels but still containd lots of drainages. Parcel 496 was an area around a very nice house with a stock
tank near it. The slopes ran down twords the stock tank with the house at the highest point on the property. The ROW
passed near the front of the house, and had many push piles to the East of the house on top of the slope. Just east of
the house was a pile of modern brick and some metal.The soils were a silty clay loam to aprox 30-40 cmbs befor
turning in to clay. Parcel 495 had a large hill to the West on all transects with some Bo darc trees through out the field.
The rolling upland area was mostly bare of trees and covered with thick grasses. A large barn and cattle pen was seen
off to the North end of the parcel. The soils in this parcel were all heavy clay with very little silt. Parcel 494 was all slope
down to the East, with thinly scattered misquite and bodarc trees. Soils in this area were rocky and thin with clay at 20
to 30 cmbs. Parcel 493 was open gently rolling fields with a drainage running N/S through all the transects, just to the
S of the ROW is a large levee and man made lake. Parcels 492 and 491 were both tree covered and hillie,all shovel
tests ended between 30 and 40 cmbs in heavy clay. All transects were dug individually at 140m intervals. Team C
surveyed transects D,E and F.

Todays survey for Crew A consisted of surveying south east along the A, B, and C transects through the parcels listed
while Crew C surveyed northwest along the D, E, and F transects. At the end of the transects, we drove the other
crew's truck back to the hotel.
The general landscape for parcels 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499 and 500 consist of a series of rolling
hills that are separated by small drainages with the surrounding vegetation being mostly a young hardwood woodland
that acts as cow grazing land. There is a 500 meter gap along the A transect within parcel 493 due to a levy that
encompassed that part of the transect. Besides that, there is also an abundance of two tracks, and roads that weave
throughout the parcels with a house residing on the northern side of the corridor just outside the APE within parcel
496. The soils found within these parcels were a 10 YR 5/6 compact clay with gravel, with a 10 YR 2/1 compact clay
found beneath it on occasion, but the clay was compact throughout the entirety of the landscape within these parcels
including the drainages.
The further east we surveyed, the darker and siltier the soils became and in parcel 501 within the cow pasture that
makes up the parcel, the soils were a 10 YR 4/3 silt loam that sat atop a 10 YR 2/1 compact clay.
Within parcel 502, which consists of a floodplain like setting with short hardwoods and tall grasses, the soil was a mix
of different soils the further east we surveyed due in part to the roads/transit lines that terminate the transects. The soils
were mostly a 10 YR 3/3 silty loam that were terminated either by gravels at 60 cmbs, compact clay at 55 cmbs, or
water table at 70cmbs in the western portion of the survey area.
For parcel 503, since it is only a small sliver that comes into the corridor, we took a picture of it and moved onto parcel
504 which consists of a residential grassy yard with an artificial pond to the northern end. Soils were a 10 YR 3/3 silty
clay atop a 10 YR 2/2 compact clay.

The crew left for the field at 7:30 and arrived at parcel 543. We began surveying N to S at 150m intervals on the C
transect. In the southern half of 543 we came upon a historic collapsed garage with collapsed shed and other ancillary
features (see site form for details) we GPS and photographed the site and continued on the survey. The area had
previously been surveyed the day prior on the DEF transect lines and the daily log from 2/2/11 describes the land form,
veg, and subsoil we encountered in 543-546. The area was a short grass cow pasture with a brown SILO W/ GR to a
hydric SICLLO at ~30cmbs. On the return we conducted the A and B transects. Once the shovel tests arrived close to
the historic features we then conducted 6 OT's close and between each feature. No artifacts were found subsurface.
The soils were a brown SILO to a yellow SICLLO at ~30cmbs. More photos were taken of the features and it was
thought we would come back at another time to finish the documentation.
The crew then passed CR3020 into parcel 542 to begin survey on a new portion. This area was a highland with a
house yard, and debris field, jutting into the line partially on the E side.To the west was a cemetery, outside of the PL
boundary. The area was a short grass pasture from 542-539 separated by barbwire fences. In some areas frozen
puddles of water had collected on the surface. Transects were kept at a 150m interval thoughout the survey. the land
form gently rises to the N. Subsoil of the area was as follows: The area had deep deposits of SACLLO with gravels
above a dark brown SICLLO at 30-50cmbs; which sat above a hydric SICL at 50-70cmbs. About the time we reached
the northern end of the survey section we began to have GPS problems, most likely due to the cold, and had to rely on
each other's GPS' to continue the survey. After we reached the halfway mark M. Miller, who had joined us for the
second half of our day, went to the site we had found eariler that day and finished the documentation. We were not
able to survey the remaining parcels on our list, 503 and 504, due to the GPS issues we were having and were called
back to the hotel.

Parcel 361 was a small narrow parcel in the same field as parcel 362, both parcels were in a well manicured horse
pasture with short grasses and gently rolling land. The soil was thick gumbo clay at surface and turned in to degraded
bedrock at 30 to 50 cmbs. We talked to the land owner who wanted to know what kind of problems would arise if she
wanted to sell part of her property before the pipeline went in. She also wanted to make sure we did not dig up her
dead horses that were buried in the pasture. Parcel 360 was in the field across the road from 361 and 362, the parcel
had been previoulsy plowed a few years before, there were short grasses in the east part of the parcel with thick black
clay from surface to depth. Twords the West end of the parcel the bedrock was higher and thus the clay ended at 3040 cmbs and the degraded bedrock started. Cedar, misquite and some other small trees were located along all of the
fence lines, and a small drainage was located twords the end of AB and C transects. All transects were dug individually
at 140 m intrvals.

Crew B started the day at the Austin office at 8:00am. We packed up and then traveled to the field south of
Waxahachie to survey parcels 367, 368, 369. The weather was in the 40's to 50's, sunny, and with strong wind from
the NW. We began the survey working N to S at a constant 150m interval. Parcel 367 was a tilled agricultural field with
near 100% ground visibility. The area was wet from the melted snow from last week and areas of standing water was
visible. The ground itself was sticky from the water and walking in the field caused our feet to sink into the mud 1015cmbs until hitting a compact, drier, layer below. The soil itself was a very dark brown, 10YR 2/1, SILO containing
gravels, and some trash, from the yearly tilling. This soil continued to depth and must be a few meters thick judging
from the cutbanks seen in the area. The southern area of the parcel contains a uncultivated backyard of a house with a
garden and tall grass fenced yard. This protrudes into the A-D transects. The land form of the parcel is a very gentle
downslope to the SE.
Parcel 368 was a grassy wooded area containing older trees and tall brush/bush. In the middle of the parcel was a
small perennial creek that runs roughly perpendicular to the PL. North of the creek the land form is a gentle downslope
to the SE while S. of the creek there is a sharper rise to a highland. On this rise the vegetation was tall grasses with
scattered juniper trees. The soils of this area was the same dark SILO. Some shovel tests were militated due to the
creek and standing water.
Parcel 369 contains the crest of the high land form at its northern end followed by a gentle downslope to the SE. The
area was a tilled field, most likely wheat due to the bales to the south, much the same as 367. Ground visibility was
nearly 100% and the area was highly muddy due to last weeks weather. Subsoil continued to be a dark SILO to depth.
No cultural materials were observed.

Parcel 351 is a large business property thus not dug on, photos were taken. Parcel 352 is an open plowed and
planted field with heavy clay 10YR 3/2 to depth with degraded bedrock gravels through out. A powerline runs north to
South across the parcel, and there is a gradual sloping from the east to west, trees are only seen along the fence line.
Parcel 353 is a cattle pasture with short grasses, a man made stock tank with a berm and a large corrigated metal
barn on transects E and F.Soils here are still the 10YR3/2-2/1 black clay with degraded bedrock gravels and
occasional ending in bedrock at 40cmbs. Parcel 354 is someones yard and across a small rural paved road from 353
and 352, the area is sloped in many directions with some terraceing twords the road, soils are the same here as
previous parcels. Parcel 356 is a small horse pasture with a slope from the east, soils here are shallow, rocky and end
in bedrock at 20-30cmbs. Some small trees are in the parcel and more around the edges of the fencing. Parcel 357 is
a large area split in to several different plowed and planted fields as well as a few cattle pastures. The ground had
warmed up by 10:30am which made it much harder to dig deeper in to the clay. the soils through out this parcel were a
rich dark clay with degraded bedrock and then ending in bedrock at 40-60cmbs. All of the fields were plowed and
planted with a very slight slope from the SE to NW. All transects were dug individualy at 150m intervals due to the
survey taking place today in plowed fields.

see general comments

Parcel 335 is predominantly a plowed agricultural field with a gently sloping landscape that rises towards a landform in
the southern half of the parcel with some grassy fields and scattered hardwoods in the eastern portion of the parcel.
This parcel was designated to be an area for a Booster Pump Station, and is Site A. Since this was an area survey, we
surveyed in transects along a bearing of 150 degrees which matched the bearing of the eastern side of the parcel.
There were eight transects that were 50 meters apart to get enough coverage over the area. The soils among the
plowed field consisted of a 10 YR 4/3 clay loam atop either a 10 YR 4/4 compact clay with limestone inclusions, a 10
YR 5/4 silty loam kaliche, or bedrock on top of the landform. The soil within the grassy wooded area to the east consist
of a 10 YR 2/2 that sit atop a 10 YR 2/2 compact clay with limestone inclusions.

'The crew began the day at 7:30am and travelled to parcel 363. The weather conditions for today started in the 20's
with high wind and rose to sunny and in the 50's by the end of the day. We began survey of parcel 363 working W. to
E. Because of the land form and the proximity to water we conducted the shovel test intervals at 140m with some
adjusted to the crest of slopes. The parcel was a short grass pasture with a gentle slope to the NE. Past the long
driveway in the middle of the parcel there is a berm at the edge of the high landform followed by a steeper slope to the
water. This steeper sloped area had taller grasses with patches of exposed limestone gravels and a thick wooded area
to the north. Subsoil for the parcel was a compact dark brown SILO w/ GR to depth or compaction at 50cmbs+. The
closer to the water, on the slope, the lighter the brown soil seemed to become and with bedrock found at ~30cmbs.
We then moved and began survey on parcels 410 and 409 at an interval of 150m.
Parcel 410 was a tall grass pasture with an old corral to the SW corner of the fenceline. The parcel was separated
from the adjoining 409 parcel by an active rail road tracks. The landform had a gentle slope to the W. with subsoils
being a dark brown SILO w/ GR to depth or compaction ~50cmbs+.
Parcel 409 was a short grass cow pasture with many scattered mesquite trees. There was also some areas of
standing water on surface. The landform itself had a gentle slope to the middle of the parcel where there was a
creek/drainage (flowing but unknown if perennial) that had carved itself into the level ground ~50cmbs. This
creek/drainage ran perpendicular to the prop PL and seemed to flow into a nearby water body to the SW. Subsoils in
this area were consistent with 410.
The crew then worked on 412 to the south in a N-S survey. The survey interval would remain the same 150m. The
area was a gently rolling short grass field with a trend to lower elevations to the SE. Most of the field was grass with
only a few scattered mesquite/junipers to be seen. On the NE end there was a stock pond constructed on the A-B
transects and a few hundred meters to the E of that an erosional/agricultural berm/old road running N-S along the edge
of an area of higher elevation. On the southern end of parcel there was a fenced in portion of planted winter wheat, still
short. The parcel also had areas of standing water trending to the lower lying portions of the land but no definite
drainage. The soils in this parcel were consistent with those found in both 410 and 409. No cultural materials were
present.

Parcels 379 and 382 are both plowed and planted fields with a small two trac road seperating them. Both areas are
relatively flat with some small ag terracing and a gradual slop N to S. Parcel 382 has trees planted along its SE border
to block it from FM road 984. The soils in both parcels were a thick clay to depth, of 10YR3/2-4/1 with gravels through
out. A transmition line ran directly off of hwy 877. Parcel 381 is across FM road 984 and is also a plowed and planted
field with a small drainage running N/S in the center of the parcel and a gentle rise to the N.Parcel 383 is a plowed field
with a power line running N/S with a stand of trees to the SE spliting it from Parcel 384. 384 is again a plowed field with
heavy trees and brush and a drainage running along its NW edge. This parcel has a small rise twords the center and
ag terraces are present. A drainage running E/W splits parcel 384 from parcel 385 which yet again is a plowed
fieldwith another drainage running N/S, near the southern most part of the parcel. Trees are present in the drainages
as well as along the eastern boundry of the parcel. All parcels contained dense clay to depth. All transects were dug at
140M intervals individually.
Parcel 321 was a large area of rolling land split in to many different pastures by barbed wire. The first field nearest
Richards Rd, was a cattle pasture with 2 stock tanks and large berms with Trees in all of the low laying areas. The
ground was covered in mixed grasses with intermitent trees throughout. The soils in the Western portion of 321 were a
black clay to depth, farther to the east in the parcel, the soils became thinner and lighter. These being a silty clay 10YR
4/6-3/2 ending in a mottled clay from 40 to 60cmbs. Parcels 322 and 323 were seperate small cattle pastures with
short grasses and sparce trees, parcel 323 had a small stock tank with large berm and a barn with much farm
equipment. Soils in this area were also a Silty clay ending in a mottled clay between 40-60cmbs. Transects A,B and C
were dug at 150m intervals indivially and as teams by team C. Transects D,E and F were dug by team B.

The crew started at 7:30am. The weather throughout the day was 20's to mid 30's and sunny with a light wind. The
crew arrived off CR877 and began survey traveling from E-W at 150m intervals. In the morning the ground, and water
on the ground, was frozen solid, but in the afternoon it had melted.
On parcel 378 and 377 the land was being utilized as a short grass cattle pasture. The parcels have a gentle slope to
the west with a creek in a Y-shape in the middle of 377. In the bank of the creek a thin layer of crude chert and
quartzite could be seen between the B and C horizon. Below this is a caliche/ degrading limestone layer. The shovel
tests in the area were unable to get 50+ cmbs and to the other layers due to the increasing clay content of the above
dark brown SICL w/ GR.
Parcel 376 was a tall grass with mixed brush trees. The ground was rolly in the area with areas of standing water. I
believe it is probably a lowland flood zone. The soil was dark SICL with gravel.
Parcel 375 was a tilled cotton field with 90-95% ground visibility. The area was a rolling land form.
Parcel 374 was a tilled corn field, perhaps baby corn. There was a high rise in land form in the center of the parcel with
gradual slope west and east. There was a standing water drainage, from the creek in 377, on the west side of the
parcel. On the return trip some of the ST's were militated by the corral in the ROW on 377.
The crew then moved to 324,323,321. These were surveyed in conjunction with crew C.
Parcel 324 is just a paved/gravel road.
Parcel 323 is a short grass pasture in a lowland with a stock pond to the NW. The subsoil was a brown SICL with GR
to caliche at roughly 30cmbs. During this survey the trimble died, and I was forced to finish the F line on Delorme #5.
Parcel 321 was a high, but not steep, rise in lanform at the center of parcel. The slopes of the landform were terraced
on all sides of the slope; there were many terraces along the slope. The vegetation itself was a tall grass and the area
was used as a cow pasture. The subsoil was a mostly ark brown SICL with GR but some area of the slope, by the
terraces, show a brown SICL to caliche at ~30cmbs. The area is most likely disturbed with terracing/leveling but still
relatively shallow bedrock. All screening had to be done by hand due to the sticky nature of the clays.

20

Parcels 330 and 331 are in the same small field, the land is gently rolling with no trees and mixed grasses, this is a
cattle pasture, the soil is a 10YR3/2 clay to 50-60cmbs and ends in bedrock. Parcel 332 has trees around the edges
and a small drainage , this area is highly manicured, with very short grasses and a slope from N to S, soils here are a
darker clay 10YR2/1. Parcel 333 is a overgrown pasture with mixed trees and tall grasses,and a slope from E to W.
The clay layer hear is also 10YR2/1 to 3/2. Parcel 334 is a cattle pasture with trees and short grasses due to the cattle,
there is a drainage running N/S through the parcel. A modern cement bridge goes over the drainage and there is the
remnents of a windmill and well in this area surrounded by trees, but is no in the ROW. No sub surface material was
found on the transects in this area. The soil here was black clay as well. Transects A,B,C and D were dug individually
at 140m intervals, while transects E and F were dug in teams of two.

25

The crew began at 7:30am and drove to the field at 392,393.
392 was a short grass yard with a trailer home in the middle. Parcel 393 was a tilled corn field with 95% ground
visibility. Both parcels were on nearly level landform with a subsoil of a dark brown SICL with Gr. In 393 you could see
many fist-sized cobbles of chert/quartzite and limestone however no flakes were found.
Afterwards the crew moved to 397,398. 398 was a short grass yard with a mobile home on it and 397 was a very
muddy short grass cattle pasture. Due to the electric fence and easily agitated cattle we met up with the land owner to
be escorted onto the property. Talking with him he told us to steer clear of the cows as the could be aggressive; he laid
out feed so that they might stay away from us. He then explain that most of the northern portion of the 397 parcel had
deep mud due to the recent weather, he said, "[We] would sink up to your knees in that mud.". So in keeping a
distance from the cows and staying on the dryer portions of his property we sank 3 shovel tests where we could fit
them in the SE portion of the parcel. The subsoil was the same dark brown SICL w/ GR. Throughout the survey for
today we dug our holes to <40cmbs due to the sticky compact clay and were forced to hand screen every test. No
cultural material was present.

6

Parcel 23 is a small waste water treatment area, photos were taken, no shovel tests were dug here. Parcel 27 was a
pasture type area with lots of brush and trees, misquite and bodarc. Lots o modern trash was in the area surveyed.
Only transects AB and C were surveyed on this parcel due to a large drainage being through transect D and E and F
being is someones manicured back yard with chainlink fence and dogs. Parcel 26 was was also in a back yard but
was shovel tested on transects D,E and F. The area was highly disturebed with a heavy slope E/W. Soils were a dark
clay with bedrock gravels.

Crew B started at 8:00am and traveled to the field. We arrived at parcel 313 and began survey to the SE at 150m
intervals. Throughout 313-317 the land was utilized as a pasture for grazing sectioned off by fences, some barbed
some pipe; with the exception of parcel 315 who the majority is a tilled grassy field, with evidence of grazing. Due to
the berming and blading of the area to the NW portion of our survey area we photoed and began the A transect to the
south of it, can be seen on aerial. The landform is relatively level high terrace with a very slight upslope to the E. Below
the surface we found a brown to dark brown SICLLO w/ GR to a bedrock at 30cmbs. The depth of the bedrock
increased as we continued the survey SE until we could no find it past 60cmbs in 315, due to high compaction/clay.
After we finished the return survey we began to work north of the road, FM1446, on parcel 312-310 to help Crew A.
We surveyed the DEF transects travelling NW at 150m intervals. Most of 312 was highly disturbed from construction of
drainages and buildings so we decided to begin survey W of the road. W of the road had high ground disturbance due
to high cattle traffic around some troughs so again we moved the start of our survey W of that area, see brown area on
arial. in the remander of 312 and 311 the vegetation was a short grass pasture with sparse old trees. The land was a
rolling pasture with a high point in the middle of the parcel where 41EL88 sits. The subsoil was much the same as S of
1446 with a brown to dark brown SICLLO w/ GR above a shallow limestone bedrock at 30-50cmbs. In 310 the area
was a cultvated field, level with planted grass. The subsoil remained consistant with previous parcels. We joined up
with Crew A at the northern treeline of 310 and proceeded to move south to begin deliniation of 41EL88.

37

the soils near the school are disturbed, however the rest of the
parcels were fairly uniform in deposition.

Parcel 312 consists of a high school within the eastern portion of the parcel and a grassy cow pasture that lies on the
western portion of the parcel across the road (Perimeter Road found off of FM 1446). The cow pasture extends into
Parcel 311 which is dominated by a small landform where the scarce remnants of site 41EL88 reside.
Parcel 310 is largely a plowed field with grass but there is a short wooded area to the northwest where site 41EL101
resides.
The soils were primarily a 10 YR 4/2 or a 10 YR 4/3 and all shovel tests were terminated by bedrock between 5 and
40 cmbs.

Parcel 38 was a horse pasture next to a highschool and off of HWY 731, the ground was covered in mixed grasses,
mostely short, with a thin covering of Misquite, Cedar and cactus. The surface in this area is mostly level. A Gas line
runs perpendicular to the road. The soil is very disturbed in this area closest to the road. A two track road is present
just north of the C transect at ST C48. A Fallen down building is also present close to the boarder of parcel 39, a few
shovel tests were put in this area and there was no sub surface material. A small round stock tank was present on
Transect F in this Parcel as well. A drainage area was present in the eastern portion of this Parcel and was covered in
heavy growth and trees. The soils in 38 tended to be a thin black clay ending in bed rock at 20 to 30cmbs.
Parcel 39 is a cattle pasture with a deep drainage/creek that runs through the parcels and was crossed on all
transects. A large transmition line ran beside all the parcels to the S and was close to the ROW at the E end of Parcel
39. Some areas in this parcel have deep clay 10YR2/1 to 5Y3/4 Very little bedrock was found in this area.
Parcel 37 has very heavy trees along the drainage area, the drainage runs E/W just north of transect F with a smaller
dry drainage running parallel to it to the South. On the N side of the larger drainage the land slopes up slightly and is
covered in trees and brush. Also along this drainage is a large push pile aprox 100M long consisting of cement, bricks
and modern trash. Soils in this area were a mix of black and red clays with very little bedrock to be found. All transects
were dug individually at 140 m intervals.

The crew started the day at 7:30 and drove to Lemon Rd. where we began survey to the west on DEF lines; with an
interval of 150m. Parcel 89 was a tall grass disturbed field to the east with a dense briar covered creek to the north
running E-W. At a N-S branch in the creek there were very tall, ~15m tall, cane plants. The land form of this area was a
lowland terrace with SACL to a basal clay at ~30cmbs. Near the creek the soil was a compacted white mottled
SICL.West of the creek the vegetation became a old growth pine woods with low brush and deep red brown SA to
depth or basal at >30cmbs. As the land form rose the woods turned from old growth piney woods to old oak with thick
brush/briar.
At the top of the rise in land form, the beginning of parcel 88, sits an abandoned damaged A frame house. The house
and surrounding debris was deemed no historic and photographed. On the west side of the hill, and into the
downslope, is a constructed pump station with leveled and graveled area. Shovel tests were not conducted in this area
and were restarted at the west end of the station. The vegetation became a mixed woods with dense briar to the north
with areas to the south of high grass and juniper trees. The landfrom of the remaining area was featureless with a slight
down slope to the S. to a constructed pond outside of the survey area. The subsoils were a red brown SA with GR to a
mottled red/yellow/pale CLLO at >30cmbs. Parcel 87 was a bladed mowed grass yard with scattered trees to a
bermed house to the North. subsoils were the same. Parcel 86 was a rising landform to the north with tall grass. The
subsoil was a red brown SA with gravel to a red basal clay 20-35cmbs. We then crossed Lemon road and began
survey to the E. Parcel 90 was a mix of elm tree woods with areas of very dense briar to the north and a cleared high
grass area in the south of the survey area. Subsoils were a red brown SA with GR to depth on the west side with a red
basal clay becoming shallower as we moved east, 40-20cmbs. There is a road between A and B transects with people
who were currently removing the SA dirt and transporting it elsewhere, to be sold?. At the east end of parcel 90 is an
intersection where a number of houses now sit. One of which on the SE portion is a previously recorded historic home.
We photoed the house, a ranch style, but it is currently being lived in. The pipeline follows an existing gas pipeline
across the street and between two houses, that are very close together. We did not have access to these so we began
survey on the other side, W. side of parcel 95. This parcel was a lowland flood zone with areas of standing water. The
ground was rolly with high matted grass. Subsoil of the area was a brown SACL with mottles of manganese and red
ferrous spots. The shovel tests were concluded due to water table or a hydric clay at ~30-50cmbs.
No cultural materials were present.

63

Parcel 320 and 319 primarily consist of a plowed grassy field that rises to a grassy yard on top of a small landform
that overlooks a residential house within parcel 318 which takes up part of the E and F transects. The eastern portion
of parcel 318 consists of a residential house that sits just east of a drainage. The landscape then gently slopes upward
toward a small landform that is made up of grassy fields. The shovel tests within these parcels made up of a 10 YR 4/2
silty loam atop bedrock which was found between 20 and 50 cmbs.
Parcel 360 consists of a grassy flood plain that gently slopes upward toward the north. The parcel itself is
surrounded by plowed agricultural fields that have standing water within several small low lying areas. The soils
consisted of a 10 YR 2/2 compact clay and some shovel tests were terminated by water table at 20 to 40 cmbs.

The crew began at 7:30am and drove to parcel 36. There we had to check in at the front desk of an office/shipping
complex. The proposed centerline of the PL goes a few meters N. of the existing parking lot. North of the parking lot is
a bladed and highly disturbed level land with a holding pond constructed to the NW. Photos were taken but it was
deemed to not shovel test. The crew then traveled to parcel 98. This parcel was a "wrecker" shop with a back lot of
many dilapidated cars/trucks. Again here photos were taken but no shovel tests were conducted due to the
disturbance. We then drove to 128,129.
Parcel 128 contained an existing house with ancillary structues, ie garage, corral; photos were taken but no shovel
tests were conducted.
Parcel 129 was a short grass level backyard to the E divided by a creek with a short grass horse pasture to the W.
The are was at the base of a downslope to the N. Shovel tests were conducted showing a red brown SA with few
gravels to depth. The crew then drove to parcel 221.
Parcel 221 was a mowed wheat field with dirt roads to the North. The land form contained a knoll at the center of the
wheat field, see aerial, with agricultural berms along the downslope. Shovel tests were conducted at 150m intervals
and showed a subsoil of a dark CLLO w/ GR to a yellow brown CLLO w/ GR at 20cmbs or greater. I believe this layer
sits above a limestone bedrock, due to the limestone inclusions in the second strat, however shovel tests were unable
to go deeper than 60cmbs. During the survey the Trimble battery died and after the survey finished the crew returned
to finish the office work.

Parcel 390 was a plowed field with a man mad berm at the North end of the Parcel and a gentle slope to the south.
The soils were a 10YR2/1 clay to depth. The top 20cm was plowed and loose and below that the soil became compact
again.
Parcel 328 was in someones front yard so only transects D, E and F were surveyed, as A,B and C were very close to
the house. The soil in this parcel was a silty clay loam to 30 or 40cm and turned in to a light clay from there on out. The
land was disturbed and had 3 man made burms/terreces in the ROW. the area was so small that only 1 shovel test
each was necessary.
Parcel 308 was a rolling grassy field with few cedar trees and no misquite, the soils in this area were a thin clay and
ended in bedrock from 10-30cmbs. A possible historic site was supposed to be in the area but none was found after a
therough surface investigation and some subsurface.
Parcel 309 was also a rolling grassy field with cedar trees along the fence line. The soils here were slightly deaper and
were a little more red. Soils tended to be 10YR 4/6 clay to 30-40cmbs. The south end of the parcel was higher than the
rest of the area in the field. The end of transect F to the S was next to trailer homes was shovel tests in this area were
probably disturbed.
Parcel 257 was fairly disturbed with lots of industrial trash, cement push piles, wood push piles and large berms. A
large Truck work shop was also next to the ROW. The soil here was a very sticky brown clay with some gravels.
Parcel 254 was a small horse and goat pasture with bedrock close to the surface. The top soil was very silty but soon
turned in to clay.
Parcel 252 was a small pasture with mixed grasses, a small barn, and a fallen building out side of the ROW.
Parcel 253 was a horse pasture with small riding ring, short grasses and misquite trees.
Parcel 255 was an open pasture with no animals, tall grasses and mixed trees and vegitation.
Parcel 256 was also a small cattle pasture with a man made stock tank and large berm in the middle of the
transects.The soil here was a gravely clay 10YR3/2
All transects were dug at 140 m intervals if possible

We conducted a survey of parcel 619 and the area designated for the cedar creek pumping station. The general
landscape of the parcel is a landform that overlooks the cedar creek reservoir, and has a levy that bisects it and goes
Northwest/Southeast. The northern half of the parcel which is mostly dedicated to the pumping station is extremely
disturbed, especially close to the levy both on the northern and southern sides of it. The northern side of it seemed to
shallow basal clay (5 YR 5/8) beneath a 10 YR 4/3 or a 10 YR 4/4
be the most disturbed with an artificial drainage and evidence of some stock ponds that are either dry at the moment,
sandy loam.
or the landscape was artificially modified recently. The cross timbers found closer to the shoreline are the least
disturbed areas within the parcel, however the soils that were consistent with the rest of the parcel showed a shallow
basal clay that was found between 20 and 50 cmbs.

Parcel 307 was broken up in to three fields, the first field was quite open with gentel slopes the the north with tall,
mixed grasses and trees along the fence line. Field two was also an open field with a small rise to the S with trees in
the low area with mixed grasses. The third field was a small cattle pasture with short grasses and a slope down to the
west where it ended in a medium pond with small drainages running away from it. The soils here were fairly shallow
ending in Bedrock at 20 to 30 cm consistantly.
Parcel 306 was an open sloping field with tall grasses and some cedar, a large drainage cut through the parcel E/W
and was crossed on all transects
Parcel 305 was a large parcel with two drainage crossings on all transects. The land sloped heavily twoards the first
drainage with a high central area between it and the second drainage, before rising again after the second drainage.
Both drainages were very wide and deep and full of brambles, brush and trees, these areas were very difficult to
navigate. After the drainages the parcel continued in a high open field with trees and brush along all fence lines.
Parcel 304 and 303 are in the same field which is again open field land with few trees and tall grasses, all soils were
shallow and hit bedrock very early. Parcel 304 contained a small drainage that had no water and was easy to cross.
Parcel 302 contained one more drainage that was somewhat shallower than the previous few in 305, after the
drainage the area rose at a moderate slope to the W. This parcel was a cattle pasture with a two track road running
N/S through the center of it. The soils here were also fairly shallow with high bedrock and gravels. Very few trees were
in this parcel that were not in the low areas, the ground was covered in mixed grasses and a power line ran N/S next to
Baucum road. ST's were dug at 140 M intervals on transects D,E and F crew B surveyed transects A,B and C

The crew began their day at 7:30am and traveled to parcel 302. We began survey traveling east at 150m intervals with
the ABC transects as crew C traveled west with the DEF transects. Parcel 302 was a tall grass cow pasture with a
knoll in the center. To the east was a dense briar wooded creek running N-S. Subsurface of the area, and all the
parcels surveyed today, was a brown SILO w/ GR to a limestone bedrock at 10-35cmbs. This subsoil stratification
remained constant throughout the survey only varying slightly in the lower areas with a few cm more of SILO.
E. of the creek was the beginning of parcel 303. This was a tall grass terrace slope with berms along the slope. The
subsoil remained constant. In parcel 305 we were on top of the high terrace with a slight downslope to the east. The
area was still a high grass cow pasture with areas of exposed limestone gravels. Though the subsoil remained the
same high bedrock shovel test intervals were changed to 140m due to the land forms and proximity to creeks. In the
eastern portion of 305 there is a Y-shape. In 306 and 307 the area was a tall grass cow pasture with few trees and
berms along the down slopes to the creeks. There is a high landform in 307 however the shallow bedrock did not
change. No cultural materials were present.

We surveyed the parcels from Stevenson-Levy street on the eastern side of parcel 80. Parcels 80, 78, 77, and 75
are a residential neighborhood and has a series of roads, existing pipelines and multiple modern disturbances. There
are two blue stars that indicate historical structures on the aerial map within our survey area and one of them was in
parcel 77. The historical structure that is indicated on the map looks to be a building that is still used for storage and
acts as a modern dump as well. The other blue star on the aerial map resides in parcel 74 and is an old railroad grade
that is overgrown, and has an existing pipeline that runs along where the railroad used to be. The soil within this area
was extremely disturbed and were a 10 YR 4/3 clay with 10 YR 5/2 clay with 5 YR 5/8 clay all mixed in.
Parcel 68 and 67 are a grassy plowed field that are north of a residential neighborhood and east of a grassy pasture
and parcel 66.
Parcel 66 is mostly a grassy upland area with cross timbers in the western portion that gently slopes towards a
pipeline corridor next to a drainage. There are two isolated finds within the parcel. The first one that we found was a
historic well about 100m west of shovel test A66E193. The other isolated find was a flake found at 0-20cmbs within
shovel test A66E194.

All of the soils that weren't overtly disturbed were a 10 YR 4/4
sandy loam atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 20-45
cmbs.

30

Parcel 65 is mostly a large grassy field that has been modified by the landowners at various times. There is a historic
structure located outside the APE to the south of shovel test A65A216. The deposition on top of the landform where the
landowner's house resides is minimal and consists of a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay between 20
and 50 cmbs. The landscape then slopes downward towards a creek where the deposition is much greater and there is
about 150 meters that should be trenched. This area is located on the western side of parcel 65 and is just east of
village creek.

22

Parcel 25 was a water treatment area only transects A and B were surveyed today. As line C was in another parcel.
The land was mostly flat and brushy with lots of misquite and short grasses. The soils in this area were a 10YR3/2 clay.
Transect B was directly S of a calichi road thus most of the shovel tests were disturbed, at st 71 the road veared to the
S twords a water pump station that was to the south of all transects. Twords the east the land sloped down gently and
turned in to a swampy area near the end of the parcel preventing any more shovel tests from being put in. Transects
were dug in pairs at 140 m intervals.
Parcel 96 was 2 very well manicured cattle pastures with few trees. transects AB and C started in the first pasture
where the land sloped up to the south and twords the house, the grasses were very short and there were few trees in
the area. The soils here were 7.5YR 5/6 sand to depth, rocks and gravel were present the deeper the test went. The
second pasture sloped down to the SW and ended in a wet area s of the stock tank and cattle pen. Soils in this souther
corner tended more to Sandy Clay at 10YR4/5 and 7.5YR5/6. All shovel tests were dug individually at 140m intervals

The crew started at 7:30 and drove to parcel 6. Parcel 6 is currently in use as a natural gas drilling platform with sound
barrers surrounding it. We took a picture and moved to the next parcel.
Parcels 47,48,49 are a short planted grass field by the existing pipelines that travel N-S down the western edge of the
parcel. In the middle of the parcels, parcel 48 is a corridor,are high tension power lines. The vegetation in the area is a
tall grass field with areas of standing water. Parcel 49 is a tilled grass field. The land form itself is a level lowland north
of a creek, outside of ROW. Subsoil was a dark brown CLLO with GR to a yellow brown transitional layer, of CLLO w/
GR at >20cmbs to the west. As the survey moved east the yellow brown layer increased in depth beyond what we
could dig in the CLLO, 50+. Afterward we returned to the hotel to check out and drove to Austin office. No cultural
materials were present.

The general topography of parcel 525 is a small hill top on the western side of the parcel that overlooks a creek to
the east with a series of two tracks, and small drainages make up most of the gentle slope leading to the creek. Along
the C transect, there is a two track and a drainage that converge and within this drainage, we found 7 pieces of
amethyst glass and a piece of painted white ware. We dug 6 offtransect shovel tests around the area but found nothing
subsurface. It is located on the slope just north east of a modern hunting lodge that resides along the A transect just
east of A525A218 and we have determined the scatter to be an isolated find.
Along the D, and E transects on top of the land form towards the westernmost part of the parcel lies the remnants of
a couple of modern oil wells as the landowner had informed us. The majority of the top of the landform seems to have
been plowed or modified recently due to the backhoe tracks, push piles, and cut trees that are scattered about most of
the D, E, and F transects.
Otherwise, the general vegetation of the area were cross timbers with some secondary growth, with soils consisting
of a 10 YR 4/1 Compact silty clay atop a 10 YR 5/4 compact gravelly clay found between 0 and 40 cmbs.

'Parcel 245 was a full parcel survey to supplement the original survey,the land was an open bare pasture, relatively
flat with two stock tanks in the North eastern corner of the parcel.
Parcel 268 and 269 are both highly disturbed along all transects due to roads, parking pads and industrialization of
the area. Photos were taken of the areas

Parcels 982,983 were both very flat wooded and brushy areas that were highly disturbed due to a transmission line
that ran NW/ SE across the parcels paralleling the ROW. A large man made stock tank was present at the North end of
parcel 982 in the ROW and buildings were present along the AB and C transects in parcel 983.

Parcel 1056 is a small parcel that is highly disturbed with a large barn on the A transect and a large calichie drive that
crossed all transects. Very few shovel tests were put in this little parcel. Parcel 1057 West to East sloping slightly up to
the east,started as a open pasture for 80 meters before becoming brushy for a bit, at a fence line, lined with trees
opened in to another open area with very shallow rock. Farther up the slope the land becomes brushy again before
opening up to a two track road/ driveway leading up to a house north of the ROW.

Parcel 248 is a very long parcel N/S behind a small housing development the land starts( to the North) as a small
pasture with a shallow drainage cutting E/W. Across a fence the parcel turns in to a brushy pasture that slopes down
slighty to the west. 900 meters down the parcel a drainage cuts across all the transect lines and ends in a very large
stock pond that cuts across the A,B and C transects. Next to the stock tank the parcel becomes a plowed field then
another drainage from the tank, some open grassland and again into the plowed field to the South with the Parcel
ending at a FM road.

and manicured yard. Leaving the yard and crossing in to a large field with an 800m tank to the south of the ROW. site
41HE227 is also just south of the ROW. Crossing a fence in to another pasture that has thick trees along the creek
edge, trenching is probably necessary to clear this area.

Soils within parcels 476. 477, and 478 consisted of a 10 YR 3/2
silty clay loam top either a 10 YR 2/1 or a 5 YR 5/8 clay found
between 35 and 70 cmbs.

Parcel 478 is mostly a grassy plowed field with a stock pond that encompasses part of transect A. There is a slight
slope toward the west where parcels 476, and 477 are.
Parcel 477 is a small grassy field with a residential house to the north.
Parcel 476 consists of two grassy plowed fields that are separated by a small drainage.

The crew started the day at 7:30am and drove to parcel 479 and began surveying east at 150m intervals. Due to the
subsoil content most shovel tests were screened by hand. The landform throughout both 479 and 480 was a rolling
landform with a few ephemeral drainages in the lower areas. The vegetation was a short grass, mowed, pasture. As
the survey headed east, through a deer fence, the area became sparsely populated with a mix of trees. Subsoil in the
western portion of the parcel was a deep dark brown SICL to a pale brown CLLO with red mottles at 60-70cmbs. On
the high landform to the east leading into most of parcel 480 the subsoil was a exposed yellow brown transitional layer
of CLLO with limestone gravels on surface. The western end of parcel 480 is a high landform with a slow rolling
downslope to the east. The vegetation was a high grass and scrub with scattered mesquite trees. Subsoil was the
yellow brown CLLO on the surface of the high landforms while in the low portions this layer was beneath a dark brown
SICL layer 30-50cmbs; becoming deeper as you traveled west.
We then were called to assist crew C. We began survey of 633. This was a high short grass land, with surface
disturbances, with the slopes and creek wooded with a mix of live oaks and brush. The subsoil was a deep SA with
gravels to depth, in most places; while in others there was a deep red SACL from 30-70cmbs. (survey was headed by
I. Doumanof, see Crew A DSL)
Parcel 632 was heavily forested with live oak woods. To the west there was a rolling grass field. The two crews, A &
B, surveyed this parcel with only the D line at 100m intervals. The subsoil was the same as P633. No cultural material
was found on survey (dispite surveying the same area as crew C).

51

Today Crew C went to a high prob area starting with parcel 639 in which 5 shovel tests were dug the soils in this
area were a 10YR6/3 sand to 60 cmbs and turned in to sandy clay from 60cmbs to depth with an orange motteling to
the soils.This area was a wooded field behind an old trailer home. Parcel 633 started in a very open fairly flat hay field
with a water line running through two areas one from the old trailer home to the well and one from the well to the animal
housing area. The field was full of short thick grasses. A treed drainage was directly to the west on all transects and
was crossed by everyone. In this drainage M. Elverson got hurt and had to leave the field for the day to get medical
attention. N. Steinle took over his transect for the rest of the parcel. Just past the drainage the field opened back up in
to a treeless pasture with some fences that had to be crossed. The land sloped gently up hill to the west and trees
were only along the fence lines. The soil in this open area was a red sand 5YR4/4 with heavy gravels to 60 or 70cmbs
before turning in to clay of the same color with lighter motteling. At the edge of this field to the West the land began to
slope down. A small hunting cabin was to the South of the Row and a small shooting range was crossed on all
transects. Just West of this was a small spring on the C transect that made the ground very wet for a short distance in
this low area. On the A transect was a stock tank with man made berm and some small drainages running from it again
slightly down hill. In parcel 632 K. Stone was able to join us and take over Transect A for the duration of the day.
The start of parcel 632 was a wooded area with a gentle slope turning in to a rolling landform. West of the wooded
area was an open field with many low rolling landforms. This area contained 2 sites which will be deliniated and
discusses at a slightly later date, as there was not enough time to do so today. Site 632C1 currently has three positive
shovel tests on a large land form that makes up the site. All artifacts found were small lithics from 40-100cmbs. The
soils in this area were 5YR 4/4 sand to 120cmbs before turning in to a light brown sand at 120cmbs and then a brown
sandy clay at 150cmbs. The clay layer also turned up at 120cmbs in some of the other shovel tests. On a seperate
land form in this field was the start of site 632C2 which has historic and prehistoric artifacts that continue in to the
wooded area West of the field and down the slope twords the lowland creek area. Soils in the wooded area became
lighter with sand 10YR5/3 to depth. In the area at the bottom of the slope in the thickly wooded and marshy area the
soils revert back to 10YR/2 clay for surface to 60cmbs. All shovel tests were dug at 100m intervals or slightly shorter in
areas where artifacts were found.

Parcel 446 is where crew C started today, it was a small pasture with mixed grasses and trees.In this area on
transects D,E and F was a small stock tank, a modern trash pile and a old chicken coop. The soils in this parcel were a
silty sand from surface to 20 or 30cmbs and then a sandy clay to depth. the color was a 10YR 4/4 to 4/2. Parcel 445
was made up of two field the first one smaller than the other was mostly flat with tall grasses and silty clay loam soils
from 0-80 varying in color from 10 YR3/2 to 5/3. There were trees around the edge of this field. the second part of the
parcel was a large field that had been plowed some time in its past with many ag terraces, the area between the
terraces held water so the ground was very soggy in this area. The soil in this area was a silty clay loam to depth with a
color of 10YR4/4.At the very west end of 445 was a drainage area surrounded by heavy brambles and briars for 30m.
Leading in to parcel 443 which was also a drainage area which thick briars and brambles and trees. A small pond not
man made was on transects A and B in parcel 443. Parcel 444 was for the most part a heavily wooded area with lots
of sloping ridges through out all transect lines. The soils in 444 were all a thick clay loam to depth varying in color from
10YR4/4 to 2/1.
Parcels 436-438 were areas to be looked at for BHT possibilities. the land owner of 436 and 438 was not happy that
we were on his land.and will not be happy about BHT either. Parcel 436 is in two fields the first field has fairly thick
trees to the NW and is very wet with standing water in some places and the land slopes down to the E. The second
field in parcel 436 was an open area with no trees and thick clay loam to 40-60cmbs before having much more clay in
it at 60 cmbs to depth.All the soil in this area is a 10YR 3/2 to 4/4. the soils contain very small gravels from surface to
aprox 40cmbs after that we began to see CaCo3 flecks in the soil. Parcel 437 is a flood plainof thick dark brown clay
loam from surface to 40-60cmbs befor turning to clay after that. the gravels and CaCo3 continue in this area. All the
transects crosses some small land forms in this area but nothing was found. This area is a candidate for BHT due to
how easy it would be to get a trencher in as well as being very close to a creek with a deep cut bank. Trenching here
would give a good idea of the soil stratigraphy as its possible for the clay loam layers to be up to 3M thick and we are
not able to give enough valid information just from shovel tests. Parcel 438 is also a candidate for Trenching and with
the parcel being on the depositional side of the creek this would also be a good area for a trench to be dug. The land
itself is still the flood plain with soils matching the previous two parcels and ends to the east in a heavily wooded area
with a deep creek channel running NS along all transects.
All transects were dug individually at 130m intervals.

The crew started at 7:30 and drove to parcel 467. We surveyed west on the ABC transects at 150m intervals. Parcel
467 was a level landform with a slight downslope on the western end. The area was being utilized a short grass horse
pasture. The subsoil in the area was a brown SICL w/ GR to depth in some areas, and a brown SICL to 20cmbs then
dark brown/black CLLO w/GR.
Parcel 466 had a downslope to the west, with dry drainages, followed by a rolling lowland. There is a perennial creek
on the west side of the parcel. Grassy woodlands with sparse old growth surrounded by dense young growth and briar.
The subsoil was a yellow brown CLLO w/ GR at 0-30cmbs, containing limestone gravels. Other areas contained a pale
brown CLLO with gravels from surface to 50+ cmbs. The shovel test intervals were altered to dig on the top of some
rises in landform.
Parcel 465 was a rolling lowland with a high rise in landform on the west end. It contained a wooded creek basin,
same as described above, with a grass pasture with scattered mesquite to west. Subsoil of the area was a deep brown
CLLO w/ GR 50+ cmbs. No cultural material was present.

Parcels 448 and 450 were a small area between highway 45 and FM 0140 a power line and railroad line rand N/S
across all transects. the land was mostly flat and very disturbed. A Texaco station was on the end of A and B lines and
Kings RV and Mobil homes were at the end of Lines E and F so all of those transect lines were very short only C and D
lines were un interupted. The soils in this area were a Silty clay loam from 0-40cm and a clay loam from 40cm to depth.
the colors ranged from 10YR6/1 to 4/4 and gravels were prominent in the soils nearest to the highway. The area was
very over grown and the soils were damp. Transects A,B,C and D were dug at 130m intervals individually and lines E
and F were dug in teams.
Parcel 451 was a nicely manicured area with short mixed grasses and few trees,the land sloped down twords the
west. The Area to the East near the start of the transect was some what disturbed due to IH 45 and a built up cement
driveway that extended the length of the parcel. The soils in this parcel were a clay loam 10YR4/4 to 60cm with gravels
starting around 30cmbs. Parcel 452 was a heavily wooded area with a creek drainage running N/S through the parcel
soils in this area were a 10YR8/2 clay loam to 40 cm and then clay from 40cm to depth.
Parcel 453 was also a large open manicured pasture with a large stock tank on lines E and F and continued to slope
down hill to the SE until it reacehd the drainage running NW/SE and the land flattens out on the other side. The soils on
the W side of the drainage were a silty sandy clay from surface to 60cmbs and clay from 60 to depth. E of the drainage
the soil was a 10YR2/1 clay. Transects A,B,C and D were dug individually at 130m intervals and transects E and F
were dug in teams at 130 m intervals.

see genral

All of the parcels were small cow pastures that were made up of short grasses within a residential neighborhood
among small rolling hills. The only exceptions were parcel 455 which was a cow pasture that gently sloped towards a
small drainage and parcel 456 which was a residential house that encompassed some of transects E and F. The soils
consisted of a 10 YR 4/3 or a 10 YR 3/3 compact clay that sat atop a 10 YR 5/4 compact clay with calcium carbonate
nodules found between 20 and 50 cmbs.

41

The crew began the day at 8:00am and drove from the Austin office to the field north of Corsicana. We began survey
on 474/475 heading west. Parcel 475 was a house with a fenced in yard. Behind the house was an area with three
wooded grave markers which were photographed and avoided. The land form throughout parcels 475-468 was a
gently rolling pasture. Parcel 474 was a disturbed hay field with 50% ground visibility. The subsoil, which remained
consistent throughout the survey, was a brown SICL w/ GR from 0-30cmbs above a dark brown CLLO w/ GR. Below
this, which was found in parcel 468, rests a pale brown SACLLO with red mottles at 60-70cmbs.
Parcels 473-470 were medium length grass fields behind houses to the south. The subsoil and landform was
consistent with previous descriptions. Parcel 469 was a disturbed hay field with similar subsoil. Parcel 468 was a short
grass cow pasture with constructed stock ponds in the northwest section of the survey as well as to the south. No
cultural materals were present.

23

Parcel 565 consists of a tall grassy pasture with juniper trees and mesquite trees scattered about the landscape. There
is a slight slope to the East in the northern section of the parcel as well as a couple of drainages that lead to an artificial
lake at the bottom by a modern structure. The soils within the area were mostly uniform throughout other than a couple
of disturbed areas that are found more west along state highway 309 which hindered us in surveying transects A and B
within the parcel. The soils consisted of a 10 YR 4/3 or a 10 YR 3/3 silty clay atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between
30 and 50 cmbs.

34

The parcels were accessed through parcel 483 which was not surveyed. Parcel 484 is a horse pasture with short
grasses in the east portion of the parcel and then it slopes down to the W with a few small drainages that are all dry
and the area in the west is full of misquite and some taller grasses the soil in this pasture is a very compact silty clay
loam 10YR 3/2 to 60cmbs. Parcel 485 is a cattle pasture with silty clay loam 10YR3/2 to 60cmbs and has a large stock
tank and many man made berms on lines E and F. Parcel 486 is a cattle pasture with very sloping ground going down
to the west the land is covered in misquite and many small drainages. the soil is a shallow gravely clay that was 2.5Y
5/6 in color to 40cmbs befor turning to basel clay.
Parcel 487 has thick misquite trees and darker soils with less gravels than previous parcels. This area is slightly
more level than previous parcels which all sloped down to the West.
Parcel 488 is a more open pasture again with heavy misquite some bodarc trees and lots of brush. Near the east
end of the parcel a house and drive way cuts through all transects. We did not dig shovel tests in the front yard of the
house. On the E transect next to the house was a windmill that may have been historic. Shovel tests in the area
showed that there was no sub surface materials. Photos were taken of the windmill.
Parcel 489 was a heavily wooded area with bodarc, misquite and hackberry trees as well as low growing brush. On
Lines E and F the ground sloped up drastically to the E behind a large tank with a house on the top of the slope in
parcel 490. Soils in this area were a thick yellowish gravely clay to 60cmbs. All transects were dug individually at 130m
intervals.

Today we worked on Parcel 416 which was a long area mostly comprised of a plowed field we started with an
offshoot arm of the pipeline that would eventually go in to Lake Bardwell. This portion of the parcel was very flat, with
Bardwell Dam Rd and Bardwell Dam to the N of the parcel. The soils in this area started as a loose silty clay loam to
20cmbs, which is also the disturbed top layer of the soil that has been tilled this soil was a 10YR3/2-4/2. The soil below
20cmbs was a compact sitly clay 3/2-5/3 in color and containing gravels.A transmition line ran N/S half way down the
parcel 50M w of the edge of the plowed field and all transects passed under it. After completeing the west half of the
parcel we drove to the East end and started again from there.We drove down Gerron Road, over the RRand down a
small drive to the edge of the parcel property. The eastern half of the parcel was a few fenced cattle pastures. the first
pasture was open with rocky soils that sloped up to the west. The soil was a gravely silty clay to Depth that ranged in
color from 10YR4/4-3/2. The second pasture was a heavily wooded area with lots of short brush, bodarc trees,
misquite trees, other spiky trees and short grasses. Half way through this field was a large stock tank with a very large
berm to the east that was on lines E and F. The soils continued to be a compact silty clay to 60-80cmbs with gravels at
40cmbs and color of 10YR3/2. Near the West end of this pasture the ground became full of small drainages as the land
continued to slope up to the west. On lines B and C at the west end of this wooded area was an older barn that after
inspection was not seen to be historic, 3 shovel tests were placed near it and no sub surface material was found. On
line A 100m SE of this barn was a non historic surface scatter, with old corrigated metal and bricks, a washing machine
front was the mane age indicator of this area. A shovel test was put in the center of this area and also yeilded no
subfurface material. Crossing the fence out of this pasture put us back in to the plowed field to the West. All transects
were dug individually at 130m intervals.

The parcels today were done with crew A and crew C minus Iasha after 7 St's as he had to go with Kevin to deal with
police about the company truck which got its gas tank busted and the gas stolen.
Parcel 432 is a very large track of land, starting at the east edge the soils were a 10YR 4/4 silty clay to 60cmbs and
then clay to depth. A power line and gas line ran parallel to Oak Grove road close to the fence line. The land sloped
down in to a drainage where there were lots of trees and brambles and sticky soils. The land then rose out of the
drainage to open pasture land with silty clay soil that changed color at 40cmbs from 10YR 4/4 to 10YR5/1 and turned
to clay at 60cmbs. At the top of this little rolling hill was a large stand of brush and trees which had a historic house site
in it on lines A,B,C,and D. All information about this site can be found in the site narative done by crew B for this day.
After this stand of trees the land again opens up in to pasture land with few trees and mixed grasses, the land begins to
slope down to the West. We then crossed a fence in to another wooded area with lots of drainages and thick brush, the
soil here is still a 10YR 4/4 silty clay to but becomes mottled with 2.5Y 5/6 at 40cmbs before turning in to clay. Shortly
after coming out of the drainage areas we crossed another fence in to an area with a cattle pen, an old mobile home
and an old well. Soils in this area contained gravels starting at 20 cmbs. A large stock tank was just W ot the cattle
pens on A and B lines. This is also where Iasha had to leave with Kevin, so we were left with a crew of 5 for the
duration. The land again opend up and began to slope to the SW twords a very large stock tank with berm and small
full drainage running N/S. The soil here is a slightly darker 10YR3/2 silty clay to 60cmbs. After this tank and another
area of thick trees and brambles the land rises gently again to an open area in another field with tall grasses and
clumps of trees.The land flattens out for a bit before sloping down to the W through a thick tree line another fence and
ending in a flat hay field that we stay in for the rest of the Parcel and in to the next.
Parcel 431 is a flat hay field that had been mowed in the not too distant past with round bales of hay in large rows
sporadically through out the field. This area is slated for BHT and it could be a good candidate for it. The soils observed
started at a silty clay 10YR5/3 to the east of the parcel and Got progressivly darker with more clay the closer to the
creek we got. The shovel test in the tree line to the West as close to the fence as we could get was a silty clay loam
10YR2/1 to depth. The creek was behind a fence in to parcel 430 which we did not have access too. Transects
A,B,C,E and F were all dug individually at 130 m intervals by crews A and C with transect D be leapfroged back from
the west end of Parcel 431 back in to 432 by all crew members.

66

For a more descriptive description, see crew C's general observations since crew C surveyed the A, B, C, and part of
the D transects and I was pulled away to help with the truck problems and my shovel tests and exposure to the parcels
The soil consisted of a 10 YR 3/3 clay atop a 10 YR 2/1 compact were limited.
clay found between 35 and 55 cmbs.
Parcel 431 consisted of small rolling hills among grassy cow pastures and scattered mesquite trees. At the top of the
first landform there was a historic collapsed structure with a duraglass bottle, an old cocacola bottle, a well, and
remnants of a fence and a road. Crew B recorded and documented the site in the afternoon.

76

The crew started the day at 7:30 and headed to parcel 419. The parcel was a tilled corn field. The surface visibility was
90%. The land form was lowland with a nearly unidentifiable slope to the east. The subsurface of the area was a deep
pale brown CLLO from surface to depth; with compaction and clay content increasing with depth. Due to this shovel
tests had to be hand-screened. To the west side of the parcel is a small group of trees with grass and constructed
stock ponds by an existing gas pipeline. Shovel tests were conducted at an interval of 160m.
We then moved to help crew C by documenting a collapsed historic house structure on parcel 432.

Parcels 184, 185, and 186 consist of cedar woods with an abundance of secondary growth and scatter modern trash
dumps throughout the parcels. The soils within these parcels consisted of a 10 YR 4/4 or a 7.5 YR 4/4 sandy loam atop
a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 35 and 50 cmbs.
Further north in parcels 183, and 182, there is less secondary growth but much more disturbance especially on the A,
B and C transects where existing pipelines and two tracks weave through the low lying hilly landscape which also has
an existing pump station in parcel 182. The soils were similar to that of the parcels to the south however, there is more
gravel and bedrock was found in a couple of shovel tests between 5 and 40 cmbs.
Parcel 181 consists entirely of a large processing building that is very active and was photographed and not shovel
tested.
Parcel 180 consists of a single wide trailer with an abundance of modern trash scattered about the parcel.
Parcel 179 is a well groomed cedar forest that slopes to the north towards parcel 178. The soil within parcel 179
consists of a 7.5 YR 4/4 sandy gravel atop bedrock found between 10 and 30 cmbs.
Parcel 178 is entirely disturbed and doubles as a cow pasture and a storage area for mulch, cement drainage pieces,
and various other modern piles such as asphalt and so on therefore there was very limited shovel testing within the
parcel.

42

The crew started at 7:30, packed and transferred hotels before going to the field. We arrived at 191 and began
surveying south at 120m intervals. Most of the area in 191 is eligible for trenching, and after survey it is still eligible
however due to the difficulty of access for a backhoe it is not recommended. The area had a slope to the south leading
to a deep creek bank before leveling off into an undulating floodplain. There were many dry drainages in the area
leading to the perennial creek. Vegetation in the area consisted of a mix of younger trees to the north leading into the
floodplain where there were very old, and very big, walnut trees surrounded by an old growth with grass. The entire
area, especially that around parcel 192, was covered in trash with higher concentrations around drainages and by the
treeline to existing houses. The subsoil was a mix of SALO and SACL with thick layers of light brown SALO sitting on
top of the dark brown SACL, found roughly 50cmbs or greater. In other areas the brown to pale brown SACL, or LO,
was found at surface to depth, or >60cmbs.
Parcels 192-194 were housing parcels with houses still currently in use. The areas behind these houses were
manicured lawns by a creek drainage. No shovel tests were conducted in the yards; photos were taken.
Parcel 195 was much like 191 in vegetation. The land form in the parcel had begun to gradually rise to the south.
Subsoil was consistent with what was seen previously.
The crew then moved to parcel 185, to assist crew A, conducting shovel tests on only the B and C transects at 150m
interval. The area was undulating with dry drainages to the south with a steep rise in landform heading north. The
vegetation was thick briar and younger trees, including juniper, with patches of tall grass. The subsoil was a shallow
red brown SALO to a pale yellow mottled CLLO at ~30-40cmbs. No cultural material was found.

71

For the following parcels, we split up the ABC and DEF transects between Crew A and Crew C respectively.
Parcel 611 is a grassy pasture that gently slopes towards a swampy drainage found in the southern portion of parcel
610. After the swampy drainage, the landscape then gently slopes upward towards a couple of low lying hills.
Most of the shovel tests on top of the landforms were a 10 YR 4/3 Parcel 609, 608, and 607 made up of these low lying hills that were grassy cow pastures.
sandy loam on top of a basal clay found between 30 and 60
Parcel 606 is a hill that overlooks a floodplain on the eastern side of the trinity river. The top of the hill is mostly a
cmbs. In the lower areas, the soil was more of a silty clay atop a grassy pasture that has an abundance of modern trash with remnants of single wide trailers, modern shells of cars,
10 YR 2/2 compact clay found at 50 cmbs.
shopping carts, chairs, etc....
At the bottom of the hill and past a small drainage lays parcel 604 which is a short grassy horse pasture and on top of
the first low lying landform is where we found a tertiary flake made out of a dark grey chert within shovel test A604B284
as well as a flake in shovel test A604A281

Parcel 603 on the East side of Old River road is a large sandy field with ag terraces and large cedar trees
scattered thinly through out the majority of the parcel. At the east end of the parcel is a large stand of trees
that goes in to parcel 605. The soils in 603 were a 10YR4/4 sand from 40cmbs to 100cmbs. And a 7.5YR4/6 clay
from 40cmbs to 100cmbs. The clay layer was higher in the western portion of the parcel being seen at 40cmbs in most
of the first shovel tests in this area. In the low laying areas there was standing water. Parcel 604 was a horse pasture
with few trees and short grasses the land sloped up to the E the soils in this parcel started as a 10YR5/3 sand to
20cmbs befor turning in to a sandy clay of the same color to 40 or 60cmbs where the soil then became a 10YR5/6 clay.
A large portion of this parcel was very swampy. Parcel 605 which is just north of parcel 604 also tends to slope up to
the east in the large stand of trees. A small stock pond is on the F transect line early in the west portion of the parcel,
after crossing a fence and returning to open pasture land the land begins to slope to the west twords a small drainage
that cuts across the parcel N/S and goes a short way in to parcel 604, after the drainage the land rises gently the the E
twords the fence line, which as usual is covered in trees and brambles to make life just that much more fun. Soils in this
parcel start out as a 10YR6/4 sandy clay to 40 cmbs before turning in to clay of the same color with orange motteling.
Roughly the next 300 meters out of the clearing the ground is very swampy and nearly impossible to dig, after the
ground begins to slope up the soils become a silty sandy clay in a 10YR3/2 to 60cmbs with clay of the same color. At
the east end of the parcel the soils again become deep sand starting at 10YR4/6 to 30 or 40cmbs and turn in to a 7.5
YR4/6 to 100 cmbs. Parcel 606 starts by sloping down to a drainage with scattered trees that become thicker in the
low area of the drainage. On the F line in this drainage was a burned trash pile on the rise just past the drainage in the
next open space was a large trash area(all Modern) to the S of most of the transects spilling on to the A and B lines.
Soils in this parcel start as a sandy clay to 40 or 60 cmbs befor turning in to a solid 7.5YR4/4 clay with motteling.
These soils are consistent through out the parcel. Parcel 607 Slopes up to the E and has 2 houses to the S of the
Row, the land is very open with few trees the soils here are a 10YR2/1 silty clay to 50 cmbs before turning in to Clay of
the same color. Parcel 608 follows in the same vein as 607 the land slopes up to the E and has sparce tree coverage
and deep silty clay soils aprox 10YR4/4 in color. Parcel 609 starts to slope down to another drainage to the E with
heavy tree coverage the soil here was sand to 60-70cmbs befor turing in to orange clay to depth. Parcel 610 is a
larger parcelthat slopes down twords the south and is a large open field with very few trees in the Row, the trees are all
to the south in the low areas. The soils in this parcel are deep sand 10YR4/4 to 70 cmbs that turn in to Clay at 60 or
70cmbs which is a 7.5YR4/6 in color. At the east end of the parcel is a very swampy areathat is deep and undigable,
mostly unwalkable too. The swampy area is aprox 150 m wideand on the other side of the swamp to the SE is parcel
611. Parcel 611 slopes up to teh SE with one clump of trees in the ROW. In that clump of trees was a possibly
historic cement structure that could have been a latrine or storage area or something of the sort. Nothing was found
sub surface in the shovel tests nearest this area so the cement was labled an IF The soil in this parcel was a constant

42

The crew began at 7:30 and travelled to parcel 603. We began surveying west of the road towards the Trinity R. at
50m intervals. The area was a rolling cow pasture with short grass and sparse trees. The subsoil of the area was a
brown SALO to a red basal CLLO at 30-80cmbs. In the lowlying areas the subsoil was a deep aluvial CLLO to depth.
The area is recommended for trenching due to the undisturbed nature of the subsurface. Along the high landform in
the middle of the parcel were found a prehistoric site. Positive shovel tests showed it followed the landform and the
artifacts recovered were quartzite microflakes and a piece of FCR. After finishing the site we moved to 604 to help crew
A finish the survey. The area was a short grass horse pasture with the same strata we found in 603/602. In the middle
of the ROW is a innundated portion.

18

The crew began at 8:00am and drove from the Austin office to the field south of Athens. The weather was 60's and
sunny. We met Mr. Hardin (the land owner) out at parcel 693 and he guided us through the parcel. The parcel itself
was a old growth oak woods which as grown unmodified since he had bought it. The land was a rolly downslope with a
few dry drainages as well as some higher knolls. On the knolls the subsoil was a v. shallow SALO to a iron rich bedrock
at ~10-15cmbs. Mr. Hardin explained that the parcel was rich in the liron 'lignite" and at one point to be mined for that
purpose. In the lower areas there was a deep pale brown sand to a red basal clay at 25-60cmbs. I will also note that
according to Mr. Hardin somewhere on the property the area was surveyed previously and found to have a good
amount of coal. No cultural materials were present.

23

Parcel 714 was a well manicured horse field with a few oak trees and a built up stock tank. The stock tank was on
trancets E and F and the area around the tank was highly disturbed with many different types of soils not seen in the
rest of the pasture. The soil through out the field was varying colors of sand to 100 cmbs. The sand started out as a
10YR5/3 and turned a yellow 10YR7/6 at 40-50 cmbs and stayed that color to 100 cmbs around the stock tank where
the soils had been dug out by a back hoe the sand started as a 10YR8/2 to 20cmbs then turned in to a Sandy Clay of
the same color with yellow and orange motteling,at 40cmbs the soil turned back to the light sand, and then at 70 cmbs
the sand became silty and was a 10YR4/4 to depth. Highway 19 was on the West side of the parcel and a CO 4613
was on the East boundry of the parcel. The land sloped gently to the East and had only short grasses.
Parcel 715 was a very small plot of land behind a house, it was a small fenced in area, possibly an old garden or very
small pasture with lots of trees.The soil in this small area was also Sand to depth of 10YR7/1.
Parcel 712 was worked on in conjuntion with Crew A, Crew B dug only 4 STs on lines E and F, the soils that we saw
were deep sand 10YR7/6 in color. And the land was over grown with brush, trees and brambles and seemed to slope
down to the W. All transects in parcels 714 and 715 were dug individually at 75m intervals

Parcel 656 is rolling pasture land to the N of walnut creek and flood plain to the Center and South of the Creek.
Walnut creek has two branches that meander through the parcel and had to be crossed on multiple occasions on most
of the transects. A natural gas line runns N/S twords the West end of the Parcel on all transects.This parcel is heavily
wooded in the Southern area with open flat land between the two arms of the creek. It was in this central area on
transects AB and C that the first site of the day was found. A single knoll in a flat area that rose aprox 1.5m above the
rest of the surface area and was 40m wide by 50m long. The soil in the site on top of the knoll was a 10YR4/4 sandy
loam to 110cmbs. In transect B's shovel test in the site several small lenses of lighter sands were seen that may be
evidence of living surfaces.This was a prehistoric site possibly Caddo due to a small piece of fingernail punctated
pottery that was found aprox 60-80cmbs. The rest of the soils through out 656 started as a Sandy Clay Loam to the
East which was a 10YR4/4 to 60cmbs or to depth in some cases, when it was only to 60cmbs the soil then turned in to
clay loam of the same color, just much more compact. Twords the west the soil stayed a Sandy clay loam to depth in
the 10YR4/4 color.
Parcel 657 was a flat area that the creek wandered through doing many oxbows and cutting through all transects at
some point in time. The soil was very sandy and there was thick tree cover along the creek with little undergrowth other
than brambles which were heavily present throughout the parcel.The river bank was between 2 and 3 meters tall at any
given time and some photos were taken of the cutbanks. The soil in this area was sand ranging from 10YR8/3 to 5/3
for the entire parcel. The sand went to depth in most areas. On transect A which was farthest from the creek the soil
tended to become a sandy Clay loam at 60 to 70cmbs.
Parcel 658 was a fairly narrow piece of land that contained our second site 658C1 which was made up of a few flakes
in three shovel tests on the A,B and C lines, along the toe slope and up slope of a large hill that made up most of the
parcel. On the top of the hill S of the ROW the land was flat and contained lots of flakes, The soil where the artifacts
were found was a sandy loam 10YR4/4 to 50cmbs and 7/6 in color from 60 cmbs to depth. The site will probably
continue down the hill and onto lines D,E and F but due to lack of time we did not finish the planned survey for the day.
The parcel in general was full of cedar and misquite trees as well as brambles and briar with very short grasses
growing where there was open air and no tree cover.

The crew began the day at 7:30am and drove to parcel 623, north of Trinidad. There we began survey west->east at
100m intervals. The land was a v. gently rolling, featureless, short to long grass cow and horse pasture. This land
feature, or lack thereof, as well as land use remained consistent from Parcel 623-627. The subsoil remained a dark
SICLO to depth and only in the western portion of parcel 623 did the crew find a shallow red basal clay below, at
25cmbs or greater. Parcel 627 differed slightly subsurface due to evidence that it retains water for periods of time.
Some crawfish holes were found in the area and the subsoil was a sticky dark brown SICL to depth. Due to the
compact and clay nature of the area the crew had to hand-screen the majority of shovel tests. After finishing the return
transects the crew headed to help Crew A finish their survey. The area description can be found in the Crew A Daily
Survey Log.

Parcels 712 and 713 are a landform within the eastern portion near state highway 19 that have a couple of residential
houses residing within piney woods. The land then slopes downward towards the west. The soil consisted of a 10 YR
6/3 sandy loam that went to depth on top of the landform with a basal clay found around 50 cmbs off of the landform
towards the drainage.

see general

Parcels 621 and 622 consist of a series of small rolling grassy cow pastures that slowly rise towards the west. The
soils consisted of a 10 YR 4/3 silty clay atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 30 and 60 cmbs.
Parcels 705 and 704 consist of two landforms among cross timber woods with an abundance of secondary growth
within two drainages which said landforms are being separated by. On top of the second landform that is located in the
western portion of parcel 704 we found a tertiary shattered flake within shovel test A704A296 between 60 and 80cmbs.
The soils within these parcels were a 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam that went to depth on top of the landforms and the shovel
tests off of the landforms were terminated by a basal clay at 55 cmbs or water table at 60 cmbs.

Parcel 690 was a very small area split in to many different pieces, one the D line there was a mobile home and small
animal pens behind the mobile home and then a small pasture behind that. On the E and F lines was a small orchard
and trash dump behind that. The land behind the the trash and orchard, the area was fairly over grown with a small
drainage leading in to the next parcel back. The soil in this area was sand to 50-60cmbs and then turned to clay.
Parcel 698 was also a small area of land that crossed CO753 with a very small portion on the west side of the road
and one ST worth on each line on the east side of the road. the soil was a 10YR7/6 sand to depth .
Parcel 699. A large areathat starts with an upslope to the east twords a line of trees and and has short grasses and
sandy soil, at the top of the rise in the wooded area that is aprox 50m wide the land begins to slope down to the East,
the wooded area doesn't have too much secondary growth some briar but not as much as we are used to seeing.
Coming out of the field still gently sloping down to the East the soils are still a deep sand 10YR5/3 to 40cmbs and then
10YR7/6 from 40-90cmbs.The open field has trees ringing it and the whole field slopes to a lower central point in the
middle of the field. To the East of the Field the land rises again to a thicker line of trees that makes up the rest of the
parcel which begins again to slope down to the East just past the tree line. Here there is thick undergrowth with lots of
briars and brambles and small brush.
Parcel 701 is a narrow, heavily wooded area with swampy lowland in the center and 10YR 5/4 grey sand to depth. the
parcel has an old two trac road running N/S twords the parcel, East of the two track the land slopes up to the East and
into the next parcel.
Parcel 700 is in the same field as 699 and has all the same soils and land features.
Parcel 707 is on both sides of CO4622 which is also Pace Rance rd, on the West side of the road, there is a fairly
modern large red barn and a gas pipe line that runs NE/SW in to parcel 706. The soil is a 10YR7/4 sand to dept and
has thick medium hight grasses. On the East side of the road the parcel is very overgrown with heavy woods and
undergrowth. Most of the F transect was on the Co road so was a no dig.
Parcel 708 was a very brushy area with scattered trees, the soil was still sand to depth through out, also a 10YR7/6 in
color. The ROW was on top of a hill with tall grasses and brush over looking a valley with manicured fields, trees and a
very nice house.
All transects were dug individually at 80 to 90m intervals depending on the area.

The crew started the day at 7:30 and drove to the field. We began at 666 and worked eastward at 100m intervals.
Parcel 666 was a thick briar and wooded area just west of the road. One shovel test was conducted here due to its
small size. The subsoil in parcel 666, as well as the rest of the parcels was a SALO on top of a shallow dark red basal
clay at 0-30cmbs. Parcel 667 was a long parcel with a pond and built levee on the western portion. The eastern portion
was a wooded area with dry meandering drainages before a number of undulating terraces to the east. The eastern
most portion of the area contains a pipeline perpendicular to our survey. The woods in the area consisted of a mix of
pine and oak of older ages but still containing a fair amount of vine and briar undergrowth. The subsoil remained
consistent with a SALO on top of a shallow red CLLO. On the first high terrace we found a old house sitting in a short
grass area. Surrounding, and analogous, to the house were pieces of white ware along with bricks and clear glass; all
on surface. This did not turn out to be a site as K. Stone talked to the landowner and he revealed that the house, from
1920's, had been moved to its current location by the landowner himself in 1971. He had used it as a hunting cabin for
a period of time before abandoning it; thus explaining in our minds the material scatter around it. We photographed the
house, whose foundation is starting to collapse, as well as the surrounding area, but determined it was not a site as it is
not in situ.
On the second rise we came upon a bladed area of distinctly bulldozed land. This area also had a scatter of
whiteware, earthenware, amethyst glass, aqua glass, clear glass; as well as more brick and a push pile of carved
limestone bricks. All of these were on surface in the area of disturbance. We decided this was to be considered a site,
due to the age of the glass. The landowner had told us that along with the house he had also imported in the brick in
the 70's as well. We determined, due to what the landowner said, that most likely the scatter is due to a previously
destroyed house outside of the ROW and this was a resulting smear.
The crew finished survey and returned back to the hotel.

Today started with a dead walk in from CR 1615 to the east end of Parcel 719, crew B crossed the creek 3/4 way
down parcel 719 and surveyd that area while crews A and C started on the East bank of the creek, which had a very
deep cutbank. On the edge of the creek was a bamboo and bramble thicket that was aprox 25m wide and soils in this
area were a sandy clay loam to depth in a 10YR 4/3 in color. Moving east from the Creek the land was very brushy but
still more open than other areas, the soil in this area was Sand 10YR7/6 to 40-60cmbs befor turning in to Sandy Clay of
the same color with grey and orange motteling to depth.
Parcel 720 starts sloping downward to the east and in the low areas the ground is very swampy and all of the area is
very thick with trees on the A,B and C transects. The soil in the west end of the parcel are fairly shallow with sand to
40cmbs and then 2.5Y4/6 clay from 40 cmbs to depth. A small site was found by crew A on the D,E and F lines at the
very West end of the parcel just before crossing the fence.
Parcel 721 starts as a wooded area beginning to gradually slope up to the East, and the trees begin to thin out. After
crossing a very old barbed wire fence we are in a large open field with no trees and lots of wild flowers. The land
sloped up to a large knoll on which we find the second site of the day 721-A1 which ended up having 5 positive shovel
tests. Pottery, flakes and burned bone were found from 40cmbs to 80cmbs mostly in ST OT-2 ceramic was found at 020cm. the soils in this parcel were Sand to 60 or 80cmbs and then red clay from 60 or 80cmbs down. Crew A stayed to
deliniate the site while the rest of the crews continued on. Crew C mostly dug transect lines A,B and C, but after the
721-A1 we switched to D,E and F lines for a few shovel tests before the end of the day. Shovel tests were dug at 100
m intervals.

The crew started the day and drove to parcel 723. There we walked, with crew A and C, to the western side of parcel
719. We began survey on the western side of Coon Creek, surveying the western half of 719 with all 6 transects. This
area was a flood plain with a rolly surface. The vegetation in the area was v. tall (Birch?) trees with a few v. large oak
trees scattered throughout (~15ft diameter); the ground was also covered with a sparse grass and briar. Subsurface of
the area was a brown LO to a dark brown/black LO at 50-60cmbs. On the northern end of the parcel there was a
swamp with a large area a standing water as well as two small streams flowing from it, in a E-W direction. The
subsurface in this area was a light brown SALO to a pale brown SALO, with light red mottles, at ~30-50cmbs. This area
would be a good place to trench however the swamp to the north and navigating the many birch trees would make it
difficult (Coon Cr. to the south is uncrossable by vehicle, that we saw).
We then proceeded to the south where K. Stone had found a incised pottery shard on the surface. This area was a
level flood plain as well with med. grass and some black berry briar growing. The subsurface was a light brown SA to
depth in the area. The other crews had already put in some shovel tests in the area so only two OT's were conducted
near the shard, both negative.
We then proceeded to another site that was found on survey by J. Nowak on the boarder of 720 and 721. In his shovel
test, E298, he had found two pieces of pottery and a lithic flake. One of the pieces of pottery looked to be incised with
some horizontal lines, as with the previous IF, while the other was plain.These were all found between 40-60cmbs. We
were told that transect shovel tests had already tested south of the positive shovel test. So we worked on the W,N,E
portions.
The site sits on a steady downslope of a higher landform on a high finger ridge extending to the NE. The vegetation of
the area was a mixed piney woods with areas of dense secondary brush. Near the initial positive was a fenceline
running, N-S, parallel to a dirt two track. We conducted 10 OT's following the cardnals of the pipeline as well as 3
chasing the ridge to the NE. Only OT8 was positive, only 3-4m N of E298. One pottery sherd was found at 50cmbs.
This sherd had a design on it, see notes, as well as evidence of burnishing, see M. Miller. The soil of the area was a
light brown SALO to a red basal clay at 35-70cmbs, more shallow as you travel away from the site area.
We then caught up to the other two crews on a grassy pasture with a rise on the eastern side of parcel 721. We
began to survey the ABC lines to the east of the site found by crew A, see crew A DSL. We surveyed at a 50m interval.
The area was a grassy gentle downslope with a small knoll on the C transect. Subsurface was a light brown SA to
depth, 100cm+. We finished survey at the border of parcel 722 and proceeded to head back to the hotel.

see general

The GIS for the parcels are slightly off with what looks like the edge of the northern parcel boundaries ending at a
fence that runs along the C transect, so only the A, B, and C transects were surveyed with a few shovel tests along the
D, E, and F transects within parcel 681. All of the parcels were grassy cow pastures that had a couple of small
drainages where cross timber woods exist. There is an existing pump station south of transect A within parcel 681 and
accounts for much of the area's soil disturbance. The soils that weren't disturbed were a 10 YR 4/2 sandy loam with a 5
YR 5/8 basal clay found between 5 and 60 cmbs.

40

soils on top of the landforms generally consisted of a 10 YR 4/3
sand atop a 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam found at around 40 cmbs that
either was terminated at depth, or by a basal clay found at about
80 cmbs. Within the floodplain area, the soils were a mottled 10
YR 5/2 silty clay atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 40
and 60cmbs.

Today we had a joint effort between crews A, B, and C in surveying parcels 719 though 723. Crew A was responsible
for the D, E, and F lines that ran through an oak/pine forest with an abundance of secondary growth among several
landforms that overlook several drainages and is a very high probable area for finding sites. Speaking of which, we had
found a couple of sites within parcels 719 and 721. Crew B delineated the site within Parcel 719 which was initially
found by Crew A with shovel test A719E298. The site found within Parcel 721 was delineated by Crew A and sits atop
a landform that overlooks a large drainage to the west. The rest of the survey will be done at a later date due to time
constraints.

Parcels 745 and 744 are grassy horse pastures with a landform that overlooks a drainage and unnamed creek
located to the East and is located just north of County Road 4530. We began on the eastern toe slope of the landform
which is located within parcel 745 and this is also where we encountered secondary and tertiary chert flakes between
the depths of 40 and 100 cmbs within a 10 YR 6/3 sand. There were four positive shovel tests along the A transect and
were dug at 50m intervals. There was also a shovel test on the B transect that had one tertiary flake between 60 and
80 cmbs. The C, D, E, and F transects were mostly consisted of a gradual slope that leads to the floodplain to the East.
We continued along our transects and will fully assess the site at another date not yet determined, however the access
to it is very good and will not be difficult to do so. Just West of the private road that bisects parcels 745 and 744, on
the A transect there was a tertiary flake found along the A transect between 0 and 20 cmbs and is most likely part of
the site found in 745. The reasoning for the shallow depth could be attributed to the disturbance in the area i.e. the
county road that is just south of the A transect, as well as the private road. The rest of parcel 744 was dug in 100 m
intervals and among the large grassy field there were no positive shovel tests. The soil remained consisted throughout
these parcels and all shovel tests were terminated by depth. There was a 10 YR 4/3 sandy loam to 30 cmbs with a 10
YR 6/3 sand that went to depth.
Parcel 753 consists of a landscape that is highly disturbed with an abundance of deadfall. There is a small drainage
that runs along the D transect, however the soils in the area were very inconsistent with some shovel tests that had
basal clay mottling within a 10 YR 5/4 sandy loam and a 10 YR 5/2 sandy clay found around 30 cmbs while others had
a 10 YR 5/4 sandy loam atop a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found at 60 cmbs.
Parcels 757 and 758 are grassy livestock pastures and we could only fit the D, E, and F transects within these
parcels. The shovel tests yielded a 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam atop a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 45 and 60

Parcel 817, and 818 consist of a series of smal undulating landforms among pine plantations and hardwoods with an
abundance of secondary growth and dead fall north east of a modern school and north of a rodeo area. There is
apparently a site located within the eastern portion of parcels 817 and 818 however there was no evidence of any site
in these parcels. See site narrative for more details. The soil in the area was a 10 YR 5/3 sandy loam atop a 5 YR 5/8
basal clay found between 15 and 70 cmbs.
Parcels 793, 794, and 795 consist of a grassy cow pasture with a gass pipeline that runs north/south and has a
pump station north of the survey area. There is a creek in the eastern most part of parcels 794 and 795 which is
where the site 41AN10 resides. Once again through our observations there is no site within our survey area. The soils
consisted of a 10 YR 5/4 atop a 7.5 YR 4/6 sandy clay found at 40-60 cmbs that was on top of a 7.5 YR 4/6 clay that
was very compact and had a 5 YR 5/6 mottling.

Parcels 661, 663 and 664 within a floodplain of a creek located to the north and east. The Western portion was
considered as a possible backhoe trenching area however there was water table found between 60 and 80 cmbs
within the westernmost shovel tests so there will be no need to trench. The soils among the area are varied and
represent the disturbance found within the area. The soils were mottled with a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay among a 10 YR 4/3
sandy loam atop a 10 YR 5/8 sandy clay

We began with surveying parcels 823, and 824 which consist of grassy pastures with small undulating landforms
among a mix of piney woods and other hardwoods. We had two positive shovel tests, both of which had a small chert
flake (most likely shatter). We delineated and determined that it is an isolated find. the soils in the area were a 10 YR
6/3 sand atop a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 30 and 85 cmbs.
We then proceeded to survey parcels 826, 829, and 831 which were grassy pastures among a residential
neighborhood that were home to a couple of emus. The soils consisted of a compact 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam.
After that, we proceeded down County road 3051 to parcel 838 which is a small parcel just off of the road where we
dug one shovel test that yielded a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam to depth.
After that we went to Parcels 803, 804, 805, 806, and 808. Parcels 805 and 806 consisted mostly of a residential
house, although there was a small landform to the east of the house which we dug 4 shovel tests on and yielded no
artifacts.Parcels 803, 804, and 808 consisted of piney woods with some secondary growth just north of the residential
area. The soils in the area consisted of a 10 YR 5/3 sandy loam atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 80 and 85
cmbs.

Parcel 644 is a small parcel located within a drainage that separates two gently sloping landforms to the east and
west. Running along the B and A transects is an existing natural gas pipeline that runs north/south. Approximately 100
meters south of state highway 31 among the mixed hardwoods and secondary brush, we encountered a creek that
was perhaps 10 meters wide and was not crossable. It did however run parallel to some modern railroad tracks located
on the southernmost portion of the parcel. The soil in the area consists of a 10 YR 6/3 sand atop a 10 YR 5/2 sandy
clay that is mottled with a 5 YR 5/8 clay found at 50 cmbs which is on top of a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 60
and 65 cmbs.
Parcel 706 consists mostly of a small wooded area loacted just west and east of FM 4622, which opens up into a
grassy horse pasture and rises towards a landform in the eastern portion of the parcel. The soils consisted of a 10 YR
6/3 sand and shovel tests were terminated by a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay between 60 and 75 cmbs.

see general

Parcel 671 is a grassy pasture with an abundance of clover just north of a wooded area that is made up of some
mixed hardwoods. The Parcel consists of a landform that separates two small drainages both to the east and west as
well as a large residential house 500m located to the north. The soil in the area consists of a 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam
atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 10 and 45 cmbs.
Parcel 711 primarily consists of a grassy landform that separates a creek to the west and a small creek and floodplain
area to the east. The soils ranged with the soils near the creek in the west which is considered as a possible area for
trenching, there was a 10 YR 6/3 sand atop a 10 YR 5/2 sandy clay that is mottled with a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay. On top of
the landform as well as the landscape to the east where a large stock pond resides just off of the landform, the soils
consisted of a 10 YR 5/4 atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 30 and 60 cmbs.
Parcel 718 consists of a grassy landform within the western portion of the parcel that slopes towards a floodplain area
in the eastern portion which also is considered as a possible area for trenching. The eastern portion of the area has a
10 YR 4/4 sand atop a 10 YR 5/2 sandy clay mottled with a 5 YR 5/8 clay found between 50 and 60 cmbs which is on
top of a 10 YR 4/2 sandy clay. There was only one shovel test that went to depth and that was located on the E
transect near a spring that runs near the northern part of the survey area within the floodplain. Otherwise, the soil
consisted of a 10 YR 6/3 sandy loam atop a 7.5 YR 5/8 basaly clay found between 60 and 80 cmbs.

Parcel 761 is a very small parcel just off of state highway 175 and was photographed due to it being extremely small

Parcels 783 and 784 were surveyed by myself, Travis Cornish, and Kevin Stone. Due to a request by the landowner
to be extra careful with digging our shovel tests, we surveyed the A, C, D, and F transects. The landscape consisted of
a grassy cow pasture with small drainages. In the western portion there is a network of existing pipelines and pumping
stations. The soil on the small landforms consisted of a compact 10 YR 6/3 sand atop a basal clay found about 40

We surveyed an area that is designated for the cedar creek pump station which is located within parcel 619 on a small
peninsula within cedar creek lake as well as a grassy pasture and levy that is within the western portion of the parcel.
The vegetation on the peninsula included a young hardwood forest with some secondary growth, the thickest being
near the shoreline. While surveying the shoreline, we found 4 small concentrations of flakes, the fourth of which had a
stage 2 biface fragment that was medially snapped. Most of the flakes were quarzite with a couple of chert flakes, but
all were tertiary and there was a small quantity of FCR that was scattered about the shoreline. All of the shovel tests we
dug were negative and the artifacts were within the wash of the lake suggesting that the site is no longer in existence,
rather we found the remnants of a site that was where cedar creek lake now lies. The soil among the peninsula
included a 10 YR 4/3 sandy loam atop a 2.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 20 and 50 cmbs. The deeper shovel
tests were located further west. The soil just east and west of the levy consisted of a 10 YR 5/4 sandy loam atop a 10
YR 6/2 sandy clay mottled with a 7.5 YR 5/8 clay found between 30 and 50 cmbs.

Parcel 434 is a low lying area within mesquite woods and grassy floodplain.
Parcel 435 consisted of a slope and low lying grassy cow pasture that led up to a residential house that resides on
top of the landform. The E and F transects were not dug within this particular parcel due to landowners who were not
very keen on our presence there. They wanted us to come up to the house first to let them know we were going to be
on the property however the right of entry agreement only stated a notification by a phone call. There seemed to be a
lot of confusion however the landowners implicitly expressed their concerns with the proposed pipeline.
The soils in both areas were a 10 YR 2/1 clay that was mottled with 10 YR 5/4 with calcium carbonate nodules found
between 40 and 50 cmbs
Parcel 825 consists of a grassy pasture that is just west of County Road 3051 that leads down to a drainage within
the western portion of the parcel.
The soils consisted of a 10 YR 6/3 sand atop a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 60 and 95 cmbs.

Iasha after the fact.
Once the crew reached the survey area for the proposed pump stations in Parcels 500, 502, and 509, the crews
began surveying Parcel 502. Topographically, Parcel 502 consists of gently rolling upland that is dissected by modern
drainages steaming from agricultural stock ponds. The vegetation is predominately comprised of grasslands that have
been overgrown with young mesquites ranging in age primarily from 1-20 yrs in age. Wetland vegetation can be
observed in close proximity to stock ponds and associated drainages. Ground visibility within this parcel was less than
20 percent. Generally, Parcel 502 contains soils consisting of a dark brown (10yr 4/3) compact, gravelly, silty-clay loam
from approximately 0-40 cmbs overlaying an even more compact and gravelly dark brown (10 yr 3/3)clay stratum. The
lower stratum was extremely difficult to excavate and screen do to compact and dry nature. The majority of shovel
tests were terminated at approximately 40-50 cmbs. Parcel 509's vegeation, topography, and soils similar to 502.
Contrary to the gently rolling topographic setting of Parcel 502, Parcel 500 contains numerous rapidly ascending
landforms that are separated by a few small, ephemeral drainages. Parcel 500 is located on the southern cusp of the
ridgeline that contains the Trinity River’s expansive floodplain. The vegetation within Parcel 500 is also starkly different.
The overstory is comprised of mesquite, honey locus, and hackberry; averaging approximately 20-30yrs with a
relatively void understory. Only small patches of high grass, wetland vegetation, tree saplings, and briar are present
predominately in the northern section of the parcel. Soils are also different, consisting of a more gravelly sandy clay
loam (10YR 4/4) overlaying either a very sticky compact clay (10YR4/2) or a dense gravelly clay (10YR 4/3). Few
areas within the parcel contain landforms suitable for a pump station location. The largest and broadest landform within
Parcel 500 is occupied by the second field site recorded during the session (500D1). Mason, I leave this summary to
you.

Parcel 85 was a small overgrown pasture with mixed tall grasses and lots of medium sized misquite trees, some oak
trees were also present, the soils were a 10YR4/4 sandy clay to 30 cmbs before turning in to 10YR5/6 compact clay.
The land sloped slighty to the south and had a cut grass track running through parcel 86 and in to 85 on transect lines
d and e. Parcels 91-94 were all in a residential neighborhood and were photoed but not excavated.
Parcel 211 was a relatively flat planted corn field with mid height corn and thick trees around the edge of the field, the
field is directly off of FM917. Soils in this parcel were a 10YR3/2 clay to 80cmbs

Parcel 395 begins as an open pasture with tall thick grasses and small mesquite trees, the land slopes up to the NE
and a Transmission line runs across the first set of transects on D,E and F lines and continues to run South of the
ROW. A small out building and some farm equipment were located near the A transect line at the beginning of the
parcel, no sub surface material was found. By the 3rd shovel tests in A, B, C and D transects we were in a plowed and
planted corn field with the corn standing 3-4 feet tall. Along the F transect there was a small man made stock pond just
south of the ROW in the open pasture area. Soils in this area were 10YR4/2 sandy clay to 30 cmbs before turning in to
black clay. The land is relatively flat with a small drainage running North/South through the parcel near the East edge.
Parcel 396 is a plowed and planted Bean field with mid size plants approximately 1 ft tall. Soils in this area continue to
be Sandy clay 10YR4/2 to 30 or 40 cmbs before tuning in to sticky compact clay. The land is flat with some ag
terracing and two small water run off areas in the fields, running North South near the Eastern end of the parcel.
Parcel 387 is directly off of Walker Road, and is a plowed and planted corn field with plants standing 3-4 ft tall and
wheat, or sorghum growing sporadically throughout standing approximately 6 feet tall, the wheat is not in rows of any
form. The land is flat with very little land undulation. Soils in this parcel were compact blocky clay to 40cmbs.
Parcel 388 is separated from parcel 387 only by crop rotation. Parcel 388 is planted with purple beans, the plants
were very small, 4-5 inches. The soil was compact dry clay 10YR 4/2 and the land again was mostly flat with no
changes in the landscape.

Parcel 301 was an open horse pasture with two fences crossing the parcel splitting the area in to separate pasture areas. The land
in the first pasture sloped up to a central area slightly higher than everything around it, the vegetation consisted of very short over
grazed grasses and trees only at the front fence line along Baucum Rd. The second pasture sloped down to the West with a thicker
tree line along the back fence separating Parcel 301 from 300. The soils in this are were very shallow with a thin silty loam
10YR4/2 followed by degraded bedrock at 20 ‐30 cmbs though out the parcel. A small shooting range was also present with some
clay pigeon debris scattered along the E and F Transects by the back fence. All shovel tests on A,B,C and D transects were dug
individually at 150 meter intervals with E and F transects being dug in groups of two. Parcel 300 was a smaller area that we had
to survey, but the land owner was very adamant that we not cross fences, so we had to drive around to the main entrance of the
property and walk in approximately 1 km to reach the survey area. The land was open rolling pasture that started sloping down to
the NW with short mixed grasses and shallow bedrock. Surveying along the A,B and C transects, the land began to slop up to the
North after the first 100 meters in to an open grassy field with some trees in low areas and along the fence line. The Soils were a
thin Clay loam 10YR 4/2 followed by shallow Bedrock at 20‐30cmbs. A few of the shovel tests contained blocky compact clay
10YR3/2 to 50cmbs. Shovel tests were dug more or less individually at 150 meter intervals with K. Stone helping with the digging
and screening. Parcel 299 was the largest area covered for the day, Both K. Stone and M. Miller were present for this portion of
the survey giving us a total of 6 people which allowed us to cover all 6 transect lines at once, leaving only a dead walk to do at the
end. Again there was no crossing fences, so we drove along Singleton Road up by the Salvation Army summer camp and began our
6 wide transects. The parcel began as a nice open pasture area with tall grasses and some trees, mostly mesquite. Shovel tests in
this area were a blocky clay with little or no bedrock before reaching compact soils. After the first 300 meters we crossed the first
drainage which was about 50 meters wide with moderate brambles and vines, there was then a small open area followed by the
much larger drainage that contained a good amount of water, there was much thicker undergrowth in this area and it was much
harder to cross through. Matters were not helped by the mid height game fence that we had to cross in the middle of the wooded
area also covered in vines and spiky plants. ( many expletives were used by everyone present.) The A,B and C transects had a
thicker wooded area to go through but not by much. Passed the drainage area, the land was sloping gently SW with tall grasses
and scattered mesquite, cedar and pecan trees. The bedrock was again becoming shallow in this area as we began to near the
back fence near parcel 300. The soils were very dry and cactus was prominent through out the south eastern portion of the parcel.
The weather was very sunny and hot with no wind, and most people began to run out of water and endurance by the time we had
to walk back to the trucks. Needless to say it was a very long day for everyone. All shovel tests were dug individually at 150 meter
intervals.

Parcel 422 is directly off of Ensign road with 3 fences bisecting the property N/S cutting the area in to 3 fields. The
first field to the West is a cut hay field with trees only along the fenced edges. The land is mostly flat with blocky clay
soils. The next field is very narrow over grown pasture with a tree line on either side along the fence. Over this second
fence is a large berm, probably man made and a pasture with tall thick grasses and lots of cedar trees. The soils in this
area are all a blocky clay to 40-50 cmbs 10YR4/1-10YR3/2.
Parcel 420 which was trenched in the previous week is a ploughed and planted bean field with disturbed soils to
20cmbs which then turn in to a clay loam that becomes very sticky at 40-50cmbs. The land was very flat and contained
nothing of interest.
Parcel 421 is an over grown pasture area with thick grasses and spotty trees, a large very deep dry drainage runs NE
to SW through the ROW and was crossed on all transects, the drainage was approximately 5 meters deep with some
heavy brambles and briar present. After the drainage was a small open area with very thick, tall grasses and small
thorny trees. The parcel ended at the Creek drainage which also had very thick wooded growth and lots of spiky vines.
Soils in this parcel were a silty clay loam to 20 cmbs and turned in to a blocky clay loam from 20-60 cmbs. All shovel
tests for parcels 422-420 were dug individually at 150 meter intervals.
Parcels 401 and 402 are in a plowed and planted bean field off of State Hwy 34. The land is very flat and the soil is
disturbed to 20 cmbs. After that the soil is compact and blocky. Site 41EL249 was recorded a few years ago as a
surface scatter in parcel 402 on transects A,B,C and D next to a housing development. Some unidentified scrap metal,
and broken brick was all that remained after many plowing seasons. Site 41EL248 was located in the South Eastern
corner of parcel 401 in the southern most corner of the ROW. Scattered Broaken brick was all that was observed of
materials left of this site. Shovel tests were scattered thinly through out both site areas, and all were negative. All
shovel tests on transect A,B,C and D were dug individually at 150 meter intervals. Transects E and F were dug in
Leap frog style all the way back in teams of two. K. Stone and M. Miller re recorded the sites, while the rest of the crew
worked the transects.

Parcel 501 had been previously visited during the ROW survey, and was being re visited as a pump station survey.
The parcel was split in to 4 fields, all of which were very well manicured. The first field nearest to the road and the
farthest from the house, was relatively flat with short mowed grasses and contained no trees and a large man made
stock tank. The soils in this field were a 10YR4/4 to 30 cmbs and then turned in to a 10YR3/3 compact clay. The top
soil was soft because it had rained the previous day, softening the soils to aprox 20-25 cm. The second field nearest to
the road and close to the house was the same well manicured field also with a stock tank and two or three sparcly
planted trees. Soils were the same in this field. Field 3 Farther from the Road and farthest from the house was also a
grassy field, slightly less manicured, with no trees, flat ground and the same soils as previously mentioned. Field 4,
farthest from the road and close to the house, was a cattle pasture, with short grasses, some trees along the westerb
back edge of the field a stock tank in the NW corner and a small fenced off round hay bale area also along the North
fence line. Soils were still compact in this area as in all others. All shovel tests were dug individually for all of the OT's

Today started like most mondays with the long drive to Waxahachie, checking in to the hotel, then heading out to the
field. We found the parcel easly and began to start out work day. Sadly the Trimble died, long live Trimble. Luckly we
still had two functional DeLormes so surveying a full parcel as a pumpstation area was not much of a problem. Today
we surveyed parcel 873, which started as a large,field with thick tall grasses nearest the road in the first pasture with a
few trees along the north fence line and a large man made stock tank in the NE portion of the field. After crossing a
dead electric fence, the land started rolling with ag terraces through out the back pasture, the grass was tall with much
more brush and weeds present in this area and the signes of dried out drainages running N/S through the area.
Running East West we crosses another non electric fence with barbed wire in to a very brushy and not maintained
area where we started running N/S transects. This had once been a swampy area that was now very dry but still
contained the plant life associated with water. as well as lots of dragonflys and many animal burrows in the softer soils.
The whole parcel was made up of a 10YR3/2 gumbo clay that was too compact to dig through at aprox 40 cmbs. Each
shovel test was dug individually.

Soils in the Kennedale Balancing Reservoir contained primarily
shallow, severely disturbed, mottled sediments and gravels to a
shallow depth of approximately 20 cm. One shovel test (near the
tract's southwest corner) was undisturbed and contained dense,
friable clay loams that transferred to an orange loamy clay at
abour 60 cmbs.
As for Parcel 863, the soils there were very shallow, dense, solid
upland clays and clay loams with rounded quartzite and caliche
gravels either throughout the column or below approximately 20
cmbs.

The Kennedale Balancing Reservoir, located immediately west of Parcel 165, was severely disturbed and generally
had only a very small portion of the tract that had any potential for containing intact deposits. The tract is actually a
borrow area that was used to provide earth for a neigboring earthen berm for another reservoir. For most of this tract,
the land is actually well below the natural grade and two large pools occupy the plat.
Parcel 863 was a broad, open, gently-rolling upland prairie typical of that area with a slight, gradual descent toward
the south. In both places the archeological potential was very low.

Description

We started the day Surveying Reed Ranch, parcels 528 and 529. Both parcels were very hilly we began by driving
out on a dirt road to the center of the transects between the parcels and surveyed parcel 528 first. from the road, the
parcel dropped steeplyin a wooded area with little undergrowth in to open pasture land with a rolling landscape and
mixed vegitation. The parcel ends on a rise to the west. A large partially man made tank or pond skirts transect line F.
The soils in this parcel were a 10YR3/3 silty clay to 30-40cmbs before turning in to clay to depth.
Parcel 529 on the East side of the road is not on the origional transect line, so the transect lines were not in the GPS
units so the shovel tests might be a bit off. Another survey team with better equipment marked a center line for us as
we worked to make life easier on all of us. The land in this parcel is also very hilly with lots of mixed grasses, and much
thicker vegitation in the low areas. The soils in this area are a 10YR3/3 silty clay to 35-40 cmbs and then clay to depth.
All shovel tests were dug individually at 150 m intervels.
Parcel 867 is an area comprised of 3 fields, a front field with short grasses, some Bo'Darc trees and a large stock
tank in the center of the field. A mobile home splits the parcel in the center, A pasture behind the house makes up the
second field, which has no trees, very little grass and lots of hard packed dirt. This area is very flat. The Back field,
which is intered by gate in the back of the dirt pasture. This field had some trees and a little grass as well as a stock
tank, twords the back of the field it contained more Misquite trees. All soils in this parcel were compact silty clay
10YR4/2 to 10YR3/3 to 40cmbs. This was a full parcel survey for a pumpstation
Parcel 508 was a small corner south of the IPL ROW backing up to parcel 867 and soils were the same. The land
was flat with thick mixed grasses, and a small clump of trees where all the cattle were staying out of the sun.
Parcel 863 is a large square field with some small drainages and a tree line to the South West. Again the area is very
flat with mixed grasses and 3 drainages running N/S through the parcel. A stock tank was also in the middle of the
parcel. Along the back of the Parcel to the South, a large trash pile was in a drainage. Mason had joind us by this point
and brought a 3rd working Delorme, so that we all had working GPS units.

Parcels 874 and 876 were in the same field with no fences splitting them so there may be some shovel tests out of the
parcel area. The parcels were either hay or wheat fields that had been mowed. A stock tank and ag terrecing were
present in parcel 874 while there was a drainage in parcel 876 with some trees along the lowlaying area. Each parcel
was a full area survey and not ROW survey. Each shovel test was dug individually by each person.

Soils within the parcel were primarily a tan, uniform sanc that
transitioned to a mottled, orange, yellow, and gray base clay
layer between 20 and 90 cmbs. Sands were deeper toward the
west and toward the east and were shallower near the midpoint
(particularly in the vicinity of the gravel access drive). Most tests
reached the base clay at around 50-60 cmbs.

Very, very, very hot and humid out there today (about 98 degrees and 80+% humidity do not mix!!). The survey area
was open for most of the western half and pine-wooded in the eastern half. The terrain was gently-rolling with a large,
gradual hillside descending toward the east then becoming more-or-less level at about the eastern end of the mid third
of the parcel. Disturbance primarily consisted of a gravel driveway, some introduced fill and grading south of the
access drive, and that was about it. Soils were primarily deep sands with orange clays at the base.

none

Parcels 374 and 375 were in the same field, parcel 374 was a plowed and mowed hay or wheat field that was mostly
flat, no trees at all, and a slight rise in the center. The soil was a 10YR4/2-10YR3/3 clay to 30 or 40 cmbs before it
became to compact to dig. Parcel 375 was a planted bean field that was too compact to dig, 2 shovel tests were put in
this area before the decision was made to call this area a No Dig and do a visual pedestrian survey of the area as
surface visibility was 90-100%.
A drainage area along the East edge of parcel 374 contained tall grasses, dense trees and brambles and slightly
darker soils, but no other change. All soils were disturbed to 20 or 30cmbs depending on plow depth.
Parcel 872 along Nash Howard Rd behind a processing plant of some kind was also a large plowed field with trees
only along the South fence line. The soils in this field were also a 10YR4/2-3/3. Nearer to the road there was much
more disturbed soils with Road fill to 40 cmbs. All soils were disturbed to 20 or 30cmbs depending on the plow depth. A
surface scatter of historic artifacts was located in the North Eastern portion of the Parcel and do the the amount of
artifacts observed. It is considered a site. No sub surface material was located.

We started the day working on parcel 839 which is a different area on the map than is stated. We started at 8AM on
this property with the biologists and all other crews. As that is what the lady who owned the property wanted. We
worked in the new 839 which is a manicured cattle pasture with plastic heavy duty fencing, short grasses and no trees.
THis was called the nursery field by the owner, the soils in this parcel were a 10YR5/3 sand to depth. We continued on
her property in to what is 836 on the map, but has been given another parcel name. The biology crew survey this
property and we followed suite to get it done with as she was giving us permission to finish working on her property on
the North side of the road. While this parcel was not planned for the day it was easier for us to do it now than try and
comeback later when she might not be in such a good mood. This pasture was very slopey and had very shallow red
soils that were very old. Shovel tests went to 30 centemeters at most in this parcel. Transects A,B and C were
surveyed in these two parcels, transect D which we were supposed to do, was in the road and thus we were not able to
survey it.
Parcels 843 and 844 were very small pieces of housing development land that are currently not in use. The land was
very brushy and over grown with light brown sandy soil on the surface to 20 cmbs ending in red clay at 20-30 cmbs.
We then moved down the road to parcel 802 which was a cattle pasture as well as a gas plant of some form, the first
portion of the parcel twords the East directly off of hwy 301 was a collection of small dry pastures with very little grass
and a few trees, there were longhorn cattle in this pasture as well as a few calves and a bull. They were very interested
in what we were doing. The soils in this first set of fields was a silty sand 10YR5/2 to depth. Passing through this field
by a small gate lead in to a cattle pen area with very large corrigated tin barns that were not of historic age. A small
house/shack was located to the South of the ROW and may be historic photos were taken. This larger field was very
gently sloping to the East and had trees along the fence lines. Soils in this area were still Silty sand, but became
compact at 40-50cmbs.
Parcel 798 just on the East side of 802 was also an open pasture with gently rolling land and a heavy tree line to the
west end of the parcel. soils in the open area were a 10YR5/2 sand to 10cmbs befor turning in to a compact gravel
conglomeration. In the tree line however the silty sand was 40-50 cmbs befor becomming too compact to dig.
Parcel 799 was a small piece of land with a mobile home and a pre fabricated house on it. We were digging at the far
end of someones back yard. The soils were a 10YR5/2 sand that became compact at 50 cmbs.

none

Parcel 785 was the start of the day in a mostly open sandy pasture with short grasses and deep sand through out. A
new fence had been put up so any shovel test near the fence was very compact and not easy to dig. Just West of the
fenced pasture was a gas pump pad with a large pumpstation in parcel 784 which was not surveyed today.The soils in
this small open area were also very compact with lots of farm equipment strewn about the area, slightly farther to the
west on all transects was a wooded area of very tall pine trees with thin underbrush. Soils in this area were loose and
sandy. Shovel tests were dug to depth at 120 meter intervals through out the ROW.
Parcel 688 was a joy to dig, if the owner had not been standing over our shoulders the entire time. The land was
gently rolling cattle pasture in all directions with more grass than we have seen in a long time, there were trees along
the fence line and in some of the low areas in the South west corner of the parcel. All soils in this parcel were a
10YR5/2-5/6 sand to 80 cmbs aside from any shovel tests dug in the dry stock tank which were clay at surface. 2
Photos were taken by each crew member of each shovel test dug a before and after picture of each. These are in the
drop box under non site data labled as parcel 688 shoveltest photos.
Parcel 692 was split in to many small electrified fenced in pastures for horses. Very few shovel tests were dug in this
area due to the massive amount of sloping of the fields. the first portion of the parcel nearest to hwy 59 was a grassy
treeless field with a small stock tank and barn in the corner. Soils were a 10YR5/2 sand that became very compact and
gravely at 45-50 cmbs. The parcel then skirts around a small house with land that is not technically in the parcel,
photos were taken as the ROW goes directly through the house in its current state. to the north of the house was
another field with a circular horse ring and well as various other training ephemera scattered throughout. Soils in this
area were slightly deeper, but still became compact at 50-60 cmbs. The wooded back portion of the parcel could not be
shovel tested due to the very steep slope, Photos were taken of this area.
Parcel 668 was added to the end of the day as we had already planned for a long day and decided to finish this small
parcel so that tomorrow we would only have to worry about the sites. Parcel 668 is a very deep parcel with a 700
meter dead walk through trees and under brush to get to the single transect line at the far north end of the parcel. The
transect was on top of a rise with many drainages and heavy undergrowth along the fence lines. Soils were a silty sand
to 30-40 cmbs before turning in to a red clay.

Today we worked on following the boundary's of sites 41HE371 and 41HE370 which will be combined in to one site
eventually. These sites are in parcels 631 and 632. Parcel 631 is the northern parcel which is a large grassy pasture
with a heavily wooded area to the West of the site area. Soils in this parcel varied from area to area. in the east the
soils were a 10YR5/4 sand to depth. AS we got closer to the tree line soils became a shallower silty clay 10YR6/2 till it
turned in to clay at 20-30 cmbs. When the land began to slop down to the West soils again became a silty sand
10YR5/4 to depth.
In parcel 632 the area was mostly a hay field with sandy soil to 100cmbs. To the far west in the parcel over a fence
the land was wild pasture with mixed trees and grasses and a slope to the west. Soils were still a silty sand to varying
depths generally 40 cmbs before turning in to a red mottled clay.

Parcel 703 was fairly unpleasant to work in, it sloped up to the East and had very thick undergrowth lots and lots of
brier and brambles under tall oak and pine trees. the soils in this parcel were a 10YR5/4 sand to depth with lots and
lots of roots in the first 40-60 cmbs. Parcel 702 the longer area was very hilly with medium dense under brush and tall
trees of oak and pine and other which I dont know. The soils through out were a uniform 10YR5/4 sand with occasional
silty sand from 0-40 cmbs in a lighter grey color. The land heading west first rose after the main paved road through the
property near the eastern boundary of parcel 703 and then sloped down in to a drainage before rising again to the NW
and again sloping down in to another wider drainage that was deeper. Once again the land rose on to a taller hill
before dropping to the final decent where the parcel ends in a transmission line cutting N/S that is the parcel boundary.
All transects were dug individually at 130 m intervals.

Clayey soils, very dry at the surface a little more moist below 20
cm (area may have had rain?). Nothing on the surface. Most
shovel tests stopped at 40 cm below surface due to
compactness.

Plowed field with furrows. A large natural gas plant is across the street and a buried pipeline extends through the
parcel. A small wash goes through the parcel but it is almost unnoticable due to plowing and the lack of rain.

Both parcels 916 and 917 contain gently sloping topography with a very compact silty clay loam matrix that exceeds
40 cmbs. It was unclear whether a basal clay layer was encountered. Unfortunately, shovel tests were unable to reach
depth due to the extremely compact soils. The compactness of soils are likely exaggerated by the extreme heat and
drought. General disturbances include terracing, burms, trash dumps, stock ponds, plowing, and vegetation removal.

Parcels 901, 902, 869 contain extremely compact silt and sandy
clay loams. Shovel tests were either terminated at approximately
30-40 cmbs due to compactness or basal clay. Parcel 891 is
primarily comprised of thick clay or silty clay loams. The
floodplain contains a mixture of clay loam closer to the ridgeline
and silty clay and sandy clay loams near Rush Creek. Due to the
compactness of the soil the crew was unable to possitively
identify if the area warranted trenching. It appears that if
trenching is needed, it would only be needed within a small
portion south of the creek. Soils approximately 100 meters south
of the creek contain a mixed alluvium primarily comprised of silt.
Due to the compactness the soils it is undetermined the exact
depth. Deeper less compact soils were also encountered on the
bank of Rush Creek. A more indepth study of soil survey is
needed to help varrify if trenching is needed.

Parcels 901 and 902 is comprised of a gently rolling upland setting. The land is use for pasture and currently has
cattle. Disturbances within these parcels is primarily centered on vegetation clearing, fence and road construction, and
trampling of ground's surface. Parcel 891 consists of a prominent ridgeline overlooking rush creek to the north. The hill
contains clayey soils that contain deep cracks more than 20 cm deep at time. The bottom lands have been primarily
cleared and contain small wetland ponds and a thin strip of mixed hardwoods next to Rush Creek. The ground within
this parcel was extremely compact. Depths of 50-60 cmbs were rarely reached. Parcel 869 is small and consists of a
nearly flat unused piece of land. Crawdad holes were seen within the parcel indicating prolonged saturation during
wetter parts of the year.

Extremely compact soils. Very Silty. Mottled. When shovel tests
could reach 30 cmbs, a more clayey transistion was abruptly
encountered.

Parcel 880 consists of a gently sloping hill that is bisected by a transmission line. The ground has been thoroughly
plowed and is extremely compact. Agricultural terraces are present. The parcel is completely devoid of vegetation and
is only covered by short mixed pasture grasses. Parcel 882 contains two disticnt land use areas. The southern half is
very similar to Parcel 880 in the the soil is very compact and devoid of veg. The northern half is a corn field that has
been receltly harvested and replowed. Ground vis within the field was nearly 100 percent. A small drainage separates
the two land use areas. The southern half contains sandyier soils while the northern clayey. Parcel 879 exact same as
880 except more tress present.

The parcel primarily consists of a landform in the northwestern portion of our survey area that overlooks a drainage
that runs north/south, which separates the landform and the floodplain to the east, which was designated for trenching
assessment. A two track bisects the landform and adds to the general disturbance found within the parcel. The side
slope of the landform is noticeably dug out and artificially terraced. This can especially be seen at the bottom of the
slope where it leads to a small concrete bridge that expands over the drainage and leads to the grassy floodplain that
lays between the north/south drainage and a drainage further south that runs roughly northeast/southwest and
intersect the a, b, and the edge of the c transects in the easternmost portion of our survey area. Within the cut bank of
southern drainage showed modern pipes and insulation eroding out. In terms of trenching assessment, this particular
parcel would not be recommended for further testing through trenching due to the soils within the floodplain, which
consisted of a 10 YR 6/3 fine grained sand atop a 10 YR 5/2 Sandy Clay with 7.5 YR 4/6 clay mottling found between
20 and 75 cmbs throughout the floodplain. On the landform, as well as the side slope, the soil consisted of a 10 YR 6/3
fine grained sand with most shovel tests terminating at a 7.5 YR 4/4 basal clay found between 40 and 80 cmbs. There
was only one shovel test that did not hit basal clay along the A transect, however it was on the side slope and
overlooks a small floodplain area to the south outside of the pipeline corridor. Overall, the parcel consisted of around
95% grassy pasture with 5% consisting of mixed hardwoods found along the drainages with Ground Surface Visibility
around 10%.

The survey crew for today consisted of Travis Cornish and myself while Jesse Nowak and Kevin Stone went out to
overlook the trenching.
Parcel 744 was previously surveyed, however we came in to survey for a reroute south of the original alignment. Just
as before, the lush grassy field consisted of a 10 YR 7/3 fine sand that went to depth in all of the shovel tests.
Parcels 624 and 626 consisted of a grassy cow and horse pasture that is surrounded by plowed fields, power lines,
roads, and overall complete disturbance. The ground surface visibility was 40% and 70% in some spots. The soil was
a 10YR 5/3 and was as hard as steel and we could usually get to 30-40 cmbs which is where a darker 10 YR 4/1 clay
was found.
Parcel 852, we dug four transects and the parcel itself runs north/south and has a small ephemeral drainage that
bisects the middle of the parcel and follows a power line that runs to a residential house to the parcel to the east. Very
similar disturbances as seen in 624 and 626, however this parcel was groomed better. Another thing to take note, our
camera died as we entered this parcel and so there are no pictures of parcels 852 and 618.
Parcel 618 was the last parcel we surveyed and consists of the same rock hard soil found in the previous parcels with
one exception. The parcel itself lays west of Key Ranch road and just north of Mankin Cemetary. On the easternmost
portion of the parcel, there is a small floodplain area with some dried up stock ponds and such, however there is a
small hump (approximately 3m by 2m) in which the Shovel Test A618C512 was dug and yielded a 10 YR 4/4 compact
silt atop a 5 YR 4/6 basal clay at 60 cmbs. Also within this shovel test, we found one fire popped flake between 20 and
40 cmbs. Since it was 1:30 p.m. when we found it, we will have to return at another time to fully delineate, although with
the surrounding disturbance, it may be very likely that it will end up as an isolated find.

Parcel 618 was the last parcel we surveyed and consists of the same rock hard soil found in the previous parcels with
one exception. The parcel itself lays west of Key Ranch road and just north of Mankin Cemetary. On the easternmost
portion of the parcel, there is a small floodplain area with some dried up stock ponds and such, however there is a
small hump (approximately 3m by 2m) in which the Shovel Test A618C512 was dug and yielded a 10 YR 4/4 compact
silt atop a 5 YR 4/6 basal clay at 60 cmbs. Also within this shovel test, we found one fire popped flake between 20 and
40 cmbs. Since it was 1:30 p.m. when we found it, we will have to return at another time to fully delineate, although with
the surrounding disturbance, it may be very likely that it will end up as an isolated find.

58

We started survey on parcels 739 and 738 and on the southern proposed pipeline. The landscape generally consisted
of mixed hardwoods and grasses among undulating hills with mostly all of the shovel tests consisting of a 10 YR 6/4 or
a 10 YR 8/1 fine sand to depth. Within Parcel 738, we located two historic scatters and had one positive shovel test
and since we had the late start and want to get as much done possible before the heat becomes too unbearable, so
we will assess them tomorrow when we have an earlier start to the day.

21

With the late start from driving up from Austin, we only got to the field around 10:30 and shortly into the survey, Greg
Sundborg did not feel well, so we were not able to survey the entirety of the parcel and were only able to assess the
trenching area that was designated for the highest possibility of deep soil deposition. We found, however that the soil
consisted of a 10 YR 5/3 sandy loam atop a 7.5 YR 4/6 basal clay found between 40 and 80 cmbs throughout the
grassy field and mixed hardwoods that lay next to a creek just east of the field. The creek is not crossable, however we
will get better access to the other side tomorrow.

52

Greg is still not feeling well today, however we set out to survey most of MOC 5. We started on the D, E, and F
transects and worked from the creek in Parcel 734 and worked out way west to the end of 736 then surveyed back to
a two track that is found in 735. Mason Miller came out to meet us just as I came across 8 large incised ceramic sherds
within shovel test A735C550 between 60 and 80 cmbs within a 10 YR 7/2 sugary sand. The soil was fairly uniform
among the undulating hills with a mixed hardwood vegetation that varied only by a green grassy manicured pasture
found in 735, however the in the western portion of 735 and most of 734 we hit a 5 YR 4/6 basal clay between 30 and
80 cmbs. Once Mason met up with us, Greg was still feeling a bit under the weather and we proceeded to delineate the
site yielding a base sherd found in OT 1 and 2 tertiary flakes found in OT 4.
It was a short day today because we have to get to Conroe, TX for a different project, however we did manage to finish
MOC 5 and dug along the C,D,E, and F lines up until the eastern edge of 735. MOC 3 within 736 and the A and B lines
of MOC 3 in 734 and 735 still need to be surveyed and will get to them next week. The vegetation and soil was the
same as yesterday.

A and B in 734 and 735. Soil was the same as it has been in Barefoot ranch; deep sand with shallow basal in the
western portion near the creek.

60

Today we surveyed parcels 741, and 739 of barefoot ranch and finished both MOCs 3 and 5. Parcel 741 consists of a
large grassy undulating landscape with a large "prized deer breeding pen" in the western portion of the parcel. The soil
consisted of a 10 YR 7/2 sugary sand to depth.
We then went to see if the small flake was an IF found in parcel 618 which it indeed was.

Shovel Testing Observations

General Observations

We met the landowner upon reaching parcel 731. The crew for the morning is Greg Sundborg, Travis Cornish, Kevin
Stone and myself. The eastern portion within the wooded area near an ephemeral drainage is extremely overgrown by
briar and vines and is extremely tough to get through. However in the western portion, the parcel is a grassy pasture
with a couple of residential houses on the edge of the woods which the centerline goes through. There is also a well
and a historic site within the parcel. The soil consists of a 10 YR 7/1 sand to depth.
After recording the site, K. Stone went to work on a report back at the hotel and we proceeded to parcels 815, 816
and 828. Parcels 815 and 816 consists of a grassy landform overlooking a small drainage and wooded area. There is
a chevron pipeline running through the northern part of the parcels and most likely accounts for much of the
disturbance found within the parcel as well as a couple of gravel roads, and various pipes that are seen going into the
ground. The soil consists of a very compact 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam atop a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 30 and
60 cmbs.
Parcel 828 is a tiny wooded parcel with an abundance of trash near a house and grassy field with emus. Soils consists
of a 10 YR 7/2 sand with a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 50 and 80 cmbs.

53

28

Parcel 610 consists of a boggy creek with dead turtles, plastic in the soil and an array of colors mottled in the 10 YR
5/3 silty clay soil.
10 YR 7/3 sandy loam atop a 7.5 YR 4/6 clay found between 95 Parcels 694, 695, 696, upon surveying to the east within parcel 695 we came across a site with A695D549 being the
and 30 cmbs. The shallow shovel tests were off of the landform. initial positive shovel test and others soon following suit along the landform that overlooks a swampy area to the east.
We spent the rest of the day recording the site and will have to come back to SS ranch at some time later in the future
to survey the rest of the ROW.

A

Shovel tests generally consisted of uniform, tan sand and silty
sands that extended to approximately 40 centimeters or less in
the upland areas or down to 60-80 centimeters in the lowland
areas. Subsoil was largely very easily defined by the prominent
orange or pale gray mottled sandy clay. Though the team
delineated an area needing trenching in the original corridor
(back in March) just to the north in Parcel 719, the revised
alignment in similar contexts was found to reach subsoil at
roughly 60-80 centimeters (as shallow as 45 cm in some areas).
As such, we don't think that there will be a need for trenching.

The survey area was a combination of broad, open grassy pastures and dense pine and oak riparian woodlands. In
general the southern 2/3 of the study corridor is gently rolling uplands that descend to a low, flat bottomland of Coon
Creek. Steep cutbanks and erosional drainage cuts were prominent toward the northern periphery of the study corridor
near the 721/722 boundary and intermittently crossing perpendicular to the line farther toward the north. This is Mason
filling in the form for Iasha.

A

Shovel tests today were more uniform in contacting the basal
clay at roughly 60-80 cm through uniform, soft, sugar sand.
Made for tough hole refilling as the sand is so dry that a good
portion of it simply blows away after screening. Some pockets of
deeper 80+-cm sands, but even these areas were found to be
upland in context and do not likely contain intact archeological
materials.

Survey corridor was more open for most of this portion, crossing rolling upland hills of open, relatively maintained
pastures. Near the middle of Parcel 723 is a prominent pine forest that looks to be artificially-planted as the trees are
found roughly in straight rows and uniformly fill a portion of the parcel. In this area, shovel testing was difficult due to
the extent of roots. Also, near the western terminus of the surveyed segment (near the midpoint of Parcel 721) is a
heavily disturbed access road with clearly graded and introduced fill. This area was not STd but was photographed.
Addtionally, steep cutbanks to the north negated the need for shovel testing. Some of the northern and southern
periphery of the open fields needed to be surveyed but they were heavily overgrown with extremely dense riparian
growth of vines, briars, trees, etc. We couldn't get very good coverage in these areas but did our best. Overall surface
visibility was roughly 25% I'd say.

?

Noel, Dan Rose and I drove up this morning to survey parcels 151, 152, 123, 110, and 66 while Amanda and Kevin
drove up a couple hours later to survey parcels 54, 55, 56 and 57 to further assess 41TR38 and had 3 negative
shovel tests near the railroad grade and were all negative. They then came to meet us in Parcel 66 later in the day.
Parcel 151 and 152 consist of horse stables, a residential house, a horse track and stock pond that all contribute to
the overall disturbance of the property found just north of Dick Price road. We dug a couple of shovel tests in areas we
felt were the least disturbed and they yielded a 10 YR 4/4 silty loam with 60 percent gravels atop bedrock found
between 20 and 35 cmbs.
Parcel 123 is extremely disturbed and the ROW is collocated with and existing pipeline and power line among a grassy
pasture and large artificial pond with it's extents being bulldozed as we were there. We managed to put in a shovel test
near the drainage found to the west of our small area of survey for the day and yielded a 10 YR 4/4 silty loam with a
7.5 YR 5/8 clay found at around 40 cmbs. It is very likely that where we dug had previously been disturbed given its
proximity to the decimation of the general landscape just to the east.
Parcel 110 is a grassy pasture near an existing pump station and is just north of a drainage that was previously
surveyed, however on the side we were digging, there was a shallow 5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 20 and 60
cmbs beneath a 10 YR 4/4 silty loam.
Parcel 66 consisted mostly of an extremely disturbed grassy floodplain in the eastern portion, however south of the
supposed location of 41TR150, there is a grassy area with scattered junipers, and cedar. We found no evidence of the
site within our survey parameters. The vegetation became more and more thick and briar and mixed hardwoods were
more apparent further west near Village Creek, however within this parcel, basal clay was found between 30 and 70
cmbs unlike Parcel 64 further south.

Shovel Testing Observations

General Observations

66

Today we surveyed along a reroute that extends south from tar rant county into Johnson county and is mostly colocated with existing pipelines and power lines. Due to that fact, most of the soil within the parcels we surveyed were
disturbed and within 983 and 987, we did not dig along the E and F transects since it was on top of an existing gas
pipeline within a power line corridor. We did encounter a site within parcel 992 and is designated as 992A1 and is a
historic scatter within a drainage.

102

We started the day by doing an area survey of parcels 929 and 302 which consisted of a large cow pasture and a 10
YR 4/3 compact clay atop a shallow bedrock found between 20 and 50 cmbs.
Parcels 339 consisted of a cow pasture as well with extremely compact 10 YR 4/3 clay and the parcel itself have a
significant but dried up drainage, however the bedrock was shown to be about 60 cm below ground surface and was
not nor should it be considered for trenching.
Parcel 346 consists of an agricultural plowed field with 99.9% ground surface visibility with a 10 YR 2/1 clay.

45

Parcels 969 and 970 consist of a cow pasture with a landform within 969, however all of the shovel tests were
terminated by a shallow basal clay beneath a 7.5 YR 4/4 sandy loam with gravel and about 600 meters of bulldozed
soil is south of the landform.
Parcels 996, 998, and 999 were all photographed due to the amount of disturbance shown on the property and it's
location to the road. Parcels 1000, and 1001 consist of a grassy cow pasture that is certainly suffering from the
drought with cracks in the landscape that extend far beyond our shovel testing capabilities due to the rock hard soil.
Parcels 1003, 1004, 1005, and 1006 all run along the same existing power line that were along the A, and B transects
in 1000 and 1001, and the disturbance within parcel 1006 is quite extensive especially in the southern portion before it
P.I.s to the East where stock ponds and construction roads are prevelant in which case made it pointless to dig along
the D, E, and F transects within 1006 due to the nature of the landscape.

76

The Parcels consist of a grassy pasture with a floodplain in the southern end of 360 that is usually innundated with
water in the winter, but we were able to shovel test it. The soils were consistent throughout yielding a 10 YR 2/1
compact clay.

93

Parcel 899 was a flat cattle pasture with short grasses, no trees and 10YR3/4-4/4 soils to 45 cmbs before becoming
too compact to dig.
Parcel 897 was an overgrown pasture area with mixed tall grasses, and sandy soils that also ended around 50
cmbs.
Parcel 885 was a very small piece of land that ended up being a no dig, as there was no place to put a shovel test,
photos were taken of the area.
Parcel 886 and 888 were a very long piece of land that had no fence between them, starting from the south above
parcel 885 the land was a large plowed corn field with 10YR3/2 clay loam to 40 cmbs for aproximately 1000 meters,
before the parcel turns in to a tree farm, all of the trees were in very large buckets in neatly spaced rows. As all of the
trees were above ground we were able to dig in the area with out disturbing anything. The soils were slightly more
compact in this area. The tree farm area was aproximatly 200 meters across followed by 50-100 meter area of over
grown sunflowers. After the sun flower area was the sod farm. We did not dig in the sod farm( though later found out
from the land owner that it would have been fine). The sod farm in the end of 886 but 888 continues into another
plowed pasture that is just as flat and boring as all the other flat plowed fields we walked through.
Parcel 887 was a small cotton field, also flat with dark compact soils after 30-40 cmbs.
Here we crossed a large and steep drainage with the only briar we saw all day going in to parcels 889 and 890.
Parcel 889 was another pasture with some cedar trees along the edges short grasses, no brush to speak of and had
a large stock tank in the NW portion of the parcel.
Parcel 890 was a slightly more over grown pasture with taller grasses, no brush but contained lots of cedar and oak
trees along the NE fence line, in this area there was a small staged shooting spot, a temporary animal pen and lots of
modern trash.

31

the soils were very uniform across the whole survey area

Today consisted of a lot of driving from survey area to survey area, and we started at parcel 982 which consists of a
medium wooded area with the E and F transects running along a power line and large corridor that was photographed
and not shovel tested. The A, B, C, and D transects were in the mixed hardwood area with some tall grasses and
abundance of modern trash thrown about throughout the parcel. The soils consisted of a 10YR 4/4 silty clay loam atop
a 10YR 5/2 sandy clay atop a 10YR 2/1 clay with 10YR 8/1 mottling. I did find a modern piece of a shoe at 35 cmbs in
one of my shovel tests which shows the general disturbance of the parcel.
Parcel 246 consists of a plowed agricultural field with a 10 YR 3/1 compact clay which we were not able to dig past
40 cmbs however given the plow field and the 99% ground surface visibility it has been surveyed to the best of our
ability.
Parcel 893 consists of a grassy plowed corn field between highway 31 and a modern railroad grade and is located
west of Kerens. The soil was a 10 YR 2/1 compact clay and the field had approximately 50% ground surface visibility.

We met with Brenton at the access point for Parcels 439, 440, 441, and 442 at 8 o'clock a.m. and surveyed and
assessed the parcels for trenching due to the fact that Parcel 439 western edge consists of a creek. 439's soils garner
trenching with a 10 YR 2/1 black clay that extends farther than we could shovel test, however due to recent flooding in
the spring, there is an abundance of downed trees and drift wood that would make it nearly impossible for a backhoe to
access the parcel. Even in surveying, I tried to look for an alternate route to the centerline but could not find one. As for
parcels 440, 441, and 442, they consisted of horse pastures and 440's soil yielded a compact clay and gravel layer
between 30 and 50 cmbs and is not recommended for trenching.
Parcel 373 consists of a plowed agricultural field with ground surface visibilty at 90%. North of the F transect we saw
a couple pieces of clear glass and horseshoes next to a modern house that has collapsed with a barn that still stands
and a modern piece of agricultural machinery and seed container (brown and looks very new).

67

Parcel 527 over near reed ranch was a very over grown parcel with lots of drainage's running mostly N/S across the
parcel. The beginning of the parcel to the North is on a high slope that slopes down to the east with lots of cedar trees
and two track roads. the area looks to be used recreationaly for hunting and target shooting. The area then slopes up
again to a large open field that has been disturbed, the soil is mostly gravels in this area. The land drops down in to a
drainage full of brambles and medium sized trees and then raises again with lots of brush and trees and briars Before
ending in a mostly open field with low ground cover.
Parcel 587 is a treed area with lots of slopes and multiple two track roads. The soils are very blocky and dark, the
parcel starts out relatively flat with a gentle down slope to the South which then slopes up then to a steeper grade
down in to an open area with a large stock tank.
Parcel 942 is an open hill top with short grasses that slopes down in to a treed area. Crossing a fence then lets us in
to parcel 590 which starts as a treed area and then opens up in to a large grassy field with sparse, large oak trees.
Parcel 943,944,945 and 946 are all relatively flat and not separated by any distinguishable markings. The land is
thick with large misquite trees, short grasses, some low brush and cattle.
Parcel 947 is the same as the previously mentioned 4 parcels but had a disused cattle pen along the C transect line.
was an open flat grassy pasture.
Parcel 949, 950 was a similar open field that was full of tall thick brush cover.
Parcel 951 and 952 were the closest to the river, starting with a gradual slope up to the South in 951 the land was full
of brambles and medium sized oak trees Parcel 952 ends abruptly with the cut bank of the trinity river.

none

74

Today, our primary focus was to survey the Eastern side of the Trinity river and examine the eastern cut bank of the
proposed re-route. In examining the bank, various shell and fire cracked rock can be seen eroding out of the side of
the bank, and although it is tough to tell where they are being eroded out from within the cut bank, the artifacts can be
seen as you make your way towards the water's edge. In our shovel testing along the bank, we could get to 80
centimeters, but there was no cultural lens seen within the shovel test, however it is certain that there is a site beneath
our shovel testing abilities and the area needs to be trenched. Note: it will probably be a very deep trench. The further
we went East from the trinity, the soil became more and more compact, mostly yielding a 10 YR 2/1 clay until we came
up onto a small ridge in the northeastern portion of the parcel which yielded a 10YR 4/4 silty sand between 0 and
30cmbs, and a 10 YR 7/3 compact sand between 30 and 60 cmbs and an even more compact 10 YR 8/1 sand with
some 7.5YR 5/8 mottling and was the termination level for our shovel tests.
Once on the ridge, we did have two different isolated finds. both on small landforms within the grassy plain, and
approximately 500 meters apart.

66

Parcel 602 Starting from the east along the trinity river, the soil starts out as sandy clay in an open grassy pasture that
is relatively flat about 4 meters above the trinity river on top of the cut bank. the land remains the same for 300-400
meters until an old dry oxbow of the river cuts across the ROW running N/S. There are a few drainages running along
this same path for the next 100 meters and then soil then becomes much more sandy with small rises through out the
area and blowouts around some of the larger trees that are present. Continuing to the East, the land continues to be
flat and grassy with sparse Oak Trees dotting the landscape. When crossing a fence in the next pasture to the East the
land is made of of gentle rolling slopes that continue all the way to the 2 track road. Just over the road in the farthest
portion of 602 the land slopes down to the SE and contains much more clay in the soil than the previous areas.
Today survey was conducted by Both Crew A and C, each taking half of the ROW.
All other parcels were discussed in a previous DPR.

Parcel 958 is just off of Old River Road and 274, the area is an open flat pasture with some brush , a transmission
line that runs N/S along the Western portion of the Parcel and contains a stock pond that crosses the B and C
transects half way through the parcel. There are trees along the fence line.
Parcel 961 is made up of two pastures the first being very open, flat with short grasses. the second pasture which is
also very flat and contains a barn in the SW corner of the Parcel and a large recently dug stock tank on the D,E and F
lines at the Far western portion. There is also a large amount of modern trash along the western fence line.
Parcel 643 is a very small, over grown patch of land off of HWY 31 near Malakoff, the land is on an upper built up
slope from the highway, with lots of modern trash, a small camper, riding lawnmower, and other sundry bits of trash.
The entire area was disturbed.

Parcel 687 consists of a small wooded area with a grassy pasture in the western portion that has a residential house
that encompasses the western portion of the parcel. The soil consisted of a 10YR 6/4 sandy loam to depth
Parcel 880 is a grassy cow pasture with rock hard 10YR 5/2 sandy clay

43

Parcel 650 consists of a small grassy cow pasture with a stock pond. The soil was a 10YR 6/4 sandy loam to depth.
Parcels 680 and 681 were previously surveyed by Crew A along the original 450 ft. buffer however today was a survey
of a reroute and it was exactly as it was when we previously surveyed the parcels; grassy cow pastures with scattered
existing pump stations further south and west of our survey area and shallow basal clay.
Parcel 686 was a small hardwooded area near a modern barn just north of the F transect. The soil consists of a 10YR
6/4 sand to depth.
Parcel 754 consists of a small floodplain with cows and shrubs approximately chest height and is a flood plain to a
small drainage. The soil consists of a 10YR 4/4 sandy loam from 0-40cmbs with a 10YR 5/2 sandy clay with a 5 YR 4/6
mottled within it.

42

Parcel 814 consists of undulating landforms that overlook a drainage to the east and to the south. The vegetation
consists of piney woods with some scattered brush, which is thicker in the western portion of the parcel. The soil
consists of a 10YR 4/4 from 0-30 cmbs and a 10YR 7/3 sand to depth below that.
Parcel 797 is in more of a lowland setting with mixed hardwoods and an abundance of briar in the western portion of
the parcel as well as natural gas pipelines to the south of our survey area. The soil consisted of a 10YR 4/4 sandy
loam atop bedrock found at 30 in the eastern portion and basal clay at 40 which was found in the western portion

131

Parcels 770, 771, 772, 773, 774 and 776 all consist of an undulating landscape of grassy cow pastures and a 500
meter stretch of Pine and Oak woodlands on the eastern side of parcel 770. There are a number of petroleum lines
that crossover the ROW however, it is tough to tell exactly where they are, aside from a few yellow posts. The soil in
the area consisted of a 10 YR 7/3 sand with a shallow basal (30-40 cmbs) within parcels 774, 773, 772, and the
western portion of 770. Within parcels 771 and the eastern portion of 770, the 10 YR 7/3 sand went to depth.

106

We surveyed the remainder of Parcels 694 and 696 in the morning and the landscape within 694 consisted of
undulating landforms along the D, E, and F transects with a floodplain that encompasses most of the A, B and C
transects. Off of the landforms, the soil was a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam with a 5 YR 5/8 basal clay between 30 and 50
cmbs while on the landforms the soil consisted of a 10 YR 7/3 sand to depth. All shovel tests were negative today.
Parcel 696 was on the other side of a gator infested swamp (we were informed by the landowner of the local wildlife
and saw a couple of traps set up along the lake on our drive out from the survey area), and generally consists of a
landform within mixed hardwoods and medium woods/brush with a small babbling brook south of the A transect. The
soil consisted of a 10 YR 4/4 sandy loam with a 7.5 YR 5/8 basal clay found between 30 and 50 cmbs.
Our survey of parcel 711 was an interesting one in that there were three different proposed reroutes for this parcel,
which we managed to survey despite lack of shape files for the third and most southern reroute in which we followed a
bearing and an idea of where the center line is and dug 4 shovel tests along the centerline and then 4 subsequent
shovel tests from each of those on the center line. There is a large landform that runs north/south in the parcel and the
landscape then slopes downward towards the west and east to small creeks on either side. It also slopes down to the
south where there is an abundance of cat claw and shrubs until the fence. The soil consisted of a 10YR 7/3 sand with a
7.5 YR basal clay found between 50 and 80 cmbs.

35

Parcel 819 consists of a drainage behind a car dealership off of highway 155 and has a shallow basal (20 cmbs)
Parcel 1020 consists of a grassy field among what we had previously surveyed for barefoot ranch and has two houses
in the north eastern and north western corners, as well as a house further south and a sand two track that runs
north/south bisecting the parcel. The soil is a 10YR 7/3 sand to depth.

Parcel 506 is a nearly level, heavily plowed field that contains a stock pond and a couple residential structures. The
plow zone is relatively a loose, gravelly sandy matrix from approximately 0-30 cmbs. Beneath the sandy matrix is an
abrupt transition to a dark brown clay, which is compact and considered to be sterile.
The small portion of 525 that was surveyed a reroute is highly disturbed. The surveyed area has been disturbed by
county road construction, huntin lodge, access roads, pond construction, and tree removal. The soil at 525 was vry
clayey. Consisting of a dark brown and grey upper 20-30 cmbs with a lighter yellowish brown clay beneath that was
very gravelly and caliche like.
Work conducted at parcel 508 was for a pump station that may be constructed north of the current ROW. The setting
of parcel 508 is characterized by gently rolling hills that are cut by the headwaters of an unnamed drainage. Large
portions of the parcel have been cleared for grazing. Thicker veg consisting of hackberry, mesquite, acacia, and bois d'
arc are present nearer to the drainage. Soils across 508 are consistent. Upland soils are very compact with a lighter
brown gravelly, sandy clay matrix from approximately 0-30/40 cmbs over a darker brown gravelly clay. Lowland soil is
moist dark grey, gravelly clay from 0-40+ cmbs.

Parcel 47: Area surveyed for reroute is a flat scrub grass and plowed fleld that has a XTO gravel acess road and gas
pad. Highly saturated soil consisting of a dark brown 10YR3/2 to approximately 30 cmbs with a 10YR4/3 with 5YR4/4
mottle.
Parcel 90: Area surveyed for reroute has an existing pipeline near Rendon road and moderately dense woods further
south.
Parcels 126, 132, 145, 149, 159 are small residental parcels that exhibit higher amounts of disturbance and
modification. Soils within these parcels are sandy (10YR5/4) with a strong brown clay at approximately 50 cmbs.
Parcel 966, 967: Area is comprised of dense oak and cedar woods on a sloping hillside. Area has been distrubed by
existing pipeline and private dirt roads. Soils are generally shallow consisiting of a gravelly, sandy upper 10YR5/4 or
7.5YR4/4 with an abrupt basal clay (7.5YR4/6 or 5YR4/4) at approximately 30-50cmbs. Pipeline corridor is well
maintained and contained high surface visibility.
Parcel 995: is highly disturbed pasturland that is situated between several active businesses. Soils are vry clayey with
an abrupt transition at approximately 30 cmbs. Upper is 10YR3/2, lower is 7.5YR4/4.
Parcel 1011: contains a series of rolling hills interdisperse by sloping lowlands and level terraces. The area is used as
pastureland and a dumping area. Soils are very clayey with an upper 10YR3/2 and were terminated at approximatly 3040 cmbs on a dark 10YR3/2 or 5YR3/2 clay containing limestone gravels or caliche. Existing pipelines, clearing of veg,
stock pond constuction, and gas pads have impacted the area.

Lots

Parcels 266, 267, 269, 270, 271, 273 are located in moderately to highly disturbed pastures that are boardered by
manufacturing facilities, railraod grade, and concrete production pad. These parcels are very flat and contain a dark
clay from 0-30/40 cmbs overlaying a lighter more yellow brown gravelly clay. These fields have undergone modern
modification including drainage ditches, blading/leveling, terracing, and road construction.
Parcels 272, 275, and 277 are currently NO ROE, but are highly disturbed and require no archeological survey. The
parcels have been modified for railroad grade and surrounding terraces. Several photos were taking illustrating said
disturbances.
Parcel 274 is primarily located on the sideslope of a prominent ridgeline that parallels the parcel. Numerous
disturbances were noted within the parcel including terracing, stock ponds, drainage ditches, push piles, blading, and
roads. Shovel testing revealed lighter brown soils from 0-30/40 cmbs overlaying a yellowish brown gravelly clay, which
is considered to be sterile.
Parcel 278 and 279 are contain slightly less slope, but similar soils as previously mentioned parcels. The majority of
disturbance is located in the southwestern quarter of parcel 278. There is a series of ditches that are interlinked with
several stock ponds. No continuation of A280IF1 within parcel 279.

Parcel 125 is a very small parcel with several disturbed areas including stock pond and cuts. One shovel test was
excavated and reached bedrock at approximately 40 cmbs.
Parcel 1007 was surveyed as best as landowner would allow. We did not have access to entire parcel. Shovel tests
were excavated on the F line within the trees. All tests were negative terminating on very compact and sticky clay
approximately 40-50 cmbs. All other transects were walked with surface inspection of the recently plowed upland field.
Parcel 1002 is a very small and completely cleared parcel that required only two shovel tests. Both shovel tests were
terminated at approximately 30-40 cmbs on compact clay with caliche inclusions.

General Observations
Parcel 689 is located in a prodominently upland setting with a few man-made drainages. Large areas of disturbance
including clearing, burning, trash piles were observed. Shovel testing revealed that the majority of sandy loam soils
exceed 80 cmbs. Only a few shovel tests encountered basal clay, these were located closest to the man made
drainages.
Parcel 630 is located west of Cedar Creek. The area surveyed today was a mixture of upland terraces overlooking
creeks and drainages with some floodplain survey. We were unable to finish this parcel due to rain and the presence of
two large prehistoric sites that will be delineated tomorrow.

Soil within parcels 938, 628, and 629 primarily consist of a silty
clay loam that abruptly transisitions into a brick hard clay at
approximately 40 cmbs. No change in soil was observed from 040. Only variation in soil at approximately 40 cmbs was
compactness, likely due to extent of plowzone.

Soils in parcel 630 consist of both sandy and clay loams. The
sandy loams are present with the lowland Pleistocene terraces.
The sandy soil typically extends deeper than 80cmbs. Some
areas encountered a basal clay layer at approximately 60-70
cmbs. However, these were typically located on isolated knolls
within the lowland terrrace.

Topography within 938, 628, and 629 consists of gently rolling to nearly flat upland ridge that boarders the lowland
terraces and floodplain of Cedar Creek. The area is largely void of vegetation and is an active cattle pasture. There are
a few gravel and dirt roads that lead to newly constructed cattle pins. Below the upland ridge and closer to Cedar
Creek, the topogarphy is characterized by prominent lowland Pleistocene terraces that overlook a disected and
undulating floodplain next to Cedar Creek. The area is a mixture of cleared pastures and dense hardwood stands. New
deer pins and roads are present throughout parcels 630.

Closest to Cedar Creek in parcel 630 is a narrow floodplain that
has been disected by Cedar Creek throughout time. Numerous
relic channels and tributaries are present within the floodplain that
make the need for trenching minimal. The channel of Cedar
Creek is not deeply incised with banks not exceeding 4 feet
above waterline. Clay was observed from 0-40 cmbs with only
one shovel tests containing a loose sandy mix of soil to depth.
Parcel 730: Very deep powdery sandy loam to depth.

Parcel 796: This small parcel consists of gravelly sandy soils along the eastern bank of an unnamed drainage to
Caddo Creek. Previously recorded site was not encountered. Open pasture with little to no trees.
Parcel 820-822: Lowland soils are very iron rich sandy loams.
Parcels 820-822: Are located within a relatively dramatic topogrphic setting. Several rapidly ascending ridges and
Upland soils are very fine powder sand with little to no gravels. All

the soils were very boring.

Parcel 1043 was a very narrow parcel that the re-rout covered on the C,D and E lines, due to the size of the parcel
only two shovel tests were excavated in this area. One on either side of the creek. The drainage was very deep in this
area, approximately 3 meters and the soil consisted of sandy clay to depth. No artifacts were visible within the cut bank
but it was also very overgrown. For trenching purposes, it would not be terribly hard to get a backhoe in to the area,
there were no old growth trees, mostly mesquite and brush.
Parcel 339 was a cattle pasture that contained short grasses, some little brush and sloped down slightly to the east.
The soils in this area were a 10YR 3/2 silty clay to 50 cmbs before turning in to a darker clay.
Parcels 1044,1047 and 1046 were all houses on the same street that were photographed, Parcel 986 was also a

All parcels worked on today were part of the latest reroute of the IPL. Parcel 377 was a in a large open field that only
needed to be re surveyed in a small area behind a house from the South fence line to the landing strip. The land was
flat and very compact with short grasses and a stock tank near FM877.
Parcel 378 was photographed due to the small amount of survey needed as opposed to what had already been
done.
Parcels 379 and 382 are on the East side of FM 877 and are comprised of a large plowed and planted field with
transmission lines running E/W across the property. Less shovel tests were put in this area due to the disturbed nature
of the parcel. Parcel 379 has some Ag terracing and the land is relatively flat.
Parcels 397 and 396 were also small rerouted areas. parcel 397 is a narrow strip of land with very compact soils from
the cattle kept on the land. The soil was a compact clay to 40 cmbs with some CaCo3 and was 10yr4/2 in color. The
land owner was worried that the cows would not be used to us and might (do us harm) if we went there with out him.
These were his pet cows that he hand fed on a daily basis and as they didn't know us, he was pretty sure we would be
eaten alive. Alas we survived the monster cows. and continued on to parcel 396 which was a recently plowed field
which was highly disturbed with dark clay soils to 40 cmbs.
Parcels 401,403,404 and 405 were our longest survey area for the day.
parcel 401 was a large plowed field that was highly disturbed so a smaller amount of shovel tests were put in this area.
Parcel 403 started out as an open previously plowed field with short grasses and no trees before crossing a fence in
to a cattle pasture with mixed mesquite and cedar trees, short grasses and lots of rag weed. Crossing another fence
put us in to another previously plowed field with mixed grasses and disturbed soils. All soils were relatively compact at
30 cmbs unless it was in the plowed areas and then it was easier to dig to 40+ cmbs. Crossing FM984 put us in to
parcel 405 which started as an open pasture that sloped down to a slightly lower drainage/ flood plain area where the
clay was mottled with orange and gravel at 20-30 cmbs. and then the land rose again to a more brushy area before
crossing a fence in to a plowed field.
Parcel 404 was a very small area so a photo was taken of the area.
All shovel tests in the 401-405 parcels were dug at 180m intervals by the crew.

60

Parcel 410 was an open pasture with a gently rolling landscape with mixed grasses, short scrub brush and few trees.
The ROW runs just east of a railroad track. A mostly dry stock tank was between the D and E transects about half way
down the parcels length. The soils on the south side of the parcel were a silty clay to 40 cmbs before turning to clay.
The soils on the north end of the parcel tended towards sandy clay to 40 cmbs before turning to clay.
Parcel 406 was photographed.
Parcel 400 was a large open field that had been recently plowed, the soil was highly disturbed for the first 30 cmbs
and became very compact and sticky from 30 cmbs down.
Parcel 420 was also a very large open field that had been plowed, ag terracing and low water areas were located to
the south of the ROW. Few shovel test were dug in this area due to the amount of previous work done and the
disturbed quality of the soil. The A,B and C transects were spread out wider to encompass the entire 6 wide rows
toward the east side of the parcel, the NE end of the parcel is over a levee road with moderate tree cover, brush and a
large drainage/ creek, this area is much less disturbed. the soils in this area were a dark silty clay to 45 cmbs before
turning in to clay.
Parcel 478 was made up of two fields, the first field to the east was open, flat, treeless and had short grasses. The
soils in the first and second field were a 10YR4/2 silty clay to 60 cmbs before turning in to clay. The second field had a
large stock tank crossing A,B and C transects with a large berm to the West and a long slope back down into a much
more overgrown pasture that was also more rolling and less flat, crossing over another fence to the West put us into
parcel 476 which was also more overgrown at the start with 2 burn piles that had been recently burned( were still
smoking) to the south of the ROW. We passed into another field with no change in terrain till we reached a low spot
with moderately treed area with little undergrowth that was aprox 60-100 meters wide. On the other side of the trees
was another open field that was a light sandy clay to 20 cmbs before turning in to 10YR3/2 clay below. All transects
that were not in plowed fields were dug at 180 meter intervals.
Parcel 777 was a 1.5 acre piece of land that was surveyed by Kevin.

Parcel 921 was a large open field with short mixed grasses lots of mesquite trees and some tall cedar trees. AB and
C transects were uneventful. A two track road crossed between D and E lines and a Stock tank was between E and F
lines near the northern boundary of the parcel. Some possibly historic barns were West of the ROW. soils in this area
were sand till 40 or 50 cmbs before turning in to clay
Parcel 920 was a large flat open field of short manicured grass, no trees and very little weeds, just grass. Soils in this
area were sandy clay to 20 or 30 cmbs before turning to clay.
Parcel 914 was a large pasture that sloped slightly to the north. At the start of the transect off of CR 2160 there was a
stock tank near the A transect and the water table was very high, a power line ran adjacent to the road in the parcel
boundary, the soils before the drainage were a relatively deep silty clay to 40/60 cmbs before turning in to orange clay.
After the drainage to the North the soils were the same.
Parcel 881 was a large area of land with only transects E and F on the property and consisted of 4 pastures. the first
pasture was brushie with some mixed growth trees and little ground cover, the second pasture which was small
consisted of a stock tank, tall grasses, mesquite trees and cows. The third pasture was more open with less grass,
more trees and a more rocky soil to 20 cmbs. The 4th pasture was the same as the third pasture with slightly more
slope to the east.
parcel 490 was a house and front yard so only photos were taken
Parcel 1064 was an over grown patch of land caddy corner to 490 and was dark clay at the surface, tall grasses,
mixed brush and mesquite trees.
Parcel 389 was a large flat plowed field as far as the eye could see. all the soils were disturbed and very few tests
were put in this area.

Parcel 40 was a small piece of land behind a housing complex. the land is used as an ATV track and is very hilly,
covered in brambles and totally disturbed. The soils were very rocky and not very diggable. A,B and C lines each got 1
st. E and F lines were taken up by a pumpstation next to the railroad grade,(parcel 41).
Parcel 1041 was a flat brushy pasture full of medium sized mesquite trees, mixed grasses and lots of brush. the
parcel was just off of the I-35 Feeder road. Soils were a silty clay through out.
Parcels 926 and 933 were thin areas around and under a transmission line, the area was open with no trees and a
slight slope to the East. Soils here were very sandy, the area was very narrow and only needed single shovel tests
along its length.

Parcel 610 and 958 are just off of Old river rd and SH 274, parcel 958 was an open flat pasture with short grasses,
little brush and a small drainage running E/W through the many sets of transect lines. a small treed area was located
along all transect lines to the west of the parcel.
Parcel 610 was much less manicured with more brush and lots more standing water, All transects crossed under a
transmission line running N/S where the land was the most boggy. The soils tended to be more sandy in this area
before turning in to orange clay at 40-50 cmbs. the land also rose slightly to the North.
Parcels 960, 961, at this point we had gotten the truck stuck on the side of SH 274 so we walked across parcel 959

open gates between them. The land was slightly rolling with short grasses, little to no weeds, lots of standing water and
some large oak trees for the cattle to stand under in the rain. A small drainage leading to a stock tank crossed the
entire parcel running N/S near the western portion of the parcel. the soils in this area were rather sandy before turning
in to orange clay.
Parcel 963 was a over grown area next to a falling down, trashed out house. the entire area had turning very marshy
due to the past weeks rain. The land was flat, with tall weeds, and full of modern trash. The soils were a clay loam to 40

Parcel 698 was on the west side of fm 753 and was a large open field with a hill to the SW on all transects, there
were trees along the fence line but none in the area of the ROW, all soils were sand to depth.
Across the road in 699 a much larger parcel, the area started out relitively flat and open with some trees in small
pockets with a rise to the NE and a moderate tree line. The ROW went through the trees up hill then down and in to a
freshly baled hay field. that after the down slope from the trees began to slope up slightly to the East again in to
another tree line in a different parcel. Soils in this parcel were also a mixed sandy clay to depth.
Parcels 676 and 937 were on another area of FM 753. 676 was broken up in to two fields, the field closest to the
road was highly disturbed with a pump station and a layer of gravel to make a solid driving or parking pad for large
trucks. the second field to the west was a large horse pasture that started out as an open field and turned in to a
wooded area full of drainages along all transects. Soil in this area was generally a silty sand, or sandy clay to 30 cmbs
before turning in to Red, Orange clay.
Parcel 937 was also a very hilly area full of drainages and trees with moderate underbrush. Transects A,B, C and D
were all in a heavily wooded area with E and F being in an open grassy field to the West. A new horse pen made out of
heavy metal piping was on the E and F transects near the Eastern boundary of the parcel. Soils in this parcel were silty
clay to 20 cmbs before turning in to Orange/red clay.

Parcel 1067 was a long narrow parcel with no discernible boundary's, the parcel was a heavily treed area just off of
hwy 19 just south of Athens. Transects B,C,D and E were surveyed at 100 meter intervals along each transect. Soils in
this parcel were a 10YR5/2 sand to depth across the parcel. The land in general sloped slightly down to the west.
Parcel 1068 was a small, flat, open field between two houses. the parcel contained: no trees, tall grasses and
10YR5/2 sand to depth.
Parcel 1070 was a house and yard, photos were taken and the area was not shovel tested.
Parcel 809 near Franksten, was a hilly pasture with trees along the fence line. There was a house out side of the
parcel on either end and a large trash pile to the East just out of the parcel boundary. Soils in this area were 10YR5/2
sand to 30 cmbs before turning in to Red sand to depth. The ROW is on the high point of the land which slopes down
towards the road to the south.
Parcels 976, 981 were both houses in the ROW so they were both photoed. Parcel 984 was a horse training and
boarding facility, with metal pipe fencing, stables, training areas and lots of disturbed soils. Soil in this parcel was a
10YR4/4 or 4/2, most of the training areas had sand that had been brought in. Parcel 985 which is attached and
directly East of 984 is a brushy area with lots of trees and under brush, the area slopes up to the East with a
meandering drainage that cuts across a-d transects more than once. E and F transects as well as the other portion of
the re rout were partially under the Transmission line and those that were not under the line were in highly disturbed
soils.
Parcel 987 across lillian road from the previous parcel was only transects D,E and F due to the Transmission line
cutting through the parcel, the area surveyed consisted of clay loam soils to 40 cmbs before becoming too dense to
dig, the land sloped more or less up to the East crossing over small drainages in a moderately treed area with massive
amount of under brush/brambles, that made for slow walking. the transects pinched out for a bit and continued again
aprox 100 meters from where we left off before. Soils in this area were the same as previously noted.
Parcels 988,989 Parcel 989 was mostly an open flat field with tall grasses and a small natural gas, oil foot pad at the
South end. Soil here was a 10YR3/2 through out. Hopping the fence in to 988 the field was still flat, but much more
muddy less manicured and contained less grass Transects A,B and C were all fully surveyed, while D,E and F had to
go around a small exotic animal farm, that would have been highly disturbed anyway. The E and F transects were
started again half way down parcel 988 and finished fully in 989.
Parcel 1007 was a half parcel survey as the majority of the parcel had been previously surveyed. Starting at the
West end of the parcel the land was relitively flat with a large transmission line running N/S along the western boundary
of the parcel so we started surveying the area just east of the transmission line. Soils through out the parcel were a
10YR3/2 sticky clay. The western portion of the parcel was an open field with muddy tracks and large gas/oil foot pads
across this parcel and many others. Crossing a fence lead in to a slightly wooded area made up mostly of mesquite
and contained a small dry drainage that crossed all transect lines. On lines A-D we stopped digging tests at the
plowed field and continued walking the lines till we reached the other treed area along lines E and F where we finished
out our survey two to a line back to where we stared.
Parcel 1018 was a plowed hay field, recently bailed. We walked the area and took photos.
Parcel 1010 was done last with the owner of the land present. it was a plowed and planted hay field that was very
muddy, we walked all 6 transects, took photos and did not dig in the clay.

All the parcels today had similar land formation as they were all in the same area. Only transects D,E and F were
tested today on the re routs. The land was all hilly with a large drainage going through parcel 519 at the start of the
transect lines as well as a gravel road being present across all transects for a good 100 meters at the start of the parcel
before the lines veer off to the South. the soils were a clay loam at the surface to 10 cmbs before turning in to a yellow
grey sticky clay to depth, the soils were the same through out the parcel. The area was moderately treed with
underbrush and some fence lines separating parcel boundaries. Parcel 521 had a large winding drainage that ran
across all transects in the parcel.

24

We surveyed the reroutes of parcels 511, 512, and 513 as an area survey. The vegetation consisted of cow pastures
in between two ephemeral drainages. The soil was fairly uniform and consisted of a 10YR 4/4 sandy clay loam atop a
5YR 5/8 basal clay found between 35 and 50 cmbs. The Eastern portion of the survey area consists of even more
shallow basal clay and a transmission line that runs SE/NW.

34

For Parcels 655, 658, and 661 we worked with crew C to complete them. See crew C's DPR for details, but all were
reroutes in grassy cow pastures near drainages, with a fair amount of disturbance in the area.
Parcels 778, 779, and 780 were of the original 450 buffer, and are located just off of the road north of Poynor (FM 315
and FM 1305). Parcels 778 and 780 were small grassy residential yards that were plowed at one point and the soils
are greatly disturbed by the surrounding roads and house that consists of parcel 779.

49

Parcel 655 was a long walk in to a sloping grassy field with large oak trees along a large creek. The soils in this
parcel started in the west with silty sand to 40 and sandy clay to 60 cmbs, farther in to the field the soils became sand
to depth, and after crossing the creek the soils were also a 10YR4/4 sand.
Parcel 658 was a longer parcel that was also an open cattle pasture. We started on the east end of the parcel
working west , to start the land was fairly level with short grasses and sandy soil that turned to sandy clay at 50cmbs.
moving west the land began to slope down more in to a low area where the soils were still very clayey, and as the land
began to rise slightly the soils began to be sand to depth, near the western boundary of the parcel the land was
covered in thick brush and brambles with sandy soil.
Parcel 661, we walked through parcel 663 to get to this parcel walking down a 2 track road through open gates to get
to our very grassy and green parcel with nice old oak trees. We surveyed from the SW to NE up to walnut creek from
the old ROW, the land was gently rolling and was sandy soils throughout.
All of the above parcels were dug by crews A and C working together.
Parcels 786 and 787 were in the same field with no fences separating them. We started surveying from the west
moving east. The parcel was a cattle pasture with some small trees, mixed grasses and slightly sloping ground. The
soils were sandy to depth with some mottling towards the bottom of the shovel tests near 70 cmbs, towards the north of
the ROW the soils contained some gravel, but remained sandy to depth.

We worked with crew C again today, and broke off when we found a site within parcel 816. The general landscape of
the area consisted of grassy cow pastures with one major drainage in the southern end of parcel 816. We surveyed for
a reroute going through the parcels. The soil was uniform with a 7.5YR 4/4 sandy loam atop a 5YR 5/8 basal clay
found between 40 and 90 cmbs.

Parcel 818 was behind the Frankston ISD in the riding club area. All of the land in this area was highly disturbed and
what wasn't disturbed was on a massive down hill slope. starting from the hwy the parcel was a large flattened road
area that had been raised, there was then a large riding arena as well as bleachers and pens. 1 shovel test was done
on this parcel to see what the soils were like, it was a dark red sandy clay with gravel that turned to clay at 40 cmbs.
Parcel 821 was a small field on the oposit side of the road from parcel 818. A house was next to the road in the parcel
and the field contained short mixed grasses, some trees and sloped down and then up to the West. Soils in this parcel
were sandy clay to clay at 30 cmbs. Parcel 812 was a smaller portion of land that contained a few stands of large oak
trees and had a stock tank with berm on the E and F transects near the end of the parcel heading west. soils in this
parcel were sandy to depth. Parcel 813 was also a large open field for the most part with a small drainage and trees
along the drainage line. Crossing a fence, getting closer to a small paved road splitting parcel 813 from 814 is a small
family cemetery. the cemetery is 20x30 meters and contains two sets of burials, the most recent being 2011. Currently
only 3 people are interred in this area. the cemetery was blocked off with a chain link fence and contained a few large
trees, tall grass, and some decorative plants.No shovel tests were placed with in 200 ft of the cemetery as per
regulations. Across the road in to parcel 813 only C-F transects could be surveyed due to land boundaries. C and D
lines were in a wooded brambely area for the first 300 meters with the E and F lines being in an open field with large
pine trees at the edges of the field, At the center of the parcel was a mobile home with dogs, and lots of trash. Behind
the home the land sloped down to the east in a wooded area across all the transects with C and D being next to
another large dry drainage that ended as the land rose higher to the east. Soils in this parcel were also sandy to depth.
Parcel 815 was a large grassy field that sloped down towards a deep drainage with a nice house to the North end of
the parcel near transect F. No shovel tests were dug on the slope, the parcel ended at the drainage and parcel 816
started. Parcel 816 was on a slope up to the NE with sandy red soils through out. Starting from the main drainage the
land was brushy for a short distance before opening up in to a field, with very little grass on the sloping portion of the
parcel, a small swampy area covered 50 meters of slope on the A-C lines another small drainage was present running
E/W and cut across the E and F transect lines at the start of the parcel. A small site was found on top of the rise by
team A, who will discuss it in there DPR. Teams A and C worked together today and dug shovel tests 100 meters
apart, origionally along the center line and on each line to either side of the center line. But with the finding of a site the
AB, and EF transects were all fully surveyed as well afterwards.

Parcel 316 was a long walk in to a small survey segment in an open freshly plowed field, a large split level house was
in the center of the parcel about 400 meters from the ROW. The soils were a sticky silty clay to 40 cmbs before
becoming too dense to dig.
Parcel 266 is actually an unnamed parcel next to the toys R us plant and toxic waste area. We crossed a Railroad
grade and a man made drainage before getting to the ROW ABC lines, the field was brushy with tall mixed grasses
and 10YR4/2 sticky clay loamto 45 cmbs before it was too dense to dig. Another railroad crossing was on the far end of
the parcel passed 266, so we did not get that close to it.
Parcel 39 was behind the housing complex where we were, not so long ago, the ROW in the parcel encompassed
the railroad grade,a stretch of disturbed land and a raised gravel road, We each put a shovel test past the gravel road
in the mesquite filled, short grass and weeded cattle pasture, soils were silty clay full of gravel and disturbed to 40
cmbs.
Photos were taken of all parcels and it rained on and off throughout the day.

We did an area survey south of the already surveyed 450 ft. buffer, and the general landscape consisted of a
residential yard with a drainage that runs north/south bisecting the parcel. The soils consisted of a 10YR 3/2 silty clay
loam atop bedrock found between 20 and 60 cmbs.

We surveyed Parcel 974 which is a small cow pasture within a residential area just off of rendon-mansfield road and
has a lot of modern disturbance. We tried to dig our shovel tests in the least disturbed areas, with the soils yielding a
10YR 4/4 silty clay atop a 5YR 5/8 basal clay found between 20 and 40 cmbs.

Parcel 1038 is right off of FM1187 parallel to the road. Transects E and F were disturbed and undiggable due to an
underground gas line. A historic barn and 3 fenced areas that may have been small animal pens or a garden or a dog
run. Were all located along the C and D lines towards the center of the parcel and slightly farther on was a cement tiled
area with low hutches either for dogs or pigs with some modern hosing to an old water trough. Shovel test were placed
in the area of all of the buildings but there was nothing sub surface. The soil across the parcel was a clay loam to
40cmbs before turning to clay. Lots of photos were taken and the area was not called a site. The rest of the land was
covered in mesquite and brush.
Across an intersection in 1039 was another historic building, photos were taken of the buildings from the road as we do
not have rights to the property yet.
Parcel 1042 was a large open flat field that is mostly made up of a flood plain. A calichie road runs E/S across the
parcel and a power line Cuts N/S across all the transects.The field is covered in short grasses, tall weeds and some
mesquite along the fence lines.

Soils were deep and sandy in parcels 105 and 108, the F and C
lines were tested where possible.

These parcels are situated on a series of small finger ridges that extend southward from a prominent uplift that
overlooks ceder creek to the west. Vegetation within the area consists of mixed woods with relatively thin undergrowth.
There are two drainages that cut south from the uplift and separate the various finger ridges. The area was extremely
saturated due to several inches of rain that morning.
Parcels 677-679: The area surveyed has gently rolling hills that are part of a broad upland uplift. The area is mostly
devoid of trees and covered in short pasture grasses.
Parcel 775: Steep slope and hills dominate the survey area within this parcel. Shovel tests were excavated at high
points and areas with limited slope. Few trees and large stock pond.
Parcel 718: Pastureland separated by thick strands of trees and briar. Existing pipeline on slope of ridge. To east of
pipeline old growth present on west bank of Coon Creek.
Parcel 1 is a contoured pasture, probably highly disturbed, near the southern creek bedrock is shallow. Parcels 105
and 108 are pretty trashed, the C line is a gas pipeline, the F line is mostly in the parcel to the north and/or a creek.
Both parcels were general land surveys due to the amount of area covered by transect lines, it was easier to survey
the entire south portion of both parcels rather than trying to stay on transect throughout the area. Parcel 524 was
open near the start to the east and became more overgrown towards the east. A large stock tank and many buildings,
boats and vehicles were along the A-D lines in the first 400 meters of the parcel. The land was hilly and had many
drainage's that were more than a little hard to navigate in the wet weather, everything was very slippery much falling
ensued. The parcel was crossed many times by different transmission lines running through out the parcel. Soils were
generally sandy to 40 cmbs before turning in to red clay.
Parcel 523 was very much the same as 524 with soils tending more towards clay than to sand. This parcel contained
many more cedar trees and was very brushy around the drainage areas.

Most of the shovel tests were in shallow bedrock.

The ground had been heavily impacted by terracing in parcels 931, 306, and 307 so testing was spaced out to 250 m.

Shovel Testing Observations

General Observations

Parcel 649 heading to the West was an open flat field with short grasses, trees along the fence line and very wet soils.
all shovel tests in this area had the water table between 50-60 cmbs. Two small stock tanks were seen along the D-F
transects and a large trash scatter was found on the A,B transects.
Parcel 648 was the largest parcel of the day and started out as a large flat open field along the D-F lines Two sites for
revisit were found along the bank of a large stock tank on the Northern boundary of the ROW in a lightly treed area.
After the site area the land begins to slope drastically down to the North leaving little space for shovel tests along the A
and B lines with the C-F lines being on top of the ridge. The land also becomes more hilly with deep sandy soils on top
of the ridge and shallow clay in the lower areas.
Parcel 647 is a very brushy overgrown pasture with small trees and much secondary growth, The ridge line continues
in this parcel and leaves transects A and B on a slope so were not dug in this area. A single positive shovel test in the
area of 41HE198 was found.
Parcel 646 is a very small brushy parcel with the ridge line along the A transect.
Parcel 645 is a very hilly parcel with tall trees, little under growth, lots of leaf litter a large transmission line running N/S
and a RRoad running along the boundary of the parcel. There is also a site that that we revisited in this parcel that
continues in to parcel 647

soils in parcels 307 and 358 had some shallow bedrock and
some deep clay areas. Parcel 112 was sandy loam.

Parcel 1080 is split in half by a large body of water the land slopes down to the east towards the water and the first
70m are not dig able due to the slope. Just west of the dirt road the parcel is very open with short grasses, hundreds of
gopher holes and a slight slope up to the west. The soils in this parcel are a light deep sand.
Parcel 1079 starts as an up hill slope to a large terrace ridge, a multi component site is on top of the ridge, the land
then slopes down to the west in a bowl shape , the ROW continues to the north with the center lines being in a low
open area clear of trees with very short grasses with heavily treed slopes rising from either side of the low central area.
Soils in this area were again a deep sand,
Parcel 1078 sloped up to the north and was very brushy for the most part. a high spot on the A,B,C lines yeilded
nothing but gravels and clay, sadly no site was found here, After the high point the land slopes down to a flat two track
road that is the start of parcel 694, the area we were to survey in 694 was mostly road base and a drainage. very little
was done in this parcel.

The northern and western thirds of the parcel were largely disturbed by a gas pumping station pad and buried pipeline
and some water control features on the west side at the base of the railroad tracks. Also, to the west of the gas pad,
the land is elevated unnaturally and cleared with a small scatter of gravels here and there. Push piles to the south. The
rest of the parcel is very dense, riparian scrub (had me cussing the whole time). Small tributary cuts meander at
various spots through the southern edge. Soils are deep in some areas, but they seem unnatural and are likely
introduced/altered. The natural landform along the A transect is much shallower.

We started the day with parcels 812-814 doing an area survey to clear all the land between the old and new
preposed ROW. Starting in parcel 812- the land was grassey, with some scattered trees and sloped up to the East on
a small rise before sloping back down in to parcel 813 which was another large open pasture that was mostly flat and
with trees along the fence line and a slight slope down to a paved road. On the other side of the road was parcel 814
which sloped down fairly drastically towards the east, the area nearest the road had been bulldozed recently for a new
fence line and some burned trees. This area was covered in very tall pine trees with some little underbrush. the land
opened up at the bottom of the slope in to a grassy field before rising again in to a wooded area. the land rises till we
reach parcel 815 where the land opens up again in to a pasture to the south and a house and yard to the north. The
land again drops to a large drainage with a nice bridge crossing and in to a green rolling cattle pasture where we had
previously found a site in the ROW on the hill top. Soils in these areas were a deep sand through most of parcel 814
and 15 with shallower clay in parcel 813.
We were supposed to do more than parcel 749 in the next area, but due to rain from the previous week, there was no
way to cross the creek or even get near it because of the mud( death trap) Parcel 749 was a large open pasture that
had two parallel barbed wire fences sectioning off the flat portion of the field. After the first 400meters moving W to E
the land dropped down to the creek with a distinct line seperating the field from the wild treed area. We attempted to
move through the trees toward the creek, but the area had turned in to a swamp, and after sinking up to my knees in
mud, we decided to regroup on the hillside and determine if there was an easier way to cross the bog.. There was not.
so it shall have to wait for another day when it is dryer. the soils in this parcel were all deep light brown sand to depth.

Transects B, C, and D. But the one test that was dug in Transect
A (at the southeast corner) was likely the only natural soil in the
parcel with dense, upland-variety clays to a depth of about 45

General Observations

Todays testing was in the wooded area in the western half of parcel 818, south of the current rerouted ROW. the area
surveyed was only 500 meters, but it was very thick and brushy across all of the transects the entire length of the
surveyed area. A small drainage ran N/S across all transects about 100 meters the West of where we started
surveying for the day. The land sloped down to the drainage and then rose gradually for the rest of the parcel. the soils
across the parcel were generally a light brown sand with ocassional bright red clay at 40 cmbs.

negative.
Parcel 102 is a small sheep pasture with a large stock tank that takes up most of the property. two shovel tests were
put in the field which was a light sand to depth. the rest of the parcel was taken up by a house, yard and out buildings
and backed up on a Junk yard.
Parcel 97 was very brushy with lots of brambles and some tall cedar trees. The soils tended to be a wet sand. A gas
line runs N/S along the East boundary of the property.

Parcel 931 was a plowed and planted wheat field with no visibility, only D,E and F lines were in this parcel with the
rest being across the drainage in someone elses property. Soils here were a disturbed clay.
Parcel 1060 was a narrow long narrow piece of land that was a previously plowed field that was flat, the soil was
again a disturbed clay.
Parcel 1059 was a large open pasture, that was very flat, soils to the south were a dark brown clay with CaCo3
throughout , the soils to the north changed to a light brown clay loam ending in bedrock between 30-40 cmbs. there
were short grasses, some trees and lots of wild flowers in this parcel.
Parcel 1050 was open pasture on the B-D lines with A line being in a more manicured area with a house, barn and
planted area, We did not dig in the yard of the house. the pasture was full of very tall grasses to the west with very
shallow soils dark redish brown and ending in either clay or bedrock, 300 meters to the east the soil turned in to deep
sand redish in color, just north of the house. Near the west end of the parcel, the land began to slope downward and
the soil was more shallow ending in a yellowish clay.
Parcel 1051 contained two small drainages running N/S across the property with a rolling landscape. Trees were in
all of the low areas with lots of blackberry brambles to keep us from getting to complacent with our work. The soils
tended to be shallow sand ending in bedrock or clay between 15-40 cmbs. only transects A-d were in this parcel.

25

Parcel 1097 was a over grown pasture with very tall grasses, rolling landscape, possibly old ag terraces? and lots of
mesquite, cactus and wild flowers, the soils through out the parcel were a 10YR4/2 clay loam with CaCo3 to 40-60
cmbs then clay and bedrock.
Parcel 1099 was a highly manicured lawn with some well placed trees and a house in the center of the parcel which
was placed out of the row as a seperate parcel. the land sloped down towards the back fence to the east. Soils again
were a 10YR4/2 clay loam with CaCo3 ending in Bedrock at 40cmbs
Parcel 752 was a revisit to delineate 2 positive shovel tests that had been found on a previous visit to the parcel. the
OT to the east was delineated by Travis' crew, and the OT to the West was delineated by my crew. the parcel sloped
up to the East from a low area in the previous parcel to a sharp rise then turning in to a rolling pasture with tall grasses
and scattered large trees.
The soils in this area were Deep sand 10YR4/6 in color ending in clay from 60-80 cmbs. The 752IF1 was found on the
previous visit to the parcel at the base of a rise to the west end of the parcel(1- 3 OT) shovel tests were placed around
the IF to see if there was any other material at the base of the rise. 752IF2 (OT5) was located on top of the rise OT's 48 were associated with this IF, and no other artifacts were found.
Parcel 749 was a long narrow parcel in a heavily treed area with a railroad grade across the parcel.

N/A

This was the survey of the third reroute which runs inbetween the first two. Topogarphy consists of several gradual and
steep sloped hills and ridgelines that are separated by open meadows. Soils ontop of landform varry from fine sandy
loam to gravelly sandy loam to shallow basal clay. Majority of shovel tests encountered basal clay from approximately
20-80cmbs, with the minority of shovel tests containing deep sand exceeding 80cmbs. Soil atop landforms was highly
variable with mixing shallow basal and deep sand or gravelly sand. Natural sandstone gravel was prominant atop
landforms with fine sand more common within lower lying areas. Mixed woods were present typically within drainage
and hilltop settings. Hollywood Lake cuts through the middle of reroute. On either side of the lake are rapidly acending
landforms with more gradual slope apexes.

N/A

964: This enitire parcel consisted of a flat, currently waist high, hay field with zero ground visiblity. All shovel testing
encountered a dark compact clay. No cultural materials were encountered.
651: This parcel was confined to a small residential yard. There were multiple chicken coups in the Right-Of-Way along
with a small man-made pond. The residents house sits 15m North of the Right-Of-Way. The house sat on the peak of a
very sublte rise that sloped evenly down the entire pacrel in all directions. Most shovel testing encountered a loamy
sand on top of basal clay that on average was enountered at 40cmbs. No cultural materials were encountered.
1105: This parcel sat along FM 2588 and was it's western border. Our Right-Of-Way was confined to the southern
most portion of the pacel. It consisted of soft slopes from the nearby small landform. Most of the topsoil has been
stripped from erosion leaving basal clay on the surface in most areas. Some minor disturbence was from a ranch
access road made of loose gravels. Most shovel testing encountered a very shallow basal clay. No cultural materials
were observed.
752: We revisited this parcel to deliniate two positive shovel tests from a previous survey effort. The parcel was mostly
a short grass cattle pasture with small groves off hardwood and consisted a soft rolling hills above Cado Creek on the
western edge. Both positive shovel tests are on the same landform. One on the East and one on the West seperated
by 400m.

Parcel 792 starts off (to the east) very open and slightly sloping up to the west. the grasses were tall and the soil was
sandy to 40 cmbs before turning to clay, the land then sloped down gradually to drainage in a treed area , on the other
side of the treed area the land rose up to a rise with a two track road and a small prehistoric site, mostly on the east
side of the two track road. The land then sloped down again in to a densly treed area crossing a fence in to parcel 789.
The land then rises, ( still heavily treed and continues to rise, full of brambles and shallow clay and bedrock through out
this parcel. A drainage runs across all lines at the start of this parcel and ends in a high open field with shallow
bedrock.

17

Parcel 1107 was made of of a series of small fields starting with a large manicured stock tank that cuts across the
A,B,C lines. The the land rises gently in a tall grass field with scattered trees to a fencing in to another grassy field with
shallow sandy soils, which leads in to yet another pasture with tall grasses and slightly rolling land, another stock tank
is found in the Eastern area of the parcel and the land then slopes down drastically in a wooded area towards the road,
no shovel tests were put in this slopey area. An older building made out of corrigated metal, possibly a barn or work
shop with a cement floor was on transect line E. The building was still too modern to worry about. Transect line F was
in parcel 759 which was in a very over grown field along what used to be a fence line but is now only trees. soils here
were also a shallow sand.

18

Parcel 1106 was a site revisit from the previous week, all land info should be there.
Parcel 1104 has a house and yard on the A line next to the road, we did not dig in the yard with the large dog instead
starting ST's behind the house. B and C lines start in a small sloping pasture that stays relatively flat for 100 meters
before sloping drastically down to the West. The slope is all trees, brambles and ground cover, no ST's were dug in the
slope. Parcel 1103 is all slop till the end near the west where it opens up slightly in to a small hunting area . Parcel
1102 starts near the road as a slopey disturbed field with a barn and house and to the west is again the down slope
with trees and ends in a open hunting camp area with a large stock tank that crosses D,E,F transects. There is another
house down in this area with a large number of junk cars strewn around. Parcel 1101 is a small wooded piece of land
like all the rest, just flatter. All soils in these connected parcels was varying colors of sand to depth.

43

Parcel 766 contained only 2 transect lines A and B, the rest were in parcel 767 which had been surveyed previously( I
think) The parcel starts at the West end as a large open field with sandy red soils that are full of gravels to 40 cmbs
before turning in to clay, the land rises up to the first fence line then begins to slope down to a treed brushy area with a
small drainage, the soil in this drainage area is a sandy clay that is very damp at 50 cmbs, and becomes more clayey
the deeper you go. After crossing the drainage the land, still tree covered, begins to open up slightly before turning in to
another large open pasture that slopes up to the NE, Soils in this area are deep sand that change from 10YR4/4 to a
light brown at 40 cmbs and remain fairly constant to 80 cmbs..
At this point we cross over in to parcel 768 which is another large open field with all transects. the pastures begins to
slope down to the east and is full of tall thistles, trees are only along the fence line at this point. Soils are again light
brown sand with some gravel ending in a yellowish clay between 40-60 cmbs. The land goes down toward another
heavily treed area full of black berries , cows and fuzzy Caterpillars. the soils stay roughly the same with more clay
mottling higher in the sandy layers. an arm of the drainage cuts E/W between the B and C lines to the end of the
parcel. On the D,E and F lines the land is a large open grassy pasture with deep sandy soils till we get back to the
drainage.

69

While there are many parcels, they are all in the same field in the same area.
All soils across all parcels were a uniform 10YR 3/4 clay. Trenching was done in the area today as well showing that
the clay layer is at least 2 meters deep.
Starting with parcel 943 to the NW the land is over grown with mesquite and other sharp trees. due to a large amount
of rain, the Trinity river had flooded its banks and the land is now very lush and green for a bit. so the grass is very tall
across all the parcels as well. parcels 944 and 945 are the same as 943,
Parcel 946,947 and 597 and slightly less brushy with lots of standing water and mixed growth of trees and very tall
grasses, small trees hidden in the grass wreak havoc on the knees causing much stumbling and cursing.
Parcel 948 is an open grassy flood plain filled with tall grasses, mud and wild garlic.
Parcel 949 is part of the same flood plain as in 948 but about 200 meters SE is a small drainage that cuts the flood
plain in half the larger side being in 949. the land becomes very over grown again towards the South end of the parcel
along the transect lines, in 951, another small but very steep drainage has to be forded and then everything is brush,
tall grasses, snakes, trees, brambles and flood debris till we reach the Trinity river to the East. Parcel 952 is closest to
the River and the cut bank, along the transect lines we could not go down the bank to look a the stratum due to the
slick mud and chance of the bank sliding in to the river. Towards the South between the new ROW and old one, we
were able to get down the bank and find a previously visited site.

Today was a long walk in, but the land wasn't over grown so all was well. Parcel 113 was the smaller of the two areas
starting to the West, the parcel backed up on to an oil pad, so the first 20 meters in the parcel was highly disturbed the
rest was covered in tall grasses, low clinging brush and very slightly rolling landscape with few large trees. The soils in
this parcel were brown sand with gravel to 35-40 cmbs before turning in to Sandy clay for 10cm finally ending in red
clay. The closer we got to the Creek to the north the deeper the soils became. Parcel 114 had the same makeup as
parcel 113 ending at the creek. A gas pipeline ran across both parcels along the creek edge in the deeper sand areas
eliminating the ability to trench with safety in the only areas worth trenching.

76

We started the morning in parcel 1054 which was roughly 800 meters long and was comprised of compact clay soils
throughout. starting in the south the land was an open cattle pasture with mixed grasses, mesquite trees some wild
flowers and little else. for the first 200 meters or so, crossing a rusty fence put us in a new field which was more over
grown but contained many small stock tanks across different transect lines. Past the stock tank and on down the line
the pasture stays over grown with a thick growth of sharp and spiky trees. A very large stock tank is on the E and F
transects about 300 meters from the north end of the parcel. A non historic raised animal pen was located on the E
line next to ST1009. Photos were taken but the area was not recorded.
We then moved on to a new and exciting area parcels 930-932, 306 and 304
Starting in parcel 931 the area was lovely and open and covered in wildflowers and sloped gently down towards the E
to a large stock tank and creek flowing in to it. Soils in this parcel were clay to bedrock between 10-30 cmbs. Parcel
306, just E of 931 started on the other side of the fence and on the other side of the creek, the land began to rise past
the creek and climbed up over some very pronounced ag terracing 7 terraces in all, the soil was again, clay to bedrock.
Passing over the previous Transect lines we hopped a pair of fences marking a gas line and worked our way down
parcel 932 on transects E and F, The soils were slightly deeper going almost to 40cmbs before turning in to bedrock.
this parcel was very over grown and was full of Sumak, cedar, and Honey locus trees. The weeds were tall but luckily
there were very few brambles. After finishing this parcel and still having time left we skirted around a No Go parcel and
worked on parcels 930 and 304. 930 was a very small open area with high bedrock like every where else, We had to
cross a large, mostly dry drainage to get to the area. Parcel 304 was slightly more open, still very brushy and bedrock
near the surface. the land sloped slightly down to the East across these two parcels.

in parcel 1054 the soils were very disturbed from previous
planting.
all other parcels had bedrock between 5-40 cmbs

Parcel 929 was a large open pasture that had probably been an area for cattle grazing. The land was relatively flat
with a very slight rise in the first third of the parcel to the West before sloping down to a treed area where there was
actually soil down to 40 cmbs. Hence the ability for trees to grow to any height. past the trees the land was level to the
back fence to the East. The land was covered in wild flowers and very old desiccated cow poo. The soils were a very
rocky clay to 10 cmbs before turning to bedrock.

Parcel 727: Soils within this area consist of deep sandy loams
ranging from 10yr 4/4 to 10yr 5/4 to 10yr 6/4. Shovel tests were
terminated at depth or on a strong brown clay 7.5yr 6/8. Few
sandstone gravels noted with roots dominating soil column.

Parcel 727: The area south of Parcel 727 primarily consisted of a pine tree farm. Trees had been harvested within the
last few years, although was not clear cut. The majority of remaining trees were between 15-20yr olds. Large stumps

Parcel 304 is a continuation of the open pasture land with some brush cover and a few small two track roads crossing
through the parcel across all transects. and very shallow bedrock.
Parcel 930 is also an open flatish field with very shallow bedrock and a deep brushy drainage.
After going around a parcel with no access we end up in parcel 931 which was a previously plowed field and still had
some ag terracing though it has not been used for planting in the past few years. the soils are still shallow and the land
slopes down towards parcel 306 which has a very large stock tank that cuts across all transects and required
everyone to go far around to get back to the transects. On the other side of the tank the land rises to the east in large
ag terraces. The IPL then vears sharply to the south through parcel 932 which is just a large brushy pasture that
contains nothing exciting.

Project and the Proposed Kennedale Balancing Reservoir

Introduction
This report describes the results of mechanical survey in two areas where the proposed Integrated
Pipe Line (IPL) right-of-way crosses major stream valleys (Figure D.1), specifically the
Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley and the Trinity River valley. Nineteen trench excavations
were examined in the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek section and seven were examined at
the IPL’s crossing through the Trinity River Valley. The trench excavations targeted settings
where Holocene alluvial deposits were considered likely to be present and therefore obscuring
visibility of any archaeological sites that may be present. Not surprisingly, the depth of the
deposits was always greater than the depth we could trench, leaving open the possibility of
deeply buried archeological sites that were out of reach. Buried cultural material was rarely
encountered, except in the Trinity River crossing where several trenches exposed buried
prehistoric occupation surfaces.

location of the work described in this section (yellow boxes).

Methods
Deposits were exposed in the field by means of trenches excavated with a backhoe or a minitracked excavator. Trench locations were selected with respect to surface geomorphic features
when present and evenly spaced when not. The exposures were cleaned with a trowel, knife,
and/or pick up to a depth of 1.5 meters; below this depth descriptions were made using samples
pulled from the excavation by the backhoe. Profile descriptions generally follow the methods of
Schoeneberger et al. (2002) except that instead of using the soil horizon as the fundamental unit
of observation we employed the zone, which is used to describe a physically different deposit.
Each zone was later assigned a soil horizon designation based on its properties. Complete
descriptions of the trench profiles are provided in Sub-Appendix D.I and the locations of the
trenches are shown on Figures D.2–D.5. The approximate age of the deposits examined in
the field was inferred on the basis of the degree of soil development according to the general
principles outlined by Birkeland (1999), and considered in light of the previous studies of Late
Quaternary deposits in this region (most notably Ferring 1994).

Waxahachie and Chambers Creeks
The proposed IPL right-of-way crosses the valley of Waxahachie Creek about 3.7 kilometers
(2.3 miles) east of Bardwell, and a short distance south of Bardwell Lake. The path crosses
the valley obliquely and traverses about 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) of the Holocene valley
floor. Parcels examined in this area include 419, 420, 423, 425, 426, 428, 429, 430 and
438. Descriptions of the work done in this region is divided into three parts (Figure D-6):
1) the Waxahachie Creek floodplain, 2) the north side of the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek
floodplain, and 3) the Cummins Creek Crossing, the valley of which lies immediately east of
the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley.

The Waxahachie Creek Floodplain
The floodplain of Waxahachie Creek, upstream of its present confluence with Chambers Creek,
was examined in parcels 419 to 426. These tracts of land are located south of Bardwell Lake
and west of the modern (artificial) confluence of Waxahachie Creek and Chambers Creek.
This reach includes the confluence of Onion Creek and Waxahachie Creek, but this junction
appears to have always been south of the proposed IPL right-of-way. Thirteen backhoe trenches
were opened to a depth of approximately 2.5 meters along this portion of the IPL route (see
Figure D.2 for the location of these trenches). These excavations were all situated within the
Holocene floodplain and along the valley margins in order to look for buried archaeological
sites and assess the stratigraphy associated with the Waxahachie Creek. No artifacts were

observed within any of these excavations. The following section summarizes the stratigraphic
observations made from these trenches.

Geomorphology and Setting
In the investigated reach the Waxahachie Creek valley is a broad, nearly flat surface that
varies between 1–1.5 kilometers wide (0.6–1 mile) and has a low gradient (~6 feet per mile;
Figure D.7). However, the valley floor is neither flat nor featureless, and is crossed by shallow
sinuous linear depressions that appear to represent the former courses of both Waxahachie
Creek and its tributary Onion Creek. In recent times numerous flood control structures have
been constructed in the valley to restrict the flooding by Waxahachie, Onion and Chambers
Creeks to relatively narrow corridors, and this construction work also changed the location of
the confluences of these streams from their natural late Holocene courses. Today, the modern
Waxahachie channel is a narrow, incised meandering stream confined by levees on one or in
a few cases both sides. The floodplain rises between 3–5 meters above the modern channel.
Backhoe trenching occurred within the proposed IPL right-of-way primarily on the valley floor
along a 6-kilometer section (3.7 miles) where 12 trenches were excavated (see Figure D.2).

Stratigraphy and Field Observations
Four stratigraphic units were recognized during the course of this investigation and the relative
relationships between these deposits are shown on Figure D.8. These are informally referred
to as depositional units A through D, from oldest to youngest respectively (Table D.1). The
general characteristics of each depositional unit are discussed in detail (below) and shown on
Figure D.9.
Unit A is the oldest alluvial fill recognized in these trenches. It is found beneath a low terrace
along the margin of the floodplain and was exposed by Trench 426-1. This deposit exhibits a welldeveloped soil with an A-Bt-Btk-Bk-Bkss profile. The A horizon of this soil is non-calcareous

to a depth of 40 centimeters and like the
underlying Bt and Btk horizons, exhibits
strongly developed prismatic structure.
The Bt horizon is 80 centimeters thick,
contains a notable increase in clay from
the A horizon, and has distinct red color
(7.5YR hue). The calcic B horizon
exhibits a Stage II (nodular) morphology
that has coarse (5–20 millimeters)
carbonate nodules and masses that
occupy 5–20 percent of the horizon.
The degree of soil development and
color this alluvium, considered in light
of stratigraphic work done on the Trinity
River (cf. Ferring 1994; discussed in
more detail below) suggest that this unit
was most likely deposited in the Late
Pleistocene.

Unit B was observed within Trench 420-3 near the margin of the Holocene floodplain, where
it was draped by 40 centimeters of Unit D. This fine-grained distal floodplain deposit exhibited
an Akssb-ABk-Bkssg soil profile and graded from dark gray (10YR 4/1) at the top of the
deposit to dark yellowish gray (10YR 4/4) near the base of the trench. The A horizon has

Creek valley floor. The scale bars next to each photograph are 1 meters long.

been leached of calcium carbonate but contained a few small (2 millimeter) calcium carbonate
nodules. The ABk horizon contains 7–10 percent calcium carbonate nodules that ranged from
5–15 millimeters in diameter whereas the Bkssg horizon had only calcium carbonate filaments,
but prominent slickensides, iron depletions and small patchy manganese coats, the latter of
which suggest periodic saturation of the lower part of the profile. The leached A horizon, and
Stage II calcic horizon suggest that Unit B is of Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene age.
Unit C was found in 11 of the 13 trenches excavated (see Table D.1) and comprises a body of
fine-grained floodplain alluvium within which a prominent dark colored, often cumulic soil has
formed. Unit C was nearly everywhere buried by a drape of the next younger deposit, Unit D,
that ranged from 0.4–1.45 meters thick. The A horizon formed in Unit C is strongly calcareous,
black to very dark gray (10YR 2/1 to 10YR 3/1), and often exhibited a few small calcium
carbonate nodules and slickensides. The B horizon is generally more yellow (2.5Y hue), and
also contains fine to medium calcium carbonate nodules, as well as slickensides, manganese
coats, and mottles. The stratigraphic position, appearance and degree of soil development
observed within Unit C are reminiscent of the Pilot Point Alluvium on the Trinity River and
this deposit is most likely of Late Holocene.
The youngest deposit observed beneath the floodplain of Waxahachie Creek, Unit D, covers
the entirety of the modern floodplain and was present in every trench excavated on this surface.
Ranging from 0.4–1.45 meters thick, Unit D, is notably lighter colored than Unit C that it buries
(Figure D.9 shows photograph of this contrast). The base of Unit D is often a dark grayish
brown, ranging from a 10YR to a 2.5Y hue, and in some locations this portion of the deposit
was laminated. A weak soil has formed within Unit D and this soil ranged from Ap-A-C to
Ap-Bw-Bkss profiles. The A horizon is strongly calcareous, often exhibits slickensides, and in
a few exposures was clearly cumulic. Where a calcic horizon is present it generally consists of
a few very small spherical calcium carbonate nodules. A few exposures revealed a thin, weakly
develop paleosol within Unit D. The stratigraphic position and appearance of this deposit are
consistent with a very young age and Unit D is thought to have been deposited during the last
millennium.

Archaeological Implications
None of our trenches were deep enough to penetrate the entire Holocene alluvial fill in this
valley. Cut bank exposures near the point that Ensign Road crosses Waxahachie Creek suggest
that the Holocene alluvial deposits are at least 5–6 meters thick. No cultural material was
unearthed during the trenching of Waxahachie Creek; however, three of the four units discussed
appear to have the potential to contain deeply buried prehistoric archaeological sites. Unit A,
which is probably of Late Pleistocene age, is too old to contain archaeology but depositional
Units B, C, and D all appear to have the potential contain in situ archaeological sites.

North Side of Waxahachie/Chambers Creek Floodplain
The present confluence of Waxahachie Creek and Chambers Creek is located immediately
west of Ensign Road close to where the two valleys join, but it is clear that this was not always
the case. Examination of topographic maps and aerial imagery indicates that Waxahachie

Creek once ran parallel to Chambers Creek along the northern margin of the same broad
valley, eventually meeting about 16.15 kilometers (10.04 miles) downstream of the present
confluence, slightly east of IH 45. This former, but now abandoned, course of Waxahachie
Creek is referred to as Waxahachie Slough. The pipeline right-of-way crosses Waxahachie
Creek about 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles) west of Ensign Road, and after that it skirts along the
northern valley margin for about 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) before traversing the drainage divide
between Waxahachie/Chambers Creek and Cummins Creek. Two parcels were trenched in this
stretch, 429 and 430, both of which have unnamed tributaries that empty onto the Waxahachie/
Chambers Creek valley floor from the north.
The upland ridge that forms the northern side of the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley
rises about 40 feet above the valley floor and is underlain by the Cretaceous age Wolf City
Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). Numerous small, low-order streams drain the
south facing slope and empty onto either the valley floor where they form small alluvial fans,
or their channels join Waxahachie slough.
Parcel 429
Two trenches were placed on parcel 429 (see Figure D.4). Within this parcel two unnamed
low-order streams empty onto the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley floor. The western
drainage has its headwaters about a kilometer (0.6 miles) to the north and a small stock tank
dams its upper reaches. This stream appears to have originally emptied onto the valley floor
as an alluvial fan but has been diverted by means of an embankment so that the channel now
joins a much larger unnamed drainage on the west side of the tract. Prior to this diversion, this
small stream formed a small alluvial fan at the margins of the broad Waxahachie/Chambers
valley, and the convexity of this small is readily apparent today. The eastern tributary, although
apparently a smaller drainage, has formed a larger alluvial fan that along the pipeline right-ofway is more than 200 meters wide. Two trenches were placed into this fan, one on the western
side (Trench 429-1) and a second on the eastern side (Trench 429-2).
Trench 429-1 was excavated to a depth of 1.75 meters and exposed 0.85 meters of Holocene
tributary alluvial fan sediment resting unconformably upon a late Pleistocene alluvial fill that
presumably was deposited by Waxahachie/Chambers Creek (Figure D.10, top left panel).
About a meter of the late Pleistocene deposit was exposed by the trench, and it revealed a
flood basin facies deposit within which an Ak-ABk-Bkg soil had formed. This deposit ranged
from very dark gray (10YR 3/1) to dark gray clay (10YR 4/1) clay and silty clay and all three
horizons contained calcium carbonate nodules which ranged from in size from 1–4 millimeters
in the uppermost horizon, to 15–25 millimeters in the ABk horizon, and accounted for 3–35
percent of the volume of the horizon. The lowest horizon of this deposit exhibited evidenced
of episodic saturation in the form of mottles and manganese concretions. It is on the basis of
the size and frequency of the calcium carbonate nodules within this deposit that it is inferred
to be of Late Pleistocene age.
The Holocene tributary fan alluvium that buries the Late Pleistocene alluvium appeared to
have been deposited in two pulses. The first of these packages of sediment accounts for about

basis of a lighter color most likely represents a second and more recent phase of sedimentation

Trench 429-2 was situated on the central to western side of this small alluvial fan near an area
that appears to periodically pond water today. This trench was excavated to a depth of 3.5
meters and exposed the same two alluvial deposits observed in trench 429-1. In this exposure
the Holocene age unnamed tributary alluvium is about 0.4 meters thick and comprised an
Ap horizon (see Figure D.10, top right and bottom panels). A much thicker exposure of the
Pleistocene alluvium was revealed by this trench and this deposit exhibited a well-developed

soil with an A-Ak-BAk-Bkssg1-B kssg2-Bkg soil profile. This deposit was clay throughout and
appears to represent sedimentation in a flood basin depositional environment. As in Trench 4291, the calcic horizon of this soil exhibited a stage II (nodular) morphology with upwards of 25
percent calcium carbonate nodules that ranged in size from 2–10 millimeters in diameter. Parts
of the B horizon exhibited well developed slickensides, and evidence of periodic saturation in
the form of manganese concretions, mottle and iron depletions.
Although both of these localities clearly had the potential to bury prehistoric age cultural
material, no buried archeological material was observed.
Parcel 430
This parcel is situated immediately east of 429 and in the same landscape position. Two streams
drain the upland margin and empty onto the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley floor on this
tract. The western of the two is a small drainage that starts about half a kilometer north of its
mouth, and trench 430-1 was placed on what was thought to be the alluvial fan of this stream.
The eastern stream is much larger, with headwaters about 2 kilometers north of its mouth, and
a Soil Conservation Service Reservoir (No. 121) blocks this drainage a short distance upstream
of the point it emerges onto the Waxahachie/Chambers Creek valley floor. The channel of this
stream, unlike the western stream, in integrated into the larger drainage network and prior to
the channelization of Waxahachie and Chambers Creeks, this creek flowed into Waxahachie
Creek. Trench 430-2 was placed on a flat surface a short distance west of the creek channel.
Trench 430-1 was expected to reveal a sequence of deposits similar to the two trenches on
Parcel 429, but instead, it exposed a single deposit within which a substantial soil has formed
(Figure D.11). This soil exhibited an A-Bw-Bk-Bkg profile formed in an alluvial deposit that

ranged from clay to silty clay to loam. The calcic horizon exhibits a substantial stage II (nodular)
morphology with upwards of 10 percent calcium carbonate nodules up to 15 millimeters in
diameter. This deposit is similar in appearance to the Pleistocene deposits observed in Parcel
429 except that it appeared to be significantly more yellow in color.
Trench 430-2 was excavated to a depth of 1.9 meters and exposed two clayey deposits, the
upper of which appears to be a cumulic soil of Holocene age, and the lower is interpreted as
a late Pleistocene alluvial deposit. The latter exhibited an Ak-Akg-Bkg soil profile where the
upper 60 centimeters of buried soil at the top of this deposit contained small (3–5 millimeter)
calcium carbonate nodules in a non-calcareous clay. The lower part of this soil contained both
coarse calcium carbonate nodules and redoximorphic features indicative of periodic saturation
(mottles, manganese coats on ped faces, and manganese concretions). This deposit is buried
by a black (10YR 2/1) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1) cumulic soil that is 75 centimeters thick
and composed of clay and silty clay and bears a strong resemblance to Unit C observed in the
Waxahachie Creek valley to the west.
No cultural material was observed in either of the trenches excavated within Parcel 430.

Cummins Creek Crossing (Parcel 438)
Cummins Creek lies directly east and north of the combined valleys of Waxahachie and Chambers
Creeks, and the IPL right-of-way crosses this valley at an oblique angle. Cummins Creek
originates about 9.6 miles (15.5 kilometers) northwest of the crossing, and has its headwaters
on the southern side of Ennis, Texas. Where crossed by the IPL path the Cummins Creek valley
floor lies about 70 feet below a narrow southeast-northwest trending ridge that separates it
from the combined valleys of Waxahachie/Chambers Creek. The Cummins Creek valley floor
is about half a kilometer wide (see Figure D.3) and this relatively flat surface is mostly mapped
by the Bureau of Economic Geology (1972) as Quaternary Alluvium. The uplands bordering
the valley are underlain by the Cretaceous Wolf City Formation which consists of marl, sand,
sandstone and mudstone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972) and nearly the entire Cummins
Creek catchment is underlain by this formation. The drainage divide on the both sides of the
valley expose the undivided Neyland Formation and Marlbrook Marl undivided which consists
primarily of calcareous clays.
About 1 kilometer of pipeline right-of-way lies on the valley floor of Cummins Creek and a
single trench was excavated along this segment in Parcel 438. The valley floor in this area
exhibits several linear depressions that appear to be paleochannels of Cummins Creek (Figure
D.12, panel A), and the trench (438-1) was situated on a low rise between two such depressions.
The modern creek channel lies a short distance (~40 meters) from the trench excavation, is
about 10 meters wide the base of which is about 4–6 meters below the floodplain surface (see
Figure D.12, panel B).
Trench 438-1 was excavated to a depth of 3.5 meters below the ground surface and revealed
two stratigraphic units: 1) a drape of Late Holocene alluvium, and 2) a buried soil formed in
a Late Pleistocene alluvial deposit. The drape of late Holocene alluvium was about 1.4 meters

thick and appeared to have been deposited in an episodic manner, with three soils formed
within it. These soils exhibited A-C or Ak-C profiles where the A horizons were black (10YR
2/1) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and gradually coarsened in texture from clay to silt loam
towards the modern surface. A cumulic paleosol between 120–140 centimeters denoted the
top of the older (Pleistocene) alluvial deposit and two pieces of cultural material (a burned
rock and a piece of debitage) were observed within this soil. Despite picking and troweling
the profile at the same elevation as the artifacts no further cultural material was discovered.
Another paleosol was observed within the Late Holocene alluvium at 60–90 centimeters; see
Figure D.12, panel C), and the modern soil formed within the Late Holocene alluvium is about
25 centimeters thick. The soils formed within this deposit comprised a black loam to silt loam.
Where unaffected by pedogenesis the Late Holocene alluvium consisted of pale yellow (2.5Y
8/2) to very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sands interbedded with dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) loam and
brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, many of which were laminated.
The older alluvial deposit buried by the Late Holocene alluvium exhibited an A-Ak-ABkBkssg soil profile. The calcic horizon formed in this deposit exhibited a stage II (nodular)
morphology where calcium carbonate nodules upwards of 15 millimeters occupied as much

as 20 percent of the profile. Near the base of the profile the calcic horizon exhibited evidence
of periodic saturation in the form of a gleyed matrix color and the presence of mottles and
manganese concretions. It is on the basis of the degree of calcic horizon development that this
alluvial deposit is inferred to be of Pleistocene age. No cultural material was observed in this
deposit below 130 centimeters.

Trinity River
The proposed IPL right-of-way crosses the Trinity River about 8.4 kilometers (5.2 miles)
northwest of Trinidad, Texas. Unlike most of the smaller streams examined for this project, the
Trinity River has a reasonably well established stratigraphic sequence, which was defined in
the headwater streams in the vicinity of Dallas and Fort Worth. The field observations for work
in the immediate vicinity of the Trinity River therefore directly correlates to this stratigraphic
framework, which is summarized below. A total of seven trenches were excavated in the initial
proposed corridor and these trenches exposed four different age alluvial deposits previously
described by Ferring (1994). One was a Late Pleistocene deposit with little potential for buried
archaeological sites, and three younger deposits ranging from Early Holocene to recent all with
a potential to contain deeply buried prehistoric occupation surfaces.

Background
Near Trinidad the bedrock geology consists of the Wilcox and Midway Groups which area
mainly interbedded mudstone and sandstone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). The
most influential geomorphic factor in this area, however, has been the Trinity River and the
evolution of its floodplain and deposits throughout time (Figure D.13). The Trinity River, with
headwaters in north-central Texas near the Red River, drains the oak and prairie regions of
Texas and run directly through the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Although previous studies (Patillo
1940; Taggart 1953; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958) attempted to ascribe ages and names to
terraces and associated alluvial deposits, it wasn’t until the work of Reid Ferring (1990, 1994,
2001) that stratigraphy and geochronology for the Trinity River were formally defined. More
recently, Abbott (2011) has examined alluvial stratigraphy in the headwaters of the Trinity
River system in the vicinity of Fort Worth and provides details on work done since Ferring
completed his work in the mid-1990s.
Ferring (1994) recognizes four constructional geomorphic surfaces or terraces (Stewart Creek,
Hickory Creek, Denton Creek, modern floodplain) and defines seven alloformations that occur
beneath these surfaces (Irving, Coppell, Carrollton, Aubrey, Sanger, Pilot Point, and Modern).
The Hickory Creek and Denton Creek terraces, and the modern floodplain, are present in the
vicinity of the first proposed IPL crossing (see Figures D.5 and D.13) and trench excavations
along this route exposed deposits of the Carrolton, Sanger, and Pilot Point alloformations
and modern alluvium. In general, at this specific site location, the Trinity has been cutting
southwestward since the late Pleistocene. This is evident by a series of progressively younger
terraces that run across the valley floor. The Hickory Creek Terrace, Denton Creek Terrace, and
modern floodplain show the progression of the Trinity from a large stream with 10 kilometers
wide valley to a smaller stream with a modern valley that is 1 kilometer wide.

Geomorphological Report

The Stewart Creek terrace is the highest Trinity River terrace Ferring (1994) recognized,
standing at ~32 meters (105 feet) above the floodplain in the metroplex region. The Stewart
Creek terrace surface can be both erosional and constructional depending on the area and are
often extremely dissected by erosion. The alluvial deposit beneath the Stewart Creek Terrace
is the Irving Alloformation which contains both coarse and fine grained facies. There is a thick
(~3 meter) well-developed argillic horizon formed within the top of the Irving Alloformation
and the unit as a whole dates to the middle Pleistocene (Ferring 1994). The Stewart Creek
Terrace and Irving Alloformation was not identified in the vicinity of the IPL Trinity River
Crossing.
The Hickory Creek Terrace is a broad, flat, constructional surface that stands 10–21 meters
(35–70 feet) above the modern floodplain and is mapped in the project area as Pleistocene
fluviatile terrace deposits by the Bureau of Economic Geology (1972; Ferring 1994). Although
this terrace is commonly described as flat, large relict channel features and associated ridge
and scroll topography are prevalent across the surface when viewed from above (see Figure
D.13) the amplitude of these meanders is far larger than those associated with the modern
Trinity River implying the river had a significantly greater discharge at the time the Coppell
Alloformation, which lies beneath the Hickory Creek terrace, was deposited between
approximately 70,000 and 28,000 years ago. A well-developed soil has formed in the top of this
alloformation characterized by a 3-meter thick argillic horizon and medium to large calcium
carbonate nodules. The Hickory Creek Terrace is present in the immediate vicinity of the IPL
Trinity River crossing, but lies immediately east of the area investigated, therefore none of
these deposits were trenched during this phase of work.
The next lower (and younger) terrace, the Denton Creek, lies about 3–6 meters (10–20 feet)
above the modern floodplain (Ferring 1994, 1990). It can often be divided into an upper and
lower surface (Ferring 1994). In aerial images of landscape near the proposed IPL Trinity
River crossing there is a distinct tonal change between the modern floodplain and the Denton
Creek terrace when viewed aerially. The Denton Creek Terrace is underlain by the Carrolton
Alloformation which is typically composed of red colored (5YR and 2.5YR hue) sandy alluvium
(Ferring 1994). The base of the unit rests on bedrock while the top of the alluvium is marked by
a soil or a very thin veneer of modern alluvium. The soil formed in the Carrolton Alloformation
is characterized by a non-calcareous matrix with a Bt and Btk horizon. Deposition of the
Carrolton Alloformation occurred between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago, and Pleistocene fauna
have been discovered within it (Willimon 1972; Ferring 1994).
The modern floodplain of the Trinity River is a relatively flat surface that typically exhibits
numerous relict fluvial geomorphic features such as ridge and scroll topography and abandoned
channels (Ferring 1994). The tread of this surface rises about 6–8 meters above the modern
channel and is currently aggrading. Four separate alloformations lie beneath the modern
floodplain of the Trinity: the Aubrey, Sanger, Pilot Point, and modern alluvium.
The oldest of these units, the Aubrey Alloformation, was not seen during trenching, and this
unit is most often deeply buried beneath the floodplain. The base of the Aubrey Alloformation
rests upon bedrock while the upper bounding surface is an unconformity with the Sanger

Alloformation that is denoted by a weak soil (Ferring 1994, 2001). This deposit is probably
best known for the Aubrey Clovis Site that was found in situ within it (cf. Ferring 2001). The
Aubrey alloformation was deposited between 20,000 and 11,500 years ago.
The Sanger Alloformation is a markedly fine-grained deposit which was deposited between
11,500 and about 4,500 years ago. Ferring (1994) recorded the Aubrey Alloformation as the
basal contact, however deeply buried profiles make it difficult to establish whether or not this
is true along the entirety of the Trinity. The top of the Sanger alluvium rests beneath the Pilot
Point Alloformation and is commonly defined by the Arlington Soil which formed from 7,000
and ~4,500 years ago. The common characteristics of this soil include a thick A horizon and
calcareous matrix with a thick calcic horizon containing medium to large carbonate nodules
(Ferring 1994). In most places Sanger alluvium is deeply buried by the Pilot Point Alloformation
and cannot be reached by means of backhoe trenching; however, it has the potential to contain
Paleoindian to Middle Archaic archaeology (Frederick 2006).
The Pilot Point Alloformation is the second to youngest and most often recorded alloformation
along the Trinity River ranging from 4,500–1,000 years ago. The Pilot Point alluvium is a dark,
fine-grained deposit that generally rests unconformably on top of the Sanger Alloformation
and often is buried by a thin veneer of modern alluvium. While it can be 3–4 meters thick
in some areas of the Trinity valley (Ferring 1996), where examined by this project the Pilot
Point it is about 1–2 meters thick. The top of the Pilot Point alluvium is defined by the West
Fork Soil which formed 3,000–1,000 years ago. This soil has been extensively recorded along
the Trinity River and its tributaries in numerous archaeological and geological investigations
(Buysse 2000; Cliff et al. 1999; Lintz et al. 2004; Ferring 1990, 1994; Frederick et al. 2006).
It has a dark cumulic A horizon and a Bk horizon with small (0.5 centimeter) nodules with
silt coats and slickensides (Ferring 1994). The Pilot Point Alloformation contains numerous
sites and has the potential to have deeply buried in situ occupations of Middle Archaic to Late
Prehistoric age.
Although not explicitly identified as an alloformation by Ferring (1990, 1994), the modern
alluvium is the youngest deposit in the Trinity River alluvial chronology and represents
sedimentation in the last millennium. The modern alluvium often forms a thin veneer on top
of the Pilot Point Alloformation in floodbasin settings, and the channels associated with this
deposit are inset into the Pilot Point and older alluvial deposits. In floodplain environments the
Pilot Point and the modern alluvium are clearly distinguishable given that the modern alluvium
is a light buff color, and often well-bedded, whereas the West Fork Soil formed in the top of the
underlying Pilot Point is massive in appearance and a uniformly dark brown color. Although
few archeological sites have been found in this alluvium, it has the potential to contain buried
occupation surfaces of Late Prehistoric and Historic age (Abbott n.d.).

Field Observations
Four of the alloformations described by Ferring (1990, 1994) were observed during trenching
of the IPL Trinity crossing: the Carrollton, Sanger, Pilot Point, and modern alluvium. Table

shows an interpretation of the alluvial deposits encountered during trench excavations in this
area.
The Carrollton Alloformation was seen in three trenches: 949-1, 602-3, and 602-5. The alluvium
is non-calcareous and ranges from distal floodplain facies of clay to proximal floodplain facies
of sand. In general the deposits exhibit a fining upward sequence. The soil formed within the
Carrollton Alloformation exhibits an A-AB-Bk-Bkg-C profile near the valley margins, near the
center of the valley this deposit has been truncated by erosion leaving only a Bk horizon, as
was seen at the base of trench 602-3. Clayey, melanized alluvium with slickensides are most
common in the A horizon, while the B horizons can have increased clay content and 1-meter
thick calcic horizons. The calcium carbonate is expressed as filaments, very coarse nodules
ranging from 1–5 centimeters, and in some cases as 1-centimeter thick bands. Mottles and
manganese coats and concretions can also be found within the B horizons. The C horizons
at the base of the profile were generally loose sand. No archaeology was found within the
Carrolton Alloformation.

The Sanger Alloformation was present in trenches 602-1, 602-3, 602-4, and 602-6. Overall
the Sanger alluvium is a slightly calcareous fining upward sequence ranging from sandy clay
loam at the base to clay at the top of the deposit. The base of the Sanger rests unconformably
on the Carrollton within trench 602-3 and is everywhere buried by the Pilot Point. In general
the Sanger is a brown color, ranging from dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to dark yellowish
brown (10YR 5/5). The soil formed within this deposit, the Arlington paleosol, exhibited an
Abssk-Bk profile, with the A horizon having been truncated in three of the four trenches that
exposed the Sanger alluvium. The B horizon was always calcic with carbonate expressed as
filaments and 1–2 centimeters diameter nodules. Prominent slickensides and manganese coats
and concretions are also present within the soil. In some cases mottles and redox depletions
were found within the B horizon. Two trenches revealed mussel shells buried within finegrained distal floodplain clays of the Sanger Alloformation (trench 602-1: shell @ 280 cmbs;
trench 602-6: shell @ 157 cmbs) which are most likely associated with prehistoric (Archaic)
occupations.
The Pilot Point Alloformation was exposed by five of the seven trenches excavated in the
proposed IPL corridor crossing of the Trinity River (e.g., 602-1, 602-2, 602-3, 602-4, and
602-6). This deposit was most often a strongly calcareous fine- grained sediment. The base
of the unit rests on top of the Sanger while the top is usually covered with a thin veneer
of modern alluvium. Much like the Sanger Alloformation the sequence is in general fining
upwards from sandy clay loam to clay. The colors that define the Pilot Point are mainly dark
and range from black (10YR 2/1) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and, as a whole, the
Pilot Point alluvium is grayer than the Sanger. The West Fork soil exposed in these trenches
exhibited an Abssk-Bssk-Bk profile where the A horizon was about 50 centimeters thick across
the valley; however it does thicken slightly in respect to the oxbow/cutoff channel that was
located between trenches 602-2 and 602-3 (see Figure D.5). The A horizon of the West Fork
paleosol is thick and very dark in color with prominent slickensides. The B horizon was always
calcic with calcium carbonate filaments and nodules that are 2–5 millimeters in size. Pressure
faces, slickensides, and mottles are also found within the B horizon, which can be in excess of
3.5 meters thick. Four of the five trenches which contained Pilot Point yielded archaeological
material with bone, shell, burnt earth, and burnt rock all found in situ. The Pilot Point was, by
far the most archeologically productive alloformation with many of the artifacts being found
within or near the West Fork paleosol, which suggests they were of Late Archaic or Late
Prehistoric age.
The Pilot Point Alloformation was everywhere buried by a thin (50 centimeters thick) drape of
modern alluvium. This deposit was generally coarser than the Pilot Point and was a strongly
calcareous silty clay to a sandy clay. A weak A horizon was observed to have formed within
the top of the modern alluvium and this soil was a dark gray (10YR 4/1) to dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) color. Most notably this alluvium was not as compact and consolidated as the other
alloformations and had no slickensides or secondary calcium carbonate. No cultural material
was observed within this alluvial fill.

Archaeological Synthesis
The Trinity River, like all of the other large rivers in Texas, was a major thoroughfare for human
culture. This explains why five out of seven trenches completed at this crossing contained
cultural material. Only two trenches tested negative, both of which were located in the Carrollton
Alloformation which predates the widely accepted period of human occupation of the New
World. The deposits beneath the modern floodplain (see Figure D.14) all have a high potential
for deeply buried in situ archaeology. Both the Sanger and Pilot Point contained archaeology;
however the Pilot Point was clearly richer, especially on and within the West Fork Soil. As
Abbott (n.d.) has recently demonstrated, the modern alluvium has a potential to contain Late
Prehistoric occupations, but no cultural material was observed within the modern alluvium
during this work. Overall the modern floodplain of the Trinity River at this site location has a
high potential for buried archaeology and should be monitored or more extensively trenched
if impacted. The nearby Denton Creek and Hickory Creek Terraces, while rich with surficial
sites, are underlain by ancient alluvium with no potential for buried archaeology.

Summary
Of the twenty-six trench excavations reported here, only those that penetrated the Late Holocene
deposits of the Trinity River repeatedly encountered buried cultural material. Cultural material
was rare in the remaining trenches, despite the fact that most of these deposits have a clear
potential to contain such buried sites. Given the 10 meters depth of the APE of the IPL project,
and the fact that the thickness of the Holocene alluvial deposits in these two valleys was greater
than could be surveyed with a backhoe, it may prudent to consider monitoring the construction
to catch any deeply buried archeological sites that may be affected by the project.

Post-Report Preparation Field Investigations
Subsequent to preparing the main draft report document, two small alterations to the proposed
Integrated Pipeline (IPL) project were proposed by engineers at Tarrant Regional Water District
(TRWD). These small changes did require field investigations within Parcels 298, 770, and
771, none of which were found to cultural resources. Since these surveys were completed
subsequent to the main report’s preparation but under the same permit, AmaTerra requests
that they are included in the overall National Historic Preservation Act and Antiquities Code
of Texas project evaluation. This appendix includes a brief survey summary at each site and
recommendations and a map depicting the results of field investigations.

Draft Technical Memorandum Detailing Cultural Resource Investigations and Findings at
the Proposed Midlothian Balancing Reservoir Borrow Site (Parcel 298)
Cultural resource professionals from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted
archeological investigations in a roughly 50-acre portion of Parcel 298 proposed for borrow
materials extraction for the Integrate Pipeline Project’s (IPL’s) Midlothian Balancing Reservoir
(MBR) in Ellis County (Figure 1). This area surrounds the proposed 150-foot IPL pipeline
permanent easement and the additional 300 feet (450 feet total) of evaluation corridor
investigated previously during the main IPL survey. On June 10th and 11th, 2013 archeologists
investigated the borrow site and utilized a combination of surface inspection and 20 subsurface
shovel tests. Archeologists found the survey area to be overgrown and populated with a dense
carpet of grasses, mesquite, and cactus. Survey crews noted extensive relict agricultural
terracing and evidence of extensive farming activities on the land that (given the shallow soils;
see below) has likely caused severe adverse impacts to any possible archeological resources
on the property. Shovel tests were generally of uniform composition, containing approximately
30-40 centimeters (roughly one foot) of dense, pale brown clay loam overlying solid,
impenetrable, archeologically-stale, clay subsoil. No sites, features, or individual artifacts were
observed within the survey footprint.
AmaTerra archeologists consulted with staff historic buildings specialists regarding the
proposed borrow activities. It was determined that subsurface excavation associated with this
project component would not likely have the potential to adversely affect non-archeological
cultural resources. Accordingly historic resource survey was not conducted and no such action
is recommended.
Archeologists and historians completed their respective surveys and consider the area fully
assessed with no need for follow-up investigations. While the facility still requires formal
coordination with various reviewing agencies, AmaTerra has no cultural resource concerns for
the facility site and no further work is recommended.

Draft Technical Memorandum Detailing Identified Archeological Resources within
Parcels 770, 771, and an un-named parcel on the Tarrant Regional Water District
and City of Dallas’s Integrated Pipeline Project
Cultural resource professionals from AmaTerra Environmental conducted archeological
investigations within Parcels 770 and 771, as well as within an un-named parcel in
support of project development for the Tarrant Regional Water District/City of Dallas’
Integrated Pipeline project. Archeological field crews investigated the entire approximate
one mile long project area on August 22, 2013, utilizing a combination of surface
inspection and a total of 26 shovel tests. No cultural resources were encountered during
the survey.
Archeologists arrived to find terrain that consisted of pasture covered with short grasses,
interspersed with heavily wooded stands of hardwood trees. The middle section of the
project area contained a strip of thick woods centered around two unnamed drainages,
with a third, smaller drainage being located in the eastern end of Parcel 770 (Figure 1).
Visibility ranged from 50 percent ground surface visibility in some of the pasture areas to
0 percent in the heavily wooded areas.
After closely examining the ground surface for prehistoric and historic artifacts and for
potential cultural features, AmaTerra investigators did not encounter any archeological
material. Archeologists supported the visual inspection with a total of 26 shovel tests, all
of which were negative. Shovel testing revealed that soils generally consisted of an upper
level of compacted silty or sandy loam overlying a heavily compacted layer of silty clay
loam. Shovel tests ranged in depth from about 30-50 centimeters below the ground
surface (cmbs) in the pasture areas to 80+ cmbs in the areas surrounding the drainages.
Along with archeological survey, investigators looked for non-archeological historic-age
resources within the survey vicinity. No such buildings were observed.
No cultural resources were encountered and AmaTerra recommends that further work is
not warranted.
