MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek
Interceptor Extension Project, an approximately 2.6-kilometer- (km-) (1.6-mile [mi-]) long
wastewater pipeline extending from the Cedar Park municipal boundary to Farm-to-Market
Road (FM) 1431 in northern Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas. The proposed wastewater
pipeline would consist of a gravity main line that would parallel the course of Brushy Creek,
crossing the stream in 5 places. The northern end of the proposed pipeline would be
coterminous with the municipal boundary of the City of Cedar Park, and the south end of the line
would connect with an existing City of Cedar Park wastewater pipeline installed on the northern
side of FM 1431 within the existing road right-of-way. With the exception of the connection with
the existing water utility line in the FM 1431 right-of-way, construction would occur within
proposed new right-of-way. The proposed pipeline would be installed within a permanent
easement measuring 11 meters (m) (35 feet [ft]) in width, and the temporary construction
easement would measure a total of 23 m (75 ft) in width. To provide an additional 8-m- (25-ft-)
wide buffer, the area of potential effect (APE) was considered to consist of a linear corridor
measuring 2.6 km (1.6 mi) in length by 30 m (100 ft) in width.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Cedar Park, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, and consequently falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977 [revised 1987], Title 9, Chapter 191,
VACS, Art. 6145-9). As the project is a publicly sponsored and permitted undertaking with the
potential to impact potentially significant cultural resources, the City of Cedar Park was required
to provide for a cultural resource inventory of the APE. At this time, it is unclear if any federal
permits are necessary; however, cultural resource investigations were conducted as part of the
due diligence process under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (P.L.
89-665; 80 Stat. 915; 16 USC §470 et seq.) in the event that any federal permits should be
determined to be necessary.
To meet its responsibilities under state and federal statutes, the City of Cedar Park
tasked its design contractor, Carlson, Brigance & Doering, Inc. (CBD), to provide necessary
clearances for cultural resources, and CBD subcontracted with Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon), to conduct a cultural resource inventory survey of the APE associated with the
proposed project. From January 2 to 8, 2007, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, field director,
and Michael Mudd, Ron Ralph, and Jared Wiersema, archeological field technicians, under the

HJN 060258 AR

Management Summary

direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource
survey of the project area to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be
impacted by the proposed construction project.
Three previously unrecorded aboriginal archeological sites were documented during the
survey—41WM1163, 41WM1164, and 41WM1165. In an initial draft of this report, submitted to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in February 2007, Horizon recommended that sites
41WM1163 and 41WM1164 were ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), though the
eligibility of site 41WM1165 was recommended as unknown due to the presence of subsurface
archeological deposits. In correspondence dated March 9, 2007, the THC concurred with
Horizon’s recommendations and determined that the investigated portion of site 41WM1165
would require archeological testing to determine its significance if impacts to the cultural
deposits found during the survey could not be avoided. At that time, the THC cleared the rest of
the proposed pipeline route so that construction could proceed south of Station Marker
No. 77+00 located just south of the south end of site 41WM1165. In the interest of avoiding
impacts to any potentially significant archeological deposits on site 41WM1165, CBD designed
a 356-m- (1,168-ft-) long reroute intended to avoid the previously surveyed 376-m- (1,233-ft-)
long segment of the proposed pipeline alignment containing the archeological deposits of
unknown eligibility.
On March 20, 2007, Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, and Abigail Peyton,
archeological field technician, surveyed the proposed reroute. The proposed reroute shifted the
pipeline alignment in the vicinity of site 41WM1165, which was located immediately adjacent to
the western streambank of Brushy Creek on the first terrace, to a new location on the second
terrace ranging from 28 to 47 m (92 to 153 ft) northwest of the previously surveyed route. The
proposed reroute diverged from the previous route at Station Marker No. 74+00 south of site
41WM1165 and reconnected with the northern terminus of the original route at Station Marker
No. 86+00, which is coincident with the municipal boundary of the City of Cedar Park. During
the survey of the proposed reroute, site 41WM1165 was found to extend up onto the second
terrace, though cultural deposits were found to be largely surficial in this area and to lack
integrity. In this revised draft of the original report, the portion of site 41WM1165 situated within
the proposed reroute is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL, and archeological clearance is recommended for the remaining
segment of the proposed pipeline route (i.e., north of Station Marker No. 77+00) that was not
previously cleared for construction by the THC in their March 9, 2007, correspondence.
During the survey of the reroute, supplemental survey-level activities were undertaken
on site 41WM1162, which is effectively a northern extension of site 41WM1165 located beyond
the northern terminus of Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area
(i.e., the current survey area), that was recorded by SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
during a cultural resource survey of Phase 2 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension
project (Wilcox 2007). These additional investigations were undertaken at the verbal request of
the THC and CBD to augment information presented in SWCA’s draft survey report (Wilcox
2007) about the potential of site 41WM1162 to contain buried, intact archeological deposits.

North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

Based on Horizon’s supplemental investigations on site 41WM1162, Horizon concurs with
Wilcox’s (2007) recommendation that site 41WM1162 is ineligible for designation as an SAL.
The 3 archeological sites (41WM1163, 41WM1164, and 41WM1165) recorded during
Horizon’s survey of the Phase 1 North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area are
aboriginal campsites consisting of scatters of chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and burned
rock. The investigated portions of sites 41WM1163 and 41WM1164 are recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. No further work is
recommended on these sites within the area surveyed for this project.
On site 41WM1165, Horizon recommends that construction be cleared to proceed within
the proposed pipeline reroute. The portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the proposed
reroute is recommended an ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL,
and construction within the rerouted easement would not result in any adverse effects to
significant cultural resources. Furthermore, construction within the rerouted alignment would
avoid any impacts to aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources located immediately adjacent
to Brushy Creek that are of unknown eligibility for inclusion the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL. Provided that construction within the rerouted alignment proves to be a feasible option, no
further archeological investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking.
Based on the results of this survey, no undiscovered portions of any of the previously
recorded sites near the southern terminus of the project area (41WM234, 41WM235, 41WM236,
or 41WM964) extend into the current project area. No cultural resources were identified within
the APE near the southern end of the proposed line on the modern ground surface or in any of
8 backhoe trenches excavated along this segment.
Archeological clearance is recommended for the entirety of the proposed route (as
designed to include the reroute that avoids archeological deposits of unknown eligibility on site
41WM1165) of Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area as defined
in this report. However, in the event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the project area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek
Interceptor Extension Project, an approximately 2.6-kilometer- (km-) (1.6-mile [mi-]) long
wastewater pipeline extending from the Cedar Park municipal boundary to Farm-to-Market
Road (FM) 1431 in northern Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed
wastewater pipeline would consist of a gravity main line that would parallel the course of Brushy
Creek, crossing the stream in 5 places. The northern end of the proposed pipeline would be
coterminous with the municipal boundary of the City of Cedar Park, and the south end of the line
would connect with an existing City of Cedar Park wastewater pipeline installed on the northern
side of FM 1431 within the existing road right-of-way. With the exception of the connection with
the existing water utility line in the FM 1431 right-of-way, construction would occur within
proposed new right-of-way. The proposed pipeline would be installed within a permanent
easement measuring 11 meters (m) (35 feet [ft]) in width, and the temporary construction
easement would measure a total of 23 m (75 ft) in width. To provide an additional 8-m- (25-ft-)
wide buffer, the area of potential effect (APE) was considered to consist of a linear corridor
measuring 2.6 km (1.6 mi) in length by 30 m (100 ft) in width.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Cedar Park, a political

direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource
survey of the APE to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed construction project.
Three previously unrecorded aboriginal archeological sites were documented during the
survey—41WM1163, 41WM1164, and 41WM1165. In an initial draft of this report, submitted to
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in February 2007, Horizon recommended that sites
41WM1163 and 41WM1164 were ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), though the
eligibility of site 41WM1165 was recommended as unknown due to the presence of subsurface
archeological deposits. In correspondence dated March 9, 2007, the THC concurred with
Horizon’s recommendations and determined that the investigated portion of site 41WM1165
would require archeological testing to determine its significance if impacts to the cultural
deposits found during the survey could not be avoided. At that time, the THC cleared the rest of
the proposed pipeline route so that construction could proceed south of Station Marker
No. 77+00 located just south of the south end of site 41WM1165. In the interest of avoiding

long segment of the proposed pipeline alignment containing the archeological deposits of
unknown eligibility (see Figure 1).
On March 20, 2007, Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator, and Abigail Peyton,
archeological field technician, surveyed the proposed reroute. The proposed reroute shifted the
pipeline alignment in the vicinity of site 41WM1165, which was located immediately adjacent to
the western streambank of Brushy Creek on the first terrace, to a new location on the second
terrace ranging from 28 to 47 m (92 to 153 ft) northwest of the previously surveyed route. The

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

This report presents the results of the intensive cultural resource survey conducted for
Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project, including the survey of the
original proposed alignment and the reroute designed to avoid impacts to archeological deposits
on site 41WM1165 that were determined by the THC to be of unknown eligibility, as well as
additional survey-level investigations conducted by Horizon on site 41WM1162 in Phase 2 of
the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area at the request of the THC and CBD
(Wilcox 2007)..
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the
environmental and cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0
describes the survey objectives, results of archival research, and cultural resource survey
methods implemented during the survey. Chapter 5.0 presents the results of the cultural
resource survey and describes the 3 archeological sites and 1 non-archeological locality that
were recorded during the survey. Chapter 6.0 presents management recommendations for
cultural resources documented during the survey. Chapter 7.0 lists the references cited in the
report, and Appendix A summarizes shovel test and backhoe trench data for the project. The
cultural resource survey described in this report was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 4374.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area is located in southwestern
Williamson County, Texas. Williamson County is situated near the southern end of the
Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and
close to the common junction of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain,
the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland Prairie.
The Blackland Prairie, the narrow
physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal
Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of
the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge
of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which
water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards
Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across
Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock
and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an
abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the
entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock,
hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
Specifically, the project area is within the Lampasas Cut Plain, a roughly triangular area
of rolling hill country in central and north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and
Colorado rivers that ranges in elevation from 230 to 400 m (754 to 1,312 ft) above mean sea
level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the
Brazos River and its tributaries, resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded
uplands cut by moderately broad, shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and
supports a mixed savanna flora, whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it
supports mixed riparian woodlands and forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and
rockshelters, but such are neither common nor extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but
not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The project
area runs along a segment of Brushy Creek, crossing the stream at 5 locations. The southern
terminus of the project area is situated near the confluence of Spanish Oak and Brushy creeks,

HJN 060258 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

and the confluence of Brushy and Block House creeks is located in the approximate middle of
the project area. Brushy Creek flows to the southeast toward the City of Couplan, Texas, at
which point it turns northeast, discharging into the San Gabriel River north of Rockdale, Texas.
From this point, the San Gabriel River flows roughly 56 km (35 mi) east-northeast, discharging
into the Brazos River near Hearne, Texas. The Brazos River, in turn, flows southeastward
across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of
Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay. In addition to Brushy Creek, several
minor, unnamed tributaries of Brushy Creek cross the project area, though most of these
streams are represented by little more than a divot in the landscape.
The project area is situated on the floodplain and terraces of Brushy Creek, and the
proposed pipeline route crosses Brushy Creek in 5 locations. The elevation of Brushy Creek’s
streambed ranges from approximately 247 m (810 ft) amsl at the northern end of the project
area to roughly 241 m (790 ft) amsl at the southern end near its confluence with Spanish Oak
Creek. The proposed pipeline route closely follows the alignment of Brushy Creek, veering
away from the streambed significantly in only 1 area along County Road (CR) 272. Elevations
across the project area outside of the streambed range from about 241 to 253 m (790 to 830 ft)
amsl.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The immediate environs of the segment of Brushy Creek along which the proposed
project area runs are mapped as Alluvium (Qal), though the surrounding landscape is mapped
as Comanche Peak Limestone (Kc) (Barnes 1974). The project area is approximately evenly
divided between these 2 geological substrates. Most of the northern half of the project area (i.e,
north of CR 272) is situated on Holocene fluviatile sediments, with the exception of the
northernmost segment between the northern Brushy Creek crossing and the City of Cedar Park
municipal boundary, which is partly situated on soils formed from decomposing Cretaceous
limestone. Conversely, most of the southern half of the project area (i.e., south of CR 272) is
situated primarily on limestone-derived soils, though the areas immediately adjacent to stream
crossings are characterized by alluvial soils.
Soils in Williamson County formed from several types of parent material. In the western
part of the county, where the project area is located, the parent material is primarily limestone,
dolomite, and interbedded limestone and marl. The Comanche Peak Limestone characteristic
of the project area ranges from 9 to 27 m (30 to 90 ft) in thickness in Williamson County, though
it thins southward and pinches out in Travis County. Specifically, the project area is underlain
by soils of the Denton-Eckrant-Doss Association, the dominant soils that overlie the Comanche
Limestone in Williamson County (Werchan and Coker 1983). The Denton-Eckrant-Doss
Association consists of calcareous, clayey, cobbly, and stony soils that formed from indurated,
fractured limestone or limy earths on uplands and range in thickness from very shallow to deep.
Denton soils are found primarily in stream valleys and have an upper layer of calcareous, dark
brown silty clay about 84 centimeters (cm) (33 inches [in]) thick underlain by calcareous, very
pale brown silty clay loam about 8 cm (3 in) thick that is, in turn, underlain by fractured
limestone and limy marl. Eckrant soils are generally found on steeper hills and ridges and

typically have a very dark gray, extremely stony clay surface layer about 28 cm (11 in) thick
overlying indurated, fractured limestone. Approximately 25% of the ground surface is covered
with limestone fragments. Doss soils are typically found on broad ridges and sideslopes and
consist of a calcareous, dark grayish-brown silty clay surface layer about 23 cm (9 in) thick
underlain by 48 cm (19 in) of calcareous brown silty clay loam. The underlying material is
weakly cemented limy earth interbedded with limestone fragments. The Denton-Eckrant-Doss
map unit covers about 21% of Williamson County—Denton soils make up about 21% of the unit,
Eckrant soils about 20%, and Doss soils 19%, with a mosaic of other soil units, including
Crawford, Brackett, Fairlie, Georgetown, Oakalla, and Sunev soils, as well as rock outcrops,
making up the remaining 40%.
The project area traverses 2 specific soil series—Sunev silty clay loam, 1 to 3% slopes
(SuB) and Oakalla soils, frequently flooded (Werchan and Coker 1983). The distribution of
these 2 soil units within the project area parallels the distribution of stream-deposited alluvium
and soils formed in situ from the underlying Comanche Peak Limestone discussed above.
Oakalla soils, frequently flooded, typically have a 86-cm- (34-in-) thick surface layer of
silty clay loam that is dark grayish-brown in the upper part and dark brown in the lower part.
The material in the lower part tends to be sandier than the overlying material. The subsoil, to a
depth of 152 cm (60 in), is grayish-brown silty clay loam alternating with silty clay, with a few
seams of very pale brown sandier material. The soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline
throughout. Oakalla soils, frequently flooded, are nearly level soils found on long, narrow
bottomlands that are flooded several times annually after heavy rains. Oakalla soils are found
on the Brushy Creek floodplain, and most of the northern half of the project area, with the
exception of the northernmost end, as well as some of the southern half of the project area, is
situated on this soil type. Sunev silty clay loam, 1 to 3% slopes, is a gently sloping soil unit that
occurs in long, narrow strips on stream terraces.
Sunev silty clay loam, 1 to 3% slopes, typically consists of a surface layer of dark
grayish-brown silty clay loam about 46 cm (18 in) thick underlain by light yellowish-brown silty
clay loam to a depth of 132 cm (52 in). The underlying layer, extending to a depth of 152 cm
(60 in), is reddish-yellow silty clay loam with many soft masses and concretions of calcium
carbonate. This soil is calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout. Sunev soils are found in
those portions of the project area located at slightly greater distances from Brushy Creek,
including most of the southern half of the project area as well as the northernmost segment
between the northernmost Brushy Creek crossing and the Cedar Park municipal boundary.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was

HJN 060258 AR

7

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest month) to
15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting
from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

BIOTA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 060258 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in
Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the
big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base
composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified
tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in
the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater
diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle
Archaic subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these 3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as
well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic
subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the
Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is
often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation
probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

12

North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa
Indians.1 The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the
prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to
a horse-based culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases
and by warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward
the early settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by
the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches
ranged through the western part of present Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions
were established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the
1860s. There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and
Mayeye Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the
16th century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt.
Alonso De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas
that would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route
passed through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River
and was called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau
de St. Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped
on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th
century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just over the eastern
border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively
explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land
grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement
resulted from these grants.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of
the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on March 13, 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1,379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and
subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had
moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent
came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican
in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage
and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850
and 1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found
large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the
market was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county
ranches had more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the
number of sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis,
divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was

14

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas
Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the
secession convention, Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the
ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson
County was one of 19 counties to oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the
war came, most of the citizens of Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at
least 5 companies were raised in the county; an independent “spy” company under James O.
Rice, a company of Texas Rangers for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and
companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of
those who had opposed secession became active Confederate supporters, others remained
loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North, and a number enlisted in the Union army. In
July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught by Confederate troops while traveling to
Mexico and were hung near Bandera, Texas, and other Unionists were persecuted during the
war. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following the end
of the war, when several men were arrested for “flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of
Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of the citizens of Williamson County was held
on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the gathering set a general tone of
reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the Reconstruction period in Williamson
County, a period that ended with the return of county government to conservative Democratic
control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new communities, and the county seems to have
been free of much of the political and racial strife that occurred in other Texas counties during
Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the
latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and some of the more famous outlaws of the day,
such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed on the property of citizens, and long-term
family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons in the towns added to the toll of
homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a
major part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record
65,093 cattle. Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its
pre-war level by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then
declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920.
The industry revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds
of wool in 1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak
in 1959, when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom
industry in Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As

HJN 060258 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

early as 1869, the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton,
but do not, by any means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been
insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in
1890, and 80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than
any county in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost
tenfold from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of
cropland used for cotton production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of
77% in 1910, and cotton was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes
in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms,
or 77%, were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners,
and the percentage of owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still
further to 29% in 1930. Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with
the shift away from cotton and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the
county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad,
which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the
county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and
Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson
County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was
eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s
and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor
throughout the county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county
by 1930, and extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in
the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th
centuries. While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in
Williamson County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends,
and Austrians moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in
the county population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration
reached a significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county.
There were 294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930.
In 1980, 9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their
distinctive customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of
other denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran,
Catholic, and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally
diverse population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural;
only 29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year.
While cotton
production was near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already
undergoing a rapid transformation.

The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
one-half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal
relief programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000
in subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and
a shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used
for cotton-growing fell by almost one-half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890
bales. Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about
one-half, and wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds,
respectively. While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County,
farmers increasingly turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the
latter 20th century. Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming
played a significant role in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the
production of eggs and chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing
from 37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in
population growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated project area
2. To provide preliminary assessments of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the National Park Service’s (NPS’s) online
National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas State Historical Association’s and the
General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a
program of intensive survey of the project area. The assessments of significance, evaluations
of NRHP and SAL eligibility, and recommendations concerning the treatment options for the
cultural resources recorded during this survey are presented in Chapter 5.0, Results of
Investigations, and Chapter 6.0, Summary and Recommendations. The rest of this chapter
presents the results of archival research, the methodological background for the current
investigations, and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating the survey fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing archival
documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations conducted
in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural resource
properties within a 1.0-km (0.6-mi) radius of the survey corridor. At least 4 previous cultural
resource surveys have been conducted within the archival search radius, including a Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) survey of the proposed Parmer Lane extension from
Ranch-to-Market Road (RM) 620 to FM 1431 in 1992, a survey of Ronald Reagan Boulevard
from FM 1431 to FM 2243 conducted by the Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group
(ACSG) in 2002, a survey of the northern right-of-way of FM 1431 conducted by Horizon in 2000

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

for the City of Cedar Park in connection with the installation of water and wastewater pipelines
(Brownlow 2001)2, and a block-area survey of a large area south of FM 1431 presumably
conducted for residential/commercial development purposes.
Only 1 of the previous cultural resource surveys conducted in the vicinity of the current
project area actually covered a portion of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension survey
corridor. In July 2000, Horizon performed an intensive cultural resource survey associated with
the proposed installation of a 2,043-m (6,700-ft) water line and a 1,433-m (4,700-ft) wastewater
line on the northern side of FM 1431 for the City of Cedar Park (Brownlow 2001). In fact, the
now-existing water line that was installed in the northern right-of-way of FM 1431 is the existing
line into which the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension would be interconnected during
the current proposed project.
During the earlier Horizon survey (Brownlow 2001),
3 archeological sites—41WM234, 41WM236, and 41WM964 (see below)—located in the vicinity
of the southern terminus of the current project area were investigated.
Thus, the southern terminus of the proposed North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension
project area had been previously surveyed for cultural resources by Horizon (Brownlow 2001),
though the remainder of the project area had not been previously surveyed. Given the high
density of previously recorded archeological sites with intact, buried cultural deposits
surrounding the confluence of Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks, floodplain and terrace
environments along Brushy Creek north of the confluence were considered to have a high
potential to contain similar cultural resources.
Seven previously recorded archeological sites are present within the 1.0-km (0.6-mi)
archival search radius (Table 1). Four of these 7 sites (41WM234, 41WM235, 41WM236, and
41WM964) are located in immediate proximity to the southern terminus of the current project
area near the confluence of Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks and were considered to be of
immediate relevance for the current undertaking. The remaining 3 sites (41WM311, 41WM774,
and 41WM1031) are located some distance from the current project area and were considered
to represent informative points of reference, though not concerns for the current undertaking.
Site 41WM234 was originally recorded in 1973 by TxDOT during the initial survey of the
FM 1431 right-of-way. Situated on the terraces and adjacent uplands of Spanish Oak Creek
immediately west of the confluence of Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks, this site was described
as 2 burned rock middens and a surface scatter of burned rock and chipped stone debitage
extending roughly 20 m north of the proposed road right-of-way. In addition, similar materials
were visible on the exposed limestone hillside extending from the edge of Spanish Oak Creek
west along the right-of-way for 10 to 15 m. One backhoe trench was excavated within the site
boundaries, as originally mapped by TxDOT, during Horizon’s 2001 survey (Brownlow 2001:18).
Sparse cultural materials (burned rock and lithic debitage) were observed down to 70 cm below
surface (cmbs), but no intact, subsurface cultural features were found.

State Archeological Landmark

Site 41WM235, also known as the Wilson-Leonard Site, is a listed SAL located on the
south side of FM 1431 immediately across the street from the southern terminus of the
proposed North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area. Originally recorded in 1973
by TxDOT, Wilson-Leonard has been the subject of more than 2 decades of investigations,
including several episodes of data recovery excavations conducted from 1982 to 1993 (Collins
1998). While cultural remains were present on the modern ground surface, the importance of
the site derives from a stratified cultural sequence in deep Holocene alluvial stream deposits
that spans roughly 11,000 years of human prehistory in Central Texas. As delineated during the
TARL and TxDOT investigations, the Wilson-Leonard Site is situated entirely south of FM 1431,
though the northern end of the site is truncated by FM 1431.
Site 41WM236 was also initially recorded by TxDOT in 1973 prior to the construction of
FM 1431. Situated on the east side of Brushy Creek on a broad terrace east of CR 272, the site
was described as an extensive open terrace site in an agricultural field that contained
predominantly shallow deposits that likely had been totally destroyed by plowing. Records in
TARL site files indicated that a variety of projectile point specimens, including Pedernales, Jetta,
Montell, Gower, and Plainview dart points, had been recovered from the surface. During the
2001 survey of the northern side of FM 1431 for the City of Cedar Park’s water line project,
Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches within the site boundaries, as originally mapped by
TxDOT (Brownlow 2001:18). Horizon confirmed that the site deposits were shallow (less than
50 cm deep) and appeared to be restricted to the plowzone. No intact subsurface features were
observed, and the only temporally diagnostic implement recovered during the investigations was

HJN 060258 AR

21

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

a heavily patinated Andice-like dart point putatively associated with the Early Archaic. Due to
the disturbed nature of the site, Horizon recommended the investigated portion of the site as
ineligible for listing in the NRHP and recommended no further investigations in connection with
the City of Cedar Park’s pipeline project.
Site 41WM964, also known as the Krienke Site, was recorded by Horizon during the
2001 survey associated with installation of the City of Cedar Park’s water pipeline on the north
side of FM 1431 (Brownlow 2001). This site is located on a prominent interfluve between
Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks directly across the street from the Wilson-Leonard Site. Two
backhoe trenches excavated on the Krienke Site each revealed an intact burned rock feature,
both of which were described as stone-lined basin hearths, buried in alluvial sediments at
depths of 70 to 100 cmbs and 180 to 200 cmbs. A charcoal sample collected from the more
deeply buried feature produced an uncorrected radiocarbon age of 1040±60 B.P. (Beta-145889)
(Brownlow 2001:20). Calibrated to 2-Sigma, the charcoal sample dated between A.D. 890 and
1060 and A.D. 1080 to 1150, suggesting a Late Prehistoric utilization of the pit feature. The
discovery of a Late Prehistoric feature at such great depth on the Krienke Site was notable,
especially considering the overall sparseness of Late Prehistoric deposits on the WilsonLeonard Site. While the Krienke Site was suspected to represent a possible northern extension
of the Wilson-Leonard Site (the later end of the prehistoric cultural sequence had been eroded
away from the upper elevations of Wilson-Leonard), the geomorphological context of the
Krienke Site is considerably different than that of Wilson-Leonard. Most notably, Holocene
alluvial sediments on the Krienke Site, while up to 3 m deep in the investigated part of the site
(Brownlow 2001), failed to achieve the depths of cultural deposits on Wilson-Leonard, which
measured in excess of 6 m in some areas (Collins 1998). In addition, the cultural features found
on the Krienke Site appear to date to a rather late portion of the prehistoric cultural sequence
considering the depths at which they were buried, suggesting that the Krienke Site was
receiving considerable deposits of Holocene overbank sediments at the same time that similarly
aged sediments were being eroded from the surface of the Wilson-Leonard Site. The
investigated portion of the Krienke Site was recommended as potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP and additional archeological testing was recommended and performed at the site.
The investigated site area, however, was limited to the project area associated with the original
water pipeline installation, and the northern boundary of the site was not delineated. This raised
the possibility that additional, previously undocumented parts of the site may exist farther north
within the current project area.
The remaining 3 previously recorded sites located within the 1.0-km (0.6-mi) archival
search radius contain a variety of aboriginal and historic-age cultural components. Site
41WM311 consists of 2 burned rock middens, a dart point, and a surface scatter of burned rock
and chipped stone debitage. Site 41WM744 is a sparse lithic scatter found on the modern
ground surface in an upland setting that lacked any apparent depth of cultural deposits and
temporally diagnostic artifacts. Site 41WM1031 is a sparse aboriginal lithic scatter (consisting
of only 4 pieces of lithic debitage) and some historic-age structural remains (a fallen chimney)
purportedly associated with a historic-age stagecoach stop. None of these 3 previously
recorded sites are located in the immediate vicinity of the current project area.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

The scope of work implemented during the cultural resource survey of Phase 1 of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area consisted of a pedestrian survey, manual
shovel test excavations, and mechanical backhoe trench investigations within the APE. From
January 2 to 8, 2007, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, field director, and Michael Mudd, Ron
Ralph, and Jared Wiersema, archeological field technicians, under the direction of Jeffrey D.
Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resource survey of the project
area to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the
proposed construction project. On March 20, 2007, Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator,
and Abigail Peyton, archeological field technician, conducted an intensive cultural resource
survey of a proposed reroute designed to avoid impacts to archeological deposits of unknown
eligibility on site 41WM1165, 1 of 3 aboriginal archeological sites recorded during the initial
survey. During the survey of the reroute, supplemental survey-level activities were undertaken
on site 41WM1162, which is effectively a northern extension of site 41WM1165, that was
recorded by SWCA during a cultural resource survey of Phase 2 of the North Brushy Creek
Interceptor Extension project (Wilcox 2007).
These supplemental investigations were
undertaken at the verbal request of the THC and CBD to augment information presented in
SWCA’s draft survey report about the potential of site 41WM1162 to contain buried, intact
archeological deposits.
Minimally, intensive cultural resource survey activities entail a pedestrian walkover with
surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching. During the
pedestrian walkover, Horizon’s archeologists traversed the entire length of the project area on
foot and thoroughly examined the modern ground surface for cultural resources. Exposed
cutbanks along Brushy Creek, where present, were periodically examined as well for evidence
of buried cultural resources and to establish the structure of local soil stratigraphy. While
ground surface visibility was excellent in some portions of the project area (near 100%), the
extent of vegetative ground cover in other areas reduced ground surface visibility to less than
25%. Subsurface probes were excavated at regular intervals across the entire project area,
however, so the limitations imposed upon the surface inspection by occasional low ground
surface visibility did not hamper the survey efforts.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) for cultural
resource surveys state that, for linear projects, a minimum of 16 subsurface probes (i.e., shovel
tests and/or backhoe trenches) per mile of 30-m- (100-ft-) wide linear corridor is required unless
field conditions warrant excavation of more (e.g., due to the presence of culturally sensitive
areas or archeological sites) or less (e.g., due to extensive prior disturbances or the presence of
cultural low-probability areas) subsurface probes. Due to the cultural sensitivity of the environs
of Brushy Creek, Horizon set out to exceed the TSMASS during the survey. Based on the
projected maximum APE width of 30 m (100 ft), the TSMASS would require a minimum of
27 subsurface probes in the 2.6-km- (1.6-mi-) long original project area. Horizon excavated a
total of 50 subsurface probes, including 22 shovel tests and 28 backhoe trenches, during the
initial survey (Figure 2). The majority of these subsurface probes were excavated within or
immediately adjacent to the APE, though 6 of the shovel tests were excavated outside the APE

in the course of delineating 1 of the 3 new archeological sites recorded during the survey. Ten
additional backhoe trenches were excavated during the survey of the 356-m- (1,168-ft-) long
reroute designed to avoid the portion of site 41WM1165 documented during the original survey
(see Figure 2). Finally, 2 backhoe trenches were excavated on site 41WM1162, which is
effectively a northern extension of site 41WM1165, that was recorded by SWCA during a
cultural resource survey of Phase 2 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project
(see Figure 2). Thus, the TSMASS for a linear project area of this length were considerably
exceeded.
Shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated toward a
target depth of 100 cmbs, to the top of pre-Holocene sediments, or to the maximum depth
practicable. Shovel tests were occasionally terminated at depths ranging from 5 to 30 cmbs due
to the presence of dense, near-surface limestone bedrock or gravel deposits, but shovel tests
commonly penetrated from 70 to 100 cmbs. While potentially culture-bearing Holocene
sediments were not necessarily fully penetrated in all of the shovel tests, shovel testing
constituted an effective method of prospecting for buried cultural resources within the upper
meter of sediments. Across most of the project area, shovel tests and backhoe trenches were
interspersed, providing deeper stratigraphic windows across a representative sample of the
landscape. Specific shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 80 to 100 cmbs or more in sandy sediments or 40 to
60 cmbs in clayey sediments). As most of the project area was anticipated to contain deep
alluvial packages that shovel testing may not be able to fully penetrate, backhoe trenching was
conducted across most segments of the project area. Backhoe trenches were excavated using
a 0.6-m- (2.0-ft-) wide bucket. All trenches were approximately 0.6 m (2.0 ft) wide, 3.0 to 4.0 m
(9.8 to 13.1 ft) long, and from 1.5 to 3.5 m (4.9 to 11.5 ft) deep. The trenches were excavated
by removing thin layers measuring approximately 0.1 m (0.3 ft) in thickness from across the
entire trench before proceeding downward. In some trenches, a portion of the trench was left at
a shallower depth while one end of the trench was excavated deeper to examine more deeply
buried strata. Horizon personnel monitored all trench excavations. Trench walls and floors
were carefully monitored during excavation; backfill piles were thoroughly examined for
archeological resources during excavation and random samples of backfill were screened
through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth; and trench walls were inspected
following excavation for artifacts, distinctive stratigraphic anomalies, and/or soil discolorations
that might be indicative of past cultural activities. Horizon personnel created profile sketch
maps and recorded notes on the stratigraphic character of soil deposits observed in trench
walls, though at no time did any personnel enter into any trench deeper than 1.2 m (4.0 ft).
Specific backhoe trench data are summarized in Appendix A.
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all subsurface probes,
including shovel tests and backhoe trenches, were determined using hand-held Garmin
ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based on the North American Datum of
1927 (NAD 27).

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

In general, the entire project area was covered in at least a few centimeters of alluvial
sediments deposited during either the Holocene or the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.
Geomorphological investigations of Brushy Creek conducted in association with the WilsonLeonard Site studies (Collins 1998:5-32) determined that the alluvial sediments along the
segment of Brushy Creek traversed by the current project area were deposited during the
Holocene or during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Oakalla soils, which tend to be restricted
to the Brushy Creek floodplain, were deposited during the Holocene and represent the youngest
sediments in the area, while Suvev soils located on the Brushy Creek terraces were deposited
during the Late Pleistocene and during earlier portions of the Holocene (Collins 1998:Fig. 2-5;
also see Chapter 2.0, Environmental Setting, of this report). Both of these soil units are
calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout (Werchan and Coker 1983), and the general soil
profile observed during the field survey consisted of silty clay loam sediments with common
inclusions of small limestone gravels and carbonate nodules or filaments toward the surface,
with densities of limestone gravels and carbonate concretions increasing with depth until
bedrock was reached. Thus, the Oakalla soils located in the Brushy Creek floodplain would
seem to have the highest potential for deeply buried archeological deposits, with Sunev soils
having a somewhat reduced potential.
The North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area is approximately evenly
divided between the Oakalla and Sunev soil units, with Oakalla soils being predominant in the
northern half of the project area (where the proposed pipeline route is closer to Brushy Creek),
and Sunev soils being somewhat more common in the southern half of the project area (as well
as wherever the proposed alignment veers away from the Brushy Creek channel). During the
survey, it quickly became apparent the alluvial sediments in the project area, while as much as
2 to 3 m deep in some areas, were, on the whole, not as deep as those observed on previously
studied archeological sites farther downstream on Brushy Creek. At the Wilson-Leonard Site,
for instance, culture-bearing sediments covering 11,000 years of human prehistory extended
more than 6 m deep in some areas. At the Krienke Site, by contrast, buried cultural features
dating to the Late Prehistoric period were found buried from 70 to 200 cmbs, though the
maximum depth of Holocene fluviatile sediments on this site was about 3 m. The pre-cultural
subsoil varied across the current project area from solid limestone and fractured, indurated
limestone bedrock to dense deposits of limestone gravels to dense, albeit soft, deposits of
chalky and marly limestone. While limestone slabs and gravels were observed on the modern
ground surface in some portions of the project area, Late Pleistocene and Holocene fluviatile
sediments associated with the Sunev and Oakalla soil series covered the project area in
sediments ranging from 30 to 200 cm in depth overlying the native limestone-derived bedrock.
In only a very few backhoe trenches were deeper, sandy alluvial sediments, extending to depths
of 260 to 280 cmbs, observed. Holocene sediments containing less than a 50 to 75% fraction of
limestone gravels were generally considered to represent the sediments with the highest
potential to contain archeological deposits. These sediments (i.e., sediments containing more
soil matrix than rock) averaged about 130 to 200 cm in depth, though variation from as little as
5 cm to as much as 280 cm was noted.
Three previously undiscovered aboriginal archeological sites, 41WM1163, 41WM1164,
and 41WM1165, were documented as a result of this survey. All 3 sites consist of surface

26

060258_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

and/or subsurface scatters of aboriginal cultural remains, including chipped stone lithic debitage,
unifacial and bifacial chipped stone tools, and burned rock. One of the 3 sites, 41WM1165,
appears to contain a potentially intact, buried burned rock feature (suspected to be a hearth), at
the distal end of the first terrace of Brushy Creek, though no features were observed on the
other 2 sites. As the artifact scatters associated with all 3 sites were at least partly surficial, all
3 sites were initially detected based on the presence of artifacts on the modern ground surface.
The presence/absence, depth, and integrity of subsurface cultural deposits on these sites were
determined by excavating shovel tests and backhoe trenches within and, to a lesser degree,
outside the boundaries of the APE. Site boundaries were delineated via a combination of
surface inspection and subsurface excavations (i.e., shovel tests and backhoe trenches),
though site boundaries were not fully delineated beyond the boundaries of the APE in all cases.
A minimum of 6 subsurface probes was excavated on all 3 sites during the course of delineating
site boundaries, and the TSMASS requirements for site delineation were therefore met on all
sites. Site boundaries within the APE were fully delineated on all 3 sites; however, due to
access restrictions in some areas and to time constraints in other areas, the boundaries of only
1 site, 41WM1164, were fully delineated beyond the APE. In keeping with the goals of the
cultural resource survey, investigations on the 3 sites focused on determining the horizontal and
vertical extent of archeological deposits within the APE, forming a preliminary evaluation of the
integrity of sediment matrices containing cultural materials, and obtaining sufficient data to
formulate preliminary assessments of the eligibility of the sites for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs. Sketch maps of each site were developed in the field, each site was
photo-documented, State of Texas Archeological Data Site Forms were completed and filed at
TARL, and permanent site trinomials were obtained.
In addition to the 3 archeological sites that were recorded during the survey, Horizon
archeologists documented 1 non-archeological locality (Locality 1), which is described in more
detail in the following chapter. This locality consists of what appeared to be the largely
articulated skeletal remains of a bovid found in a backhoe trench buried at depths of 140 to
150 cmbs in deep alluvial sediments. Considering the depth at which they were found, the
bovid remains were investigated to determine if any cultural material materials were associated
with the skeletal elements. Excavation of 2 more backhoe trenches in the immediate vicinity
and careful inspection of trench walls and backfill piles failed to produce any evidence
suggesting a cultural origin for this find. In addition, Dr. Jason M. Wiersema, a biological
anthropologist trained as a zooarcheologist and currently working as a Forensic Anthropology
Investigator in the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office, examined the skeletal remains on
January 6, 2006. Dr. Wiersema identified the remains as deriving from a domesticated cow
rather than from a bison or other large herbivore that would have been economically significant
to the aboriginal inhabitants of the area. Based on the lack of cultural features, artifacts, and
paleosols, and the high degree of articulation and preservation of the skeletal elements
represented, this find was downgraded to a non-archeological locality of essentially modern
origin. It is reported upon here largely in the interest of documenting the rapid sedimentation
that portions of the Brushy Creek floodplain appear to have experienced in the recent past.
Finally, Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches on site 41WM1162, which is effectively a
northern extension of site 41WM1165, that was recorded by SWCA during a cultural resource

HJN 060258 AR

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

survey of Phase 2 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project (Wilcox 2007).
During the course of consultation with the THC regarding Horizon’s survey of Phase 1 of the
overall North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project, the THC requested additional surveylevel investigations on site 41WM1162 in the interest of providing information about the
stratigraphic context of the site. SWCA had delineated site 41WM1162 via surface inspection
and shovel testing, and investigations were therefore limited to the upper 40 to 60 cm of
sediments on the site. As Horizon was already intending to return to the field to survey the
proposed reroute around the previously investigated portion of site 41WM1165, CBD tasked
Horizon with performing the additional investigations on site 41WM1162 requested by the THC.
Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches on site 41WM1162 to obtain information about deeper
sediment strata and to determine whether or not the site contained more deeply buried
archeological deposits.
The survey employed a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Non-diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were described,
sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in which they
were found. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s
marks) were to be collected and placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant
provenience information. Only 1 potentially diagnostic artifact, a contracting-stemmed dart point
fragment found beyond the edge of the APE on 1 of the 3 archeological sites recorded during
the survey, was found during this survey effort (see discussion of 41WM1163 in Chapter 5.0,
Results of Investigations). While this implement exhibited morphological characteristics that
could variously be termed “Bulverde-like” or “Wells-like,” it was not possible, in the end, to
confidently assign the specimen to a taxonomic category. Furthermore, as the point was found
on private land outside the APE, it was left where it was found.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project areas as defined in
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The City of Cedar Park is proposing to construct Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek
Interceptor Extension Project, an approximately 2.6-km- (1.6-mi-) long wastewater pipeline
extending from the Cedar Park municipal boundary to FM 1431 in northern Cedar Park,
Williamson County, Texas. The proposed wastewater pipeline would consist of a gravity main
line that would parallel the course of Brushy Creek, crossing the stream in 5 places. The
northern end of the proposed pipeline would be coterminous with the municipal boundary of the
City of Cedar Park, and the south end of the line would connect with an existing City of Cedar
Park water pipeline installed on the northern side of FM 1431 within the existing road right-ofway. Construction would occur within proposed new right-of-way, and the APE consists of a
linear corridor measuring 2.6 km (1.6 mi) in length by no more than 30 m (100 ft) in width.
To meet its responsibilities under applicable state and federal statutes, the City of Cedar
Park tasked its design contractor, CBD, to provide necessary clearances for cultural resources,
and CBD subcontracted with Horizon to conduct a cultural resource inventory survey of the APE
associated with the proposed project. From January 2 to 8, 2007, Horizon archeologists
performed an intensive cultural resource survey of the project area to locate any cultural
resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed construction project. On
March 20, 2007, Horizon archeologists surveyed a proposed reroute at the north end of the
proposed project area designed to avoid a portion of site 41WM1165 recorded during the initial
survey that was found to contain buried archeological deposits of unknown eligibility.
The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new archeological sites (41WM1163,
41WM1164, and 41WM1165) and 1 non-archeological locality that initially was believed to be a
possible archeological site (Locality 1). The 3 archeological sites are aboriginal campsites
consisting of scatters of chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and burned rock. Two sites
(41WM1163 and 41WM1164) are confined to surface and/or near-surface contexts, whereas
1 of the sites (41WM1165) is largely surficial but contains more deeply buried archeological
deposits, including a buried burned rock feature, in a small area situated at the distal edge of
the first terrace of Brushy Creek. The non-archeological locality (Locality 1) consists of the
remains of a buried bovid skeleton that was initially investigated as an archeological site until it
became apparent that the bovid remains were from a modern cow rather than a prehistoric
bison and that no artifacts or other evidence of cultural activity is associated with the skeletal
remains. No isolated occurrences of artifacts were encountered.

5.1

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES

Prior to proceeding with the discussion of the cultural resources documented during the
survey, a brief consideration of the previously recorded archeological sites located in the vicinity
of the southern terminus of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area is
warranted. As discussed in Chapter 4.0, Research Objectives and Methodology, 3 previously
recorded archeological sites (41WM234, 41WM236, and 41WM964 [the Krienke Site]) are
present on the north side of FM 1431 in the general vicinity of the southern terminus of the
project area, and a fourth previously investigated site (41WM235, the Wilson-Leonard Site) is
located on the south side of FM 1431.
The southern end of the proposed interceptor line articulates with an existing wastewater
utility line (installed on the northern side of FM 1431 within the existing right-of-way) on the east
side of Brushy Creek between the streambed and CR 272 (Figure 3). From this point, the
proposed interceptor line right-of-way proceeds 200 m (656 ft) north-northwest along the
eastern bank of Brushy Creek (Figure 4), crossing to the western bank of Brushy Creek about
midway between FM 1431 and a private driveway that provides access to the Krienke family
property. From here, the proposed pipeline route continues north about 200 m (656 ft), at which
point it encounters CR 272. The proposed alignment then continues north-northwest near the
western edge of the CR 272 right-of-way, eventually crossing CR 272 and continuing into the
northern portion of the project area.
As designed, the proposed interceptor pipeline route avoids the mapped boundaries of
all of the previously recorded archeological sites located near the southern end of the project
area. Site 41WM234 is situated on the terraces of Spanish Oak Creek well to the west of the
southern end of the project area. As the project area traverses the eastern side of Brushy
Creek, the proposed undertaking would have no potential impacts on site 41WM234. Similarly,
site 41WM235, the Wilson-Leonard Site, is located south of FM 1431 on the southern bank of
Brushy Creek. As the current project area terminates at the existing wastewater utility line
installed on the north side of FM 1431, there would be no potential effects on any documented
portion of the Wilson-Leonard Site.
Four backhoe trenches (BTs 1 to 4) were excavated within or adjacent to the APE on the
eastern side of Brushy Creek between the southern terminus of the survey corridor and the first
Brushy Creek crossing 200 m to the north (see Figure 2). Two of the trenches (BTs 1 and 2)
were excavated within the APE, though 2 trenches (BTs 3 and 4) were excavated a short
distance east of the APE due to the presence of thick stands of deciduous hardwoods along the
eastern bank of Brushy Creek. No cultural resources were observed in any of these trenches or
along cutbanks of Brushy Creek, thereby documenting that neither site 41WM272, located east
of CR 272, nor site 41WM964 (the Krienke Site), located on the west side of Brushy Creek,
extend into this segment of the APE.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

The previously documented portion of site 41WM964, the Krienke Site, is situated on an
interfluve between Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks west of Brushy Creek. The documented
site boundaries extend 65 m north of FM 1431, though the northern site boundary was not
determined during earlier investigations on the site (Brownlow 2001). The current project area
crosses over to the west side of Brushy Creek 200 m north of the FM 1431 right-of-way and
continues north 200 m along the west side of Brushy Creek to CR 272. Four backhoe trenches
(BTs 5 to 8) were excavated along this 200-m segment of the APE (see Figure 2). Sediment
deposits in these trenches appear to be largely similar to those documented by Horizon on the
Krienke Site (Brownlow 2001:Figs. 6 and 7), and, while Holocene sediments in BTs 5 to 8
extended as deep as 170 to 220 cmbs, no cultural materials were identified in any of the
trenches. During recording of the trench profiles, particular attention was paid to the sediment
strata that seemed to correspond to those that yielded the burned rock features on the Krienke
Site, though no artifacts, cultural features, or anomalous soil discolorations that may be
indicative of past cultural activity were identified.
Based on the results of this survey, no undiscovered portions of any of the previously
recorded sites near the southern terminus of the project area (41WM234, 41WM235, 41WM236,
or 41WM964) extend into the current project area.

5.2

NON-ARCHEOLOGICAL LOCALITY 1

Locality 1 is a non-archeological locality that consists of skeletal remains from the head
and shoulders area of a cow found in deep alluvial sediments in a backhoe trench (BT 16)
excavated near the APE centerline in a levee-like landform that extends a short distance along
the edge of Brushy Creek’s first terrace (Figure 5). In this location, the project area follows the
eastern bank of Brushy Creek along a prominent westward-sweeping meander of the
streambed. The western bank of Brushy Creek in this area is a steep bluff (Figure 6), and the
eastern bank is bounded by a prominent gravel bar. Backhoe trenching conducted in this area
revealed deep alluvial sediments overlying gravel deposits (probably associated with the gravel
bar observed along the stream bank). Due to the steep bluffs on the western side of the stream,
any overbank flooding would result in deposition of alluvial sediments on the broad floodplain
formed by the westward sweep of the streambed, a landform that extends eastwards as much
as 250 m east to the base of the second terrace. Geomorphologically, alluvial sediments in this
area are relatively deep and constitute the first terrace of the stream.
BT 16 was excavated in a levee-like landform at the edge of the first terrace. At a depth
of 140 cmbs, very near the base of alluvial sediments observed in the trench, the remains of
what appeared to be the head and shoulder area of a bovid were identified (Figure 7), including
skull and mandible fragments, a horn core, and numerous flat and cylindrical fragments possibly
from the scapulae and/or front leg longbones. While the remains were compressed and
fragmented due to the heavy bulk of overlying sediment, most of the skeletal elements of the
head and shoulders area appeared to be represented, suggesting that the skeleton was largely
articulated. Stratigraphically, sediments in BT 16 consisted of thick, relatively undifferentiated
deposits of very dark grayish-brown clay loam with inclusions of a few limestone gravels to a
depth of 120 cmbs underlain by grayish-brown silty clay loam with abundant calcium carbonate

filaments and a few limestone gravels from 120 to 165 cmbs. The transition between these
2 strata was gradual, and no stratigraphic unconformities were noted that may have suggested
the presence old stabilized land surfaces. Below 165 cmbs was a dense deposit of limestone
gravels that appears to correspond to the gravel bar noted along the Brushy Creek stream bank.
Thus, while the skeletal remains were clearly lying on a horizontal surface, the land surface
present at the time of the animal’s death was not stratigraphically observable, suggesting that
overbank sediments may have accumulated relatively rapidly. No cultural materials, such as
lithic debitage, chipped stone tools, burned rock, or cultural features, were observed in BT 16.
Initially, despite the lack of artifacts or cultural features that may have indicated a cultural
association for the find, the skeletal remains found in BT 16 were investigated as a possible
archeological phenomena. The logic underlying this strategy derived from the known
geomorphology and cultural association of deep alluvial sediments at site 41WM964, the
Krienke Site, investigated by Horizon in 2001 (Brownlow 2001). At the Krienke Site, 2 backhoe
trenches each revealed intact burned rock features, both of which were described as stone-lined
basin hearths, buried in alluvial sediments at depths of 70 to 100 cmbs and 180 to 200 cmbs. A
charcoal sample collected from the more deeply buried feature produced an uncorrected
radiocarbon age of 1040±60 B.P. (Beta-145889) (Brownlow 2001:20). Calibrated to 2-Sigma,
the charcoal sample dated between A.D. 890 and 1060 and A.D. 1080 to 1150, suggesting a
Late Prehistoric utilization of the pit feature. The discovery of a Late Prehistoric feature at such
great depth on the Krienke Site was notable, and the depth at which the bovid remains were
observed in BT 16 during the current survey (ca. 140 to 150 cmbs) appeared to correlate with

34

060258_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

the depth of the Krienke Site hearth features. At the time, there was no a priori reason to
assume the sedimentation processes in the vicinity of BT 16, located 1.8 km (1.1 mi) north of
the Krienke Site, were comparable; however, bison are known to have been present in Central
Texas during the Late Prehistoric period, so the decision was made to err on the side of caution
in the absence of an on-site faunal specialist who could determine the species of the remains.
Two additional backhoe trenches (BTs 27 and 28) were excavated in the immediate
vicinity in an attempt to find some evidence of aboriginal cultural activity associated with the
bovid remains. BT 16 had been excavated along an approximately east-to-west orientation in a
levee-like landform paralleling Brushy Creek. BT 28 was excavated off the eastern end of
BT 16 at a right angle, extending perpendicular to the stream course, and BT 27 was excavated
5 m east of and parallel to BT 27 (i.e., also oriented north to south). BTs 27 and 28 revealed
deep alluvial deposits extending to depths of 130 to 230 cmbs, though the stratigraphy of these
2 trenches showed more clearly defined soil zones that likely represent multiple episodes of
overbank flooding. No cultural resources were observed in either of these 2 trenches, nor were
any additional bovid bones uncovered.
In fact, no cultural resources were encountered anywhere on the first terrace within the
broad, western meander of Brushy Creek in this portion of the project area. The nearest
archeological site, 41WM1164, extends along the base of the second terrace about 150 m east
of this locality, which suggests that the landform that is now the second terrace was probably
the first terrace in aboriginal times. In any case, the lack of archeological evidence at Locality 1
suggested that the bovid remains were natural in origin rather than the result of aboriginal
resource procurement activities. To confirm this hypothesis, a sample of the bovid remains,
including skeletal elements with diagnostic traits, teeth, and a horn core, were collected for
examination by a zooarcheologist. Following completion of the field survey, Dr. Jason M.
Wiersema, a biological anthropologist trained as a zooarcheologist and currently working as a
Forensic Anthropology Investigator in the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office, examined
the skeletal remains on January 6, 2006. Dr. Wiersema identified the remains as deriving from
a domesticated cow rather than from a bison or other large herbivore that would have been
economically significant to the aboriginal inhabitants of the area.
Based on the lack of cultural materials, such as artifacts and features, the absence of
paleosols, and the high degree of articulation and preservation of the skeletal elements, this find
was downgraded to a non-archeological locality (Locality 1) of essentially modern origin. It is
reported upon here largely in the interest of documenting the rapid sedimentation that this
segment of Brushy Creek appears to have experienced in the recent past.

5.3

SITE 41WM1163

Site 41WM1163 is a low-density surface scatter of aboriginal artifacts at the edge of an
agricultural field on the broad western terrace of Brushy Creek (Figure 8). Based on the
distribution of artifacts observed on the modern ground surface, the site extends from a private
driveway that provides access to the Krienke family property northwards to CR 272. The rightof-way of CR 272, which parallels the approximately north-northwest-to-south-southeastoriented course of Brushy Creek in this area, forms the arbitrary eastern boundary of the site.

Just south of the confluence of Brushy and Block House creeks, CR 272 turns sharply westsouthwestward, effectively forming the northern as well as the eastern site boundaries. North of
CR 272, stream activity has washed most of the Holocene-age sediments away, and exposures
of limestone bedrock crop out on the modern ground surface in the area. No cultural resources
were observed between CR 272 and the confluence of Brushy and Block House creeks, so
CR 272 appears to form a reliable northern boundary for the site. The area lying between
CR 272 and Brushy Creek to the east was not investigated, and it is unknown whether or not
the site continues to the east. No cultural resources were observed in backhoe trenches
excavated south of the private driveway that forms the southern boundary of the site. The
western boundary of the site was not delineated, though a quick surface inspection revealed
that the artifact scatter does, in fact, continue an undetermined distance to the west. The
western site boundary has been arbitrarily established as being coterminous with a two-track
farm road that runs along the edge of the property
Thus, as currently delineated, site 41WM1163 measures approximately 500 m in length
north-northwest to south-southeast along the axis of the project area by 40 to 80 m eastnortheast to west-southwest in width (see Figure 8). A line of deciduous hardwood trees
borders the fenceline that marks the boundary between the agricultural field and CR 272 on the
eastern side of the site, and a small forested area cuts across the approximate site center, but
the documented site area lies almost entirely within an agricultural field that does not appear to
have been actively cultivated in the recent past (Figures 9 to 11). Brushy Creek flows
southward at a distance of 75 to 125 m east of the site, with the closest approaches to the creek
located at the north and south ends of the documented site area. Topographically, the site is
relatively level, ranging in elevation from approximately 245 to 246 m (805 to 810 ft) amsl.
Artifacts observed on the surface include lithic debitage, a contracting-stemmed dart
point fragment, the mid-section of a late-stage bifacial tool, a late-stage biface that appears to
be an abandoned projectile point preform with a partially fashioned stem element, and several
large fragments of burned rock (Figures 12 and 13). At least 1 biface-thinning flake was among
the lithic debitage observed on the site, though most flakes were undiagnostic primary and
secondary flakes and angular debris. Only 1 potentially diagnostic artifact, a contractingstemmed dart point fragment, was found on the site. This artifact was observed in the two-track
road beyond the edge of the APE. While this implement exhibited morphological characteristics
that could variously be termed “Bulverde-like” or “Wells-like,” it was not possible, in the end, to
confidently assign the specimen to a taxonomic category. Surface artifact densities are
relatively low across the investigated site area (ca. 1 artifact per 25 m2), though densities
appeared to be somewhat higher within the two-track road that runs along the arbitrary western
edge of the site (ca. 1 artifact per 10 m2).
A total of 6 shovel tests (STs JW-8 to 11 and MM-1 and 2) and 6 backhoe trenches
(BTs 9 to 14) were excavated on site 41WM1163 (see Figures 2 and 8). Shovel tests
encountered relatively uniform dark brown to black silty clay loam sediments to the bottom of
the shovel tests at depths ranging from 60 to 90 cmbs. While shovel tests did not necessarily
penetrate to the bottom of Holocene-aged sediments with a potential to contain cultural
resources, the density of limestone gravels and calcium carbonate filaments and nodules was

observed to increase with depth, suggesting that near-surface sediments are relatively old and
have been stabilized for a sufficiently long period of time to undergo some degree of
pedogenetic development. Based on backhoe trench profiles, the maximum depth of Holoceneage sediments would appear to be on the order of 90 to 120 cmbs, at which depths dense
limestone gravels with relatively little sediment matrix were encountered (Figure 14). One
trench, BT 11, revealed lenses of alluvial sediments extending to a depth of up to 250 cmbs,
though this seems to be the exception rather than the rule and may simply represent a localized
unconformity. No artifacts or culturally modified ecofacts, cultural features, or stratigraphic
anomalies suggestive of past cultural activities were observed in any of the shovel tests or
backhoe trenches.
Site 41WM1163 consists of a low-density lithic scatter situated on the surface of what
appears to be a relatively old stream terrace remnant west of Brushy Creek. Site delineation
was confined largely to the APE, though the northern and southern boundaries appear to be
reliable, demarcating a ca. 500-m-long site within the project area. The site may extend
eastward beyond CR 272 toward Brushy Creek, and the surface artifact scatter does, in fact,
appear to continue an undetermined distance to the west, though the documented site width
ranges from only 40 to 80 m. A variety of artifacts, including lithic manufacturing debris, 2 latestage biface fragments (1 of which may be an abandoned dart point preform exhibiting some
suggestion of a partial stem element), and several fragments of burned rock, were observed on
the modern ground surface of the fallow agricultural field in which the site is situated. All
chipped stone materials were manufactured from relatively high-grade, chalky-white to bluishwhite varieties of Edwards chert. Some of the backhoe trenches excavated on the site hinted at
the presence of a plowzone in the upper 30 cm or so, though the transition to underlying strata
was gradual, suggesting that the field has not been under active cultivation in some time.
Cultural materials are limited to the modern ground surface of the investigated area of
site 41WM1163—no buried archeological deposits were observed in any of 12 subsurface
probes excavated on the site. While the variety of artifact types observed on the site suggests
that this was probably the location of an aboriginal campsite, the lack of diagnostic artifacts
precludes pinpointing the age or cultural affiliation of the aboriginal occupation (aside from a
possible Archaic association suggested by the presence of an unidentified, contractingstemmed dart point). Furthermore, all observed cultural materials are restricted to the modern
ground surface of a plowed field and lack integrity. The presence of burned rock suggests that
cultural features, such as hearths or roasting ovens, once may have been present on the site,
but any such features appear to have been disturbed by prior agricultural activities and are no
longer intact. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack of organic remains,
and lack of integrity resulting from prior disturbances to the site, the investigated area of site
41WM1163 does not appear to possess significant potential to contribute to an enhanced
understanding of the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not
possess characteristics warranting eligibility under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. While
undocumented areas of site 41WM1163 may be present east and west of the current project
area, the investigated portion of the site is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41WM1163
in connection with the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project.

5.4

SITE 41WM1164

Site 41WM1164 is a low-density lithic artifact scatter situated along the base of the
neighboring limestone uplands at the proximal edge of the broad first terrace of the Brushy
Creek floodplain (Figure 15). The lithic artifact scatter is confined largely to the modern ground
surface, though 2 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site yielded fragments of burned rock in
shallow Holocene sediments 10 to 30 cm deep. Most of the observed cultural materials are
distributed along a two-track road that passes through a cleared corridor through the opencanopy forest in this area (Figures 16 and 17). To the east, the landscape rises slightly onto
limestone uplands with ubiquitous outcrops of limestone bedrock on the modern ground surface,
and the broad terrace of Brushy Creek extends westward to a broad, western meander of the
stream channel. While the terrace sediments to the west are of alluvial origin, they may have
been deposited as a result of overbank flooding in the relatively recent past (see discussion of
Locality 1 above). While the two-track road in which most of the cultural materials were
observed is mostly level, the site and road meander along the approximate alignment of the
250-m (820-ft) elevation contour, and the landscape exhibits a gentle slope down towards the
southwest.
The site is situated in a moderately dense, open-canopy forest of deciduous hardwood
trees, though the path of the two-track road along which most of the artifacts were observed
passes through a corridor that has been cleared of trees. While much of the modern ground
surface is covered in forest floor detritus, underbrush, and various grasses and shrubs,
limestone bedrock crops out in many areas with minimal vegetation cover. Ground surface
visibility was correspondingly poor (less than 25%) across most of the site but ranged up to
80+% in some areas. Site boundaries were fully delineated based on the distribution of artifacts
observed on the modern ground surface, demarcating a site measuring about 500 m northwest
to southeast by 25 to 50 m northeast to southwest (see Figure 15).
Artifacts observed on the modern ground surface included chipped stone manufacturing
debris, consisting primarily of primary and secondary flakes and angular debris (though at least
1 biface-thinning flake was observed), 3 edge-modified flake tools, and occasional burned rocks
(Figures 18 and 19). Artifact densities on the modern ground surface were quite low across
most of the site (ca. 1 artifact per 50 to 100 m2), though 3 or 4 small areas with markedly higher
densities of artifacts (ca. 1 artifact per 10 to 25 m2) were observed. These higher-density areas
may represent the remains of aboriginal activity areas, though no intact cultural features, formal
tools, or diagnostic artifacts were observed anywhere on the site that may serve to pinpoint the
specific nature of aboriginal activity.
A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on the site (STs JW-7, JW-12 to 15, and MM-4),
2 of which produced burned rocks from depths ranging from 10 to 30 cmbs (STs JW-12 and
MM-4). Shovel testing across the site revealed thin Holocene-age sediments consisting of 10 to
30 cm of black to very dark brown silty clay loam overlying indurated, fractured limestone and
marl bedrock and solid limestone bedrock. No backhoe trenches were excavated on the site
due to the shallow soils and predominantly upland geomorphological context.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

All chipped stone materials observed on site 41WM1164 were manufactured from
relatively high-grade, chalky-white to bluish-white varieties of Edwards chert. Edwards chert
likely crops out locally in the general vicinity of the site, though no raw material sources were
specifically observed on the site and lithic cores and primary decortication flakes were not
observed among the chipped stone debris. Thus, this would not appear to represent a raw
material lithic procurement site (i.e., “quarry”), but rather an ephemeral aboriginal campsite
consisting of a series of smaller campsites spread across the base of the neighboring uplands.
The lush environs of the Brushy Creek bottomlands and stream likely provided abundant
subsistence resources, though it is possible that the modern structure of the floodplain is not
currently the same as it would have been prehistorically.
Only a very small fraction of the southwestern corner of site 41WM1164 extends into the
current project area where a two-track road that runs along the eastern bank of Brushy Creek,
providing access to this area from CR 272 to the south, turns to the west (see Figure 15). In
this vicinity, a small scatter of burned rock and lithic debitage is visible on the modern ground
surface, and a shovel test (ST JW-7) and a nearby backhoe trench (BT 15) were excavated in
this area. While Holocene sediments are deeper in this area (ca. 50 cmbs) due, undoubtedly, to
the proximity of Brushy Creek immediately to the south, the shovel test and nearby backhoe
trench failed to produce any evidence of subsurface archeological deposits.
Site 41WM1164 consists of a low-density lithic scatter situated along the interface of the
limestone uplands on the eastern side of the Brushy Creek floodplain and the broad first terrace
of Brushy Creek. Cultural materials are restricted largely to the modern ground surface, and
Holocene-age sediments are either lacking or measure no more than 10 to 30 cm in depth
across the majority of the site area. Only 1 small portion of the site, the part situated within the
current project area’s APE, had deeper Holocene sediments (measuring up to 50 cm in depth).
A limited variety of artifacts, including lithic manufacturing debris, 3 edge-modified flake tools,
and several fragments of burned rock, were observed on the site. Artifact densities are very low
across most of the site, though 3 or 4 small areas with higher densities were identified. These
areas may represent the remains or aboriginal activity areas, but no cultural features were
observed in any of the higher-density areas.
While the variety of artifact types observed on the site suggests that this was probably
the location of an aboriginal campsite or series of campsites, the lack of diagnostic artifacts
precludes pinpointing the age of the aboriginal occupation. The presence of burned rock
suggests that cultural features, such as hearths or roasting ovens, once may have been
present, but any such features appear to have been destroyed as a function of the extensive
surface erosion that has transpired on the site, exposing native limestone bedrock in many
areas. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack of organic remains, and lack
of integrity resulting from prior erosion on the site, site 41WM1164 does not appear to possess
significant potential to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not possess characteristics warranting eligibility
under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The site is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site
41WM1164 in connection with the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project.

SITE 41WM1165

Site 41WM1165 is a multiple component aboriginal campsite and historic-age
campground or picnic site situated on the western terraces of Brushy Creek at the northern end
of the Phase 1 North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area (Figure 20). The
aboriginal occupation is the main component on the site and consists of a lithic artifact and
burned rock scatter, as well as a possibly intact burned rock feature, exposed on the modern
ground surface and buried in alluvial sediments up to 100 cmbs. The historic-age component is
restricted to the southern end of the site and consists of a picnic table constructed of limestone
slabs and concrete, a well constructed of dry-laid limestone slabs, and a pump house.
The boundaries of the site were delineated only within the construction easement,
including the original alignment as well as a reroute designed to avoid buried archeological
deposits present near the eastern boundary of the site adjacent to Brushy Creek. Brushy Creek
flows southwards along the eastern edge of the site and forms the natural eastern site
boundary. The northern boundary has been arbitrarily defined as the fenceline that marks the
City of Cedar Park’s municipal boundary and the northern terminus of the current project area,
though a similar archeological site, 41WM1162, was recorded immediately north of this fence by
SWCA during a cultural resource survey of Phase 2 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor
Extension Project that undoubtedly represents the northern end of site 41WM1165 (Wilcox
2007). The southern extent of aboriginal cultural resources on site 41WM1165 occurs in BT 24,
the southernmost culture-bearing subsurface probe excavated on the site, though the southern
boundary has been extended to include the historic objects that constitute the historic-age
component. The western boundary of the site is coextensive with the edge of a large disturbed
area that runs along the edge of the proposed reroute easement on the second terrace of
Brushy Creek (see Figure 20). Thus, the eastern, southern, and western boundaries have been
reliably delineated by Brushy Creek and the distribution of cultural materials in surface and
subsurface contexts. The northern boundary has been defined arbitrarily as the northern
terminus of the current project area, though the documented boundaries of site 41WM1162,
which effectively constitutes the north end of site 41WM1165, indicate that cultural materials
extend 75 m north of the Cedar Park municipal boundary (Wilcox 2007). As defined within
Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project, site 41WM1165 measures
approximately 200 m north to south by 30 to 60 m east to west.
The site is situated on the first and second terraces on the western bank of Brushy
Creek; in fact, Brushy Creek effectively defines the eastern boundary of the APE in this area
and provides a natural eastern boundary for the site. A moderately thick forest of oak, cedar,
and other deciduous hardwood trees lines the stream bank of Brushy Creek, and the adjacent
landscape consists of an extensive pasture that has been largely cleared of vegetation except
for short pasture grasses (Figures 21 and 22). Immediately west of the site is a series of large
earthen berms constructed by the landowner that are used to burn brush (Figure 23). Most of
the documented site area lies within the pasture, and the landscape across the site is relatively
flat, especially within the proposed reroute easement atop the second terrace (Figures 24
and 25). Elevations on the site range from approximately 247 to 253 m (810 to 830 ft) amsl,
with an average elevation of about 250 m (820 ft) amsl.

Figure 25. Northern Portion of Site 41WM1165 in Reroute (BT 35 at Left) (Facing NE)
The aboriginal component is the primary cultural component on site 41WM1165.
Aboriginal cultural materials are exposed on the modern ground surface across the northern half
of the documented site area, extending from the City of Cedar Park’s municipal boundary
fenceline at the northern end of the site (i.e., at the northern end of the project area) southwards
roughly to the point at which the proposed pipeline alignment bends slightly toward the
southwest (i.e., in the vicinity of BTs 25 and 26 along the original route and BT 33 along the
reroute). Artifacts observed on the surface in this area include a few pieces of lithic debitage,
2 chipped stone tools (including 1 edge-modified flake tool and the medial segment of a large,
late-stage biface), and burned rock. Chipped stone materials were manufactured from relatively
high-grade, chalky-white, bluish-white, and light gray varieties of Edwards chert. The density of
surface artifacts, primarily burned rock, is relatively high in this northern area, ranging from ca.
1 artifact per 25 m2 along the fenceline marking the arbitrary northern site boundary to 1 artifact
per 5 to 10 m2 in the vicinity of BTs 33 to 37. While cultural materials are exposed on the
modern ground surface in the northern portion of the site, they become progressively more
deeply buried toward the southern end of the site and eastward toward Brushy Creek. On the
second terrace (i.e., in the vicinity of BTs 34 to 37), cultural material is primarily surficial, with
disturbed, buried cultural materials extending to depths of only 10 to 22 cmbs. Along the first
terrace of Brushy Creek (i.e., in BTs 25 and 26), the aboriginal occupation zone occurs from
30 to 45 cmbs. Near the southern end of the site on the first terrace (i.e., in BT 24), cultural
materials occur in a subsurface zone situated 70 to 100 cmbs. Thus, cultural deposits are
somewhat deeper along the edge of Brushy Creek on the first terrace than farther upslope on
the second terrace.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

A total of 12 subsurface probes were excavated on site 41WM1165, including 3 shovel
tests and 9 backhoe trenches. ST RC-1, excavated in the northern portion of the site that
contains the artifact scatter on the modern ground surface along the original proposed pipeline
right-of-way, revealed dark grayish-brown clay loam with limestone gravel inclusions that
increased in density proportionately with depth. Three burned rocks were observed in the upper
30 cm. An additional small burned rock was encountered between 30 and 60 cmbs in ST RC-1,
though its provenance is uncertain and it may have fallen from higher up in the profile.
Near the edge of the first terrace overlooking Brushy Creek, a buried, aboriginal
occupation zone was encountered from 30 to 45 cmbs in 2 adjacent backhoe trenches (BTs 25
and 26) (Figures 26 to 29). BT 25 was excavated first, revealing relatively deep alluvial
sediments consisting of very dark brown silty clay loam transitioning to dark grayish-brown
loamy clay and clay extending to a depth of 210 cmbs, below which a dense deposit of
limestone gravels extends to a depth of 300 cmbs (Figure 28; Appendix A). Several large
burned rocks were observed in the backfill pile, deposited by a bucket of sediments just
excavated from an approximate depth of 30 to 45 cmbs. As these burned rocks appeared to
have been excavated from a relatively discrete area, excavation of BT 25 was temporarily
abandoned, the backhoe boom was rotated about 30 degrees clockwise, and BT 26 was
excavated to determine if additional cultural materials were present at comparable depths. To
preserve the structure of the possible cultural feature, mechanical excavations in BT 26 were
suspended when a semicircular arrangement of burned rocks was encountered at a depth of
roughly 30 cmbs in the approximate center of the trench, apparently extending into the northern
trench wall (Figure 29). Hand tools, including shovels and trowels, were used to carefully
expose the upper portion of the semicircular arrangement of burned rocks. The tops of 7 large
burned rocks were exposed in a semicircular pattern measuring about 1 m in diameter and
extending into the northern wall of the trench. Designated as Feature 1, approximately one-half
of the feature appeared to be present in BT 26, and the burned rocks previously excavated from
a comparable depth and location in BT 25 presumably formed the other end of this feature.
While the sediment matrix surrounding this feature contained some limestone gravels, the rocks
forming the edges of this feature were somewhat larger and exhibited clear evidence of burning,
and the matrix within the feature was of a darker, loamier consistency than the surrounding
sediment. In addition, several large lithic flakes of grayish Edwards chert were found within the
matrix of the feature lying flat on what was presumably the land surface at the time this feature
was constructed.
Based on the limited available information, Feature 1 appears to be intact, though the
feature was not completely exposed during the survey. BTs 25 and 26, the trenches in which
Feature 1 was encountered, were excavated about 1 hour before dark on the last day of the
initial survey fieldwork, and very little time was available to investigate the feature. Feature 1
appears to be an aboriginal burned rock feature, possibly a hearth, consisting of a circular
arrangement of burned rocks and lithic debitage. No charcoal or other organic remains were
observed in the matrix of the feature, though the decision was made to not excavate any
additional feature matrix due to the limited time available to perform the task properly. Thus, the
top of Feature 1 was exposed in BT 26, and burned rocks from the adjoining trench, BT 25,

were recovered from depths of 30 to 45 cmbs, suggesting that the occupation zone in this part
of the site is on the order of 15 cm thick.
Following the partial delineation of Feature 1, excavations were continued in BT 25 and
in the far western end of BT 26 to determine the structure of alluvial sediments underlying the
occupation zone containing the feature (the feature itself was left in place and reburied intact).
Alluvial sediments continued in these trenches to a depth of 210 cmbs, below which dense
limestone gravels extended to the bottom of the trenches at ca. 300 cmbs.
A third backhoe trench, BT 24, was excavated in the southern portion of the site,
revealing very dark brown clay loam sediments from 0 to 60 cmbs grading into dark brown clay
loam from 60 to 115 cmbs (Figure 30). Deeper sediments consisted of pale gray silt loam from
115 to 170 cmbs underlain by a dense deposit of limestone gravels extending to a depth of
260 cmbs. Limestone gravels were relatively common throughout the profile. Several burned
rocks were observed in backfill and in the trench wall profile extending from depths of
approximately 70 to 100 cmbs, correlating with the middle portion of the dark brown clay loam
layer that extends from 60 to 115 cmbs (Figure 31). One shovel test excavated nearby, ST RC2, also produced a few burned rocks from depths of 20 to 70 cmbs, probably from the same
cultural lens as that detected in BT 24.
The proposed reroute of the northern end of the pipeline was designed to avoid buried
deposits encountered on the first terrace in BTs 24 to 26 that were determined by the THC to be
of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs based on the
results of the initial survey as presented in an earlier draft of this report. In the interest of
avoiding impacts to buried archeological deposits adjacent to Brushy Creek, CBD designed a
reroute that would shift the pipeline alignment from 28 to 47 m (92 to 153 ft) northwestwards of
the previously surveyed route. The proposed reroute would move the alignment up onto the
second terrace of Brushy Creek, an area anticipated to contain shallower Holocene-age alluvial
sediments and a lower potential to contain deeply buried archeological deposits. The survey of
the proposed reroute revealed that cultural materials are exposed primarily on the modern
ground surface, though shallow subsurface deposits extending to depths of up to 22 cmbs were
encountered in backhoe trenches. Geomorphologically, the very dark brown silty clay loam A
horizon observed elsewhere in the vicinity was absent, and surface sediments consisted of a
gravelly, dark brown clay loam that contains the cultural horizon. Underlying sediments
consisted of old alluvial sediments that grew gradually finer with increasing depth, ranging from
brown clay loam and silty clay loam immediately underneath the cultural horizon to very light
brown and yellowish-brown clay at the bottom of the trenches. Burned rock was the most
common type of artifact observed in this area, though none of the burned rock exhibited any
apparent structure or patterning. Furthermore, the area atop the second terrace appears to
have experienced some degree of prior disturbance from surface stripping, as evidenced by the
large earthen berms in the area immediately west of the site that had been constructed by the
landowner for brush burning.
Allowing for slight color differences of sediments resulting from the relative depths at
which cultural materials were found across site 41WM1165, the aboriginal occupation zone on
this site appears to be situated within a dark brown to dark grayish-brown silty clay loam stratum

that extends across the site. In most areas of the site (primarily on the first terrace), and in
areas south of the site, the dark brown silty clay loam stratum was found to underlie a welldeveloped A horizon composed of very dark brown clay loam, though the A horizon had been
removed from much of the pasture area atop the second terrace. At the northern end of the
site, cultural materials were observed from the modern ground surface to depths up to 22 cmbs
on the second terrace to 30 cmbs on the first terrace. Moving southwards, the cultural zone
appears to be situated at depths of ca. 30 to 45 cmbs, while near the southern end of the site
the occupation horizon is buried at depths of 70 to 100 cmbs. While it is conceivable that more
than 1 aboriginal component is reflected by the varying depths at which cultural deposits were
encountered, stratigraphic evidence seems to suggest that the materials derive from a single
component. In the latter case, it may be that the original landscape at the time of the aboriginal
settlement sloped down towards the south. Subsequent to the occupation, the fluvial structure
of Brushy Creek may have changed, washing away sediments from higher elevations to the
north, or the absence of a localized A horizon near the north end of the site may simply be a
function of recent land-stripping by the current landowner.
While the documented boundaries of site 41WM1165 are confined to the defined APE of
Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension Project, the overall project actually
extends northwards approximately 1.1 km (0.7 mi) from the Cedar Park Municipal boundary,
which defines the northern end of the current project area, to CR 179 (Wilcox 2007). This
northern portion of the overall pipeline, designated as Phase 2 of the North Brushy Interceptor
Extension Project, was surveyed for cultural resources by SWCA concurrently with Horizon’s
survey of the Phase 1 project area. SWCA documented 1 aboriginal archeological site,
41WM1162, immediately north of the Cedar Park municipal boundary that undoubtedly
represents the northern end of site 41WM1165. Site 41WM1162 was described as a sparse
scatter of aboriginal chipped stone lithic debitage and a multidirectional chert core found on the
modern ground surface within the fenced corridor that demarcated Phase 2 of the North Brushy
Creek Interceptor Extension Project (Wilcox 2007:11-12). Cultural materials were observed
primarily on the modern ground surface, though a single lithic flake was found at a depth of
35 cmbs in 1 of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. Due to the surficial character and
eroded context of the site, it was recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL and no
further archeological work was recommended.
As no backhoe trenches had been excavated on site 41WM1162 when it was initially
recorded, Horizon excavated 2 backhoe trenches (BTs 39 and 40) within the documented
boundaries of site 41WM1162 at the request of the THC and CBD to assess the potential for
deeply buried archeological deposits (Figure 32). BT 39 revealed a stratigraphic profile similar
to that observed on site 41WM1165 to the south, consisting of a surficial A horizon composed of
very dark brown clay loam underlain by a gravelly, dark brown clay loam. On portions of site
41WM1165, it was this dark brown clay loam underlying the A horizon that contained cultural
materials, though none were observed in BT 39.
Underlying sediments consisted of
increasingly fine alluvial material that culminated in massively structured clay at the bottom of
the trench. BT 40 consisted of mature, well-developed clay sediments from the top to the
bottom of the trench profile (see Appendix A for backhoe trench data). Cultural materials,

including burned rock and chipped stone debitage, were observed on the modern ground
surface of site 41WM1162, but no cultural materials were found in subsurface contexts. Horizon
concurs with Wilcox’s (2007) recommendation that site 41WM1162 is ineligible for designation
as an SAL.
This historic-age component on site 41WM1165 consists of several historic-age objects
located near the southern site boundary, including a picnic table, a well, and a pump house.
The picnic table is constructed of limestone slabs and concrete and exhibits an engraving that
reads “April 1956” near the end of one of the benches (Figures 33 and 34). Numerous cedar
saplings have sprung up around the picnic table, suggesting that it has not been used in some
time. Located approximately 5 m (16 ft) northwest of the picnic table, the well consists of a 0.6m- (2-ft-) high, partially collapsed rim of cut limestone slabs measuring slightly less than 1.0 m
(3.3 ft) in diameter (Figure 35). Between 5 and 7 courses of dry-fitted limestone slabs are
evident aboveground. Finally, a small building is located about 10 m (33 ft) northwest of the
well (Figure 36). The building is quite small, measuring only about 1.5 m (5.0 ft) on each side,
and is collapsing in an advanced state of disrepair. While the function of the building is not
definitively known, it is suspected to be a pump house, probably associated with the nearby
well. No historic-age artifacts were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the
subsurface probes excavated in the southern portion of the site near the historic objects. The
constellation of historic objects observed on site 41WM1165 would appear to represent the
remains of a historic-age campsite or picnicking facility in a park area constructed ca. 1956.
Site 41WM1165 is a multiple component aboriginal campsite and historic-age
campground or picnic site situated on the western terraces of Brushy Creek at the northern end
of the Phase 1 North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area. The aboriginal
occupation is the main component on the site and consists of lithic artifact scatter, including
lithic debitage, chipped stone tools (including 1 edge-modified flake tool and the medial segment
of a large, late-stage biface), and burned rock extending from the modern ground surface to a
maximum depth of about 100 cmbs. Aboriginal cultural materials are exposed on the modern
ground surface in the northern portion of the site and become progressively more deeply buried
toward the southern end of the site and eastwards toward Brushy Creek. The first terrace of
Brushy Creek, on which the original proposed pipeline route was aligned, contains more deeply
buried cultural deposits. In the vicinity of 2 backhoe trenches excavated on the first terrace
overlooking the creek, the cultural zone appears to be ca. 30 to 45 cmbs, and a buried burned
rock feature (Feature 1) was observed that appears to be largely intact. Near the southern end
of the site, also on the first terrace, burned rock was detected in a cultural zone approximately
70 to 100 cmbs. Farther northwest on the second terrace, on which the proposed pipeline
reroute easement is aligned, cultural materials are largely restricted to the modern ground
surface, though disturbed deposits extending up to 22 cmbs are present.
As no diagnostic artifacts were observed, the approximate date and cultural affiliation of
the aboriginal occupation cannot be assessed at this time. The density of artifacts exposed on
the modern ground surface is relatively high. The site contains buried archeological deposits as
well as a possibly intact, buried burned rock feature (possibly a hearth) on the first terrace of
Brushy Creek, though the second terrace is largely deflated, with cultural materials exposed on

the surface in a disturbed, erosional context. Based on the information available from surveylevel investigations, the buried cultural materials on the first terrace of Brushy Creek appear to
retain at least some degree of integrity and may have the potential to yield significant data about
the prehistoric past pursuant to Criterion D of the NRHP. The portion of the aboriginal
component situated on the first terrace of Brushy Creek on site 41WM1165 was recommended
as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL in an
earlier draft of this report, and the THC concurred with this eligibility assessment. In the interest
of rerouting the proposed pipeline around these buried deposits of unknown eligibility, CBD
shifted the proposed alignment northwest on top of the second terrace of the creek. Cultural
materials on the second terrace are restricted to surface and near-surface contexts and do not
appear to retain sufficient integrity to warrant further study. No organic materials, such as
burned macrobotanical remains or faunal bone, were observed on the site, and no diagnostic
artifacts that might serve to illumine the cultural and chronological affiliation of the aboriginal
occupation were found. The portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the proposed reroute on
the second terrace of Brushy Creek does not appear to have the potential to yield significant
data about the aboriginal past pursuant to Criterion D and does not possess characteristics that
warrant consideration under Criteria A, B, or C of the of the NRHP. As such, the portion of the
site within the proposed reroute easement is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL. It is Horizon’s opinion that construction of the proposed
pipeline within the rerouted easement will not impact any significant cultural resources.
The historic-age component on site 41WM1165 is restricted to the southern end of the
site and consists of a picnic table constructed of limestone slabs and concrete, a well
constructed of limestone slabs, and a pump house. No associated historic-age cultural
materials were observed. These historic-age objects appear to constitute a camp site or
picnicking facility, and an engraving that reads “April 1956” in the concrete of one of the picnic
table benches indicates a mid-20th century date of construction. Based on the lack of
archeological deposits, the historic-age component on site 41WM1165 would appear to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D, though insufficient data are currently
available to evaluate the significance of the site under Criteria A, B, or D. The proposed reroute
of the pipeline shifts the alignment more than 46 m (150 ft) northwest of the historic objects on
site 41WM1165, and installation of the proposed pipeline within the reroute would avoid any
impacts to the historic objects situated at the south end of site 41WM1165.
Horizon recommends that construction be cleared to proceed within the proposed
pipeline reroute. The portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the proposed reroute is
recommended an ineligible for inclusion the NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and
construction within the rerouted easement would not result in any adverse effects to significant
cultural resources. Furthermore, construction within the rerouted alignment would avoid any
impacts to aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources located immediately adjacent to Brushy
Creek that are of unknown eligibility for inclusion the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
Provided that construction within the rerouted alignment proves to be a feasible option, no
further archeological investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objectives are, first, to locate and delineate site boundaries with the project’s APE and, second,
to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance
of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Thus, adequate information on
site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate,
historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions
vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and
chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the
inventory process.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the
criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The

HJN 060258 AR

63

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and
related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (36 CFR
§60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:

64

060258_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
structure as an SAL if it (1) is publicly or privately owned and listed on the NRHP and (2) meets
one of the following 6 eligibility criteria:
A. Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
B. Is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. Is important to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
D. Is the work of a significant architect, master builder, or craftsman;
E. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinctions; or
F. Has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to the understanding of
Texas culture or history.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new archeological sites (41WM1163,
41WM1164, and 41WM1165) and 1 non-archeological locality that was initially believed to be a
possible archeological site (Locality 1) (Table 2). The 3 archeological sites are aboriginal

campsites consisting of scatters of chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and burned rock. Two
sites (41WM1163 and 41WM1164) are confined to surface and/or near-surface contexts
whereas 1 of the sites (41WM1165) contains surficial as well as buried archeological deposits
and a buried burned rock feature that appears to be intact. The non-archeological locality
(Locality 1) consists of the remains of a buried bovid skeleton that was initially investigated as
an archeological site until it became apparent that the bovid remains were from a modern cow
rather than a prehistoric bison and that no artifacts or other evidence of cultural activity is
associated with the skeletal remains. No isolated occurrences of artifacts were encountered.
Site 41WM1163
Site 41WM1163 consists of a low-density lithic scatter situated on the surface of what
appears to be a relatively old stream terrace remnant west of Brushy Creek. Site delineation
was confined largely to the APE, though the northern and southern boundaries appear to be
reliable, demarcating a ca. 500-m-long site within the project area. The site may extend
eastwards beyond CR 272 toward Brushy Creek, and the surface artifact scatter does, in fact,
appear to continue an undetermined distance to the west, though the documented site width
ranges from only 40 to 80 m. A variety of artifacts, including lithic manufacturing debris, 2 latestage biface fragments (1 of which may be an abandoned dart point preform exhibiting some
suggestion of a partial stem element), and several fragments of burned rock, were observed on
the modern ground surface of the fallow agricultural field in which the site is situated. All
chipped stone materials were manufactured from relatively high-grade, chalky-white to bluishwhite varieties of Edwards chert. Some of the backhoe trenches excavated on the site hinted at
the presence of a plowzone in the upper 30 cm or so, though the transition to underlying strata
was gradual, suggesting that the field has not been under active cultivation in some time.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

Cultural materials are limited to the modern ground surface of the investigated area of
site 41WM1163—no buried archeological deposits were observed in any of 12 subsurface
probes excavated on the site. While the variety of artifact types observed on the site suggests
that this was probably the location of an aboriginal campsite, the lack of diagnostic artifacts
precludes pinpointing the age or cultural affiliation of the aboriginal occupation (aside from a
possible Archaic association suggested by the presence of an unidentified, contractingstemmed dart point). Furthermore, all observed cultural materials are restricted to the modern
ground surface of a plowed field and lack integrity. The presence of burned rock suggests that
cultural features, such as hearths or roasting ovens, once may have been present on the site,
but any such features appear to have been disturbed by prior agricultural activities and are no
longer intact. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack of organic remains,
and lack of integrity resulting from prior disturbances to the site, the investigated area of site
41WM1163 does not appear to possess significant potential to contribute to an enhanced
understanding of the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not
possess characteristics warranting eligibility under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. While
undocumented areas of site 41WM1163 may be present east and west of the current project
area, the investigated portion of the site is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site 41WM1163
in connection with the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project.
Site 41WM1164
Site 41WM1164 is a low-density lithic artifact scatter situated along the interface of the
limestone uplands on the eastern side of the Brushy Creek floodplain and the broad first terrace
of Brushy Creek. Cultural materials are restricted largely to the modern ground surface, and
Holocene-age sediments are either lacking or measure no more than 10 to 30 cm in depth
across the majority of the site area. Only 1 small portion of the site, the part situated within the
current project area’s APE, had deeper Holocene sediments (measuring up to 50 cm in depth).
A limited variety of artifacts, including lithic manufacturing debris, 3 edge-modified flake tools,
and several fragments of burned rock, were observed on the site. Artifact densities are very low
across most of the site, though 3 or 4 small areas with higher densities were identified. These
areas may represent the remains or aboriginal activity areas, but no cultural features were
observed in any of the higher-density areas.
While the variety of artifact types observed on the site suggests that this was probably
the location of an aboriginal campsite or series of campsites, the lack of diagnostic artifacts
precludes pinpointing the age of the aboriginal occupation. The presence of burned rock
suggests that cultural features, such as hearths or roasting ovens, once may have been
present, but any such features appear to have been destroyed as a function of the extensive
surface erosion that has transpired on the site, exposing native limestone bedrock in many
areas. Due to the surficial context, lack of diagnostic artifacts, lack of organic remains, and lack
of integrity resulting from prior erosion on the site, site 41WM1164 does not appear to possess
significant potential to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not possess characteristics warranting eligibility
under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. The site is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the

HJN 060258 AR

67

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further investigations are recommended on site
41WM1164 in connection with the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project.
Site 41WM1165
Site 41WM1165 is a multiple component aboriginal campsite and historic-age
campground or picnic site situated on the western terraces of Brushy Creek at the northern end
of the Phase 1 North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area. The aboriginal
occupation is the main component on the site and consists of lithic artifact scatter, including
lithic debitage, chipped stone tools (including 1 edge-modified flake tool and the medial segment
of a large, late-stage biface), and burned rock extending from the modern ground surface to a
maximum depth of about 100 cmbs. Aboriginal cultural materials are exposed on the modern
ground surface in the northern portion of the site and become progressively more deeply buried
toward the southern end of the site and eastwards toward Brushy Creek. The first terrace of
Brushy Creek, on which the original proposed pipeline route was aligned, contains more deeply
buried cultural deposits. In the vicinity of 2 backhoe trenches excavated on the first terrace
overlooking the creek, the cultural zone appears to be ca. 30 to 45 cmbs, and a buried burned
rock feature (Feature 1) was observed that appears to be largely intact. Near the southern end
of the site, also on the first terrace, burned rock was detected in a cultural zone approximately
70 to 100 cmbs. Farther northwest on the second terrace, on which the proposed pipeline
reroute easement is aligned, cultural materials are largely restricted to the modern ground
surface, though disturbed deposits extending up to 22 cmbs are present.
As no diagnostic artifacts were observed, the approximate date and cultural affiliation of
the aboriginal occupation cannot be assessed at this time. The density of artifacts exposed on
the modern ground surface is relatively high. The site contains buried archeological deposits as
well as a possibly intact, buried burned rock feature (possibly a hearth) on the first terrace of
Brushy Creek, though the second terrace is largely deflated, with cultural materials exposed on
the surface in a disturbed, erosional context. Based on the information available from surveylevel investigations, the buried cultural materials on the first terrace of Brushy Creek appear to
retain at least some degree of integrity and may have the potential to yield significant data about
the prehistoric past pursuant to Criterion D of the NRHP. The portion of the aboriginal
component situated on the first terrace of Brushy Creek on site 41WM1165 was recommended
as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL in an
earlier draft of this report, and the THC concurred with this eligibility assessment. In the interest
of rerouting the proposed pipeline around these buried deposits of unknown eligibility, CBD
shifted the proposed alignment to the northwest on top of the second terrace of the creek.
Cultural materials on the second terrace are restricted to surface and near-surface contexts and
do not appear to retain sufficient integrity to warrant further study. No organic materials, such
as burned macrobotanical remains or faunal bone, were observed on the site, and no diagnostic
artifacts that might serve to illumine the cultural and chronological affiliation of the aboriginal
occupation were found. The portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the proposed reroute on
the second terrace of Brushy Creek does not appear to have the potential to yield significant
data about the aboriginal past pursuant to Criterion D and does not possess characteristics that
warrant consideration under Criteria A, B, or C of the of the NRHP. As such, the portion of the

68

060258_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the
North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension, Phase 1, Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas

site within the proposed reroute easement is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL. It is Horizon’s opinion that construction of the proposed
pipeline within the rerouted easement will not impact any significant cultural resources.
The historic-age component on site 41WM1165 is restricted to the southern end of the
site and consists of a picnic table constructed of limestone slabs and concrete, a well
constructed of limestone slabs, and a pump house. No associated historic-age cultural
materials were observed. These historic-age objects appear to constitute a camp site or
picnicking facility, and an engraving that reads “April 1956” in the concrete of one of the picnic
table benches indicates a mid-20th century date of construction. Based on the lack of
archeological deposits, the historic-age component on site 41WM1165 would appear to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D, though insufficient data are currently
available to evaluate the significance of the site under Criteria A, B, or D. The proposed reroute
of the pipeline shifts the alignment more than 46 m (150 ft) northwest of the historic objects on
site 41WM1165, and installation of the proposed pipeline within the reroute would avoid any
impacts to the historic objects situated at the south end of site 41WM1165.

6.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The survey resulted in the documentation of 3 new archeological sites (41WM1163,
41WM1164, and 41WM1165) and 1 non-archeological locality that was initially believed to be a
possible archeological site (Locality 1). The non-archeological locality (Locality 1) consists of
the remains of a buried bovid skeleton that was initially investigated as an archeological site
until it became apparent that the bovid remains were from a modern cow rather than a
prehistoric bison and that no artifacts or other evidence of cultural activity is associated with the
skeletal remains. As a non-cultural locality, Locality 1 does not fall under the jurisdiction of the
NHPA or the Antiquities Code of Texas; it has been discussed in this report largely in the
interest of documenting the geomorphology of this segment of Brushy Creek.
The 3 archeological sites (41WM1163, 41WM1164, and 41WM1165) are aboriginal
campsites consisting of scatters of chipped stone tools, lithic debitage, and burned rock. The
investigated portions of sites 41WM1163 and 41WM1164 are recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. No further work is recommended on these
sites within the area surveyed for this project.
In an initial draft of this report, submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in
February 2007, Horizon recommended the portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the
originally proposed pipeline route as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL. In correspondence dated March 9, 2007, the THC concurred with
Horizon’s recommendations and determined that the investigated portion of site 41WM1165
would require archeological testing to assess its significance if impacts to the cultural deposits
found during the survey could not be avoided. At that time, the THC cleared the rest of the
proposed pipeline route so that construction could proceed south of Station Marker No. 77+00
located just south of the south end of site 41WM1165.

HJN 060258 AR

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

In the interest of avoiding impacts to any potentially significant archeological deposits on
site 41WM1165, CBD designed a 356-m- (1,168-ft-) long reroute intended to avoid the
previously surveyed 376-m- (1,233-ft-) long segment of the proposed pipeline alignment
containing the archeological deposits of unknown eligibility. The proposed reroute shifted the
pipeline alignment in the vicinity of site 41WM1165, which was located immediately adjacent to
the western streambank of Brushy Creek on the first terrace, to a new location on the second
terrace ranging from 28 to 47 m (92 to 153 ft) northwest of the previously surveyed route. The
proposed reroute diverged from the previous route at Station Marker No. 74+00 south of site
41WM1165 and reconnected with the northern terminus of the original route at Station Marker
No. 86+00, which is coincident with the municipal boundary of the City of Cedar Park.
Horizon recommends that construction be cleared to proceed within the proposed
pipeline reroute. The portion of site 41WM1165 situated within the proposed reroute is
recommended an ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and
construction within the rerouted easement would not result in any adverse effects to significant
cultural resources. Furthermore, construction within the rerouted alignment would avoid any
impacts to aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources located immediately adjacent to Brushy
Creek that are of unknown eligibility for inclusion the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
Provided that construction within the rerouted alignment proves to be a feasible option, no
further archeological investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking.
Based on the results of this survey, no undiscovered portions of any of the previously
recorded sites near the southern terminus of the project area (41WM234, 41WM235, 41WM236,
or 41WM964) extend into the current project area. No cultural resources were identified within
the APE near the southern end of the proposed line on the modern ground surface or in any of
8 backhoe trenches excavated along this segment.
Archeological clearance is recommended for the entirety of the proposed route (as
designed to include the reroute that avoids archeological deposits of unknown eligibility on site
41WM1165) of Phase 1 of the North Brushy Creek Interceptor Extension project area as defined
in this report. However, in the event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the project area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.
