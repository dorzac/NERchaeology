Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access and utility rightsof-way of the proposed TX 16596-B Bluegrove Road Cell Tower site in south-central Dallas
County, Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic
Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to
such an undertaking. The total area to be impacted is 2,500 square feet, in addition to a 20-foot
wide Access/Utility easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 1, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
Two individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to the successful
planning, organization, and completion of this project are Mr. Chris Baker, Section 106 Manager
at AARCHER, Inc., and Mr. Bill Martin, Federal Programs Reviewer at the Texas Historical
Commission’s Office of Historic Preservation.

In December 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or
within one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area

developed, and may have generally undisturbed soils.

Project Environment
Physiography
The Project Area lies within the Blackland Prairies Region of north central Texas. The Blackland
Prairies Region consists of nearly level to gently rolling topography, and covers approximately
11.5 million acres from Grayson and Red River Counties in northeast Texas to Bexar County in
the south-central region of the state. Elevations range from 300 to 800 feet above mean sea level.
Blackland soils that occur in the region are so named due to the uniform dark-colored calcareous
clay component of the typical mollisols. These soils are interspersed with gray acid sandy loams.
This highly fertile region has been widely used for agriculture, although use of the land for
ranching has become increasingly popular (Gould 1975; McMahon et al. 1984).
The area received the “Cross Timbers” name from travelers who traveled from west to east
through the area about as early as 1772. To both the east and west of this area was generally open
prairie, but the timbered area in between these prairies areas became known as the “Cross
Timbers”. Since then, microcosms of the region have been significantly changed by the
movement of people into towns and cities, and the fragmentation of once continuous habitat into
smaller land holdings.
More specifically, Lancaster, Texas is situated within an ecotone between the Cross Timbers
Ecological Region, and the Prairies (Gould et al. 1960; TPWD 2014). The topography varies
from gently rolling, to hilly, to deeply dissected. Rapid surface drainage is typical throughout the
region.
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the TX 16596-B Bluegrove Road Cell Tower is to be constructed in
Houston black clay (44), commonly found on 1 to 3 percent slopes in this area of Dallas County.
A typical soil pedon of Houston black clay consists of extremely hard, moderately alkaline and
calcareous very dark gray clay from 0-6 inches below the surface. Underlying that upper zone,
from about 6-38 inches below the surface is extremely hard, moderately alkaline and calcareous
black clay with common intersecting slickensides. From roughly 38-52 inches is extremely hard,
very dark gray clay exhibiting common intersecting slickensides, and few fine calcium carbonate
concretions. The subsoil from 52-70 inches is dark grayish brown clay with light olive brown
mottling. It is also extremely hard, and is moderately alkaline and calcareous (Coffee et al. 1980;
Websoil Survey Online 2014).

Cultural Chronology
Introduction
The TX 16596-B Bluegrove Road Cell Tower site is situated within the North-central Texas
Archaeological Region (Perttula 2004:7). Although still poorly understood because of the lack
of excavations conducted on well stratified and intact archaeological sites within the region,
there are three periods that have most succinctly been defined by Dan Prikryl (1990) in his
synthesis of geomorphology and archaeology along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. They are
the Palaeoindian period, the Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric. Duane Peter and Dan McGregor
(1988) further identified a Protohistoric period from their investigations at Joe Pool Lake that
should be added to this sequence. The sequence is shown in Table 1; all dates presented in
‘years BP’ and are years before A.D. 1950, when radiocarbon dating was refined.

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited North America before 11,500 BP, solid evidence does not
as of yet support their existence. The argument that artifacts recovered from Levi Rockshelter
in Travis County are older than Paleoindian (Alexander 1983:133-145) is not supported because
the radiocarbon dates are not clustered, and there are no distinct artifact and extinct fauna
assemblages within well-defined stratigraphy (Collins 1995:380-381). Other sites where
assemblages are purportedly pre-Clovis include Friesenhahn Cave (Krieger 1964) and the Waco
Mammoth Site (Fox et al. 1992). Human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from Friesenhahn
Cave, and mammoth bones at the Waco Site. However, problems of context or dating exist at
both sites (Collins 1995:380-381). The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the
largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath
the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for
a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Gault 2014; Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown
2000).
Paleoindian
The first undisputed evidence of human habitation in North America is known as the Paleoindian
period and dates from 11,500 - 8000 B.P. in north-central Texas and the Southern Great Plains
(Prikryl 1990; Hofman 1989:29-45; Story 1990). Similarly, the Paleoindian period dates from
11,500 – 8,500 B.P. in central Texas (Collins 1995) where a higher number of well-stratified
sites have been recorded. The Southern Great Plains were defined by changes in climatic
conditions and subsistence patterns more so than projectile point technologies which are
indicators of change in Central Texas; however, these regions will be referenced as well for a
more complete over view of north-central Texas’s prehistory since undisturbed Paleoindian sites
near the Trinity River Valley are rare (Meltzer 1987). The close of the Pleistocene period is
characterized by small bands of nomadic big game hunters with a lithic technology consisting
of Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Plainview projectile points. Typically,
Paleoindian projectile points were lanceolate-shaped and often fluted to facilitate hafting to
foreshafts of wooden spears. Atlatls, or spear-throwers, were utilized by Paleoindian groups to
5

more effectively bring down large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse
(Black 1989). Known Clovis sites in Texas include kill sites, quarries, caches, open campsites,
ritual sites, and burials (Collins 1995:381-383; Hester 1995:433-436).
Several sites dating to the Paleoindian Period are found throughout north-central Texas. One of
the oldest Paleoindian sites in this region is arguably the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479), located
in Denton County, Texas. The Aubrey Clovis Site has been carbon dated to 11,550 B.P. (Ferring
2001). A wide variety of lithic material, which originated in distant locations, was found at
41DN479 under roughly 8 meters of alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain. This lithic material
was used to fashion a wide variety of tools such as blade tools, flake tools, Clovis points, end
scrapers, and gravers (Ferring 2001). The Lewisville Lake Site (41DN71) contained 27 hearth
features, an ephemeral lithic scatter in a near-surface context, and one Clovis point (Crook and
Harris 1957,1958; Story 1990:182-184).
Both the Horn Shelter No. 2 Site (41BQ46) and the Waco Mammoth Site yielded Paleoindian
deposits. The Horn Shelter No. 2 Site revealed 27 strata of human occupation which yielded
numerous features and several Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The Waco Mammoth Site
also exhibited materials from the Paleoindian period (Fox et al. 1992). Some notable Clovis age
sites have been recorded further north which include the Sam Kaufman site in Red River County
(41RR18), which included a Paleoindian age hearth feature 1.8 meters below the ground surface
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The Roy Young site (41LR36) in Lamar County yielded a single
Clovis point, as did a site in Grayson County, Texas (Story 1990). In central Texas, the Gault
Site (41BL323) in Bell County, has contributed to over 90% of the world’s Clovis artifacts.
Materials from this site may eventually provide conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in
Texas as well (Gault 2014; Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown 2000).
Recent research has suggested that the Paleoindian reliance on large game was not as pronounced
as previously thought. In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups also harvested small game
such as deer, turtle, mice, raccoons, and frogs (Collins 1995:381). The latter portion of the
Paleoindian Period saw stylistic changes in projectile point technology. Dalton, Scottsbluff and
Golondrina traditions gradually replace Clovis and Folsom fluted technology types. These
projectile types were wide spread, but occurred in higher densities in the High Plains and Central
Texas (Meltzer and Bever 2007).
Environmental data suggests that the Paleoindian climate was wetter and cooler than it is today
(Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993). The climate gradually shifted to drier and
warmer conditions as the Early Holocene approached (Bousman 1998). Studies indicate that it
is highly unlikely that Paleoindian hunters caused the extinction of large game (Cannon and
Meltzer 2004; Grayson and Meltzer 2002). As climatic conditions changed, megafauna began
to die out, directing Paleoindian subsistence strategies towards small game hunting and plant
foraging during the rise of the Archaic Period.
Archaic
The Archaic Period immediately follows the Paleoindian Period and is typically divided into the
6

Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods. Generally the Archaic Period is characterized by
a more intensive reliance on local floral and faunal resources. The Archaic period in northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 8,500-2,700 B.P. (Prikryl 1990). The Archaic period
sees an increase in the number of projectile point styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record
also suggests a heavier reliance on food processing and a wider variety of site functions, as well
as more localized geographic distributions of artifacts. Increasingly complex settlement systems,
increased population sizes, gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group
territories define the Archaic period in north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990). These circumstances
may have compelled Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of north-central
Texas to diversify hunting and gathering strategies based on bottomland resources of the rivers
and tributaries, and bison hunting along the plains (Hofman 1989). Archaeological endeavors
along the West Fork of the Trinity River suggest that primary contexts for Early and Middle
Archaic sites are likely to be identified only under deeply buried deposits of flood plain alluvium
(Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986).
Early Archaic
Prikryl (1990) dates the Early Archaic from approximately 8,500 – 6,000 B.P. and suggests a
lack of regional differences in terms of adaptive patterns during this time. In the North Texas
region, subsistence data for this region during the Early Archaic is scarce (Ferring and Yates
1997). Early Archaic components in north central Texas have not been identified. Projectile
point styles in Central Texas began to transition around 8,000 BP from unstemmed to stemmed
varieties such as Martindale and Uvalde (Black 1989). Early Archaic projectile point styles in
north-central Texas included early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990;
Story 1990). The dwindling megafauna populations led to a shift in focus from large game to
smaller game such as deer, fish, and plant material (Black 1989).
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic dates roughly from around 6,000 – 3,500 B.P. and the climate shift to a
warmer drier climate that began in the Early Archaic continued to persist into the Middle
Archaic, although as the Middle Archaic continued conditions became more mesic (Albert and
Wyckoff 1984), leading to the development of the Cross Timbers physiographic region (Prikryl
1990). Prikryl’s (1990) research into the archeological data from the lower Elm Fork of the
Trinity River reveals that all Middle Archaic sites recorded prior to 1990 were situated on the
first terrace above stream flood plains, with 55% along the Elm Fork itself. This settlement
pattern suggests that Middle Archaic peoples utilized terraces along major drainages.
Additionally, Prikryl’s studies revealed a complete lack of burned rock middens in the lower Elm
Fork region. Burned rock middens are a very common feature in Central Texas, and a number
of theories have been posited in order to attempt to explain there absences in the lower Elm Fork
region. One reason for the lack of burned rock middens in the area may be because the plant
foods utilized in areas where burned rock middens occur with frequency were not common in
the area Prikryl focused on. A second interpretation focuses on the link between burned rock
middens and the processing of acorns, which some believe requires limestone in order to leach
the acids from the acorns. The bedrock found in the oak savannahs of north Texas is typically
sandstone and is chemically inert (Prikryl 1990). Lastly, it is quite possible that groups in central
7

and north central Texas developed distinct adaptations (Prikryl 1990). The distribution of dart
points supports the last interpretation. For example, point types that are commonly found in
association with burned rock midden features such as Nolan, Travis, and Bulverde are absent
from Prikryl’s study area. Projectile points commonly found in the lower Elm Fork region
include Carrollton, Wells, and the Basal-Notched group that includes Calf Creek, Bell, and
Andice points (Prikryl 1990).
Several important sites have been found in the north Texas region that date to the Middle
Archaic. The R. W. Watts Site Number 2 (41CP14) in Camp County which exhibited dense
midden deposits and burned rock features dated to the Middle and Late Archaic, with possible
earlier components (McKay et al. 2003:14). The Wild Bull Site in Henderson County (41HE61)
contained Middle and Late Archaic lithic assemblages and a burned rock feature (McKay et al.
2003:14). The Calvert Site in the Trinity Valley of Denton Creek (41DN103) (Ferring and Yates
1997) yielded a burial, hearths, and an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna. Investigators
at the site suggested that the climate may have been drier, and that the homogeneity of artifact
types with adjacent regions might indicate that Middle Archaic groups participated in broader
cultural interactions (Ferring and Yates 1997:305).
Late Archaic
Prikryl (1990) places the Late Archaic period from 3,500 B.P. to 1,250 B.P. and observes at least
three increases in site frequency relative to the Middle Archaic period (1990). The Late Archaic
in the north-central Texas region is characterized by an increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and decreased mobility.
Ferring (1986) suggests that the climate during the Late Archaic was even more mesic than in
the previous Early and Middle Archaic periods, although the West Fork of paleosol that
developed in the latter part of the Late Archaic in the Upper Trinity Basin may be evidence of
a wetter climatic regime. It has also been hypothesized that population densities increased
dramatically during the Late Archaic, possibly due to changing environmental conditions, new
subsistence strategies, technological innovations, reduced group mobility, or the increased
accumulation of cultural knowledge. However, as groups began to specialize in the procurement
of resources available, mobility and cultural interactions with neighboring groups may have
decreased. This may be indicated in the more diverse tool technologies and subsistence patterns.
Projectile point style varieties show an increase. Projectile points characterizing a Late Archaic
site include Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent, and Gary points. Other styles include
Castroville, Elam, Dallas, Edgewood, Godley, Marshall, and Trinity points (Prikryl 1990; Story
1990). Prikryl’s (1990) studies on population densities supports increases in populations in the
region during the Late Archaic. Prikryl found that Late Archaic sites were 3.5 times more
numerous than were sites dating to the Middle Archaic. This discrepancy is telling, but does not
rule out the fact that there may be Middle Archaic sites; they just have not yet been located.
The lithic material used for tool manufacture in the Late Archaic suggests a decrease in group
mobility as compared to earlier periods (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983). Prikryl (1990) found that
62% of the projectile points found within his area of study (the Lower Elm Fork) were made
8

from materials obtained locally, specifically Ogallala quartzite. Prikryl (1990) postulated the
theory that the Late Archaic period in the upper Trinity River basin was characterized by a
decline in the use of local chert, although the Fort Worth area near the Clear and West Forks of
the Trinity River remained unexplored.
The frequency of open campsites seems to have increased during this time, but the scale of the
sites tends to be smaller. Smaller game and plant materials continued to be an important
component to Late Archaic subsistence strategies. This evidence is supported by the presence
of lithic tools associated with plant processing activities (Brownlow et al. 1999). Late Archaic
deposits along the Denton Creek drainage indicate an increased reliance on freshwater shellfish,
suggesting a possible decreased availability of large game, decreasing territory size, or resource
specialization (Anthony and Brown 1994). Several important sites dating to the Late Archaic
have been documented in this region of Texas. The Joe Pool Lake site (Peter and McGregor
1988) and the Lake Ray Roberts site (Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and Yates 1987), located
in Dallas County provide important information to this period. Assemblages at these sites
suggest the small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a limited
time and then reoccupied other sites on a seasonal basis exploiting deer, rabbit, turtle, and
freshwater mussel shell along the way (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). Other important Late Archaic
sites include the Sister Grove Creek Site in Collin County (Lynott 1975), and the Hurricane Hill
site (41HP106) in Hopkins County (Greaves 2003).
Late Prehistoric
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin falls roughly
between1,300 to 300 B.P. Research at Lake Ray Roberts suggests that regional exchange of
technological information, rather than environmental change, likely explains the shift from Late
Archaic lifeways to Late Prehistoric (Ferring and Yates 1997:305). Both Lynott (1977) and
Prikryl (1990) agree on the division of the Late Prehistoric into an early and late phase based on
arrow point and ceramic technologies. The early phase dates from 1,300 B.P. to 800 B.P., and
reflects a continuation of the foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic.
Assemblages are characterized by sand and grog tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner,
Catahoula, and Alba arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The introduction of the bow and
arrow enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest prey from greater distances more safely, and
required less room to maneuver than atlatls so hunters could conceal themselves in brush.
Similarly to other temporal periods, known sites appear to have occurred on terraces, although
roughly one-third are known to be situated on the floodplain. The climate is also believed to have
become drier around 1,000 B.P. (Prikryl 1990). Climate stress and the presence of ecotones may
have contributed to the large numbers of sites located on the Cross-Timbers/Blackland Prairie
boundary. Prikryl argues that the regionalization observed during the early phase of the Late
Prehistoric shifts to one of greater mobility or trade with neighboring groups (Prikryl 1990).
The late phase reflects Southern Plains influences and occurred from 750 to 250 B.P. (Prikryl
1990). It is associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus,
unstemmed triangular points (Fresno, Maud, Washita, and Harrell), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). This period also exhibits some evidence of horticulture and bison
9

procurement. As bison herd sizes increased, hunter gatherers became more reliant on them for
subsistence (Baugh 1986; Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1957; Yates1982). In north-central Texas, this
phase demonstrates prominent influence from settled agricultural peoples to the north and east.
The dry climatic conditions experienced during the early phase, continued during the late phase,
contributing to short grasslands which bison herds fed on. This may account for the increase in
Bison remains during this period. Terrace sites are the dominant site type, mostly occurring along
the Cross Timbers/Blackland Prairie boundary. A high density of sites was recorded along that
margin at the Aquilla Lake Site (Brown 1987a, 1987b).
Excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake have contributed to our
understanding of the Late Prehistoric period. House structures, roasting pits, Alba points, burned
corn, and grog-tempered ceramics were documented at this site indicating significant adaptive
transitions during the middle of the Late Prehistoric period (Peter and McGregor 1988). Data
from the Ray Roberts project suggests that regional traditions which emerged during the last
phase of the Late Prehistoric did so independently of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands
cultures (Ferring and Yates 1997:305; Story 1990).
Protohistoric
The time period between 400 to 200 B.P. (A.D. 1600 to 1800) in north-central Texas is referred
to as the Protohistoric Period. From the late AD 1500s, Europeans entered Texas only
sporadically and did not settle there until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). First European contact
on the Texas coast most likely began with the landing of Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez
expedition survivors in 1528. Reliable historical information for the Trinity River basin during
the Protohistoric period is somewhat limited, and it is not well understood which aboriginal
groups resided in north-central Texas during this temporal period. Limited data suggest that
Caddoan-language speakers, possibly members of the Wichita Confederacy, occupied the area.
Caddo groups, including the Kichai, Ionis, and Tonkawa Indians, are known to occupy the lands
within north Texas. Tribes consisting of the Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Yscani, Waco, and
Kichai are believed to have entered the Southern Plains in an effort to avoid hostile groups like
the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:904). Groups with more abbreviated occupation in this region
include the Comanche, Kiowa, and Lipan Apache. More sedentary Plains Villagers of the
Wichita Confederacy tended to leave behind a more substantial archaeological presence. These
materials typically included arrow points (Fresno, Harrell, and Washita types), thick end
scrapers, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints, bison hoes, elbow pipes, Womak Engraved
pottery, metal knives, horse tack, shot, kettle fragments, trade beads, and various European
ceramics.
Historic
The historic period begins with more formal European-American settlement of the continent. In
response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French
incursion into East Texas, a series of Spanish missions and presidios were erected in Texas
during the eighteenth century. Eventually, the newly independent Mexican government began
granting impresario contracts to allow more prominent Anglo settlement to facilitate
development throughout the territory. Stephen F. Austin, one such settler, spearheaded a
10

movement by Anglo and Mexican settlers against Mexican authority towards independence. The
area around present-day Dallas was attractive to many of these settlers because of a natural ford
on the Trinity River and populations in this locale soon grew. After becoming the Republic of
Texas in 1836 following the decisive Battle at San Jacinto, the territory later joined the United
States in 1845.
“Abram Bledsoe bought half of the Roderick Rawlins survey in 1847 and five years later laid out
a city plan near the community of Pleasant Run. He named his township Lancaster, after the
name of his birthplace, Lancaster, Kentucky. A carding machine was operated in the community
in 1850. Dr. H. J. Moffett established his drugstore and practice there in 1851. In 1860 a post
office was established in Lancaster. With the advent of the Civil War a Lancaster volunteer
company was raised and became part of the Fifth Texas Cavalry. A pistol factory manufactured
the Tucker-Sherrod Colt Dragoon, an exact copy of the .44 caliber Colt Dragoon, for the use of
Confederate troops from Texas. Eventually, on May 22, 1887, Lancaster was incorporated. In
1885 the population was estimated to be 550, and by 1900 it had risen to 1,045. A money-order
office was operating in Lancaster by 1880, and in 1887 the Lancaster Herald was established by
Joe T. Green. The Lancaster Tap Railroad, completed in 1890, connected Lancaster with the
Houston and Texas Central at Hutchins, south of Dallas. In 1905 the H&TC bought the Lancaster
Tap, which was finally abandoned in 1934. Another railroad, the Dallas and Waco, was built
through Lancaster in 1888. In 1891 this railroad became part of the Missouri, Kansas and Texas,
running from Dallas to the Gulf Coast of Texas. In that same period, two roller mills and three
cotton gins were established; and two academies, the Lancaster Masonic Institute and Lancaster
Female Institute, opened. By 1897 the town also had a public school that employed one teacher
and had an enrollment of fifty-six students. The city also had Methodist, Baptist, Disciples of
Christ, and Presbyterian churches, a chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows, and a
Masonic Temple. After 1900 Lancaster's population rose slowly. In 1925 the town had 1,200
people, a flour and cottonseed-oil mill, a Western Union Telegraph station, the White and
Company Hotel, and the First National Bank. The town was connected to Waco by the
Waco-Dallas Interurban in 1911. From 1930 to 1960 Lancaster's population more than doubled,
with an increase to over 7,000 by the latter year. Cotton oil and printing companies were
Lancaster's principal industries during this time” (Nall 1996).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
Previously Documented Archaeological Surveys, Sites, and Historical Markers
A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TX 16596-B Bluegrove Road Cellular Tower site
had not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor had any archaeological sites been
recorded within one mile. There were however, two cultural resources conducted within one mile
(see Figure 3). The first was conducted in 1980 along Mill Branch Creek for the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The second was conducted in 1994 along the proposed Bear Creek
Road right-of-way by archaeologists with the Federal Highway Administration (FWHA). In
11

neither case were any archaeological sites discovered (Atlas 2014).
The only historical structure within one mile is the William Fleming House, constructed around
1898. It was designed by architect Henry Clay Rawlins, and owned by Dr. D. M. Hardy of
Dallas. It is described as a two-story wood frame and stone residence, central hall floor plan,
hipped roof with side gables, 6/6 and 1/1 windows; chimney located at west facade, shed porch
across front facade (Atlas 2014). Notably, this historic structure lies beyond the 3/4-mile visual
APE of the proposed TX 16596-B Bluegrove Road Cellular Tower.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the area to be impacted had been clearly delineated with
survey stakes (Figure 5). In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic and thorough
pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests
(see Figure 6) were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research
plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be
placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel tests. Excavation of the shovel tests were
terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
No evidence of either prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed either on or below
the surface. The tower footprint area was covered with pasture grasses, but was obviously very
hummocky, suggesting at least some degree of disturbance had occurred in the recent historic
past. This was likely caused by the excavation of a stock pond adjacent to the northeast corner
of the tower site. The Access/Utility easement leading westward and north-westward from
Bluegrove Road had been also obviously heavily disturbed, built up, and capped with bricks,
fragmented pavement, and road base (see for example, Figures 6 and 7). However the surface
area throughout was markedly hummocky, suggesting that the area had been cleared of trees or
brush in the not too distant past.

Three shovel tests (STs) placed within the tower’s footprint and the westernmost portion of the
Access/Utility easement (STs 4 - 6) (Figure 8) revealed relatively disturbed and mottled black
and dark grayish brown clay in the upper 30 cm, with vertical cracking, calcium carbonate fines
and threads, and faint slickensides in the lower 30 cm. More heavily disturbed dark grayish
brown clay with angular limestone road gravels and black plastic inclusions were present in the
upper 20 cm of ST3, but apparently undisturbed clay in the lower 40 cm. The upper 45-50 cm
of both ST 1 and ST2 exhibited caliche road base and fragmented red and brown bricks within
dark grayish brown clay. From roughly 50-60 cmbs was apparent undisturbed black clay with
calcium carbonate fines and faint slickensides.
Notably, no cultural material was found in any of the six shovel tests excavated. The results of
shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
There are no known archaeological sites nor historic structures within the visual APE of the
proposed TX 16596-B Blue Grove Road Cell Tower site. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface within the Project Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated. No evidence
of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found either on or below the surface.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
