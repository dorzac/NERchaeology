Locat1on and Character ot the Reservo1r
The

Sab~ne

R1ver Author1ty ot Texas, 1n conjuncture w1th the

c1ty ot Dallas, 1s preparing to construct a large earthwork dam
approximately f1fty m1les east ot Dallas on the Sablne R1ver.

Thls

projeot, known as Iron Bridge Dam and ReservOir, will provide water
for the city ot Dallas and will aid in flood oontrol and water COD­
servat10n on the Sablne River, while at the same t1me afford1ng
exoellent recreatlon fao111ties tor the surround1ng area.
The reservo1r site 1s located ln Hunt, Ralns, and Van Zandt
Count1es, and the dam ls to be situated Just below the junction
po1nt of the headwater tributar1es ot the Sabine River.

Its waters

w111 flood large areas along the Sabine proper, the South POrk ot
the Sabine, Caddo Fork, Cowlesoh Fork, and scores ot small oreeks
and mlnor tributar1es.

The maximum length of the reservoir w11l

be about twelve ml1es; the maximum width, approximately five miles,
and an estimated

6a,ooo acres ot land are to

be inundated.

Work on the earthwork structure at the upper end ot the dam
1s scheduled to begin in Aprll 1957, and it has been estimated
that the reservoir w11l begin tilling by January 1961.

Its floodplain, which provides abundant arable

land, 1s somewhat entrenched and is bounded In all directions
by low hIlls, dissected parts of the rollIng plains above.
This headwater area lies within Fenneman's Coastal Plains

ArcheologIcal SUrve7
From April 1 to April 12, 1951, an archeolog1cal surve7
ot the reservoir area was conducted by the Austin OffIce ot

the River Bas1n Surveys, Nat10nal Park Service, as a part ot
the extens1ve progrmn ot archeological and paleontological
salvage administered by the National Park Service and the
Sm1thsonian Institution with the assistance ot the U. 8.
Bureau of Reclmnatlon and the U. S. Army Oorps of Engineers.
Field reconnaIssance was carr1ed out by LeRoy Johnson.
Jr., with the assistance ot W. A. Davis.

Twenty-two archeo­

logical sites were located. several ot which promise to be
ot great archeolog1cal importance, and surface collections

of artIfacts were made at all sites where possible.
Heavy rains and floods during reconnaissance h1ndered
field work ser10us17, and many parts of the reservoir could
not be. inspected.

Therefore, it 1s reoommended that further

survey work be carried out at a later date as there are un­
doubtedly more sites to be found 1n the area.

S1te Descr1pt1on and Analyses
The s1tes located dur1ng th1s survey represent two culture
stages: the Archaic, followed by the Neo-Amerioan (as defined
by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954).

The Archaic sites are non­

ceramic, pre-bow, and presumably pre-agriculture sltes character­
ized by dart pOints, gr1nd1ng stones, blades, scrapers, etc.,
while the Neo-American sites are dist1ngu1shed by the presence
ot pottery and arrow points.

However, it should be noted that

when a site where only a small number of artifacts were found
is assigned to the Archaic Stagel as is sometimes the case in
th1s report, that this is done mainly for a matter of conven1ence.
Many of the lith1c artifacts found on Archa1c sites in th1s area

are likewise present on Neo-American sites.

Theretore, when only

a small sample of artifacts is on hand, it is quite poss1ble that
the site may be Neo-American and that ceramics and/or arrow points
do not show on the surface or have merely been overlooked by the
collector 1n making his survey of the s1te.

One thing that adds

to the d1fficulty of d1st1nguishing between Archa1c and the Neo­
American s1tes in this area 1s that the same dart point types-­
Wells, Gary, and others--are found in s1tes of both stages.
Whether these dart points continued in use into the Neo-American
stage, or whether they represent earl1er occupation by Archa1c
peoples at Neo-Amer1can s1tes, is a quest10n Which only controlled
excavat10ns can answer.

5

A pr10rity system has been set up for the purpose of

reco~

mend1ng excavation at sites reoorded during this survey:
Priority A - A s1te located below the max1mum flood pool,
from which a large amount of informat1on may
be seoured.
Pr10rity B - A site located below the maximum flood pool
from whloh a small amount of informat10n may
be secured.
Priority C - A slte located above the maximum flood pool
but in danger of destruotlon by erosion from
the reservoir and from which a large amount
of informatlon may be secured.
Priorlty D - A site looated above the maximum flood pool
but in danger of destruotion by erosion from
the reservoir and from wh1ch a small amount
of information may be secured.
In designat1ng the sltes, the five part numerical system,

as used by the Unlversity of Texas, was employed: state number,
quadrangle number, sub-quadrangle letter, area number, and last,
the slte number.
The following commonly used terms have been employad 1n art1­
fact descr1ption: scraper, drill, muller, grinding slab, dart point,
arrow polnt, and potsherd.

It is felt that these terms are 1n fre­

quent use and merit no definitive explanat1ons.

Because several

meanings and impl1catlons can be attached to the term ·blade",
however, a brief def1n1tion for th1s term is in order.

In th1s

paper the term "blade" is USed to designate any large, b1facial,
lanceolate or oval core tool probably designed tor cutt1ng.

6

All projectile po1nt and pottery type names used are those
set torth 1n .!!l }ptroductory Handbook £! Texas ArcheolGSl (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954).
One particular group ot dart points has been herein designated
as type "A".

This type includes pOints sim1lar to the Gary type,

except that they are much smaller than allowed 1n the detin1tion
ot Gary points by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (less than tour centi­
meters in length), yet are too thick and heavy to be consldered
arrow polnts.

These ar'tltacts l1kewise resemble Wells polnts

strongly in that the stem is often halt the length ot the en­
tire po1nt.

Here again, however, these pOints tall below the

defined length range tor Wells points.
It is not now proposed that these points constitute or de­
serve a new type name.

More distrlbution and comparative atudies

are necessary to answer th1s question.

Rather they have been

grouped separately 1n thls paper because they do not exactly tit
any established

t~~e,

although strongly resemblIng several.

The followIng evaluations are based on the general oharao­
ter1stics and appearanoe ot the sltes, prom1nent features such
as mounds, etc., be1ng taken 1nto oonsideration. and on a study
ot the artifacts collected trom them.

It cases where a site

seems promising archeolog1cally, reoommendations have been made
for excavation.

41-18DQ-20 (Hunt County) - About nine miles west ot the town of Lone
Oak and on a low hill to the west of north Oedar Creek, th1s site conslats of scattered oooupation debris cover1ng about e1ght acres of
pasture land, formerly under oultivation.

Artifacts found 1nolude

dart point types Gary, Wells, and Kent, w1th one eaoh of the types
Elam, Darl, and Ellis.

Other artifacts reoovered are side-sorapers,

blades. and one plano-convex end-scraper.

The si'te seems to belong

to the East Texas Aspeot of the Archa10 stage, probably showing some
influences from the Central Texas area.

Limited exploratory excavation

1s recommended under priority D.

point ot Cedar Oreek with the Cowleach Fork of the Sabine, is Situated
in a previously cultivated fleld, and consists of occupation debris
sparsely

soatter~d

over an area of about f1ve acres.

Artifaots found

include dart po1nts Gary, representative ot the group deSignated here­
1n as ItA", plano-convex end-scrapers, and one plain, bone-tempered pot­
sherd.

These ari;itacts represent either an East Texas Aspect Archaic

occupation ot the s1te tollowed by a ceramic occupation, or else a
s1ngle occupation by a culture intermediate between the Archa1c and
NeO-American Stages.

Exploratory trenching is theretore recommended

under priority 0, particularly to ascertain whether any stratigraphic
arrangement ot the artifacts exists.

west of the Oowleach Fork ot the SaM.ne.

Approximately ten acres ot

pasture land, prev10usly under cult1vat10n, are covered by the a1te.
Art1tacts collected include large numbers ot dart polnt types Gary,

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This brief survey can only give a general impress10n of the aroheology

ot the Iron Br1CY-

~oir

present a clear

of the cultures and peoples represented by these

~~ure

area.

Only 1ntensive excavat10n can hope to

twenty-two sites.
As has been pOinted out, several of the sItes promIse to be of great
aroheolog1cal Importance and sIgnIfIcance, primarIly the large historIC
site on HOoker Oreek and the extensive village slte on the same stream
whioh shows affilIation with the Sanders Focus.

Sites in this area also

are of great lmportance because of their marginal locatIon between the
Caddoan, Central Texas, and Southern Plains areas.

Little known archeo­

logically, thIs regIon promises to hold key 1nformation to relatIonships
between those three large culture areas. and the Iron Bridge Reservoir
sites

t;l"S

thorefore of vItal importance to a clearer understand1ng of

lnter-r-torea problems.

In

addltion, several of the s1tes may well provide

data regarding relations between Archaic and Neo-American Stages, an area

ot InvestIgation which has been largely neglected in the past.
It would be lamentable, indeed, if these sites were to be Inundated
before exoavations could be carrled out, as the science of archeology aauld
sufter an irreparable loss.

It Is, therefore, strongly urged that the re­

commendations eet forth herein be carried out prlor to the completlon of
Iron Bridge Reservoir.
