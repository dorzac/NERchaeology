INTRODUCTION
An archaeological survey of a proposed 5333 foot pipeline (3.67 acres) in
western Jasper County, Texas (Figure 1) was conducted by BVRA on October 22,
2001. The proposed pipeline will lead from an existing pipeline (Station 0+00) to a well
site currently in operation (Station 53+33). The maximum width of the pipeline route will
be 30 feet; however, the actual ground disturbance or permanent easement will only
affect 10 feet; the remaining 20 feet is a temporary work area. The projected depth
along the pipeline route is four feet. The tract to be surveyed parallels traverses uplands
through a recently clear-cut pine forest and a small segment of hardwood bottomland.
The terrain along the route is hilly with elevations ranging from approximately 315 feet
at the pipeline/riser tie-in point and elevations above 275 feet along most of the route
except at the single crossing where it is between 50 and 275 feet. A previous
investigation by Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. determined that the creek
crossing (tributary of Sandy Creek) is the only wetland area present within the route of
the proposed pipeline. To the west of the existing well is a major stream (Sandy Creek)
that runs in a north-south direction. The current project area is depicted on the 7.5'
United States Geological Survey topographical map Jasper East (dated 1984
[Provisional Edition]) (Figure 2).
Overall, the project area is located in a region known to contain significant
archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a reconnaissance survey
by professional archaeologists was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Since this is a federally funded project (EPA), no Antiquities
Permit was required. In order to satisfy this requirement, BVRA was retained by
Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. of Kinder, Louisiana to examine the
proposed pipeline route for the presence of significant archaeological sites. The project
number assigned by BVRA is 01-22.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Jasper County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the THC (Biesaart et al. 1985:151), Jasper County
contained 86 recorded sites. The site files at TARL revealed 149 recorded sites at the
time of this survey. In 1985, 0 sites in the county had been excavated, 10 had been
tested by hand, 1 had been tested by machine, and 73 had been surface collected.
Twenty-three recorded prehistoric sites in the county were listed as Archaic and 54 sites
were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:151). One site contained burials.
In the volume by (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.3) an evaluation was
made regarding density of sites in Texas counties. At this time Jasper County was next
to last with 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. In 1993, Jasper County contained 99
recorded archaeological sites. Of this number, 27 were regarded as not significant, 62
were of unknown significance, 9 were probably significant, and 1 was considered to be
significant according to National Register criteria (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table
2.1.1).
Unfortunately, there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of
archaeological sites in Jasper County. These include population growth (City of Jasper
and surrounding area), highway construction, Sam Rayburn Reservoir (formerly McGee
Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of the
archaeological sites known to exist in Jasper County have been identified by surveys
associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by National Forest
personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was performed in the late
1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin. At that
time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were considered to be of primary
importance. From the late 1940s until the mid 1970s, most of the archaeological
research in East Texas was carried out in connection with reservoir construction. In
1948, for example, Robert L. Stephenson published the results of his work at the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San
Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). At the time this was the only
systematic professional major archaeological investigation in the county. Since that
time several studies regarding reservoirs such as Dam "B" (Stephenson 1949), Big Cow
Creek (Moir n.d.), and Rockland Lake (Prikryl (1987) have been published.

It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Jasper County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), other reports
cited above, and the Abstracts in Contract Archaeology series also published by the
THC for more detailed information regarding the archaeology of Jasper County.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by Adrianne
Mraz, Research Assistant at TARL. Ms. Mraz checked the site files for previously
recorded sites in the project area. In addition, information pertaining to previous
archaeological work in the region was obtained from the library at BVRA. The field
survey crew relied on the topographic map Jasper East and the soils book for Jasper
County (Neitsch 1982). The method utilized to assess the pipeline consisted of shovel
tests and a surface inspection of exposed areas.
The field survey crew walked the entire route excavating shovel tests along the
way. Since the project area does not exceed 30 feet (9.15 meters) in width, parallel
survey transects were not necessary. In all, 14 tests were dug through sandy soils. All
earth excavated through shovel testing was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a
shovel test log (Appendix I) was kept. Profiles of the shovel tests were sketched in the
field, and the tests were drawn on a project area map. The location of all shovel tests is
depicted in Figure 3. The wooded nature of the project area made it difficult to dig
shovel tests at regular intervals. Tests were excavated at closer intervals near the tops
of the hills and on level areas and further apart on the slopes. No tests were dug on
steep slopes. Unfortunately, the line was not staked prior to this survey. The route had,
however, been flagged by Ron Fossett who accompanied the survey crew during this
project.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed no previously recorded archaeological site
in the project area. No archaeological sites were found by the survey crew during this
investigation. The area surveyed consisted of sandy uplands composed of two soil
types as defined by the soil survey for Jasper County (Neitsch 1982:Sheet 7). These
are the Letney-Tehran association, undulating (LTC) (Neitsch 1982:30) and the TehranLetney association, hilly (TLE) (Neitsch 1982:43-44). The project area depicted on the
soils map appears as Figure 4.
LTC soils are deep sandy soils on uplands on broad ridges and side slopes
above drainageways. They occupy most of the highest landforms in the survey area.
Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Letney soils are well drained, and Tehran soils are
somewhat excessively drained. Permeability of the soils is moderately rapid, and runoff
is slow. The available water capacity is medium for Letney soils and low for Tehran
soils. These soils are typically used as woodland.
TLE soils are deep sandy soils on ridge tops and side slopes above
drainageways on uplands. Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent. Tehran soils are
somewhat excessively drained, and Letney soils are well drained. Permeability of
Tehran and Letney soils is moderately rapid, and runoff is slow. The available water
capacity is low for Tehran soils and medium for Letney soils.
It is believed that the project area as currently proposed is a low probability area
for significant archaeological sites. The highest probability area is the high hill just to
the west of the existing well site overlooking the main channel of Sandy Creek.

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that Duke Energy be allowed to proceed with construction of
the gas pipeline as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that no significant archaeological
sites were missed during the examination of the 5333 foot proposed pipeline route.
Should, however, cultural materials be exposed during the construction of the pipeline in
areas other than mentioned above, all work should cease until the situation can be
evaluated by the THC in consultation with Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc.
and BVRA.
