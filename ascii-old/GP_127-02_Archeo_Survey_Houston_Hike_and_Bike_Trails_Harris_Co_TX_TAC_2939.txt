ABSTRACT

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted on the
proposed right-of-way (ROW) for six separate Hike and Bike trails. These ROWs have all been
heavily impacted by modern construction activities associated with the channalization of
waterways for the purpose of flood control, or by road building and maintenance. Archaeological
survey of five of the trails indicated that construction activities are unlikely to impact intact
archeological deposits. No artifacts were encountered or collected during survey of the trail
segments.
Survey of the portion of the Keegans Bayou trail ROW adjacent to the Riceville Cemetery
indicates that the cemetery contains at least four unmarked burials outside of, but in close
proximity to, proposed trail construction.
The trail design has been modified to avoid these burials; the plans include a construction
buffer area between the grave locations and the trail route, and the bayou bank will be extended
through the construction of retaining walls. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further work
be required in association with the various proposed trail segments.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. (Berg Oliver), on behalf of Klotz Associates, Inc. (Klotz)
and the City of Houston, contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC. (HRA Gray & Pape) of
Houston, Texas to perform an intensive pedestrian survey on six segments of hiking and
bicycle trails proposed for construction in western, central, and southern Harris County,
Texas. When completed, these six segments will add approximately 22.5 kilometers (14
miles) of trail sections to the existing system.
Funding for this project is provided in part through the Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), a component of the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) established by Congress in 1991. As such, the goals
of the survey were to determine if the initiation of this project could impact any previously
identified historic properties as defined by 36 CFR Part 800 of the Advisory Council for
Historic Preservation (ACHP), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified buried
cultural resources were located within the project’s Areas of Potential Effect (APE).
The current project area is divided into six trail sections. Archaeological survey
completed for each of the sections discussed in this report took place primarily on easements
owned by the Harris County Flood Control District, or on property that will be purchased by
the City of Houston. Archaeological work conducted to complete this survey was done
under Texas Antiquities Permit # 2939, issued by the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Division of Archeology in August of 2002. All fieldwork and reporting activities
were completed with reference to state (Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended [36CFR 800]) guidelines, and according to
standards set forth by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Programmatic
Agreement for Enhancement Projects.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The six proposed trail segments will be constructed along natural or man-made
waterways, over existing railroad grades, or within existing road right-of-ways (ROW)
throughout urban and suburban sections of Harris County, Texas (Figure 1).
Where
subsurface disturbance is proposed along natural bayous or man-made drainages, trail
construction will take place within a ROW measuring no more than 3.5 meters (10 feet)
wide. In addition, construction will include subsurface excavation to a maximum depth of 1
meter (3 feet) to accommodate the installation of lighting conduits. Bridge construction is
planned for two of the six trail segments. The bridge design has not been completed, but the
depth of disturbance is expected to be no more than approximately 6.5 meters (20 feet).
Trails associated with existing roadways will require the re-striping of traffic lanes only, and
therefore were not archaeologically surveyed. For the purposes of this study, the APE for
archaeological components was determined to be the boundaries of the proposed ROW (as
defined above) on each trail on which subsurface disturbance will be required.

The proposed Little White Oak Bayou Trail will tie into an existing east-west onstreet designated bike lane on Cavalcade Road and run northward approximately 560 meters
(0.35 miles) along the east bank of Little White Oak Bayou to Link Road. A pedestrian
crossing will be added to cross Link Road, and the trail will continue north along Enid Road
where the trail will become an on-street bike route for approximately 340 meters (1116 feet).
The trail will continue northward to its intersection with the Interstate Highway 45 (IH 45)
southbound frontage road. It will then extend a short distance beyond the intersection of
Sylvester Road and the IH 45 frontage road (Figure A1). Lighting conduits will be installed
along sections adjacent to the bayou. Segment length is approximately 0.97 kilometers (0.6
miles).
The proposed Columbia Tap-Union Station Trail will begin at the intersection of Polk
Street and Velasco Street, extending generally north along the existing Union Pacific
Railroad grade for approximately 440 meters (1444 feet). The trail will leave the railroad
grade at Bastrop Street, where it will continue to the northeast down Bastrop Street. The trail
segment will terminate at the intersection of Bastrop Street and Texas Avenue (Figure A2).
Completion of this segment will involve the re-striping of existing traffic lanes, and the
removal of the existing Union Pacific Railroad grade. The total segment length is
approximately 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles).
The proposed Westchase District Trail segment extends partially along a man-made
drainage parallel to Blue Willow Drive, and partially along existing roadways (Figures A3
and A4). Originating from a point near the corner of Riverside Drive and Harbor Oaks
Drive, the trail will run south down a man-made drainage paralleling Blue Willow Drive.
The trail continues south along Walnut Bend, where it leaves the street and splits to follow a
second man-made drainage; the western portion of the trail following this second drainage
terminates at Wilcrest Drive, while the eastern portion continues east and then south before
terminating at Richmond Road. The completion of a large portion of this segment will
require re-striping existing traffic lanes. Along sections associated with the drainages, a
four-foot high retaining wall will be cut into the bank, and a lighting conduit will be installed.
The total segment length is approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles), 2.75 kilometers (1.7
miles) of which will be off of existing roads.
The proposed West Brays Bayou Trail will occupy approximately 6.4 kilometers (4
miles) of easement along the banks of Brays Bayou. This segment will run from a starting
point located approximately 152 meters (500 feet) north of Bissonnet Road, and extend east
to a point approximately 457 meters (1,500 feet) west of Loop 610 (Figures A5 through A7).
Subsurface disturbance will include trenching to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3 feet) to
accommodate the placement of a lighting conduit, and bridge construction in two locations.
The proposed length is approximately 6.44 kilometers (4 miles).
The Keegans Bayou Trail will extend from the intersection of Gessner Road and
Brays Bayou, at the confluence of Brays and Keegans bayous. From this point, the trail will
run west along Keegans Bayou, and terminate at South Kirkwood Road. The proposed trail
will be equipped with lighting conduits, and subsurface disturbance will include construction

3

of a bridge (Figures A8 through A10). The proposed length is approximately 9.7 kilometers
(6 miles) and will extend primarily along the north side of the bayou.
Plans for the proposed Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor Trail have not been
finalized. Current plans indicate that the trail will extend along the north bank of Buffalo
Bayou from approximately 200 meters (656.2 feet) east of South Jensen Drive eastward to
Hirsch Road. From that point the trail will extend north to parallel Hirsch Road for
approximately 243.84 meters (800 feet). The trail length is approximately 1.7 kilometers
(1.05 miles) (Figure A12).

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphology of Harris
County, with attention paid to the area’s various rivers and bayous. This is followed by
discussions of soil morphology, and climate typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level
to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches
as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones escarpment
in central Texas. The basic geomorphologic characteristics of the Texas coast and associated
inland areas, which includes Harris County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced
by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of
the continent, and subsequent down-cutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of
the region’s rivers. Locally, Harris County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary
rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott
2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in
modern-day Harris County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to predate
human occupation in the region, and the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned
stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date to between
one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as consisting “of up
to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large looping meander
scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge markedly greater
than that seen today (Abbot 2001; 16). Overlaying these deposits may be relatively thick or
thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the Harris County area by alluvial or aeolian factors, or
potentially, marshy environments.
Major topographic relief is the result of erosion of sediments from fluvial action
associated with the many rivers, bayous, and creeks within and around Harris County. Major
drainages include the Brazos River to the west, the Colorado River to the north, and San
Jacinto River to the east. Creeks and bayous that border or dissect Harris County include
Spring and Cypress creeks to the north, Cedar Bayou to the east, Clear Creek, Brays Bayou,
Keegans Bayou, and Buffalo Bayou to the south. Watercourses relevant to this study include
Little White Oak Bayou, which is a tributary of White Oak Bayou in south central Harris
County, Buffalo Bayou, Brays Bayou, and Keegans Bayou. The following discussion of
relevant soils is organized by their association with these bayou systems.

SOILS
Four broad groups of soil associations have been identified in Harris County
(Wheeler 1977). In general, these groups are distinguished by clay to loam ratios and
association with prairie or forested environments.
Soils associated with the Little White Oak Bayou Project Area include urbanized
units termed the Gessner-Urban land complex (Gu) adjacent to the bayou, and the ClodineUrban land complex (Ce) in the northern portion of the project. The Gu unit contains
approximately 20 to 80 percent Gessner soils, consisting of friable, dark grayish brown loam
in the top 18 centimeters (7 inches), followed by a friable, grayish brown loam to
approximately 41 centimeters (16 inches) below the surface. Below this is a friable dark gray
loam with a higher clay content that extends to 86 centimeters (34 inches) below the surface.
This is followed by a firm, light gray sandy clay loam, mottled with yellowish brown and
brownish yellow to a depth of 213 centimeters (84 inches) below the surface. Other soils in
the area have been altered or covered by urbanization (Wheeler 1977). The Ce unit is similar
in extent to the Gu unit, and consists of a friable, dark gray loam to about 30 centimeters (12
inches) below the surface, followed by a friable, gray loam to a depth of roughly 74
centimeters (29 inches). Below this is a friable, light brownish gray loam, containing
irregular pitted calcium carbonate concretions. Urbanized land makes up between 10 to 75
percent of this unit (Wheeler 1977).
Soils associated with the Buffalo Bayou and downtown urban area (which includes
the Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor Project Area and the Columbia Tap Union Station Trail
Project Area) include a broad area termed Urban land (Ur). The Ur mapping unit consists of
urbanized or otherwise built areas where up to 75 to 100 percent of the area contains
buildings or has been extensively disturbed by land alteration, infilling, grading, soil
removal, or other construction activities. Adjacent to this mapping unit is the Midland-Urban
land complex (Mu), consisting of firm, dark grayish brown silty clay loam 0 to 18
centimeters (0 to 7 inches) below the surface overlying firm, gray silty clay 18 to 51
centimeters (7 to 20 inches) below the surface and firm dark gray clay to a depth of 127
centimeters (50 inches). Below this is a firm clay mottled with gray, olive yellow, and
brownish yellow. Approximately 10 to 75 percent of this complex has been urbanized
(Wheeler 1977).
The Westchase District Trail Project Area originates approximately 0.4 kilometers
(0.25 miles) south of Buffalo Bayou, to the west of downtown Houston (see Figure 1). Soils
associated with this area include a unit termed the Lake Charles-Urban Land complex (Lu).
Lake Charles soils contain a thick surface layer of firm black clay to very dark gray clay
extending approximately 91 centimeters (36 inches) below the surface. Below this is very
firm, gray clay mottled with olive brown and yellowish brown. This layer extends to a depth
of 188 centimeters (74 inches) below the surface. Approximately 10 to 75 percent of the
soils associated with this complex are located in urban area (Wheeler 1977).

6

Soils associated with the West Brays Bayou Trail Project Area are similar in some
ways to those found near the Westchase District Trail, as there is a trend from Lake Charles
clay (LcA) in the western most section, to Lu in the central section. Lu soils are interspersed
with soils of the Bernard-Urban land complex (Bg), consisting of a surface layer of friable,
very dark gray clay loam approximately 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick, followed by a 122
centimeters (48 inches) thick layer of very dark gray clay. Below this is firm, gray clay
mottled with yellowish brown mottles that contains calcium carbonate concretions. Mu
mantles the eastern half of the project area (Wheeler 1977).
The eastern end of the Keegans Bayou Trail Project Area and the western end of the
West Brays Bayou Trail Project Area lie in close proximity to one another (see Figure 1).
Not surprisingly, LcA mantles the northeastern and central portion of the Keegans Bayou
Trail Project Area, with Bernard clay loam (Bd) in isolated areas of the central portion. Bd
consists of a friable, very dark gray clay loam surface layer roughly 15 centimeters (6 inches)
thick. Below this is firm, very dark gray clay to a depth of 137 centimeters (54 inches),
followed by a firm, gray clay mottled with yellowish brown mottles and few calcium
carbonate concretions. Interspersed with Bd are soils of the Bernard-Edna complex (Be). Be
soils consist primarily of Bernard clay loam and Edna fine sand loam, with Bernard soils
found on flats and concave depressions between knolls and pimple mounds made up of Edna
soils (Wheeler 1977). Bernard soil consists of a surface layer of friable very dark gray clay
loam approximately 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick, followed by a layer 122 centimeters (48
inches) thick very dark gray clay. Below this is firm gray clay with yellowish brown mottles
and few calcium carbonate concretions. Edna soil contains a surface layer of friable, dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam to a depth of 25.4 centimeters (10 inches) followed by very
firm clay 86 centimeters (34 inches) thick that trends in color from gray in the upper portion
to olive gray in the lower portion. Underlying this is a firm, gray sandy clay loam with
yellowish brown mottles. LcA soils mantle the western half of the project area.

CLIMATE
Harris County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds trend from the southeast or
east, except for in winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air from the
north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90’s Fahrenheit, and are
often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter temperatures can reach into
the low 30’s Fahrenheit, below freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of
every year, and are typically restricted to the early morning hours.
Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging
from between 43 centimeters (17 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from
thunderstorms (Wheeler 1977), which tend to be heavy but of short duration.

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING

Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural
regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as the interface
between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines, both Shafer
(1976) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record of this
region as “Woodland.” This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact cultural
patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten (1984:74)
states, “it loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a cultural
periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.”
Under this framework the prehistoric
archaeology of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local
innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive
enough so as to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The “Mossy Grove”
cultural tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups
in this region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste
Goose Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early
Historic periods.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin sub-regions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Based on aspects of material culture researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800). In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8,000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8,000-5,000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1,000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic
(A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences,
the chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point

8

technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that
a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation, and much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state of
Texas and around North America. At the close of the Pleistocene period, large game hunters
crossed the Bearing Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America
(Culberson, 1993; Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands
(Culberson, 1993) and were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their diets consisting
of mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried with them an
easily recognizable tool material culture, though, admittedly, little is known about their
wooden or bone tools, and their clothing types. Diagnostic points such as fluted Clovis,
Folsom, and Plainview points can be used to identify a site’s Paleo component, and the
nature of these points demonstrate the nature of their hunting style. The above points are
large and designed to be attached to a spear. No evidence of bow and arrow hunting has
been found in this period (Culberson, 1993; Newcomb 1961).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
With the waning of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna upon
which the Paleo-Indian peoples survived gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply
is seen as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Culberson,
1993; Biesaart et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961). Though dates often disagree (ranging from
8000 B.C. marking the beginning of the Early Archaic [Culberson, 1993], to Aten [1984]
stating that the transition from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around
A.D. 100) there are three progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: the
Early, Middle, and Late.

LATE PREHISTORIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester
(1993) see the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the preliminary
stages of Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is believed by
most (Culberson, 1993; Turner and Hester 1993; Aten 1984; Newcomb 1961) to be from this
period, though some may place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations,
the first signs of pottery begin to emerge at sites from this period. Though the amount and
variety of pottery intensifies during the Late Prehistoric, it is an excellent way of determining
the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora
intensifies beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no
sufficient data to demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agriculturalism. The diagnostic
points of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
9

The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from
the end of the Archaic period to the historic period ushered in by the Spanish Missions and
Anglo-American settlers. During this period there is a shift to the almost total use of arrow
points such as Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993), and almost every group now
has pottery. According to Aten (1984), there are nearly 18 different types of pottery from
this period currently identified for the east Texas Coast alone based on temper, paste, and
design. It is during this period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapans, Bidai, to
name a few are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the
historical sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the
reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The county
was renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John Richardson Harris, an early pioneer
who had established Harrisburg in 1826, the first town site in the county. Harrisburg was
established at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and Brays Bayou and by the 1830s had
become the major port of entry for the region and a transportation hub. Roads ran northwest
to the Brazos communities of San Felipe and Washington, east to the ferry landing that
crossed the San Jacinto, and west paralleling Brays Bayou to the Oyster Creek Community
near present day Stafford in Fort Bend County.
Under Mexican rule the area surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by
1832) was known as the San Jacinto District. The district stretched east from Lynchburg on
the San Jacinto River west to the location of present day Richmond, and from Clear Creek in
the south to Spring Creek in the north. Harrisburg County encompassed this same territory
with the addition of Galveston Island. The modern boundaries of Harris County were
established in 1838 (The Texas Handbook Online: Harris County).
The lands that would become Harris County comprised the southeastern border of
Austin’s Colony. In July of 1824, twenty-nine titles were granted to lands in future Harris
County, with an additional twenty-three grants made between 1828 and 1833. These original
grants concentrated mainly on the watercourses of the region (The Texas Handbook Online:
Harris County). The early settlers in the region were mostly from the southern United States
who brought with them their African slaves. In the 1840s, large numbers of German and
French immigrants settled in Harris County. The Hispanic presence in the region was
relatively sparse prior to an influx of immigrants following the Mexican Revolution
reflecting the ephemeral nature of Spanish and Mexican colonization.
The founding of the city of Houston by Augustus and John Allen was announced in a
newspaper advertisement of August 1836. The brothers managed to convince the delegates
of the first Texas Congress to establish the yet-to-be-built Houston as the first, albeit
temporary (1837-1840), capital of Texas. In 1837, Houston also became the seat of
Harrisburg County. The town was laid out on a grid plan with streets running parallel and
perpendicular to Buffalo Bayou near the confluence of White Oak Bayou. The town grew
10

rapidly from 12 inhabitants and one log cabin in January of 1837 to 1500 people and 100
houses four months later (The Texas Handbook Online: Houston, TX).
Initially the city was not segregated and slaves lived scattered throughout the city’s
neighborhoods. There was a separate social structure for the whites and subordinate blacks
which continued beyond the Civil War and Emancipation. Schools, churches, and businesses
continued to be segregated and by the end of the nineteenth century residential segregation
was also present. Separate white, black, and later on Hispanic neighborhoods divided the
city.
The immigrants that came to the area following the Civil War founded settlements
along the rail lines that bisected the county. The Houston communities of Pasadena, Deer
Park, Houston Heights, Bellaire, Webster, La Porte, South Houston, and Genoa developed in
this manner and were eventually annexed into the city of Houston. By the 1930s Harris
County was the largest county and Houston was the largest city in Texas.
By the mid nineteenth century Houston and Harris County had become a center of
commerce. Products were imported into the Texas hinterland through Houston after being
offloaded from ocean going ships in Galveston. Exports included agricultural products such
as cotton, corn, and cow hides. The town became a railroad hub with six railways spreading
from 80.5 to 160.9 kilometers (50 to 100 miles) to the northwest, east, west, south, and
southeast. In 1873, Houston joined the national rail network when the Houston and Texas
Central reached Denison (The Texas Handbook Online: Harris County).
The expansion of Buffalo Bayou was essential to the commercial life of Houston and
a number of private ventures were undertaken over the years to widen and deepen the
channel. The Army Corp of Engineers took control of the project in 1881, eventually
creating the 15.2-meter (50-foot) deep Houston Ship Channel from Galveston Bay to a
turning basin above Brays Bayou. Additional public works projects included the creation of
Lake Houston reservoir in 1954 to reduce the dependence on subsurface water, the use of
which had caused up to 3 meters (9 feet) of subsidence surrounding the confluence of
Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. In 1935, the Harris County Flood Control District
was established and infrastructures such as the Addicks and Barker dams in western Harris
County were constructed. Channalization projects since this time along Houston area bayous
have significantly modified the landscape, and doubtlessly have affected archaeological sites
along these waterways. However, isolated and undisturbed areas along these watercourses
may still contain intact deposits (Abbott 2001:101).
The discovery of oil at Spindletop made Houston an important center for the
petroleum industry. The Ship Channel’s inland location made it safe from Gulf storms and
refineries began lining the banks in 1918. By 1929 forty oil companies had offices in
Houston. The outbreak of World War II created a demand for products made of
petrochemicals. The city would go on to become one of the two largest petrochemical
concentrations in the United States (The Texas Handbook Online: Houston, TX).

CHAPTER IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily buried
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. A discussion of research and
field methods is provided below.

RESEARCH DESIGN
The project area included six trail sections, which are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figures
A1 through A12. The construction activities associated with this undertaking will be restricted
to 3-meter (10-foot) permanent ROWs along natural bayou banks, artificial drainages, and
existing road ROWs. Subsurface excavation is expected to be required on trail construction
taking place along the natural and artificial watercourses, and these segments were subjected to
intensive pedestrian archaeological investigations. Trail segments proposed for placement on
existing roads are not expected to require subsurface disturbance, and therefore these areas were
not subjected to archaeological investigations.
Initially, it was determined that lighting conduits would be installed along each trail
segment, indicating that not only bayou banks, but streets, sidewalks, or potentially, areas
immediately adjacent to building foundations would be impacted by subsurface disturbance.
As discussed in Chapter I, however, current plans call for lighting conduits to be installed only
along trail segments proposed for development along bayou banks and artificial drainages,
namely, portions of the Little White Oak Bayou Trail, the Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor
Trail, the Keegans Bayou Trail, the West Brays Bayou Trail, and portions of the Westchase
District Trail. Trail development on the remaining segments or segment portions call for lane
re-striping only, or in the case of the Columbia Tap Union Station Trail, lane re-striping and use
of an existing Union Pacific railroad grade following track removal.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. Historic maps and aerial
photographs were also examined for specific sections when appropriate. Site file research
resulted in a listing of all archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the various
project areas, and all historic structures eligible for National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) listing located adjacent to the various project APEs. Site file research was used to
provide a historic context to the archaeological survey, and additional documentary research
was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development and history of the
APEs, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research was then used to
prepare an overview history of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual
framework of Harris County prehistory and history.
12

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to define all sites, prehistoric and historic, within the defined project boundaries. In
addition to site identification, the archaeological investigations must also provide sufficient
data to determine whether or not additional investigations will be required to evaluate fully
the potential eligibility of any newly defined site location for inclusion on the NRHP.
The Houston-Potential Archaeological Liability Map (PALM) Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled by the TxDOT Austin Environmental Affairs
Division, is a probability-modeling tool developed to assist researchers in determining
whether intact prehistoric archaeological deposits are likely to exist in a particular area
(Abbott 2001). Important to this survey, the PALM does not address probabilities associated
with the identification of historic archaeological resources, although current research
implemented by TxDOT is expected to eventually result in the development of a similar
management tool (Abbott 2001:167). Trail-specific PALMs were not provided to HRA Gray
& Pape for this project; instead, the location of each trail segment was plotted against maps
printed in Abbott’s 2001 resource.
Project areas associated with the Little White Oak Bayou Trail, the Columbia Tap
Union Station Trial, the Westchase District Trail, and the West Brays Bayou Trail are located
in PALM Unit 4. Map Unit 4 includes areas containing Pleistocene landforms without
Holocene deposits, or areas where heavy urbanization has likely destroyed the integrity of
archaeological sites. The close proximity of these project areas to natural watercourses (and
therefore potentially high probability areas) suggested the possibility that isolated deposits
located along bayou banks may have avoided destruction (Abbott 2001: 87-88, 101).
The Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor Project Area is located in PALM Unit 3(a).
Map Unit 3(a) includes areas that have not been recommended for surface survey or deep
testing, unless severe deep construction impacts are anticipated. Although prehistoric sites
would likely be sealed under several layers of historically introduced fill within this project
area, the research design developed for this project was created to consider the effects that
trail construction may have on potential historic deposits.
The project area associated with the Keegans Bayou Trail is located in PALM Units
2, 2(a), and 4. Map Unit 2 includes areas that have been recommended by TxDOT as
requiring surface survey activities, including shovel testing. Deep testing, such as by
backhoe or other mechanical means, is not recommended. Map Unit 2(a) includes areas that
have been recommended by TxDOT as requiring a surface survey of pimple mounds only.
Deep testing is not recommended in these areas.
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the investigations consisted of
observation point survey. Observation points provide a reference to maintain horizontal control
and provenience across a given survey area. In general, these observation points were
positioned at 30-meter (100-foot) intervals in areas considered to possess high probability for
13

containing cultural materials. Regardless of the interval, linear transects were utilized for the
positioning of these observations points across the specific survey area. All actions performed
at a specific observation point location, the general observations of the surveyor, and the results
of survey actions were recorded on an observation point log, which include provenience, survey
method, and cultural materials identified. No archaeological survey activities were performed at
observation points located in previously disturbed locations, areas located on excessive slope
(greater than 20 percent) or in areas containing standing water. However, information
concerning the environmental and topographic conditions identified at these observation points
was recorded on the observation point log.
In areas where sufficient surface visibility allowed for an examination of the ground
surface (i.e. surface visibility in excess of 30 percent), severe disturbance, or evidence of
artificial berms was observed; a surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was
performed at each observation point. The results of the surface inspection activities were
recorded on the observation point log. The majority of the investigations along the proposed
Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor Trail, Westchase District Trail, the West Brays Bayou Trail,
and the Columbia Tab Union Station Trail were performed utilizing this methodology. A
portion of the investigation along the proposed Little White Oak Bayou Trail was performed
utilizing this methodology.
In areas where surface visibility was less than 30 percent or natural stratigraphy was
indicated, intensive pedestrian investigations were performed by the excavation of 30centimeter (11.8-inch) shovel tests at each observation point. These shovel tests were typically
excavated to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39.3 inches) into the underlying substratum,
or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened through 1/4inch hardware cloth when possible. Soils with high clay content were sorted by trowel.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2000)
soil color charts. The results of the shovel test activities were recorded on the observation
point log and additional information concerning soils encountered and a profile drawing of the
exposed profiles were recorded on a shovel test form for each excavation. The majority of the
investigations along the Keegans Bayou Trail and a portion of the Little White Oak Bayou Trail
were performed utilizing this methodology. Prior to survey of the Keegans Bayou Trail, an
examination of historic maps indicated a potential for unmarked burials associated with the
Riceville Cemetery to be located immediately adjacent to this proposed trail segment.
Mechanical scraping was used to remove the topsoil within the Keegans Bayou ROW in an
effort to locate grave-shafts associated with unmarked burials. This effort was aided by
information obtained during informant interview from members of the Rice Village Mount
Olive Missionary Baptist Church.
In some instances, trail design was modified after fieldwork had been completed.
The results of previously completed fieldwork were used to determine whether or not
additional survey was appropriate. These revisions and recommendations for the need for
additional survey are indicated on each proposed trail map (Figures A1 through A12).

14

Archaeological material was not encountered during the survey of these proposed trail
segments. Therefore, a discussion of laboratory methods and artifact analysis is not provided in
this report.

CHAPTER V. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Surveys conducted near the bayous surrounding the Houston area have lead to the
identification of numerous archaeological sites. In general, prehistoric sites tend to cluster
near major watercourses to the north and east of Houston. Projects conducted on the shores
of Cypress Creek and the Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River basin, for example, have
uncovered several Native American sites ranging in date from the Paleoindian to the
Protohistoric Periods. In contrast, construction projects associated with the development and
expansion of downtown Houston has lead to the recording of numerous, mostly historic,
archaeological sites and historic properties in that area. Many of these date to an early
statehood period (circa 1850), or are associated with the city of Houston’s early development
(after 1836) and its reliance on the bayou system for the transportation of industrial goods.
Since the proposed trail sections described in this report will be located in various
areas of Harris County, a number of previously recorded cultural resources were identified in
the general vicinity of the proposed trail segments during site file research. None are within
the project APEs. These resources consisted primarily of Historic Period archaeological
sites. The results of the site file research and field survey are discussed in the following
section. No newly identified archaeological resources were encountered during the survey of
the currently proposed trail alignments.

LITTLE WHITE OAK BAYOU SURVEY AREA
The results of site file research indicate that there are no previously recorded cultural
resources in or immediately adjacent to the project ROW. Research also indicates that no
archaeological surveys have been located within the northern section of the project area, and
no archaeological sites have been recorded. However, there are three historic sites of
importance within a one-mile radius of the trail, and all are located to the north of the project
area. The first is Independence Park (marker number 97000544), which was established in
1910. Within the same general area two other historical structures are recorded. These
include the Cyrus, Ben C and Jenetter House (marker number 97000549), which was
constructed in 1915, and the General Mercantile Store (marker number 97000545),
constructed during the same time.
Two previous cultural resources surveys conducted in the east and southeast section
of this project area were both associated with the construction of the nearby IH-45
expressway. These surveys include the city of Houston survey, conducted in December 1998
(id # 2995-43118), and the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) survey conducted in
October of 1996. Within a one-mile radius of the project area only one archaeological site is
recorded. Site 41HR524, which is known as the Quezada site, is a multi-phase site
containing mostly historic artifacts. Survey efforts at that time were restricted to site

16

recordation activities. No artifacts were collected, and subsequent development of the
property led to the site’s destruction.
There are no previously recorded architectural resources immediately adjacent to the
project ROW. Two historically significant structures are recorded within a one-mile radius
of the project area. A few blocks to the east is the San Felipe Cottage. It is recorded as the
oldest structure in Houston. Farther to the south and east is the Edward Hall Mandell House.
Although the proximity of the project area to downtown Houston is important to the
historical development of this area, available development plans indicate that these historical
properties will not be impacted by trail construction.
The field survey associated with the Little White Oak Bayou Project Area consisted
of an archaeological investigation along the trail ROW (Figure A1). The archaeological
investigation took place along a segment of the proposed trail that will originate at Cavalcade
Street and continued north along the east bank of Little White Oak Bayou. The majority of
this segment is proposed for development on a narrow strip of property located between the
IH-45 frontage road and the east bank of the bayou (Plate B1). Surface visibility ranged
from 0 to 100 percent in areas disturbed by in-progress street repair and bridge construction.
Significant portions of the southern half of the segment have been disturbed by
previous roadway construction. Two shovel tests were excavated at 30-meter (100-foot)
intervals along this segment, located five meters from the north bank of the bayou in an area
suspected of being outside of the IH-45 construction ROW. In addition, in-progress
construction activities were noted during the survey within a section of the trail ROW
adjacent to Link Road (Plate B2). A section between Link and Enid Road was located along
a fence line on slopes greater than 20 percent, and therefore not surveyed. Buried cultural
resources were not identified during this survey. Soils encountered during excavation
consisted of a dark olive brown (2.5Y3/1) sandy loam extending from the surface to a depth
of 10 centimeters (3.9-inch), underlain by yellowish brown (10YR5/3) sandy clay to a depth
of 23 centimeters (9.05-inch). Mottled red clay was noted in one shovel test at this depth,
along with modern refuse consisting of concrete and modern nails. Below this was a dark
yellowish brown (10YR4/1) clay extending to a depth of 100 centimeters (3 feet).

BUFFALO BAYOU HERITAGE CORRIDOR SURVEY AREA
The results of site file research indicate that there are no previously recorded cultural
resources in or immediately adjacent to the project ROW. Research also indicates that no
archaeological surveys have been located within this portion of the project APE, and no
archaeological sites have been recorded. However, there are four historic sites and one
National Register District within a one-mile radius of the trail.
Site 41HR621 is recorded as a historic dump. This site is located on the south bank
of Buffalo Bayou, approximately 91.4 meters (100 yards) upstream from the McKee Street
Bridge. Cultural material recovered from the site included bottles and metal hardware; dates
for these materials range from 1875 to 1930. At the time of discovery, this site showed signs
of looting. Site 41HR907 is also a historic site. This site is located along the northern bank
17

of Buffalo Bayou, between Elysian Road and Highway 59. Cultural material noted at this
site included brick, slag, metal, and glass, and there is a brick wall or support pier feature
associated with the site. Also located along Buffalo Bayou between Elysian Road and
Highway 59 is a historic structure site, Site 41HR908. Associated with this site are brick and
glass artifacts, as well as a brick footing. This site likely dates to the late 19th century.
Finally, Site 41HR982 is the location of Frost Town. This town was founded around 1822.
There are numerous features associated with this site, including cisterns, postmolds, and
piers.
In addition to these archeological sites, there is a NRHP district located to the south
of the project area. This property, the Myers-Spalti Manufacturing Plant, is significant for its
Italianate architecture and for events that took place in the area. While the plant was initially
a furniture manufacturing facility, in later years it has been a wire and metal manufacturing
facility. Later, it was the El Mercado del Sol shopping mall. Currently, the facility is a good
example of adaptive reuse, as the building will become the Runnels Lofts, a residential
development.
A total of four surveys have been conducted within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the
project area. These include the survey of a large parcel to the south and west of the project
area by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) in 1982. Also, an area to
the north of the project area was surveyed in association with wastewater treatment and
collection systems (Texas Antiquities Code [TAC] permit #1641). A third survey includes a
City of Houston Survey of a bicycle trail (TAC Permit #3540). Finally, a survey of road
project (TAC Permit #3749) was conducted to the west of the project area.
The majority of the Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor Project Area will be constructed
on private land. While survey permission was given for portions of the project area, other
areas were considered “no access” due to lack of survey permission. This investigation
originated at McKee Road, and continued east along the north bank of the bayou (Figure
A12). Surface visibility ranged from 75 to 100 percent throughout the ROW. A pedestrian
survey utilizing observation points spaced at 30-meter (100-foot) intervals revealed that the
ground surface consisted of several meters of introduced fill material made of sand
intermixed with concrete and gravel (Plates B3 and B4). Trail construction is expected to
take place on the high bank of Buffalo Bayou and entirely within this layer of introduced fill.
As currently planned, trail construction is not expected to extend into the natural ground
surface.

COLUMBIA TAP UNION STATION SURVEY AREA
Although construction in downtown Houston has led to the identification of
numerous archaeological sites near the western edge of Highway 59, no previous surveys
have been conducted intersecting the current project ROW. Prior surveys conducted within a
few blocks of the project area have primarily consisted of neighborhood-level surveys
designed to identify architectural resources. These resources are discussed below.

18

There are no previously recorded cultural resources in or immediately adjacent to the
project ROW. Fourteen previously recorded archaeological sites have been identified within
a one-mile radius, all of which date to the Historic Period. Most are associated with the late
nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. The majority of identified sites located within a few
block radius of the trail fall within the Settegast quadrangle map. Site 41HR508, known as
the Trimbel site, is reported as historic dump; Site 41HR795 is reported as the location of a
historic residence containing architectural artifacts such as plaster and 19th century glass.
Site 41HR820 is reported as an early statehood historic site, excavated during the Ball Park at
Union Station project. Site 41HR859 is reported as a historic site that included three privies
and two refuse deposits. Site 41HR861 is a historic site with two identified cisterns. Site
41HR863 is a historic residence (ca.1870). Site 41HR864 is the remains of a historic
structure (block 288) dating to a pre-1870 occupation. Site 41HR860 is a historic fence line
(ca.1830-1870). Site 41HR621 is a historic dump (date not indicated). Site 41HR747 is an
industrial dump (date not indicated). Site 41HR575 is a historic site reported to contain
munitions, flatware, glass and ceramics ca. 1860-1880. Site 41HR787 is a historic site
containing glass, ceramics, bricks and metal ca. 1850. Site 41HR409 is a mixed component
site, prehistoric lithics and historic era ceramics, glass and bones. Site 41HR752 is a historic
site containing ceramic and bottles, ca. 1836-1860.
The proposed Columbia Tap-Union Station Trail will follow a railroad grade for its
initial 440 meters (1444 feet), and continue to the northeast down Bastrop, to its point of
termination at the intersection of Bastrop and Texas Avenue (Figure A2). The trail will be
built on the abandoned railroad grade or will consist of street re-stripping. The entire
segment was surveyed by reconnaissance.

WESTCHASE DISTRICT SURVEY AREA
Site file research reveals the existence of 14 previously recorded sites, two linear
surveys and two area surveys within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the proposed Westchase
District Trail. All the sites are reported to contain only prehistoric materials.
Site 41HR788 lies approximately 600 meters (1969 feet) west of the end of the
proposed ROW. It is reported to contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds, bone, and projectile
points. Site 41HR811 lies approximately 1100 meters (3609 feet) to the north of the
proposed ROW. It is reported to contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds and projectile points.
Site 41HR745 lies approximately 1300 meters (4265 feet) to the north. It is reported to
contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds and projectile points. Site 41HR810 lies approximately
1350 meters (4429 feet) to the north. It is reported to contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds
and projectile points. Site 41HR809 lies approximately 1450 meters (4757 feet) to the north.
It is reported to contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds and projectile points. Site 41HR217 lies
approximately 1130 meters (3707 feet) to the west. It is reported to contain chert flakes. Site
41HR272 lies approximately 1190 meters (3904 feet) to the west. It is reported to contain
chert flakes. Site 41HR293 lies approximately 1200 meters (3937 feet) to the north. It is
reported to contain chert flakes, ceramic sherds and projectile points. Site 41HR294 lies
approximately 1245 meters (4085 feet) to the north. It is reported to contain chert flakes. Site
41HR295 lies approximately 1365 meters (4478 feet) to the north. It is reported to contain
19

chert flakes. Site 41HR311 lies approximately 1240 meters (4068 feet) to the west. It is
reported to contain ceramics and chert debitage. A chert core was recovered as well. Site
41HR323 lies approximately 1300 meters (4265 feet) to the north. It is reported to contain
chert flakes. Site 41HR112 and Site 41HR113 are recorded approximately 700 to 800 meters
(2297 to 2625 feet) to the northwest. The Texas Historical Commission records indicate that
there are no contents for these sites.
In addition, both block and linear surveys have been conducted within a one-mile
radius to the north, east and west of the proposed ROW. These surveys produced no sites.
During the field survey, the initial segment of trail that runs along a constructed
drainage was assessed as clearly man-made and of very low archaeological potential (Figure
A3 and Plate B5). No subsurface testing was attempted. Subsurface testing was not
attempted for the trail segment that extends along Blue Willow Street due to the fact that the
trail will utilize existing streets. The section of the trail that runs west to Wilcrest and east
then south to Richmond will follow ROW on top of an existing drainage bank constructed
with fill deposits. The bank is lined with riprap or concrete for most of its length (Plate B6).
No subsurface testing was attempted for this section of trail.

WEST BRAYS BAYOU SURVEY AREA
No previously identified sites are to be found within 1600 meters (1 mile) radius of
the West Brays Bayou trail. Six linear surveys have been conducted, between November
1987 and May 1997, by various entities with no sites reported. The surveys include: Harris
County Flood Control District 5/97, Texas Water Development Board 5/96 (three linear
segments), Federal Highway Administration 11/87, and Galveston Corps of Engineers 12/83.
Field observation indicated that the entire trail segment will be constructed adjacent
to the heavily channelized bayou bank on top of artificial levees (Figures A5 through A7).
These levees contain at least 1 meter (3 feet) of introduced soil, and remnants of an existing
asphalt trial in some areas (Plates B7 and B8). A reconnaissance survey was conducted for
the length of the proposed West Brays Bayou Trail in an effort to identify areas with the
potential to contain intact soils. Subsurface testing was not attempted for this trail segment.

KEEGANS BAYOU SURVEY AREA
Various surveys have bisected or were conducted in close proximity to the proposed
Keegans Bayou trail ROW. A Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) survey in March
1985 followed the Highway 59 route near its intersection with Keegans Bayou. A TxDOT
survey of September 1984 followed a northwest transect from Highway 59; similarly, the
TxDOT survey of January 1985 continued the preceding survey to the southeast of Highway
59. The UMTA survey of March 1985 (id# 2995-3148) transected both the lines of the
FHWA survey and the line of the current project. The most important survey conducted for
this project area is the Harris County Flood Control District survey of May 1997. This is the

20

only previous survey that followed Keegans Bayou, and it was restricted to areas where the
bayou came into contact with two suburban development areas.
There are no previously recorded archaeological sites in or immediately adjacent to
the project ROW. Within a one-mile radius of the proposed Keegans Bayou Trail, one
archaeological site has been recorded. Site 41HR564 consists of an open campsite with a
lithic scatter. The site is recorded as being heavily disturbed and eroded and no further
testing was recommended.
There are no historic-age structures recorded along the banks of Keegans Bayou; this
is possibly due, at least in part, to the fact that urban development occurred relatively
recently in the area. The nearest recorded historic properties are listed in the Sugar Land area
a few miles south of the project area, well beyond the scope of any impact. During field
survey, however, it was determined that the established boundary of the Riceville Cemetery
was sufficiently close to the proposed trail construction corridor to warrant additional
investigation. A discussion of these activities is provided later in this chapter.
Archival review indicates that the Riceville Cemetery was associated with the
Riceville Mount Olive Baptist Church. In March of 1889, the late Reverend John Lilly
organized the church in a brush arbor. Later that year, John Ruby donated a parcel of land to
be used for the church and burial grounds. This parcel was located on the back of Keegans
Bayou. The church was destroyed by a storm in 1916 (Ira Price, personal communication
2006). The church was rebuilt, and burned to the ground in 1967. Once again, the church
was rebuilt, this time on a different location (www.ricevillemtolivebaptistchurch.org). The
town of Riceville was located on Bray’s Bayou to the east of Highway 59. Founded in the
1850s, the town was a farming community composed of primarily African-Americans.
Riceville was annexed by the City of Houston in the late 1960s (Handbook of Texas Online,
s.v. Riceville). The boundaries of the current cemetery are not fenced.
The Keegans Bayou segment showed the least evidence of prior disturbance;
therefore, intensive archaeological survey efforts were employed during fieldwork.
Observation Points (OPs) for this survey include shovel tests as described in the Methods
section and surface inspection where shovel testing was not appropriate (Figures A8 through
A10). Pedestrian inspection was utilized where the surface was concrete, or the soil was
determined to contain impenetrable fill made of concrete and asphalt. One hundred and two
OPs were recorded. Of these, 58 were sub-surface investigations and included 51 shovel tests
and 7 soil probe tests. None of the sub-surface testing revealed cultural materials or activities
beyond the process of channelization and maintenance of the bayou or adjacent infrastructure
(Plates B9 and B10). Shovel tests ranged in depth from 10 centimeters to 90 centimeters (4
inches to 35 inches). Concrete was commonly found as deep as 50 cm (18 inches). Where
other shovel tests revealed native soils no cultural materials or evidence for cultural activities
were observed.
Surface observation of the ROW adjacent to the Riceville Cemetery indicated that a
significant amount of clay overburden had been removed from the bayou during channelization
activities and deposited on the bank to create a low, artificial berm. Despite the presence of
these introduced soils and modification to the bayou bank to improve drainage, several
21

depressions in the ground suggested a potential for unmarked burial locations adjacent to the
proposed trail ROW. In addition, a number of headstones or other burial markers were adjacent
to the proposed trail. Mechanical scraping by backhoe was used to remove the topsoil near the
depressions and the marked graves closest to the proposed route, and the subsoil was examined
for color or texture changes. General observations about the soil matrix were made for each
trench, but detailed soil descriptions were recorded only when evidence for unmarked burials
were encountered.
Four trenches were mechanically scraped within the proposed ROW adjacent to the
known boundaries of the Riceville Cemetery (Figures A8 and A11), as it was defined during
initial survey; a discussion of how the results of this activity affected trail design and ROW
location is provided below. Trench location was judgmentally determined based on surface
conditions, evidence or absence of prior ground disturbance, the location of marked graves
within the cemetery, and topographic features adjacent to the proposed trail alignment that
suggested the potential presence of unmarked burials. Trench dimensions varied based on
similar criteria. Trenches were placed as close to the bank of the bayou as safely feasible.
TRENCH 1
Trench 1 was excavated furthest to the south in a section of the proposed trail that was
believed to be well south of the cemetery boundaries. The trench measured 6 meters (19.7 feet)
long, 1 meter (3 feet) wide, and extended to a depth of 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) below the
ground surface. The soils in this trench were composed of a single stratum of hard packed
sandy clay intermixed with yellow and red mottled clay. This soil profile was interpreted as
evidence of past channelization and redeposition activity. No cultural material or deposits were
observed in Trench 1.
TRENCH 2
Trench 2 was excavated adjacent to a series of shallow depressions that were suspected
to indicate the presence of unmarked burials. This trench was the longest of the four trenches
excavated, and measured 35 meters (114.8 feet) in length and varied in width from between 1
meter (3 feet) and 2 meters (6 feet). Trench depth varied from between 1 meter (3 feet) on the
southern end to 40 centimeters (15.7 inches).
Excavation of Trench 2 resulted in the identification of a concrete crypt and three grave
shaft locations (Figure A11). The tops of these features were estimated to be between
approximately 20 centimeters and 40 centimeters (7.8 inches and 15.7 inches) below the modern
ground surface. Trench excavation was halted when evidence of a grave shaft or other feature
was observed. If a grave shaft or feature was encountered the area was shovel scraped and
probed in an effort to define the boundaries of the feature. The floor and the west wall of
Trench 2 were cleaned in an effort to determine the depth and size of the shaft features. The
outlines of the shafts were drawn in plan view and the trenches were photo documented.
Excavation activities were limited to what was necessary to identify and delineate the burial
features. No cultural material or human remains were identified or collected from feature
locations in Trench 2.

22

Excavation and interpretation of the burial dimensions was hampered by the presence of
highly compacted, mottled clays and unconsolidated spoil material that had been deposited
adjacent to and over the burials; shaft delineation was accomplished by a combination of surface
observation, soil probing, and change in soil texture. In general, the eastern edges of the grave
features were located approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) from the west bank of Keegans Bayou.
Examination of the eastern portion of the trench confirmed that no additional unmarked burials
were present closer to the bayou. The archaeological survey crew flagged the location of each
feature, recorded sub-meter Global Positioning System (GPS) positions, and, after trench
backfilling, placed staking approximately 2 meters (6 feet) from the mapped end of the burial
shafts to create a construction buffer to assist the engineers in the redesign of the trail route (see
Figure A11).
TRENCH 3
Trench 3 was excavated adjacent to a series of headstones south of a culvert that drains
into Keegans Bayou. The trench measured 10 meters (32.8 feet) long, 1 meter (3 feet) wide, and
extended to a depth of 65 centimeters (25.5 inches) below the ground surface. The soils in this
trench were similar to those observed in Trench 1, but contained a higher quantity of yellow and
red mottled clays and unconsolidated fill material. This soil profile was interpreted as evidence
of past channelization and redeposition activity. No cultural material, deposits, or evidence of
grave shafts were observed in Trench 3.
TRENCH 4
Trench 4 was excavated adjacent to a series of headstones to the north of the culvert.
The trench measured 10 meters (32.8 feet) long, 1 meter (3 feet) wide, and extended to a depth
of 75 centimeters (29.5 inches) below the ground surface. The soils in this trench were similar
to those observed in Trench 3, and interpreted as evidence of past channelization and
redeposition activity. No cultural material, deposits, or evidence of grave shafts were observed
in Trench 4.

CHAPTER VI. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted on the
proposed ROW for six separate Hike and Bike trails. These ROWs have all been heavily
impacted by modern construction activities associated with the channelization of waterways for
the purpose of flood control, or by road building and maintenance. Archaeological survey of
five of the trails indicated that construction activities are unlikely to impact intact archeological
deposits. Survey of the portion of the Keegans Bayou trail ROW adjacent to the Riceville
Cemetery indicates that the cemetery contains at least four unmarked burials outside of, but in
close proximity to, proposed trail construction. In some instances, trail design was modified
after fieldwork had been completed. The results of previously completed fieldwork and
aerial photography were used to determine whether or not additional survey was appropriate.
Management recommendations in association with each of the proposed trails are provided
below.
Intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed Little White Oak Bayou Trail found only
urban soils and concrete. Most of the trail will utilize existing roads. No additional work is
recommended along this proposed trail.
The Columbia Tap Union Station Trail will be built on abandoned railroad grade except
for the portion utilizing existing roadway. No additional work is recommended along this
proposed trail.
The Westchase District Trail begins on a constructed embankment, follows existing
roadway for much of its length, and concludes on a constructed embankment. No additional
work is recommended along this proposed trail.
The West Brays Bayou Trail proposed ROW will be placed entirely on top of an
artificial levy, along a section of the bayou that has been significantly modified by past
channelization activities. Trail construction is not expected to extend into the natural ground
surface. No additional work is recommended along this proposed trail.
Survey of the proposed Buffalo Bayou Heritage Corridor trail was completed by
reconnaissance survey on all property for which landowner access had been granted. Surface
observation indicates that the trail will be located on several meters of introduced fill material.
Although the exact route has not been determined, the remainder of the planned trail is expected
to be located on developed land owned by Halliburton. This property has been extensively
modified, and additional survey is not recommended in this areas.
Of all the proposed trails, Keegan’s Bayou required the most intensive survey. Much of
the length of the proposed ROW was found to be heavily disturbed. However, particular
attention was paid to the area where Keegans Bayou Trail runs adjacent to the Riceville

24

Cemetery, and investigation indicates that a series of unmarked burials are located within the
southernmost cemetery boundaries adjacent to what is currently proposed for the trail ROW.
The trail design has been modified to avoid these burials; the plans include a
construction buffer area between the grave locations and the trail route, and the bayou bank will
be extended through the construction of retaining walls. However, detailed plans for this have
not yet been developed and therefore cannot be included in this report. Based on the currently
available information, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further work be required in
association with the Keegans Bayou trail as long as the design of the proposed trail contains a
buffer between the trail and the cemetery to avoid the unmarked burials identified during
survey. However, should the design be changed to an alignment that would include the burials
within the APE, then additional work would be warranted.
