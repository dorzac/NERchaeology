Abstract
Reported herein is a summary of the activities conducted during the 2006-2007
Northwestern State University Regional Archaeology Program grant year for Management Unit 1.
Approximately 580 acres were surveyed. Twenty-four new archaeological sites were recorded
and information was updated on four previously recorded sites. An archaeogeophysical survey
was conducted at the Mounds Plantation Site (16CD12) and potential subsurface features were
identified. Mounds Plantation previously has been considered eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places by the State of Louisiana. Seven 1-x-1-m test units were
excavated at the Swan Lake Site (16BO11) demonstrating the presence of intact midden and
probable prehistoric features. The site appears to meet criteria for listing on the National
Register. Eighteen new sites were recorded along Toledo Bend Reservoir in Sabine Parish
(16SA252-269). Ten have low research potential and do not meet criteria for nomination to the
National Register. A previously recorded site (16SA91) also does not meet NRHP eligibility
criteria. The remaining eight sites require additional investigation to determine whether or not
they meet National Register eligibility criteria. Three 50-x-50-cm shovel tests were excavated at
the Delrie No. 1 (16NA416) site. Although the site contains intact midden deposits, extensive
disturbances limit research potential and the site does not meet National Register eligibility
criteria. One of two sites recorded along Lake Vernon, 16VN3601, also requires additional
investigations. The second site (16VN3600) has low research potential and does not meet NRHP
eligibility criteria. The remaining four recorded sites (16CD317, 16RA1374, 16RA1375, and
16NA624) require additional testing. All collections acquired during the grant year will be curated
at Northwestern State University. Eight landowners were contacted during the grant year. Public
outreach efforts included 16 presentations at conferences and to local organizations. Assistance
and information also was provided to local individuals, museums, and other organizations for the
development of public displays and other projects. Three papers were published in regional
archaeological journals.

REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY PROGRAM
Management Unit 1
Eighteenth Annual Report
Introduction
This report summarizes the activities of the Regional Archaeologist for Management Unit 1
for the 2006-2007 grant year. Management Unit 1 consists of 13 parishes in the northwestern
portion of Louisiana (Figure 1). The Regional Archaeology Program was established in the fall of
1989 and has continued through agreements between Northwestern State University of Louisiana
and the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, Office of Cultural
Development, Division of Archaeology. The program is funded in part from the National Park
Service FY 2006 Historic Preservation Fund.

Figure 1. Parishes of Management Unit 1
Annual Action Plan and Summary of Field Work
For the 2006-2007 grant year, I planned to carry out surface surveys in three areas: (1)
upper portions of Toledo Bend Reservoir in DeSoto Parish; (2) a segment of the upper Bayou
Pierre drainage in DeSoto and Red River Parishes; and (3) Black Lake in Natchitoches Parish. I
also planned an archaeogeophysical survey at the Mounds Plantation site (16CD12) in Caddo
Parish.
Lake levels in Toledo Bend reservoir were at record lows during the late summer and early
fall of 2006 and I received reports of intensive collecting and digging of sites beneath the normal
pool level in the upper portion of the lake. Because the northern end of the reservoir had been
exposed for a long period of time, most dry areas beneath the normal pool level were covered by
vegetation. The middle portion of the reservoir, however, had large tracts where surface visibility
was excellent.
In this section I surveyed approximately 550 acres, recorded 18 new
archaeological sites (16SA252 through 16SA269), and updated information on one previously
recorded site (16SA91) (Figure 2). I also met with the director of the Sabine River Authority to
discuss the problems with collecting and other damage to the sites. In October 2006, sustained
rains raised the reservoir level to near the normal pool level where it has since remained.

Figure 2. General locations of investigated areas
Survey along Bayou Pierre was not carried out as additional information about possible 18th
century occupation of the area indicated that it was unlikely that significant sites would be situated
in the low-lying wildlife management area. However, an attempt was made to locate a historic
Indian village plotted on an 1833 survey plat west of the Bayou Pierre area. A prehistoric site
(16CD317) was found in the surveyed area, but I was unable to locate the early 19th century site.
The planned Department of Wildlife and Fisheries draw down of Black Lake in Natchitoches
Parish did not result in exposure of significant landforms as expected, and no surveys were
carried out. However, in November 2006, the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries lowered Lake
Vernon (Vernon Parish) 6 to 8 ft below the normal pool level. With the help of members of the
West Louisiana Chapter of the Louisiana Archaeological Society, I surveyed approximately 20
acres along the shoreline and recorded two new archaeological sites (16VN3600 and
16VN3601). Heavy rains that occurred shortly after this survey resulted in a return of the lake to
normal pool level.
An archaeogeophysical survey was conducted of four sample blocks at the Mounds
Plantation site (16CD12). The blocks consisted of seven 20-x-20 m units on and around Mound
2, four 20-x-20 m units in the western portion of the plaza, six 20-x-20 m units on Mound 6, and
four 20-x-20 m units on Mound 7. Surface collections were made from the Mound 7 units. The
survey was conducted using a gradiometer, electrical resistance meter, and ground penetrating
radar. The results point to several areas where prehistoric features are likely to be located.
The landowner of the Swan Lake Site (16BO11), an important Caddo mound site in Bossier
Parish, initiated the selling of her property in 2006. In order to test the site for eligibility to the
National Register of Historic Places, we excavated seven 1-x-1-m test units. I also analyzed
artifacts recovered from six previously unreported shovel tests excavated by Louis Baker of the
Louisiana Archaeological Society, and a large surface collection donated by the landowners.
Three 50-x-50-cm shovel tests were excavated at the Delrie No. 1 Site (16NA416) in
Natchitoches Parish. The tests indicated that the site contains intact midden deposits, but no
archaeological features were encountered.

2

Finally, historic features encountered by landowners in Natchitoches and Rapides parishes
resulted in survey of approximately 10 acres along Bayou Boeuf and the recording of three new
archaeological sites (16NA624, 16RA1374, and 16RA1375).
A total of eight landowners were contacted during the grant year.
Management Issues
Archaeogeophysical investigations at the Mounds Plantation site (16CD12) demonstrated
that significant intact deposits are present on the eastern periphery. Although the site is eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places, the landowners do not wish to pursue a nomination at
this time. Test excavations at the Swan Lake site demonstrated the presence of three distinct
occupations, all of which appear to have intact archaeological features. The site appears to meet
criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the sites recorded
along Toledo Bend Reservoir are eroded, contain few artifacts, and have limited research
potential. These sites do not meet criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places (Table 1). Seven sites, despite having undergone some erosion from lake level
fluctuations, have material remains in substantial amounts and may contain data useful for
addressing significant research questions. These sites require subsurface investigations to
determine depths of deposits and to test for the presence of datable features. Lake Vernon No. 1
(16VN3600) is a small, eroded lithic scatter with limited research potential. Lake Vernon No. 2
(16VN3601) appears to have a substantial Late Archaic period component that might be of
considerable research significance. However, lowering of the lake exposed only a small portion
of the site. Additional survey and subsurface testing is necessary to assess whether or not the
site meets criteria for nomination to the National Register.

Material remains at the Mulford Site (16CD317) appear to be limited and it is possible that
several occupations are intermixed. However, the site is in good condition and requires more
extensive subsurface testing to determine its research potential. Test units at the Delire No. 1
Site (16NA416) demonstrated that intact midden deposits remain on the western side of the site.
Extensive disturbances from historic residential activities, however, limit the research potential of
this site and it does not appear to meet criteria for nomination to the National Register. The
Chaseland Sugar Mill (16RA1374) and Chase Home Site (16RA1375) both appear to have
excellent potential to address significant research questions. However, in order to prepare a
nomination to the National Register, additional fieldwork is needed to better determine site
boundaries and to test for subsurface features. Investigations at the Calvin Clark site (16NA624)
were limited in scope and insufficient information is available to determine whether or not the site
contains significant research information.Curation of Records and Artifacts
Curation of Records and Artifacts
All records and artifacts resulting from this project are curated in the Williamson Museum
collections at Northwestern State University of Louisiana.
Professional Presentations and Outreach Activities
I presented papers at a symposium on historic Caddo sites at Stephen F. Austin University
(Nacogdoches, Texas); at the Annual Meeting of the Louisiana Archaeological Society in
Leesville, Louisiana; and at the Caddo Conference at Southern Arkansas University (Magnolia,
Arkansas). Public presentations were made at several events during the grant year (Table 2). I
published papers in Louisiana Archaeology (Girard 2006a), the Caddo Archaeology Journal
(Girard 2007a) and the Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology (Girard 2007b). I also had two
printed in the newsletter of the Louisiana Archaeological Society and one in the newsletter of the
Red River Refuge Alliance, Inc.
Other outreach activities included: (1) organized a tour of the Mounds Plantation and Swan
Lake sites for members of the Caddo Nation; (2) helped design and assemble a display of
artifacts in the Ralph McKinney collection and from the Caddo Nation for the Bossier History
Center; (3) provided information and advice for displays at the Minden Museum in Webster
Parish; (4) participated in a planning session of the Caddo Lake Heritage Tourism Initiative in Oil
City; (5) participated in the forming of the Red River Heritage Association and their investigation
of the Colfax Courthouse in Grant Parish; (6) participated in a planning session for the El Camino
Real National Historical Trail in Natchitoches; and (7) organized a tour of sites along Cane River
for the Northwest Chapter of the Louisiana Archaeological Society. Finally, Mr. Jameel Damlouji
of Shreveport and I re-organized the Northwest Chapter of the Louisiana Archaeological Society
and recruited approximately 30 new members.

Environmental Setting of Management Unit 1
Three basic physiographic areas are included within Management Unit 1: (1) Tertiary
uplands; (2) Pleistocene terraces; and (3) Holocene alluvial valleys.
Tertiary Uplands
The Tertiary uplands constitute the largest land area within Management Unit 1. Tertiary
deposits range from the Paleocene Wilcox and Midway Groups (deposited ca. 60 million years
ago) in the northwest portion of the region, to Pliocene formations (deposited ca. 3 million years
ago) along the southeastern edge. Sediments consist of alternating beds of massive sands,
carbonaceous shales, and calcareous shales and silts. Included are ironstone and limestone
concretions, seams of lignitic silts, and petrified wood gravels (Murray 1948:85-88). The Tertiary
formations were deposited as marine sediments that subsequently were uplifted, faulted, and
differentially eroded producing a complex spatial pattern of surface geology and soils (Hudnall
and Edwards 1991:110). Presently, the region has a low, rolling hill topography with narrow
ridgetops and steep adjoining slopes.
Archaeological sites resulting from human occupation throughout prehistory are numerous
on upland ridges and ridge slopes. Because surfaces are stable or eroded, these sites have little
depth and materials from long periods of time often are mixed together. The Delrie No. 1 site
(16NA416) is located on a bench, or level portion of a Tertiary ridges slope. The Lake Vernon
sites (16VN3600 and 16VN3601) and the Mulford Site (16CD317) are located along the lower
slopes of Tertiary ridges.
Most areas in the Tertiary uplands are in timber production or pasture. Thick vegetation
often makes it difficult to identify sites. However, artifacts frequently are found on eroded logging
roads and in areas where surfaces have been disturbed by logging machinery. Logging activities,
building and road construction, erosion, and treasure hunting produce the most damage to sites
in the uplands.
Alluvial floodplains are present along some of the major tributary streams draining the
uplands. Deeply buried sites, and sites containing stratified contexts with vertical separation of
distinct occupations are present in some of these floodplain settings. The largest streams are
located east of Red River and include Bayou Dorcheat, Bayou Bodcau, Black Lake Bayou, Saline
Bayou, the Dugdemona River, and the upper reaches of Bayou DâArbonne.
Pleistocene Terraces
Remnants of Pleistocene terraces border portions of the Red River and Sabine River
floodplains. A major region of Pleistocene deposits borders Bayou Dorcheat in Webster Parish
and probably relates to an ancestral course of the Red River. Small areas representing
Pleistocene terrace remnants also are present along the margin of the Sabine River floodplain.
One site recorded during the grant year, Toledo Bend No. 19 (16SA269), is located in this setting.
In some areas these terraces slope gradually to the floodplain; whereas in other areas bluffs as
much as 7 to 9 m high are present. The Pleistocene terraces contain less surface relief than the
Tertiary hills. A gently rolling topography, dissected by small tributary streams, is typical.
Sediments range from clays to sands and often contain gravel. Soils tend to have loamy surface
horizons with finer grained subsoils.
The terraces were formed as alluvial deposits from major Pleistocene rivers. Initially, four
distinct geomorphic surfaces were identified corresponding to major periods of stream cutting as
a result of glacial melt in the interstadial periods of the Pleistocene (Fisk 1940). Fiskâs ideas have
been revised by Autin et al. (1991), who recognize Upland, Intermediate, and Prairie complexes.
The most recent surfaces associated with the Prairie complex were deposited 25,000 to 30,000
years ago (Autin et al. 1991:557) and thus pre-date evidence of human occupation in the region.
Slopewash from Tertiary ridges has covered portions of the terraces, but, in general, the lack of
Holocene deposition on these surfaces precludes the presence of stratified archaeological
contexts.

5

Stability of the terrace surfaces over long time periods has produced well-defined soil
horizons. In general, sandy loam surface horizons are underlain by clay or clay loam argillic B
horizons formed by the downward movement and accretion of fine particles and minerals. In
some areas where soils have formed in a combination of sandy alluvium and slopewash, soil
profiles are sandy or loamy throughout. Bioturbation from both vegetation and burrowing animals
tends to be intense in the upper sandy soil horizons. Subsurface concentrations of artifacts often
are found along the contact of the sandier upper soil horizons with clay (argillic) subsoil (B
horizon) due to the effects of rodent burrowing to this depth.
In isolated places, a terminal Pleistocene depositional unit known as the Deweyville complex
has been identified. Dating the time of deposition of the complex has been controversial with
some estimates in the 30,000-17,000 BP range, others as recently as 10,000 BP. The latter is
within the time frame of Paleoindian period suggesting that Deweyville surfaces buried by early
Holocene deposits may contain Paleoindian sites that are not mixed with later components. The
Deweyville complex has been identified as a surface exposure only in small areas at the back of
the Red River floodplain. Elsewhere, the complex appears to be buried beneath Holocene
floodplain sediments (Autin 1993:11).
Although some areas are used for crop production, most of the Pleistocene terraces are in
pasture or timber. Negative impacts on sites are from logging activity, residential and commercial
development, treasure hunting, and plowing.
Major Holocene Alluvial Floodplains
Portions of four major alluvial floodplains (Red River, Sabine River, Little River, and
Calcasieu River) are present in Management Unit 1. The floodplains are characterized by
relatively flat topography with low rises from over bank deposition due to periodic flooding. The
largest floodplain is that of Red River. Red River has a meandering channel pattern with well
developed floodplain features such as natural levees, point bars, backswamps (inter-levee
lowlands), crevasse splays, oxbow lakes, abandoned channels and channel segments. The
floodplain environment is highly dynamic due to channel migration, high sediment load and
frequent flooding, and a tendency for bank caving (with the consequence of rafting).
Understanding prehistoric settlement of the Red River drainage is linked closely with
understanding changes in the floodplain landforms. Whether a particular area is within an active
meander belt, a recently abandoned belt, or a long abandoned belt has important implications
with regard to factors such as distribution of biotic resources, soil conditions, bank erosion, and
propensity for flooding. Because of the dynamic nature of the Red River floodplain, all of these
conditions underwent changes during the Holocene in any given area. Floodplain dynamics also
are important for understanding the structure of the archaeological record. Sites on landforms
with highly stable surfaces often accumulate materials from cultural activity over long time periods
resulting in a complex archaeological record difficult to translate into specific human activities
(Ferring 1986). Areas prone to frequent flooding may have stratified deposits where artifacts from
relatively short intervals are separated by sterile sediments. Slowly accumulating deposits may
provide some vertical separation of temporally distinct episodes of artifact deposition, but no
distinct strata will be visible and materials will be subject to mixing from bioturbation and other
pedogenic processes. Sites located in areas subject to bank erosion may be truncated spatially
and provide only a partial picture of the range of activities that took place during site occupation.
Mounds Plantation (16CD12) is situated adjacent to an abandoned channel segment within
the modern meander belt of the Red River. Swan Lake is an abandoned channel segment that
was associated with an older meander belt. Bayou Boeuf, along which the Chaseland Sugar Mill
and Chase Home sites are located, represents an old course of the Red River in southern
Rapides Parish. The Calvin Clark site is along Cane River, a channel of the Red River
abandoned in the early 19th century.
Most of the alluvial floodplain of the Sabine River in Management Unit 1 is flooded by Toledo
Bend Reservoir, which was impounded in 1967. Before inundation, the Sabine had a meandering
channel pattern with floodplain features similar to the Red, although on a smaller scale.
6

Unfortunately, few studies concerning the development of the Sabine floodplain have been
conducted. Only minimal archaeological research was conducted prior to reservoir construction,
and most cultural resources have been lost or no longer are accessible for study. Low lake levels
in the late summer and early fall of 2006, enabled survey of the eastern edge of the floodplain.
Most of the recorded sites are situated on a series of natural levees along a course of the Sabine
that had been abandoned by historic times.
The upper reaches of the Calcasieu River are located in Rapides and Vernon parishes along
the southern edge of Management Unit 1. The Calcasieu differs from the Red and Sabine in its
anastomising channel pattern consisting of a network of channels that divide and rejoin alluvial
islands (Waters 1992:143). The floodplain is aggrading due to vertical accretion on the islands
during overbank flooding. Little lateral movement of the channels occurs because of the finegrained sediments (silts and clays) and dense vegetation on the islands. Shifting of channels
does take place but meanders rarely develop to the point of becoming cut off. Hence, unlike the
Red River floodplain, there has been no meander belt development (Fisk 1940:53). The potential
for the presence of deep sites in vertically stratified sediments is excellent in the Calcasieu
floodplain. However, relative to the Red and Sabine, habitable areas are small in extent, and
frequent flooding and changes in the channel course make the environment less stable for human
habitation. Currently, almost all of the area is used for timber production. Impacts on sites are
due to logging activities and treasure hunting.
Little River begins at the confluence of Dugdemona River and Castor Creek in northeastern
Grant Parish. The river meanders in a generally southeastern course to Catahoula Lake. Lenzer
(1978:29) argued that until the formation of the Black/Tensas Mississippi meander belt about
4800 BP, Little River probably drained into a course of the Arkansas or Ouachita River. The Little
River floodplain ranges between 2.5 and 5 km wide and is flanked by Pleistocene (Prairie) terrace
and Tertiary uplands. Lenzer (1978:35) also identified a terrace below the Prairie terrace,
perhaps related to the lower Prairie Terrace (Qtp) of Russ (1975) or the Deweyville terrace. The
floodplain has been aggrading throughout the Holocene.

Culture History
The Paleoindian Period (ca. 11,500 cal B.C to cal 8000 B.C.)
Considerable recent research has been directed at understanding the earliest migration of
human populations into North America. Of particular importance have been inquiries into the
timing and likely routes of migration along with the accompanying material culture (e.g., Dillehay
2000; Meltzer 2003). Because of fluctuations in atmospheric 14C, problems exist for calibrating
radiocarbon ages in the 14,000 to 11,000 bp range into calendar years. Calibrated dates are now
believed to be about 2000 years older than radiocarbon ages (see Fiedel 1999). These early
dates commonly are discussed in radiocarbon years before present (14C yr B.P.) and this
convention is followed here. Evidence has been offered for occupations prior to the Late Glacial
Maximum (earlier than 30,000 14C yr B.P.), but this remains controversial (e.g., Wyckoff et al.
2003). An ice-free corridor was present from Asia to North America by about 13,000 14C yr B.P.
along the Pacific coast, which enabled colonization of plants and animals that would have been
useful to human hunter-gatherers. An inland corridor was blocked between about 30,000 and
11,500 14C yr B.P. and was not passable by humans for a time thereafter before climatic
conditions ameliorated to the point where plants and animals could re-colonize (Meltzer
2003:543). The presence of human occupations at Monte Verde in Chile ca. 12,500 14C yr B.P.
supports the argument that early wave of migration took place down the coast (see discussion of
Dillehay 2000).
The distinctive Clovis points and associated tool forms (end and side scrapers, gravers, and
knives âsee Collins 1999), traditionally cited as the first evidence of human occupation in North
America, date shortly after the opening of the interior corridor with most radiocarbon dates in the
11,200 to 10,900 14C yr B.P. range (Taylor et al. 1996). A diverse range of habitats was exploited
and sites appear to represent the remains of small groups of highly mobile people (Meltzer
2003:549). In the eastern U.S. most Clovis sites date between 10,600 and 10,200 14C yr B.P. âa
time when Folsom points were used in the Great Plains to the west (Meltzer 2003:549).
Unfluted lanceolate points probably were in use in the Lower Mississippi Valley and TransMississippi South in the 9000 to 7000 cal B.C. interval, but the chronology is not well established
(Jeter and Williams 1989a:75). Lanceolate points have been reported in Management Unit 1, but
no contexts relating to this time have been isolated and studied. Most points have been
recovered as isolated surface finds on eroded Tertiary ridges or as aberrant specimens in
collections dominated by later artifacts. Similar situations are found throughout the Southeast
probably due to high residential mobility of the Paleoindian groups as they exploited extensive,
dispersed food resources (Meltzer 1988; Anderson 1996).
Although few paleoenvironmental studies have been carried out in Management Unit 1,
information from nearby regions indicates that climatic conditions probably were cooler than at
present during the Paleoindian period.
A late Pleistocene--early Holocene transition
characterized by a succession of spruce forest to cypress-gum forest to modern mixed hardwoodconiferous forest has been hypothesized for the lower Mississippi Valley (Delcourt and Delcourt
1981). However, it is not known if this model is applicable to Northwest Louisiana. Prior to 8000
cal B.C., it is likely that large Pleistocene mammals, such as mammoths and mastodons, were
present in the region.
The Early Archaic Period (ca. 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C.)
All archaeologists do not agree about whether to classify the San Patrice point horizon within
the Paleoindian or Archaic periods. Many aspects of San Patrice chipped stone technology,
particularly thinning point bases by fluting, resemble Paleoindian technology. However, unlike
Paleoindian specimens, San Patrice points and other associated tools in northern Louisiana
commonly are made on local pebble cherts. They also are far more numerous and often found
clustered together at particular sites. Finally, their distribution is limited on a regional scale
relative to the earlier forms. For these reasons, Saunders and Allen (1997) place San Patrice in

8

the Early Archaic period. Unfortunately, San Patrice contexts have not been dated by radiometric
means and the chronological position suggested here remains conjectural.
The John Pearce site (16CD56), located in southern Caddo Parish, was a small campsite
containing San Patrice points (Webb et al. 1971). Excavations produced a variety of chipped
stone tools (scrapers, notches, retouched flakes, burins, and gravers) in addition to San Patrice
points. Two Clovis-like points may represent an earlier Paleoindian period component. No
ground stone artifacts or features were encountered. Unfortunately, charcoal for radiocarbon
dating was not present.
Numerous San Patrice points have been recovered at Fort Polk in Vernon Parish on the
southern edge of Management Unit 1. Of particular importance are several deeply buried
contexts that underlie materials from later occupations. In addition to San Patrice points,
recovered from these deposits were a variety of small tools including scrapers, burins, drills,
pitted stones, and abraders (Mathews et al. 1995; Anderson and Smith 2003). No features
relating to this time have been identified, and no radiocarbon dates have been obtained.
The Middle Archaic Period (ca. 6000 B.C. to 2000 B.C.)
Archaeologists have subdivided the Archaic period in different ways. A common practice is
to associate the middle period with the mid-Holocene warm and dry period known as the
Altithermal or Hypsithermal. Although data from widespread areas in the Midwest and Southern
Plains indicate that this climatic interval occurred, evidence in the Southeast is weak and there is
no agreed-upon chronology. Jeter and Williams (1989a:85) place the Middle Holocene between
9000 and 5000 years ago. They suggest that the oak-hickory-southern pine forests may have
declined and patches of grasslands expanded within the Trans-Mississippi South.
Saunders and Allen (1997) suggest that the Evans point horizon and the beginning of mound
construction ca. 4000 B.C. should mark the start of the Middle Archaic period. However, sites
that fall into the 6000 to 4000 B.C. interval in the Southeast generally are considered to be Middle
rather than Early Archaic in age (e.g., Bense 1994; Sassaman and Anderson 1996; Walthall
1980; Morse and Morse 1983; Jeter and Williams 1989a). Our understanding of changes in
Archaic period material culture has been limited, making it difficult to identify point forms or other
tools that are diagnostic of specific time periods.
The only isolated and dated Middle Archaic period context in Management Unit 1 is the
Conly site (16BI19) located along Loggy Bayou in Bienville Parish (Girard 2000a). Recovered
from the site were a variety of stemmed dart points that can be assigned to several types
including Macon, Bulverde, Carrollton, Jones Creek, and Ellis. A couple of fragmented
specimens made on novaculite have stems with concave bases suggestive of the Johnson type,
considered to be associated with the Middle Archaic Tomâs Brook culture in southern Arkansas
and eastern Oklahoma (Schambach and Early 1982). During the latter half of the Middle Archaic
period, the distinctive notched Evans point is widespread throughout northern Louisiana and
southern Arkansas (Saunders and Allen 1997:Figure 4). Evans points have been recovered at
most of the Middle Archaic period mound complexes in Louisiana, and are found in large
quantities at sites classified with the Big Creek culture in Arkansas.
Burial of the Conly site under 3 m to 4 m of clay alluvium has resulted in one of the most
extensive and best preserved faunal assemblages in the Southeast for this period. Charred
botanical remains also are well represented at the site. Analyses of food remains from
excavations already carried out indicate that both aquatic resources (catfish, freshwater drum,
turtles, and shellfish) and upland resources (deer, squirrel, and hickory nuts) were exploited
(Scott and Jackson 2000; Dering 2000; Jackson and Scott 2001).
Human groups probably continued to be relatively mobile during the Middle Archaic period,
but concentrations of debris found at particular sites (such as the Conly site) suggest a greater
redundancy in use of specific places and territories relative to the Paleoindian period. Smith
(1986:18-35) argued that middle Holocene climatic conditions induced river aggradation and
stabilization in the southeastern United States resulting in channel meandering and the

9

emergence of rimswamp and oxbow environments that were rich in biotic resources. Site
distribution patterns and subsistence remains show that these environments became focal points
for human exploitation.
Recent research has demonstrated that construction of earthen mounds occurred by 3000
B.C. in the Ouachita River drainage. The Watson Brake site (16OU175) includes 11 mounds on
an extensive earthen embankment. The site inhabitants exploited local aquatic fauna and weedy
annual plants including goosefoot, knotweed, and marshelder (Saunders et al. 1997). The social
complexity represented by this site and others is forcing archaeologists to re-evaluate models that
link complex social behavior to use of cultigens and the existence of sedentary villages.
Most sites in northwest Louisiana relating to this period have been found in upland settings.
As noted for the earlier periods, artifacts often are mixed with those from later times and
chronologies have been difficult to work out. The Conly site demonstrates the potential for old
landforms containing evidence of human occupation to be buried, and relatively well preserved,
beneath more recent floodplain sediments. Such sites might be present within the Red River
floodplain and along the lower reaches of major tributary streams. Although difficult to locate,
deeply buried sites may represent relatively limited temporal spans of occupation, enabling
construction of fine-grained chronologies.
The Late Archaic Period (ca. 2000 B.C. to 500 B.C.)
The Late Archaic period often is interpreted as a time of intensive use of floodplain aquatic
resources in the Southeast (e.g., Bense 1994; Smith 1986) as well as increased population and
establishment of long distance trade networks. Increasing reliance was placed on indigenous
starchy and oily seed plants for food, eventually culminating in gardening and incipient cultivation
of these plants. Probably linked to this subsistence change was the âcontainer revolutionâ or
production and use of stone (steatite), gourd, and eventually, ceramic vessels.
The Late Archaic period is poorly understood in northwest Louisiana. This fact is due largely
to problems with isolating contexts relating specifically to this time. A variety of dart point forms
probably was produced, but point chronologies are not well understood. Sequential point clusters
have been defined in the lower Sabine/upper Calcasieu drainage region based on excavations at
Fort Polk (Anderson and Smith 2003; Campbell et al. 1990). However, the expanding stem to
corner notched forms common in that region, seem to be rare further north. The Late Archaic
period appears to be a time when the variety of point styles in use increased markedly, possibly
indicating increased social differentiation on a regional scale. There seems to be a general trend
from rectangular and expanding stem forms, to the ubiquitous contracting stem Gary points by
the end of period. However, other stem forms may have continued to be made, and Gary points
continue into the Woodland period.
Late Archaic points appear to be common on upland ridges, sometimes mixed with earlier or
later occupations. Few sites likely to relate to this time have been identified within the Red River
floodplain and none have been investigated to any substantial degree. This pattern is not
necessarily a reflection of the lack of Late Archaic period use of the floodplain. Most sites
probably have been destroyed or buried by the highly dynamic river.
In northeastern Louisiana, the distinctive Poverty Point culture flourished in the interval from
ca. 1500 to 500 B.C. Distinctive baked clay objects, a microlithic industry, earthwork
construction, and evidence of long distance trade are characteristic of Poverty Point. These traits
are rare in northwest Louisiana and a separate Poverty Point period generally is not recognized.
However, unsystematic examination of point collections suggests that use of novaculite from
Arkansas or Oklahoma might have increased in this period. Red jasper owl effigies, similar to
those from Poverty Point, have been recovered from the McMullen farm (16BO104) in Bossier
Parish (Jeane 1983) and Toledo Bend Reservoir (John Guy, personal communication 1990).

10

The Early and Middle Woodland Periods (ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 400)
The Woodland period usually is considered to begin about 500 B.C. when pottery first
appears in significant amounts. The earliest pottery, Tchefuncte pottery, has distinctive
untempered, often poorly-wedged and laminated paste. It seems to be present in significant
quantities in the Catahoula basin region, but rare along Little River and in areas to the north and
west. No Early Woodland period occupations have been isolated and studied in Management
Unit 1. However, Tchefuncte pottery has been reported from sites in southern Natchitoches
Parish (Gregory and Curry 1978), and from the Swan Lake site (16BO11) in Bossier Parish
(Girard 1995a). Approximately 25 km west of the Louisiana border, Tchefuncte pottery, including
an intact vessel, was recovered from the Resch site in the upper Sabine River drainage in
Harrison County, Texas (Webb et al. 1969).
Use of pottery in northwest Louisiana appears to have been sporadic until the Middle
Woodland period or about 100 B.C. when relatively thick, grog-tempered pottery was used
throughout the region. Although widespread, Middle Woodland pottery has been found only in
small amounts in Management Unit 1, usually in contexts mixed with later materials. Schambach
(1982, 1998, 2001, 2002) has argued that a major cultural separation between peoples in the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Marksville culture) and those in the woodlands west of the Mississippi
River floodplain (Fourche Maline culture) had developed by this time. Differing burial practices
and pottery assemblages mark this separation. Distinct economic strategies may be represented
as well. Nevertheless, characteristic Lower Mississippi Valley (Marksville) ceramics occur in low
numbers at several sites in northwest Louisiana. Similar ceramics have been recovered as far
north as the upper Ouachita drainage in Arkansas (Schambach 2001), and as far west as the
upper Sulphur River in Texas (Perttula 1999:27).
Almost all information regarding the Middle Woodland period in Management Unit 1 comes
from solitary mound sites situated on ridges overlooking the Red River floodplain or major
tributaries such as Bodcau Bayou. With the possible exception of the Bellevue site (16BO4) in
Bossier Parish, these sites have little or no evidence of habitation near the mounds. The sites
contain small amounts of thick, grog or grog-and-bone tempered pottery known as Williams Plain.
All of these mounds are located north of the mouth of Loggy Bayou in northern DeSoto, Bossier,
and Caddo parishes (Webb 1984). Radiocarbon dates suggest that they date between
approximately 200 B.C. and A.D. 500 (Girard 2002a).
It seems likely that relatively mobile settlement systems with subsistence economies based
on fishing, hunting, and gathering nuts and other plant foods continued into Middle Woodland
period times. Studies in eastern Texas suggest that Woodland period sites represent more
sustained occupations by larger groups relative to those in Late Archaic period times (Perttula
1999:387). Unfortunately, habitation sites of the Middle Woodland period have yet to be isolated
and studied in northwest Louisiana.
The Late Woodland Period (ca. A.D. 400 to A.D. 900)
Significant changes in human social and economic systems are evident for the Late
Woodland period (ca. A.D. 400 to A.D. 900) in the Natchitoches area and along Little River. The
Fredericks site (16NA2), located near the lower end of Black Lake Bayou has five mounds and an
extensive and rich midden area (Girard 2000b). Ceramics at the site are similar to those of the
Troyville culture in the Lower Mississippi Valley and differ markedly from Fourche Maline sites in
the Shreveport area. A significant technological change apparently took place in this period with
the replacement of the dart-and-atlatl as a principal hunting weapon with the bow-and-arrow.
Limited study of faunal and botanical remains indicates that the Fredericks site inhabitants had a
hunting/gathering economy with deer and fish of primary importance (Shaffer 2000). It is not
known whether the site was inhabited by a permanent residential group, or was seasonally
occupied by a population that was more widely dispersed throughout part of the year.
Occupation in the Red River floodplain is represented by the Montrose site (16NA37),
located south of Natchitoches (Heartfield Price and Greene Inc. 1985). Although no structures
could be isolated, the site contained a large number of pit features, several human burials, and a
11

large collection of ceramics. The Fredericks and Montrose sites indicate intensive use of
particular places in the landscape, evidence of which is lacking for earlier periods.
Radiocarbon dates indicate that the Fredericks and Montrose sites were occupied in the
interval from about A.D. 400 until about A.D. 800. Small amounts of pottery relating to early
Coles Creek occupations in the Lower Mississippi Valley are present at both sites and probably
represent the latest occupations. Several other sites in the Natchitoches area have ceramic
assemblages equivalent to early Coles Creek, but lack evidence of earlier occupation. These
include the Black Lake Bayou site (16NA587) (Girard 2001), the Lemoine and McNeely sites
(16NA24 and 16NA84) (Gregory and Curry 1978), and the Edwards Site (16NA590) (Girard
2002b). No radiocarbon dates have been obtained from these sites, but dates from early Coles
Creek sites to the east suggest that the represented occupations took place in the A.D. 700 to
900 range (e.g., Kidder 1990).
As discussed earlier, the Fourche Maline mound sites located to the northwest in the Red
River drainage appear to date prior to A.D. 500. However, based on a small amount of pottery
similar to that recovered at Fredericks, it is possible that the Bellevue site (16BO4) was occupied
during the Late Woodland period. Schambach (1996), however, argues that mortuary traits
suggest that the mound was constructed earlier. Several small habitation sites that might relate
to this period have been recorded, but none have been subject to significant investigation.
On the southeastern edge of Management Unit 1, substantial occupation of the Little River
drainage appears to have taken place during the Late Woodland period. Like in the Natchitoches
area, ceramics along Little River relate closely to Troyville and early Coles Creek assemblages of
the Lower Mississippi Valley. The Whatley site (16LA37) in LaSalle Parish has a component
relating to this period (Thomas and Campbell 1978), as does the Clear Creek Bay site (16GR20)
(Keller 1983; Girard 2001). Although extensive habitation is apparent, mounds apparently were
not constructed until late in the period or after A.D. 700. Three large mounds were built at the
Clear Creek Bay site (Keller 1983) and several smaller mounds developed at the Walnut Landing
site (16GR137) (Girard 1998; 2001).
The Early Caddo/Late Coles Creek Period (ca. A.D. 900 to A.D. 1200)
The period between approximately A.D. 900 and A.D. 1200 was one of considerable change
in human lifeways in Management Unit 1, particularly in the Red River drainage.
Archaeologically, changes are evident in ceramic assemblages, site locations, and mortuary
traits.
During this period, north of the Natchitoches area, a widespread cultural tradition known as
âCaddoâ after the groups who lived in historic times, became established in the Red River
floodplain and adjoining uplands. Traits that distinguish Caddo from earlier Woodland period
cultures in Louisiana are:
â¢ A broadening of the diversity of pottery vessels made and used. New forms such as the
bottle and carinated bowl appear.
â¢ Changes in the manner in which pottery was decorated. Particularly distinctive is the
appearance of engraved vessels with polished surfaces.
â¢ A tremendous increase in the number of sites situated in the Red River floodplain. The
sites appear to represent the formation of villages consisting of small clusters of houses
dispersed over distances of several kilometers.
â¢ Construction of mounds in the floodplains of the Red and Sabine rivers and termination of
mound construction on upland ridges.
â¢ Distinctive mound burials consisting of deep shaft graves that contain multiple individuals
and many grave goods.
â¢ Possibly, an increase in the importance of farming, particularly cultivation of maize.
These traits did not appear all at once. However, none are present prior to A.D. 800 and all
appear in some places throughout the Caddo region by A.D. 1000. A major research issue in
Management Unit 1 is to clarify the timing of the appearance of these traits across the landscape.
12

By the Early Caddo period, four distinct aspects of settlement in the Red River drainage can
be identified (Girard 1997a), most of which persist throughout late prehistory:
(1) Floodplain villages consisting of clusters of households dispersed in lineal patterns along
secondary streams. By A.D. 1200, some areas were relatively densely inhabited. After A.D.
1500, settlements seem to be more dispersed and focused near abandoned channel segments in
the active meander belt rather than along streams in older meander belts. The reasons for this
shift are not known.
(2) Areas within these villages that contain solitary mounds or special ceremonial structures.
Higher population concentrations appear to be represented in the immediate vicinity of these
areas, but it is not clear whether or not residences of social elites are represented.
(3) Ceremonial centers containing multiple mounds and plaza areas. Only one such site,
Mounds Plantation (16CD12), has been documented in Management Unit 1 (Webb and
McKinney 1975). Mounds Plantation might have been used for inter-village rituals and special
mortuary purposes. Although the chronology is not well understood, the site appears to have
been abandoned after A.D. 1200 probably indicating significant changes in inter-village social
relationships.
(4) Small clusters of households in peripheral floodplain settings, particularly around
rimswamps and marshes in the lower reaches of tributary streams. It is not clear if these sites
represent seasonal or opportunistic occupations by floodplain villagers or more permanent
occupations by socially distinct groups.
Ceramic assemblages on the eastern periphery of Management Unit 1 (Bayou Darbonne,
Dugdemona River, Little River, and the western side of the Catahoula basin) relate to Late Coles
Creek sites and show little Caddoan influence at this time. To the east, along the lower Ouachita
and Tensas rivers, a proliferation of Coles Creek sites, generally with two or three mounds
arranged around plazas, occurs during this period. Habitation areas probably were dispersed in
small communities away from the mounds. A few very large sites developed, such as Pritchard
Landing (16CT14), which included at least 14 mounds arranged around a circular plaza (Moore
1909:17-18). It is possible that a settlement hierarchy, with at least two levels of ceremonial
centers, was present in the Tensas basin by the end of this period (Kidder 1992:153). However,
in contrast to the Caddo area, burials of individuals in special tombs with numerous or exotic
burial goods are sparse or absent in Coles Creek ceremonial centers (Kidder 1998:132).
Along the lower portion of Little River in Grant Parish, occupation continued at the Clear
Creek Bay site (16GR20) and at least five mounds arranged around a plaza eventually were
constructed (Girard 2001; Keller 1983; Moore 1909). The nearby Walnut Landing site (16GR137)
includes six small mounds that appear to cap remains of houses that were arranged around a
small plaza or courtyard (Girard 2001). This activity on Little River appears to coincide with major
mound construction in the lower Ouachita River drainage (Pritchard's Landing phase) and
elsewhere in northeastern Louisiana (Kidder 1990; 1998). Other sites identified along Little River
are probably contemporary and suggest that a significant population buildup occurred in the
region. Little is known about the subsistence economy. No apparent cultigens were found at the
Whatley site (16LA37), and none were identified in small sample analyzed at Walnut Landing
(Girard 1998). Kidder and Fritz (1993) found no evidence of maize agriculture prior to A.D. 1200
in the Tensas Basin. It appears that Lower Mississippi Valley groups continued exploitation of
native food resources at the time maize agriculture was becoming of major importance to the
Mississippian populations to the north.
The Middle Caddo/Early Mississippi Period (ca. A.D. 1200-1500)
The archaeological record for the Caddo area in Management Unit 1 during the Middle
Caddo period is generally described under a single taxonomic unit-- the Bossier focus (now
usually considered the Bossier phase). The Bossier focus was initially defined primarily on the
basis of pottery traits that differed from those of the Early Caddo period. Foremost among these
was the frequent use of brushing on utilitarian wares, a trait shared with sites of the Plaquemine

13

culture in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Webb (1948) based the Bossier focus on investigations
at several sites located primarily in Bossier, Caddo, and DeSoto parishes, but recognized similar
sites as far east as the Ouachita Valley, south to the Natchitoches area, and east into the
Cypress Creek drainage.
Major Bossier phase village sites are located on bluffs adjacent to the Red River floodplain in
southern Bossier Parish (e.g., the Sinner â16BO1 and Peaseâ16BO2 sites) and along major
upland drainages such as Bodcau Bayou (e.g, the Maddox siteâ16BO20). Interestingly, the
only two mound sites initially attributed to the Bossier focus, one component at the Belcher Site
(16CD13) and the Vanceville Mound (16BO7), were located within the Red River floodplain,
although not along the present channel. Webb (1948:140) argued that a dispersal of population
into small, upland, farming hamlets occurred during this period. However, later investigations
conducted along Willow Chute Bayou indicate that the Middle Caddo period habitation was
extensive in the floodplain, and probably represents population growth and expansion from Early
Caddo times (Girard 1997a).
Middle Caddo period mounds were present along Willow Chute at the Vanceville (16BO7),
Swan Lake (16BO11), and Werner (16BO8) sites. Farther north, the Byram Ferry site (16BO17)
included at least two mounds (Girard 2007a) and initial construction of the two, eventually
connected, mounds at the Belcher site (16CD13) had begun (Webb 1959). However, no multiple
mound/plaza ceremonial centers (like the earlier Mounds Plantation site) are present during the
Middle Caddo period in the Red River drainage in Louisiana.
No burials in mounds with elaborate grave goods can be firmly attributed to the Middle
Caddo period. However, mound excavations have been minimal, and rich mortuary contexts are
present at sites in the Red River floodplain in southeast Arkansas such as Haley (3MI1) (Moore
1912) and Mineral Springs (3HO1) (Bohannon 1973). It is likely that the early (pre-mound)
burials at the Belcher site were made prior to A.D. 1500 as well.
In eastern Louisiana, most Early Mississippi period occupations are considered to be
affiliated with the Plaquemine culture. Plaquemine is characterized by changes in ceramic
assemblages and expansion of mound construction, often attributed to intensive contacts with
Mississippian groups to the north (Rees and Livingood 2007). New mounds and plazas were
constructed and mantles added to existing mounds in large ceremonial centers such as
Winterville and Lake George in the lower Yazoo region, and at the Raffman (16EC20) and
Fitzhugh (16MA1) sites in the Tensas region (Kidder 1993:143). Although few studies of food
remains have been conducted, it is often assumed that maize agriculture played an important role
in Plaquemine subsistence (Jeter and Williams 1989b:215).
No Plaquemine occupations have been identified along Little River (Thomas et al. 1983) and
Gibson (1983;1996) has argued that, although Plaquemine components are present at several
major mound sites, populations in the Lower Ouachita region may have gradually declined during
this period. This does not appear to be the case in the Catahoula Basin, however, where major
occupations are represented at sites such as Mayes (16CT10), Sanson (16RA1), and Bennett
Landing (16CT4) (Gregory et al. 1987). Unfortunately, despite the rich Plaquemine period
archaeological record, relatively few studies have been conducted in the Catahoula Basin region.
Surveys by Gibson (1977) and Gregory et al. (1987) resulted in suggested phase sequences but
these are not based on either stratigraphic excavations or radiocarbon dates. Jeter and Williams
(1989b:213) point out that strong Caddo influence in ceramic assemblages are present in both
the Lower Ouachita and Catahoula Basin regions at this time, and suggest that a new cultural
taxonomic unit may be needed to differentiate these western areas from the Plaquemine
âheartlandsâ of the Tensas and Lower Yazoo basins. Both temple and mortuary mounds have
been identified in the Catahoula and Lower Ouachita regions along with extensive sheet middens
(Gregory et al. 1987:82-87). These traits appear to be absent in the Natchitoches area, and rare
in the Red River drainage to the immediate north.

14

The Late Caddo/Late Mississippi Period (ca. A.D. 1500-1700)
In the area around present-day Shreveport, the Late Caddo period is marked by distinct
changes in both ceramic technology and decorative styles. It also appears likely that a settlement
pattern shift took place. The cultural manifestation of the period was defined by Webb (1959) as
the Belcher focus (like Bossier, now generally considered as a phase). Ceramic vessels differ
from earlier examples by a tendency toward having relatively thin vessel walls, hard pastes, and
frequent use of shell temper. Several new decorative types appear which seem to show
increasing similarities in use of elements and overall design layouts to sites in the Ouachita River
drainage to the east.
It is not clear whether or not new civic/ceremonial sites were constructed during the late
Caddo period. However, burials were placed in earlier-constructed mound centers (e.g., Mounds
Plantation--16CD12), sometimes with significant additions being made to the mounds (e.g., the
Belcher Site--16CD13). Schambach and Early (1982:119) noted that almost all of the major
mound groups in southwest Arkansas contain Late Caddo period burials. Webbâs excavations
into the Belcher Mound (Webb 1959) showed that elaborate mortuary ceremonialism involving
placement of high status goods with certain individuals continued into the Late Caddo period.
As is the case throughout the Caddoan sequence, few habitation sites have been identified.
On the west side of the floodplain, major occupations are represented along Cowhide Bayou
(Webb 1959; Girard 1999). With the exception of the late occupation at the Festervan Site
(16BO327), the Willow Chute area appears to have been abandoned early in this period. Sites
that date late in the period have been investigated in southern Bossier Parish at Beene Plantation
(16BO19) near Bossier City (Girard 2006a), and at the McLelland (16BO236) and Joe Clark
(16BO237) sites (Kelley 1994). These sites probably relate to the historic Yatasi and related
groups.
Mound sites of the Late Caddo period in the Great Bend Region of the Red River drainage,
including Belcher, Friday, Foster, Battle, and McClure, probably were abandoned by A.D. 1650,
prior to sustained European contact (Perttula 1992:122). Continued use of mounds, however, is
depicted in the 1691-1692 Teran map that probably shows the Hatchel Mound and surrounding
Hatchel-Mitchell-Moore archaeological complex of the Texarkana phase, centered upstream from
the Belcher phase occupations in northeast Texas (Perttula 2005; Wedel 1978). Abandonment of
the mound centers may have followed shortly after the practice of placing deceased leaders in
mound shaft graves had been discontinued. According to Perttula (1992:227):
Periods of mound use and/or mound pit burials on the Red river for the McCurtain,
Texarkana, and Belcher phase regions generally pre-date ca. 1650.
Their
discontinuation coincides with evidence of decreased social differentiation and/or
complexity and with less extensive settlement within the Red River valley. Settlements
are widely separated in the protohistoric period, and they appear to be made up of
clusters of farmsteads and family communities.
Perttula goes on to note that the more aggregated âtownâ communities along the Red River
may have experienced greater population loss than the rural communities along smaller upland
drainages.
Evidence of Late Mississippi period occupation appears to be sparse in the Lower Ouachita
and Catahoula basin areas. The historic Natchez are generally thought to be the descendants of
prehistoric Plaquemine groups located on the bluffs east of the Mississippi River near the present
city of Natchez. West of the river, were the Taensa and, further south, the Avoyel. These groups
may have had Late Mississippi period ancestors who resided in the Lower Ouachita and
Catahoula basin areas, but it has not been possible to locate historic sites and trace material
culture continuities into the late prehistoric archaeological record.
The Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700-A.D. 1900)
The Caddoan and Mississippian periods end ca. A.D. 1700 with significant increases in
exploration and settlement of northwest Louisiana by Europeans and Native Americans from
15

other areas of the Southeast. The influx of new peoples resulted in rapid changes in local
demographics, settlement systems, and material culture.
The Kadohadacho villages documented in the historic record in the southern Arkansas
portions of the Red River floodplain were occupied until 1790 when abandonment took place due
to Osage raids and epidemics (Swanton 1942; Smith 1995). Population losses resulted in
smaller numbers of villages through time. Perttula (1992:170) notes that five villages were
present in 1690; only three by 1719; and finally, all the Kadohadacho were in a single village in
1790 when they moved south into Louisiana, and eventually west to the Timber Hill village along
James Bayou on Caddo Lake in 1800 (Parsons et al. 2002).
In Northwest Louisiana, reported raids by the Chickasaw from east of the Mississippi valley
ca. 1717 split the Yatasi into two groupsâone of which moved north to live with the
Kadohadacho, and the other south near the Natchitoches and Adai (Swanton 1942:57). The
groups eventually coalesced in what is now eastern DeSoto Parish by the middle 18th century and
became important in the French-Caddo commerce (Girard et al. 2006).
French settlement developed around Fort St. Jean Baptiste resulting in Natchitoches
becoming a predominantly European settlement during the eighteenth century. The nearby
presidio of Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Los Adaes was a Spanish military outpost occupied
between 1721 and 1773. Avery (1997) and Gregory et al. (2004) summarize results of several
years of archaeological investigations at the site (16NA16). After Louisiana was ceded to Spain
in 1762, European settlements expanded rapidly. Plantations were started in the Red River
floodplain along Cane River south of Natchitoches, and along Bayou Rapides and Bayou Boeuf in
Rapides Parish. An extensive dispersed settlement, known as the Bayou Pierre Community,
developed along the western edge of the Red River floodplain in present DeSoto Parish. Two
sites relating to this community, Louis Procello (16DS212) and Pierre Robleau (16DS380) have
been partially excavated (Espey Huston and Associates 1983; Girard 2002b; Girard et al. 2006).
The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 was followed by the influx of Euro-Americans of English descent
settling in towns and rural farmsteads throughout Management Unit 1.
By the early nineteenth century, Caddoan peoples were reduced in number and had moved
out to the margins of the Red River floodplain and near lakes on major tributaries. Discussions of
changes in settlement locations can be found in Sibley (1922), Swanton (1942), Williams (1964),
Webb and Gregory (1986), Perttula (1992), Girard (1997b), Kelley (1998), and Girard and
Gregory (2002).
Native American tribes from the east began coming into the area during the late eighteenth
century. Most of these groups (which include the Coushattas, Apalachees, Pascagoulas,
Chatots, Choctaws, Biloxis, and Quapaws) initially settled on bluffs or rises along the floodplain,
and eventually moved out of the region or retreated into the surrounding uplands (cf. Hunter
1990, 1994; McCrocklin 1990).
During the nineteenth century, the landscape began to fill with small upland farms and large
plantations, the latter mostly in the Red River floodplain. Initial clearing of logjams in the
floodplain opened the area to riverboat commerce and resulted in the growth of large
communities such as Shreveport. Two key settlement developments occurred in the late
nineteenth century: (1) the breakup of the plantation system after the Civil War resulted in the
spread of small tenant farm houses on the peripheries of agricultural fields, particularly in the
floodplain; and (2) expansion of the logging industry resulted in the development of small upland
towns around sawmills and railroads. Although many archaeological sites relating to this time
have been recorded, little detailed research has been conducted in Management Unit 1.

Archaeogeophysical Survey at Mounds Plantation (16CD12)
by Jami J. Lockhart and Jeffrey S. Girard
Introduction
Despite its status as the largest and most complex Caddo ceremonial center in Louisiana,
relatively little research has been conducted at the Mounds Plantation site. Excavations have
been confined primarily to two mounds, Mound 3 and Mound 5 and were conducted during the
early 1960s (Webb and McKinney 1975; Girard 2006a). Surface collections were made across
large portions of the site in 1985 (McCrocklin 1985), but the recovered materials have not been
analyzed or reported. Permanent data points were placed in the site plaza and a detailed contour
map was made in 2005 and 2006 (Girard 2005; 2006a). As a means for locating possible
subsurface features, an archaeogeophysical survey was conducted of selected areas in January
2007. The survey was conducted over a period of four days using three technologiesâelectrical
resistance, gradiometery, and ground penetrating radar.
Girard selected four areas for the study (Figure 3). During a four-day survey, a total of 9,200
m2 was covered using gradiometry; 3,600 m2 with ground penetrating radar; and 2,800 m2 with
electrical resistance.
Technologies
The term archaeogeophysics describes a range of non-invasive methods for delineation and
analysis of subsurface archaeological and cultural features (Weymouth 1986; Clark 1996;
Conyers and Goodman 1997; Kvamme 2001). Generally speaking, archaeological sites are the
product of cultural and natural formation processes (Schiffer 1987). Sites are altered by
anthropogenic activities and the natural accumulation of sediments. Soils are physically and
chemically changed over time, and the archaeological record is transformed both spatially and
quantitatively. These site formation processes produce a three-dimensional archaeological
volume composed of topographic and physical properties such as soil texture, soil compaction,
stratigraphy, biogenic and biochemical components, differential moisture retention, burning, and
artifact composition. Archaeogeophysical technologies provide the capability to measure the
variable strengths and locations of physical properties that make up the archaeological record.
Through post-processing of geophysical data, maps of data anomalies can be produced and
georeferenced to actual field coordinates that can be accurately located on the ground for
archaeological excavation and confirmation as archaeological features.
Archaeogeophysical surveys are non-destructive in that each technology operates at or near
the surface of the ground by measuring physical properties that have been created or altered by
natural processes and/or past anthropogenic activities. Archaeogeophysical surveys are also
cost-effective in many situations as compared to traditional archaeological survey methods, such
as shovel testing. The results can provide greater data resolution and accuracy in identifying and
locating subsurface archaeological features before excavation.
A variety of techniques can be used to record physical properties of near-surface deposits.
Generally, each of these techniques incorporates a consistent and systematic sampling strategy
through the use of measured sample and traverse intervals. Using equally spaced ropes of fixed
length (e.g., 20 m) marked in 50 cm intervals, geophysical measurements (z-values) can be
collected at prescribed intervals in both the x and y directions on the ground. A broad area can
be sampled, and every measurement generated has a known location on the ground. Combined
with accurate land survey technologies, such as a total station, high-order location precision can
be achieved. The raster-formatted data can also be used directly with other spatial data
management technologies, such as geographic information systems (GIS), in intra-site analysis
and precise placement of excavation units.

17

Figure 3. Locations of sample areas for geophysical survey at the Mounds Plantation site
There are two realms of geophysical technology â active and passive. Active technologies
transmit electromagnetic energy into the ground, and measure the response to subsurface
characteristics. Passive technologies measure inherent or naturally occurring and culturally
altered physical properties without introducing additional electrical or magnetic energy.
Gradiometry (a form of magnetometry) is a passive technology capable of measuring small
variations in the earthâs natural magnetic properties. Although it changes over time and space, at
any given moment and place the earth has a consistent magnetic alignment (inclination and
declination). Soil volumes that have been disturbed reflect a change in this natural magnetic
alignment. Likewise, materials that have been fired have a measurably different magnetic
signature than their surroundings. This magnetically enhanced state is referred to as
thermoremanence. In addition to fired materials, magnetic methods are also sensitive to metal.
Technically speaking, magnetic field strength is measured in nanotesla (nT = 10-9 Tesla). This
project measured magnetic properties using a Geoscan FM-36 fluxgate gradiometer that features
the capability to difference diurnal fluctuations (ca. 40 to 50 nT) in background magnetic field
strengths commonly ranging from 40,000 to 60,000 nT (Weymouth 1986) with potential
archaeological features that can differ from the background by as little as 5 nT. The FM-36
18

gradiometer measures the vertical gradient of the magnetic field â not the total field strength -and is sensitive to magnetic differences as subtle as 0.1 nT. The device is capable of
approximately 8 measurements per second, and is generally limited to features located in the top
2 to 3m of the soil.
Electrical resistance is an active technology, in which two probes initiate an electrical current
and two probes measure voltage. This technology depends on physical properties of the soil (i.e.
moisture, dissolved ions, soil particle properties). The physical properties of archaeological
features commonly differ from the surrounding natural soil matrix, resulting in measurable
differential resistance to the flow of electricity. For example, the moist fill of a buried ditch might
provide a less resistant pathway for electrical current than the surrounding dry and compacted
natural soil matrix. Prospection depth is controlled by the distance of separation between the
probes. Electrical resistance is measured in ohms, and resistivity is measured in ohm-meters
(2pi*resistance in ohms*probe spacing in meters). The Geoscan RM-15 used in this project is
optimized for archaeological applications. The probes are affixed to a frame, and the data
collector is capable of approximately 20 to 30 measurements per minute for a total of 30,000
measurements before downloading. It can be configured in parallel mode to take multiple
readings of equal depth, or in multiplexing mode to take readings at different depths as in
tomography.
Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is another active technology, which emits continuous
pulses of radar energy into the ground that are then reflected by buried features. Antennae used
in archaeological applications generally range from 200MHz (deep) to 1000 MHz (shallow, high
res.), and determine the depth of signal penetration. A 400MHz antenna was used in this
application. The cone-shaped radar signal results in hyperbolic reflections. The return time of the
echoes indicates depth to target, and is measured in nanoseconds (nS). Velocity of the signal is
controlled by the material (i.e. soil) through which the signal is traveling â this is called dielectric
permitivity. Signal strength and resolution attenuate (degrade) with increasing depth. The
magnitude of the reflection is an indicator of the nature of the target. The data are a series of
profiles or sections, which can be further processed as horizontal slices for map views at specific
depths. Continuous pulses (large amounts of high-resolution data), in combination with recent
processing software advances, provide the potential for very high-resolution data sets at multiple
depths.
Regardless of which technology is used, data must be downloaded from the device, postprocessed and converted to imagery for use in site interpretation. The volume of data that can be
compiled in a short period of time using optimized instruments (i.e. 1,600 measurements in 30
minutes) has led to advances in computer software. Post-processing includes the concatenation
of multiple files, edge matching of files, noise removal through de-spiking routines, low and high
pass filtering to visually separate cultural features from background soils and geology, filtering to
better define linear patterning, histogram clipping to sharpen data contrasts, data interpolation to
improve resolution, assigning intensity values, as well as interpretation and recommendations.
A critical companion element of the methodology used before and after the geophysical
surveys is precision surveying and mapping. In 2005, Girard established spatial control on a
single coordinate system for the entire site. Once this system was established, all spatial
elements of the site could be located with high-order accuracy. Prior to the instrument work,
corners of each 20 x 20 m geophysical grid were marked in the field. By geo-referencing the
geophysical imagery with the spatial control of the total station coordinate system, every
geophysical anomaly within every 20 x 20 m geophysical grid on the site can be located with
centimeter-level accuracy. This spatial control allows for direct comparisons between the
geophysical imagery and archaeological excavations.
Results of the Mound 2 Study
The Mound 2 area is composed of nine 20-x-20-m geophysical grids located in the western
portion of the site (Figure 4). The survey area was laid out to sample a portion of the mound as
well as areas immediately adjacent that may be covered by slopewash.

19

Figure 4. Locations of 20-x-20-m sample grids in the Mound 2 area
Mound 2 apparently was quadrilateral and flat topped in the early 20th century. It may be the
mound known as Arickâs Mound, described by Veatch (1899) as 40 x 50 ft and 12 ft tall. C.B.
Moore (1912) described it as square with the summit 70 ft in diameter and base 150 ft in
diameter. Moore did not provide an estimate of the height of Mound 2. The mound now is
roughly conical in shape with the base considerably larger than reported by Moore (73x60 m or
240x197 ft). It is similar in height to Mound1 or about 2.6 m (8.5 ft) tall. Clarence Webb (Webb
and McKinney 1975) reported that more than half of the mound was cut down when a tenant
house was removed from its summit, presumably in the late 1960s. It seems more likely that
about 1 m was removed from the top and spread around the base. No excavations have been
made in Mound 2. The mound now is planted in grass and only minor erosion is notable.
Gradiometry
In gradiometry, metal is typically identified by discrete data dipoles, which are extremely high
nanotesla readings paired with an extremely low readings. A monopole (a high reading alone) in
the data can represent smaller pieces of metal, more deeply buried metal, or fired objects, such
as bricks, clusters of ceramics, hearths, daub, etc. Larger, and often more subtle, magnetic
differences can indicate where the topsoil has been disturbed as in removed, piled, or
compacted. The gradiometer data for Mound 2 were collected using a 50 cm transect interval and
25 cm sample interval at 1nT sensitivity (due to metal debris). Parallel traverses were surveyed
from west to east beginning in the northwest corner of each of the nine 20 x 20 m geophysical
grids.
Results, as shown in Figure 5, depict subsurface anomalies as they relate to the elevation of
the mound. Two obvious features of the gradiometry are the diagonally- trending linear features
with alternating black and white segments visible in grid N5000/E4800 (SW corner). Lengths of
metal are often measured as alternating north and south magnetic poles. This underground
feature is likely to be a modern intrusion, such as a water pipe or some other utility conduit/line.

20

Figure 5. Gradiometry results for Mound 2, Mounds Plantation (20 cm contour interval, 20 m grid)
Perhaps not unexpectedly, the gradiometer data appear to show widespread metal debris
across the Mound 2 area. Local informants report that a house was located on Mound 2 during
the 20th century. In Figure 6, the gradiometer imagery is shown with a superimposed two-meter
grid geo-referenced to the site coordinates. The vast majority of magnetic anomalies shown
appear to be metal objects, the strong signatures of which may be obscuring more subtle
prehistoric patterns and features.
However, recent evidence obtained through
archaeogeophysical survey and subsequent test excavation at sites in nearby eastern Texas
indicates that small magnetic dipoles may also indicate burned archeological features (Chet
Walker, personal communication 2007). This phenomenon results from the anthropogenic firing
of objects and materials composed of, or juxtaposed to, naturally occurring highly ferrous soils
and ironstones. Due to this possibility, a number of different magnetic signatures have been
chosen as potential test excavations, as shown in Figure 6.
Ground Penetrating Radar
The ground penetrating radar survey for Mound 2 was conducted using what is commonly
referred to as a zigzag configuration alternating west-to-east and east-to-west traverses
beginning at the northwest corner of each of the nine grids. A GSSI 400 MHz antenna was used
in conjunction with a GSSI SIR2000 computer and survey cart (Figure 7). Results, as shown in
Figure 8, reflect subsurface radar anomalies as they relate to the elevation of the mound. Figure
9 shows the imagery with a superimposed two-meter grid geo-referenced to the 16CD12 site
coordinates.

Figure 9 also shows the location of potential 2 x 2 m test excavations that could be used to
ground-truth the imagery and inform future geophysical surveys at 16CD12. Potential test unit 1
is a strong and contiguous radar reflectance that occurs off the mound. Test unit 2 is located
over one of the larger radar anomalies in the dataset, but is also located on some of the steepest
22

terrain of the extant mound. Unit 3 tests an anomaly that corresponds to a signature in the
electrical resistance imagery, which is described below. Unit 4 is located over a semi-circular
linear anomaly. Unit 5 would test similar anomalies occurring in both ground penetrating radar
and gradiometry. Unit 6 would test anomalies that are apparent in radar and electrical resistance.
Test units 7 and 8 would test anomalies that are located well away from the steepest portions of
the extant mound.

Electrical Resistance
Unfortunately, collection of electrical resistance data during the project proved to be
problematic. Four of the seven 20 x 20 m grids collected using resistance contained spurious
and pervasive positive and negative data spikes associated with an inconsistent malfunction of
the resistance meter and/or associated wiring. Reconfigurations of the device and its frame in the
field failed to remedy the problem. However, three grids of unaffected data were collected in the
Mound 2 study area (Figure 10). The target depth for these data ranges up to approximately 70
cm. Beginning in northwest corner of each 20 x 20 m grid, survey transects and sample intervals
were 50 cm, and data were collected in a zigzag pattern (from west-to-east, and then from eastto-west on the return). Thus, each 20 x 20 m grid consists of 1600 individual readings measured
in ohms.

Figure 10. Electrical resistance image for Mound 2, Mounds Plantation
Figure 11 shows the location of a potential test excavation over a rectangular anomaly that is
situated at the foot of the extant mound where the slope begins to flatten. The southwest corner
of the 2 x 2 m test unit is N5012/E4864. Determining the nature of this anomaly will increase our
ability to interpret similar signatures in these data, as well as future electrical resistance imagery
for mound 2. Also of interest are the diagonal anomalies trending from the southeast corner to
the northwest corner of the 20 x 20 m geophysical grid N5000/E4840 (SW corner). These
anomalies are visible as an approximately 4 to 5 m wide linear feature composed of lower
electrical resistance (lighter shading) flanked on either side by increased electrical resistance
(darker shading), particularly in the northeast of the 20 x 20 m grid.
Results of the Mound 6 Study
Mound 6, over which six 20-x-20-m geophysical grids were placed, is a low rise within a
cultivated field on the southern margin of the plaza (Figure 12). Mound 6 is large, about 80 m x
60 m, of similar size to Mound 1. However, it is only a little more than 50 cm high. When
described by Webb (Webb and McKinney 1975), it was 60 cm tall and 45-50 m in diameter. A

24

barn, garden, and windmill were on its summit. Although spread out by plowing, Mound 6 does
not appear to have been cut down significantly since that time.

Gradiometry
The six geophysical grids composing the Mound 6 study area lie within an area of active
cotton cultivation. The furrows run from northwest to southeast at an approximate 40-degree
angle to grid north. The depth of the furrows precluded the practical use of geophysical
technologies (such as ground penetrating radar and electrical resistance) that require contact with
the ground surface. The gradiometer data for mound 6 present a variety of magnetic signatures
(Figure 13). Two particularly strong anomalies are centered on N4807/E5056 and N4791/E5077,
respectively. Also, an interesting concentration of anomalies could be tested in the 2 x 2 m
excavation unit N4822/E5052 (SW corner). Another strongly magnetic anomaly occurring within
the 2 x 4 m test excavation N4786/E5050 (SW corner) appears to have been "smeared" by the
plow. Other potential test excavations, such as N4806/E5048 (SW corner), are provided to test
smaller anomalies.

Results of the Mound 7 Study
Webb designated a circular sandy area east of Mound 4 as Mound 7. The mound does not
show up well topographically, although there is a slight rise between Mound 4 and the property
line, further east than plotted by Webb (see Figure 3). An auger test placed in the approximate
26

area in 2004 did not encounter a distinct buried soil horizon and nor a clay overburden leaving the
status of Mound 7 as a cultural feature in doubt. Numerous artifacts are present on the plowed
surface in the area, however, suggesting that habitation may have taken place there. We
sampled the area with four 20-x-20-m grid units (Figure 14). Surface collections also were made
from each of the grid units. Considerably higher amounts of material were found in the
northeastern unit, which is slightly higher in elevation. We expected that anomalies likely to
represent cultural features would most likely occur in that portion of the sampled area. As
discussed below, this turned out not to be the case.
Gradiometry
As with Mound 6, the four geophysical grids composing the Mound 7 study area lie within the
area of active cotton cultivation. The furrows, running from northwest to southeast at an
approximate 40-degree angle are visible in the imagery. The 2 x 2 m unit at N4866/E5240 (SW
corner) contains a large, somewhat amorphous anomaly that extends beyond a single test unit
(Figure 15). The 2 x 2 m unit at N4874/E5236 (SW corner) contains the majority of a more
regularly shaped magnetic anomaly. Both anomalies are similar to signatures that have proven
to be prehistoric archeological features at other sites.

Results of the Pecan Grove study
The pecan grove sample area lies immediately south of Mound 3, much of which was
excavated by Ralph McKinney in 1959 after the former landowner removed a tenant farm house
from its summit (Webb and McKinney 1975). Mound 3 contained at least two human burials that
dated to the Late Caddo period. The burials were placed in the upper moundfill. Underlying the
mound were two layers of midden containing ceramics that appear to date early in the occupation
of the site (ca. A.D. 900-1050). Between Mound 3 and Mound 1 is the western portion of the
plaza, now in a pecan grove. It has not been plowed in recent years, but may have been so in
the past. No archaeological investigations have taken place with the sample area, which
consisted of four 20-x-20-m grids (Figure 16).

Gradiometry
In addition to gradiometry, electrical resistance data were collected for the Pecan Grove
area, but the previously described equipment malfunctions unfortunately rendered the imagery
unusable. Based on the gradiometry, it appears that there is a significant amount of metal
detritus in the Pecan Grove. The potential test excavations shown in Figure 17 were selected to
examine a variety of magnetic signatures, which under many circumstances would be considered
to be metal.

Summary of the Archaeogeophysical Survey
The primary objective of the 2007 Mounds Plantation archaeogeophysical survey project
was to locate geophysical anomalies for future archaeological investigation. Of the four areas
tested, Mound 7 contains anomalies most similar to burned archeological features that have been
ground-truthed in other agricultural settings, such as in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley of Arkansas.
This is especially true of potential test excavation unit N4866/E5240 (SW corner).
The Mound 6 gradiometry also contains a number of interesting anomalies. The strongest
readings for the area occur at approximately N4807/E5056 and N4791/E5077. These anomalies
may be associated with metal. Mound 6 anomalies that warrant testing as possible prehistoric
features occur in or near 2 x 2 m test units N4822/E5052 and N4786/E5050 (SW corner).
Material from both of these magnetic features appears to have been displaced by plowing along
the same orientations as the present cotton furrows.
Historic and modern disturbances and the introduction of metal in the areas of Mound 2 and
the Pecan Grove make the prioritization of anomalies for testing less clear. Geophysical
interpretation for these areas in particular would have benefited greatly from full-coverage using
electrical resistance, which is far less sensitive to the presence of metal. Electrical resistance
data were collected, but spurious positive and negative data spikes in most of the 20 x 20 m data
grids were more numerous than plausibly correct readings, so the data could not be salvaged.
The malfunctioning resistance meter is being repaired, and the Arkansas Archeological Survey is
in the process of obtaining new equipment.
Just as geophysical survey results help inform future archaeological excavations, those
same excavations provide essential feedback for future geophysical interpretations. The ideal
situation would be to begin to build a catalog of geophysical signatures for archaeological feature
types at Mounds Plantation and similar or nearby sites. In that way, field methods, data
interpretation, and pinpointed testing become increasingly effective as surveys continue over a
period of years.

Test Excavations at the Swan Lake Site (16BO11)
Introduction
Archaeological survey and test excavations carried out along Willow Chute Bayou in
northwestern Louisiana, have resulted in the identification of numerous archaeological sites, most
of which were occupied primarily between approximately A.D. 1050 and A.D. 1450 (Girard
1997a). The Willow Chute locality extends for approximately 12 km on the eastern side of the
Red River floodplain, and is important for understanding the late prehistory of the Caddo people
of northwest Louisiana because it appears to represent a dispersed floodplain village, probably
the primary form of settlement for the region beginning in the 11th century A.D.
Although not situated along the Willow Chute channel, the Swan Lake site was a major
component of the Willow Chute community. It contains one of the three documented Caddo
mounds in the locality (only one other remainsâat the Vanceville Site, 16BO7; a mound at the
Werner site, 16BO8, was plowed down in the early 20th century; a fourth possible mound was
reported from the Ed Johnson site, 16BO12, but never investigated prior to its destruction). The
mound is approximately 2.5 m high and about 25 m in diameter. Clarence Webb (n.d.) visited the
site, but only made a short description-Solitary mound on n-east shore of Swan Lake, which is an old Red River channel.
Is circular in shape, approx. 8-10 ft. high, 60 ft. at the base and 20 ft. on summit. Has
several shallow trial holes on top, appears to be built up of sand--no sherds found on or
around mound--trial holes show mostly sandy soil near clay out in field. In one or two
places 3 to 4 inches dark soil found. In nearby field, 1 rough spear head found.
According to the landowner, Webb's visit was in the 1930s and he reportedly dug a small
hole in the mound. However, I cannot find any record of this excavation in his notes. The
landowner also was told that Webb had planned to do additional work at the site but, after hearing
about the impending destruction of the Gahagan Site (16RR2), directed his efforts there and
never returned. Louis Baker of the Louisiana Archaeological Society and I excavated a trench at
its base in the spring of 1995 and demonstrated that it was likely to relate to the Middle Caddo
period (ca. A.D. 1200-1500) (Girard 1995b).
Although plowed and cultivated in the past, the Swan Lake Site now is in pasture with a
portion used as an orchard. Surface collections made by the landowners from garden areas
suggest that Caddo occupation was fairly extensive north of the mound along the edge of low rise
adjacent to the bottomlands surrounding the oxbow lake known as Swan Lake. The collection
has been donated to the Northwestern State University and is described in this report.
In 1994, Louis Baker and I excavated 11 auger tests along the western edge of the site
where the landowners reported finding artifacts. One of the tests encountered a pit feature that
extended almost 2 m below the surface. We excavated five 1-x-1-m test units that covered
approximately half of the feature. Three charcoal samples obtained from the pit feature dated in
the 160 B.C. to A.D. 340 interval. The presence of thick grog-tempered sherds and a Gary dart
point within the pit fill corroborated the radiocarbon ages (Girard 1995a) and suggest that the site
was occupied initially during the Middle Woodland period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 400). No other
site along Willow Chute appears to have been occupied this early. However, a small mound at
the Jim Burt site (16BO23), situated on a Pleistocene terrace remnant north of the floodplain,
probably dates to the same period (Girard 2002a). Numerous sherds that apparently relate to
this early occupation are present in the surface collection and materials from test units.
Most pottery recovered from the site resulted from the Caddo occupation that probably
spanned portions of the Early (ca. A.D. 900-1200) and Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1200-1500)
periods. In June 1994, Baker excavated ten 30-x-30-cm shovel tests across the highest
elevations on the north side of the site. Results from the shovel tests were not reported
previously, but are included in this study. In addition to the prehistoric materials, numerous
artifacts relating to a late 19th to early 20th century occupation of tenant farmers also were
recovered.

31

After the landowner expressed efforts to sell the property in the fall of 2006, Baker and I
returned in October to conduct additional testing to determine whether or not the site is eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places. Specifically, we were interested in finding intact
subsurface features relating to the Caddo occupation of the site. We excavated seven 1-x-1-m
test pits and encountered one cultural feature that likely relates to the Caddo occupation, and one
feature that relates to a late 19th or early 20th century tenant farm residence. Although the
landowners do not want to pursue a nomination at this time, the investigations demonstrate that
the Swan Lake site meets Criterion D for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.
Site Deposits and Features
Information relating to the Woodland pit feature and mound trench has been reported
previously (Girard 1994, 1995a, 1995b). In this section, the site deposits and and cultural
features encountered in the shovel tests and test pits are described. A few comments on the
numbering of the units and site map need to be addressed initially. In 1994, a datum point was
established and contour map of the site was made. At the time, no accurate way was available to
relate the datum to UTM coordinates and the datum was lost following the fieldwork. In the fall of
2006, we established another datum with the coordinates N5000 E5000 Z100 and established a
site grid based on magnetic north. The UTM coordinate for the datum is E436176 N3607006
(measured using a GPS instrument with a 2-4 m error factor). We did not make a second contour
map of the site, but have a basic view of the site topography from use of LIDAR elevation data
that are geo-referenced to UTM coordinates (Figure 18). Using the previous contour map, it was
possible to plot the earlier shovel tests and test pits with a reasonable degree of accuracy. One
of the backfilled shovel tests (ST5) excavated in 1994 was found within one of our 2006 test units
(TP20) aiding in our coordination of the maps.

Statewide GISâ.

The shovel tests excavated in 1994 were labeled ST1 through ST10. The original five 1-x-1m test pits used to explore the Woodland Period pit feature in 1994 were designated TP1 through
TP5. Test Pits 6 through 13 constitute the trench into the base of the mound excavated in 1995.
For the fall 2006 excavations, we continued this sequence and designated our seven units, TP14
through TP20.
Soils at the Swan Lake site are mapped as Gallion silt loam (Chaffin et al. 1962). Gallion
soils are situated on older natural levees in the Red River floodplain and have better developed
soil horizons than those in the active meander belt. In general, they consist of a brown A horizon
that extends to approximately 13â (33 cm) below the surface. Underlying the A is a yellowish red
silty clay loam Bt horizon that extends to a depth of at least 39â (1 m). Sediments in shovel tests
and test pits generally conform to the Gallion series although a weakly developed E horizon was
visible in some profiles. Past plowing has produced a distinctive plowzone (Ap horizon).
Because of little rainfall in the late summer of 2006, the sediments were extremely dry and hard,
particularly along the western edge of the site adjacent to the slope to the bottomlands.
Three of the four designated features were encountered in Test Pit 20. Features 1 and 2
clearly were recent intrusions, both probably relating to shovel excavations that took place within
the last 20 years. Feature 1 almost undoubtedly is the backfilled Shovel Test 5 excavated in
1994. Feature 2, located in the southeast corner of Test Pit 20 appears to represent an older
shovel excavation that likely was made prior to our 1994 investigations. Both features have very
sharp margins consisting of a series of arcs that approximate the widths of modern shovels. The
fill consists of patches of sediments that appear to be mixtures of the A and B horizons. A distinct
patch of clay in Feature 2 was not seen elsewhere in the investigations and its origin is not
known.
Feature 3 is the only possible feature relating to the Caddo occupation of the site. As we
encountered the top of the Bt horizon at 100.00 m (a little over 40 cm below the surface), we
noticed a slightly darker area along the eastern edge of the unit. We continued the excavation
another 25 cm, revealing a possible posthole that was visible in the eastern profile (Figure 19). At
detection level, the feature was approximately 35 cm across, and tapered gently to about 15 cm
at the 99.80 level near its base. The deepest portion was at the 99.78 m level, approximately 65
cm below the surface. The fill of the recent Feature 2 intruded into the top of Feature 3 on the
southern side. The feature does not extend through the Ap (plowzone) and is not likely of recent
origin.

Figure 19. Photograph and drawing of the east profile of TP20 showing outline of Feature 3,
Swan Lake Site
A feature (Feature 4) relating to the late 19th to early 20th century occupation of the site was
encountered in Test Pit 15. Dark deposits continued from the A horizon to the 99.90m (40 cm
below surface), at which point a distinct north to south boundary was visible (Figure 20). West of
the boundary, deposits continued to be dark (7.5YR3/2) and were filled with historic materials. In
contrast, along the eastern side of the unit, the Bt horizon (5YR4/6) was visible. An iron pipe fed
into the northwest corner of the test pit. The top of the pipe was at 100.20, 17 cm below the
33

surface. I suspect that the pipe extended from a former historic house into the bottomlands
adjacent to Swan Lake. The darker, trash-filled deposits apparently relate to a pit or depression
adjacent to the house.

in the northwest corner (lower right of the image).
Artifacts in the Prescott Collection
The Prescott family collected numerous sherds and stone artifacts from the site surface,
mostly from garden areas along the western edge of the landform. It is evident that collection of
decorated sherds was emphasized as less than 10 percent of the specimens are undecorated.
There is no evidence of bias toward certain types of decoration. However, we cannot be certain
and interpretations of the relative percentages of decorative categories should be made with
caution.
Caddo Pottery
The Swan Lake specimens were separated into the major decorative categories used for a
larger study of ceramic variation in the Willow Chute bayou locality (Girard n.d.). Sherds are
classified according to attributes that have been demonstrated to vary temporally across the Early
and Middle Caddo periods in northwest Louisiana (e.g., Webb 1959; 1963; 1983; Webb and
McKinney 1975). Rigorous use of traditional types is not possible primarily because types are
based on whole vessels. As at other Willow Chute sites, most of the Swan Lake sherds are small
and breakage at the rim-body juncture is common. Classification of the sherds into existing types
in an unambiguous manner would result in large proportions of collections as âunclassified.â The
groups employed here are based on attributes that can be monitored in a relatively unambiguous
manner on small sherds. Only specimens with maximum dimensions of 2 cm or greater are
tabulated.
Vessel forms that appear to be common in the area are depicted in Figure 21. An attempt
was made to classify the sherds in terms of vessel parts (rim, neck, shoulder, body, or base) and
thickness of each specimen was measured with digital calipers to the nearest mm (Table 3).
Where possible, rim shapes and diameters were recorded. These data are useful for interpreting
the kinds of vessel forms represented for each group.

I did not attempt to record paste variation for this collection. Almost all specimens appear to
have grog temper and all have sand inclusions. Crushed bone was used sparsely, and no shelltempered specimens were identified.
Undecorated Sherds. These sherds originated from both undecorated vessels and from
undecorated portions of vessels decorated primarily around the rims. Most undecorated rims
probably came from undecorated vessels, although in some cases decorations may have begun
a significant distance below the lip. Because of the tendency to brush utilitarian jar bodies in the
Middle Caddo period, undecorated sherds constitute smaller proportions of collections through
time.
Undecorated rims in the Swan Lake collection (Figure 22 A-F) vary widely in form and it
appears that bottles, jars and small bowls are represented. Five bottle rim sherds (Figure 22 A,
B) have rim diameters ranging from 3 to 6 cm. One jar rim (Figure 22 C) has a rim diameter of 22
cm. Another has a diameter of only 7 cm and appears to represent a very small jar.
All eight base sherds (not included in Table 4) are flat and probably circular (disk shaped),
although none are large enough to measure their diameters. These sherds range from 7 to 12
mm thick.
Seven specimens classified as undecorated have a red slip. One red-slipped rim (Figure 22
F) appears to have been a small bowl with rim diameter of 10 cm.

35

Figure 22. Undecorated and Incised sherds and rim profiles, Swan Lake Site
Diagonal Incised: Decorations consisting of horizontal bands of diagonal lines usually are
classified as Dunkin Incised, a type that began during the Early Caddo period and lasted into the
Middle Caddo period. Webb (1948, 1983) noted that cylindrical jars tend to be earlier than those
with everted rims and referred to the latter as a late variant of Dunkin Incised. A large number of
specimens from Swan Lake can be identified as neck sherds (everted rims lacking the vessel lip)
indicating that this late variant is common. Webb (1983:193) also suggested that lip notching,
another common trait at Swan Lake, is a later trait.
Most decorations on the Swan Lake specimens appear to be relatively simple, consisting of
a band of short diagonal lines (Figure 23; Figure 22 K-N), some of which are framed by horizontal
lines or a row of punctations. Multiple rows (Figure 22 S, T) were identified on only four
specimens. Nested triangle patterns (Figure 22 O-R) also are common, and a few cross-hatched
examples are present (Figure 23). Diagonal incised elements tend to be on rim or neck sherds
indicating that this trait was most commonly applied to the upper portions of jars (see Table 4).
Horizontal Incised: Sixty rim and neck sherds are decorated by bands of parallel horizontal
lines. Two shoulders, probably from carinated bowls, are decorated in a similar manner.
Horizontal incising is associated with several types. Vessels decorated exclusively around the
rim generally are classified as a variety of Coles Creek Incised. Most of the Swan Lake
specimens have multiple lines applied in a relatively sloppy manner and resemble Coles Creek
Incised, var. Hardy. However, paste characteristics suggest that they were locally produced and
do not represent vessels imported from the Lower Mississippi Valley. There are no specimens
with the arc forms characteristic of the type Weches Fingernail Punctated; nor are there any with
the distinctive triangular punctations of the Coles Creek variety of the type Coles Creek Incised.
Bands of horizontal incised lines on rims are present on some vessels of other types
including Kiam Incised, Dunkin Incised, Pease Brushed Incised, and Sinner Linear Punctated.
These all are utilitarian jar forms that relate primarily to the Early and Middle Caddo periods. In
the Middle Caddo period, the Caddos combined incised, brushed, and punctated elements in a
wide range of patterns on utilitarian jars. Although, as noted earlier, differing percentages of the
categories must be interpreted with caution, the abundance of horizontal incised sherds suggests
that occupation began late in the Early Caddo period, perhaps in the 12th century A.D.

36

Figure 23. Summary of decorative variation on Incised Rim Sherds, Swan Lake Site
A few rims have diagonal notches at the lip. Two specimens (Figure 22 I, J) have widely
spaced lines with tapered rims resembling the Greenhouse or Blakely varieties of the type Coles
Creek Incised. Eight sherds have punctations beneath the band of horizontal lines (Figure 23).
One unusual specimen (Figure 22 H) has alternating bands of punctations and diagonal lines
beneath a band of horizontal lines. Five red-slipped specimens probably represent the type East
Incised.
Miscellaneous Incised: Forty-eight body sherds that have multiple parallel lines in a single
direction are classified as âmiscellaneous incised.â Orientations of these sherds are not clear,
and they may be from either horizontal incised or diagonal incised vessels.
Curvilinear Incised: Along Willow Chute Bayou, curvilinear incised lines appear to have
been used to form scrolls, circles, and filler elements, but in few cases is it possible to determine
design motifs or even elements. Use of curvilinear incising was a minor technique at Swan Lake,
appearing on only six specimens, all of which are too small to determine design elements. The
specimens might pertain to vessels of the types Crockett Curvilinear Incised or French Fork
Incised, both of which relate primarily to the Early Caddo period.
Free Punctated: Punctated sherds are separated into three categories: free punctated,
linear punctated, and incised punctated (Figure 24). Free punctated sherds have multiple
punctations with no apparent incised framing lines. Much variation in the shapes and spacing of
the punctations is evident (Figure 25 A-E). Vessels of the types Kiam Punctated Incised (with
incised rims) and Wilkinson Punctated (punctated to the rim), both of which relate primarily to the
Early Caddo period, are likely to be represented.

37

Figure 24. Summary of decorative variation on punctated sherds, Swan Lake Site

Figure 25. Selected punctated and incised punctated sherds, Swan Lake Site

38

The relatively high percentage of body sherds (see Table 4) reflects the frequent use of this
decoration on the bodies of large jars, often with incised rims (Kiam Incised). The rim and neck
sherds indicate that the jars tend to have vertical to slightly everted rims. It was possible to
measure the rim diameter of only one specimen. This rim likely was from a small jar with a rim
diameter of 12 cm.
Incised Punctated: Most of these sherds have punctations in zones that are framed by
rectilinear or curvilinear incised lines, and most are likely to be from vessels of the type
Pennington Punctated Incised, which was most abundant in the Early Caddo period. It is
possible that some examples of the types Crockett Curvilinear and Haley Complicated Incised are
included.
A few specimens appear to have incised rims with punctated bodies (Figure 25 L-N). One
sherd (Figure 25 O) has an unusual pillar shaped element filled with punctations. Underlying this
element is a band consisting of a single row of punctations framed by incised lines.
Linear Punctated: Two varieties of linear punctated sherds are present in the collection (see
Figure 24). Twenty-four sherds have flat punctations aligned in horizontal or diagonal rows
(Figure 26 A-G). Applique nodes are present on two (Figure 26 D-E). On ten specimens (Figure
26 H-N), the punctations are close-spaced and applied diagonally to give a corrugated effect.
The type Sinner Linear Punctated encompasses both varieties. This type has panels consisting
of multiple parallel rows of punctations in contrasting directions (Suhm and Jelks 1962:143) and
generally is associated with the Middle Caddo period. Rim forms in the collection indicate that
jars with vertical to slightly everted rims are represented. It was not possible to measure rim
diameters for any of the specimens.
Brushed:
Brushed jars became very common in the Middle Caddo period throughout
northwest Louisiana and generally are typed as either Bossier Brushed (Webb 1983) or Karnack
Brushed Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). Bossier Brushed jars tend to have tall, horizontally
brushed rims. Brushing on vessel bodies often is diagonal or multi-directional. Karnack Brushed
Incised vessels tend to have short, flared rims, and vessel forms are similar to those of the type
Belcher Ridged (see below). Brushing (or occasionally incising) on vessel bodies usually is
vertical. The brushed rims in the Prescott collection exhibit a wide range of forms (Figure 27 A-D)
and both types may be represented. Diagonal brushing on body sherds appears to be common
(Figure 27 E-F) although orientation is difficult to determine on many specimens. Rim diameters
of 12, 22, and 26 cm were measured on three specimens.
Applique Ridged: The type Pease Brushed Incised consists of brushed or diagonal incised
jars that have vessel bodies separated into panels by vertical appliquÃ© (and usually notched)
strips of clay (Figure 27 G-I). Relative to other sites along Willow Chute Bayou, the type appears
to have been quite rare at the Swan Lake site. Pease Brushed Incised vessels almost always
have brushed or incised rims and thus, no rim sherds are classified in this category.
Ridged sherds: Ridged pottery, generally classified as Belcher Ridged, was made by
forming clay into narrow ridges with the use of a tool or finger (Webb 1959:136). Rims tend to be
short and flared, often with vertical or diagonal incising or brushing. Rims classified with this
group all retain portions of the upper bodies with visible ridges (Figure 27 L-O). Orifice diameters
range from 10 to 18 cm (n=5), suggesting that small to medium jars are prevalent.
Engraved sherds: The complexity of design elements and patterns presents difficulties for
classification of engraved sherds into types defined on the basis of whole vessels. For this
analysis I have grouped the sherds into five categories (Figure 28) based on dominant design
elements:

Figure 28. Summary of decorative variation on engraved sherds, Swan Lake Site
Group 1âThese sherds have cross-hatched, wide bands or zones along with multiple
parallel horizontal or diagonal lines (Figure 29 A-H). Decorations tend to be relatively crudely
executed and vessel surfaces are not polished. Temper particles (grog, bone in three examples)
often are exposed on surfaces. Jars and shouldered bowls are represented, but the shoulders
are not sharp as with true carinated bowls. There may be a relationship with the type Sanders
Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:137) generally found upstream along the Texas-Oklahoma
border.

Group 2âThese are sherds with finely cross-hatched zones or bands (Figure 29 I-K).
Vessel surfaces are polished and paste is finely textured. One possible bottle sherd is present,
but the rest appear to be bowls. No shoulders from carinated bowls are represented. Two rim
diameters measured at 15 and 16 cm suggest that the bowls were relatively small. Webb (1948)
probably included similar specimens in the type Maddox Banded Engraved. Hempstead
Engraved (Suhm and Jelks 1962:69), a Middle Caddo period type found widely in southwest
Arkansas, may be represented.
Group 3âThis is a poorly defined group of engraved sherds with rectilinear elements, some
of which are hatched bands or zones (Figure 30 A-G). Although there is much variation in rim
forms, most specimens appear to represent bowls. One rim diameter of 15 cm was measured.
No definite carinated bowls or bottles are represented.
Group 4âThese sherds have simple horizontal lines (Figure 30 I-K). Most are small and
may be on vessels with more complex designs. However, some might represent the type Hickory
Engraved, which dates primarily to the Early Caddo period. One bottle sherd is present.

Figure 30. Additional engraved sherds, Swan Lake Site
Group 5âThis group consists of sherds with horizontal lines, often ticked, and arched
dividers. The design elements are common on carinated bowls of the type Glassell Engraved.
Glassell Engraved began in the Middle Caddo period and lasted into the Late Caddo period.
Similar elements are present on some bowls of the type Natchitoches Engraved, and a few of the
rim forms (Figure 30 H, L) appear to represent rimmed bowls common with the Natchitoches
type. However, Natchitoches Engraved vessels tend to be shell-tempered and no sherds
characteristic of the complex body decorations of the type are present in the collection.
Group 6âThese sherds have curvilinear engraved lines. Some appear to be portions of
curvilinear bands, but most are too small to determine the nature of the design elements
represented (Figure 30 M, N).
Woodland Pottery
The presence of the Middle Woodland period component presents a challenge for
classification that does not exist elsewhere along Willow Chute Bayou. Sherds recovered from
the Middle Woodland period pit feature excavated in 1994 have distinctive, friable, coarse-grained
paste that usually includes relatively large grog, sand, and/or bone particles added as temper.
Although some sherds have characteristics of Tchefuncte pottery, all have some temper. I
attempted to sort sherds with similar paste characteristics and classify these separately as

42

Woodland period pottery. In many cases, this task was relatively straightforward; in other cases it
was not and it is possible that some specimens are mis-classified.
Of the 78 specimens identified, 43 (55.1%) are undecorated. Nine are rims, 24 are body
sherds, and ten appear to be thickened bases. None of the vessel bases are the flat, disk
shaped forms that are common among Caddo vessels. Rather, most vessels appear to have
tapered to gently rounded and thickened bases. Both jars and bowls appear to be represented in
the collection. Included are: a shallow bowl with a rim diameter of at least 33 cm (Figure 31 A); a
vertical sided bowl with a rim diameter of 28 cm (Figure 31 B); and five rims (Figure 31 C-E) that
probably represent jars. As was the case for Late Woodland period sites in the Natchitoches
area (Girard 2000b, 2001), rim forms exhibit much variability.
Because Woodland period ceramics have not been well studied in the region, it is not
meaningful to assign the decorated sherds into specific types. Instead, I separated the
specimens into five groups.
Group A (n=4): These specimens consist of cross-hatched rim or neck sherds (Figure 31 FH). One specimen has rows of punctations both above and below the cross-hatched zone
(Figure 31 G). Although execution of the incised lines tends to be sloppy, the specimens
resemble the type Marksville Incised. The sherds appear to be from jars with vertical to slightly
everted rims.
Group B (n=7): These specimens also all appear to be neck or rim sherds. Decoration
consists of diagonal incised lines or combinations of diagonal and horizontal incised lines (Figure
31 I-L) resembling the type Alligator Incised (Phillips 1970:39). Two rims (Figure 31 I,J) appear to
represent small bowls with incurving rims and rim diameters of only 12 and 16 cm. The
thickening of the lip on the specimen illustrated in Figure 31 J is a common feature at the late
Woodland period Fredericks site (16NA2) in Natchitoches Parish (Girard 2000b).
Group C (n=4): These are four body sherds that have rows of punctations and incised lines.
The specimens are too small to determine the represented decorative patterns or vessel forms.
Group D (n=13): This group consists of five rim and neck sherds and eight body sherds. All
contain relatively large punctations, generally lunate to hemispherical in shape. The single rim
sherd of substantial size (Figure 31 M) is from a relatively large jar. In terms of decoration, this
group resembles the Caddo types Kiam Incised and Wilkinson Punctated. However, the pastes
are similar to the Woodland specimens.
Group E (n=3): These three specimens are rim or neck sherds with single rows of sloppily
executed triangular punctations. The punctations are on the necks of everted rim vessels on two
(Figure 31 Q, R), and just below the lip on the third (Figure 31 S).
A Woodland period occupation of the Swan Lake site was demonstrated by the excavation
of a large pit feature that contained charcoal radiocarbon dated to the Middle Woodland period
(Girard 1995a). The cross-hatched rim sherds (Group A) also are suggestive of a Middle
Woodland period occupation. Similar forms of decoration were absent from the Late Woodland
period Fredericks site in the Natchitoches area. On the other hand, some specimens from Swan
Lake resemble Alligator Incised, a type generally assigned to Late Woodland (Baytown period)
contexts in the Lower Mississippi Valley, suggesting that occupation may have continued after
A.D. 400. A better regional ceramic chronology for Woodland period contexts in northwest
Louisiana is needed.

Artifacts from the Test Units
Prehistoric Artifacts
Ceramics. Although relatively few specimens were recovered from the test units, and
specimens tend to be small, the sample provides information about relative quantities of the
decorative categories (Tables 4 and 5). More than 80 percent of the Caddo sherds are
undecorated. This percentage is high relative to most sites in the Willow Chute locality where
undecorated percentages generally range between 45 and 75 percent. The paucity of brushed
and appliquÃ© ridged sherds suggests that occupation began during the Early Caddo period and
lasted into the early part of the Middle Caddo period. However, Belcher Ridged sherds, more
often associated with the latter part of the Middle Caddo period and Late Caddo period, are
relatively abundant. I cannot resolve this dilemma with the current data. It is possible that there
was a hiatus in occupation, followed by a brief re-occupation several hundred years later.
However, the site lacks diagnostic types of the Late Caddo period such as Cowhide Stamped,
Foster Trailed Incised, and Belcher Engraved. Webb (1983:193) suggested that Belcher Ridged
might have been made, at least in small quantities, back to the Early Caddo Period. If so, it is
extremely rare at other sites along Willow Chute.

Lithics. Chipping debris (flakes, cores, angular fragments) was recovered throughout the
site (Tables 6 and 7). Most of the chipping debris is local chert (n=108 or 92.3%). Eight
novaculite flakes and small pebble cores were recovered. One quartzitic sandstone flake
probably resulted from breakage of a celt. Chunks of upland material (ferruginous sandstone,
ironstone, silicified wood) may represent fragments of materials brought in for grinding and
abrading tools. It is possible that some stone pertains to the historic occupation of the site.
Only two chipped stone tools were recovered. A dart point with a narrow contracting stem
(Figure 32) is of the Gary type and probably relates to the Woodland period occupation. A similar
specimen was recovered in 1994 from the fill of Woodland pit feature. The second specimen is a
small lateral biface fragment.

Historic Artifacts
It is likely that one or more historic structures were present in the areas around Test Pits 15
and 19 as a relatively large amount of historic artifacts, including bricks, nails, and window glass,
was recovered in these units (as well as Shovel Tests 1-3) (Tables 8 and 9). No brick piers or
other footings were encountered, however. As noted earlier, Feature 4 in Test Pit 15 appears to
represent a pit that was filled with trash. Descriptions of the historic artifacts are organized by
material categories.
Glass. Glass fragments are the most numerous recovered historic artifacts. Most fragments
are too small to identify the complete artifact from which they came. One exception is a small,
stemmed goblet of clear glass recovered from Test Pit 15 that was partially reconstructed (Figure
33 C). Both the rim and base diameters are 6 cm. A base of a syrup bottle of amber glass

46

(Figure 33 A) was recovered from Test Pit 19. Fourteen molded glass fragments in all were
recovered. These include lamp glass and small serving dishes or vases (Figure 33 B).

Figure 33. Molded glass artifacts from the Swan Lake site
Most of the glass fragments are curved and are likely to represent bottles or other vessels
(Tables 10 and 11). Fifteen bottle bases, one bottle neck, and seven bottle rims were identified.
Flat glass fragments, mostly window glass, totals 68 specimens. The remaining specimens could
only be classified as shatter or unidentified small fragments.
Historic Vessel Ceramics.
The dominance of undecorated whiteware/ironstone
earthenwares generally indicates an occupation that dates to 1870 or later. Decal, gilt, and
sponged treatments were recovered in very small amounts (Tables 13 and 14). All are late 19th
to early 20th century modes of decoration. All three examples of decal decoration are floral
patterns. Two are on hollowware, one on flatware. Both gilded specimens are cups or small
bowls--one has a gold band under the rim; the other has a floral element on the interior. Both
transfer printed specimens are on whiteware. One is cobalt blue; the other is black. The sherds
are very small and patterns cannot be discerned. One hand painted specimen with a blue, floral
pattern was recovered. This form of decoration relates primarily to the early 19th century, but it
has been noted that similar decorations were common between 1880 and 1910 (Kovel and Kovel
1986:237).

Five porcelain sherds were recovered. Two are transfer printed (curvilinear, possibly floral
elements) saucers or plates. Another specimen appears to be hand painted (pattern unknown)
on the interior. Finally, one porcelain bowl sherd has a gilded floral element on the interior.
Slip glazes dominate the stoneware sherdsâtwo have Albany slip, one Bristol slip, and the
remainder are of an unidentified light brown slip. Three sherds with salt glaze also were
recovered. Two of these are unglazed on the interiors.
Nonvessel Ceramics. Two white porcelain buttons, both with four holes, were recovered.
Metal. Iron artifacts were in very poor condition and it is not possible to classify the vast
majority in any meaningful manner. Nails appear to be abundant--both wire and machine cut
examples can be identified, but are too poorly preserved to quantify. Identifiable iron artifacts
include an iron band and cast iron stove or appliance handle from Test Pit 19; and a handle from
Test Pit 20.
Three lead artifacts were recovered. A bullet (.20 cal) and lead shot (.32 cal) came from
Shovel Test 2. An unidentified lead chunk came from Shovel Test 5.
Both recovered coins are nickels. A shield nickel (Figure 34 A) came from Test Pit 15. The
specimen is too worn to determine the date, but shield nickels were minted between 1866 and
1883. Recovered from Test Pit 20 was a Liberty Head nickel dated 1891 (Figure 34 B).

Figure 34. Nickels and metal clasp from the Swan Lake site
Also recovered was a spring clasp of unidentified metal (Figure 34C). The clasp has an
ornate molded pattern and the raised letters âLindsay Patentâ on one side; with âpat. Nov3.74.
apr23.78.â on the opposite side. A search of records from the U.S. patent office indicated that
John P. Lindsay of Boston (later New York) patented many garment clasps between 1870 and
1890.
Stone. Nine small fragments of slate were recovered.
Bone. Two small fragments of modified bone objects were recovered. One appears to be a
fragment of a utensil handle; the other may be a comb tooth.
Discussion
The Swan Lake Landform
Geomorphological studies indicate that the Red River has occupied its current valley for the
past 12-14,000 years. At the beginning of this time it was entrenched at least 4-5 m below the
present elevation of the floodplain, and it has been aggrading throughout the Holocene (Pearson
and Hunter 1993:31). The evolution of the floodplain was complex and it has proven difficult to
isolate and date specific depositional surfaces. Saucier and Snead (1989) identified six meander
belts within the floodplain and mapped surface deposits associated with each. Willow Chute
flows through Saucier and Snead's Hmr2, the meander belt occupied immediately prior to that of

50

the modern river. Autinâs (1997) study of the channel patterns and information from the recent
borings indicate that portions of Hmr3 remain in the southern portion of the Willow Chute area,
and include the landform upon which the Swan Lake site is situated (Figure 35).
The time of the avulsion marking the shift from Hrm2 to the modern belt is not known.
Saucierâs (1974:17) chart puts it as recently as 500 years ago. However, Albertson et al.
(1996:24) report a radiocarbon date of 4610 +/-60 BP from a Hrm2 overbank deposit along Finn
Bayou in southwestern Arkansas. Archaeological sites along Finn Bayou date back to the Late
Archaic period, suggested to date in the 5000 to 2500 B.P. interval in that region.

Figure 35. Landforms in the Willow Chute locality (after Autin 1997)
At the north end of the Swan Lake site, a charcoal sample was recovered from 2.6 m below
the surface at the top of backswamp sediments that were overlain by natural levee deposits. An
earlier natural levee was buried beneath the backswamp deposits (Autin 1997: Table 2). The
sample was dated at 3290+/-50 B.P. (C-13 corrected to 3280+/-50 B.P.) (Beta-105512 AMS
method). If the natural levee overlying the backswamp represents overbank deposition that
occurred while Swan Lake was the active channel of Red River, then either: (1) Hrm3 (and
hence Hrm2) is not as old as current estimates; or (2) Swan Lake relates to Hmr2 rather than
Hmr3. It is possible that the situation is complex and Swan Lake is an Hmr3 channel segment
later re-occupied when Hmr2 was active. In this case the natural levee deposits underlying the
backswamp might relate to the time Hmr3 was active. A shift to Hmr2 initially resulted in the
formation of a backswamp near Swan Lake, but the channel eventually migrated closer and

51

constructed the second natural levee. The date, then, would relate to an event within the time
Hmr2 was active, not to its onset.
In either event, the date suggests that existing estimates of the active span of Hmr2 might be
a little early. However, Hmr2 is discontinuous between Willow Chute and Finn Bayou and
correlating belts between different segments of the floodplain is problematical. It is possible that
a single belt (Hmr2) was occupied in the Finn Bayou area over a time span when two separate
belts (Hmr2 and Hmr3) formed in the Willow Chute area.
Radiocarbon dates from surface deposits along Willow Chute indicate that the natural levees
were essentially stable by the 1700 B.P. to 2100 B.P. range. At the Swan Lake site (16BO11)
charcoal recovered from a large pit feature dug from the top of the upper natural levee dated
within this range (Girard 1995b: 9-10) indicating that the natural levee had built to its current
elevation approximately 1500 years after deposition began. A radiocarbon assay obtained from a
buried scatter of charcoal at the Vanceville Site (16BO7) also was within this range. Although the
charcoal did not appear to be related to human occupation (probably burned tree roots), the date
indicates that the natural levee was in place at that time (Girard 1996:19). Thus, the evidence
suggests that, in the Willow Chute Bayou locality, Hmr2 was active by 3300 B.P. (perhaps
considerably earlier). Landforms became stable by the 1700-2100 B.P. interval, suggesting that
the Red River had shifted to the modern belt by the time of the Middle Woodland period
occupation of the Swan Lake site.
Ages of Occupations
Pottery resulting from the Middle Woodland period occupation of Swan Lake is scattered
throughout the site and mixed with later materials. No major periods of deposition resulted in
stratification of the site deposits and vertical separation of the components. However, Woodland
period sherds constitute increasingly high percentages of the total prehistoric sherd assemblage
with greater depth for the shovel tests and test pits (Figure 36). This trend might be a result of
the slow aggrading of sediments since the early occupation, or due to deeper displacement of
materials into the deposits because of the greater length of time for biorturbation.

Figure 36. Percentages of Woodland period sherds by 10-cm excavation levels, Swan Lake Site
Possible contemporary occupations are represented at two sites situated on the Pleistocene
terrace deposits that lie between Black Bayou and the Red River floodplain (Figure 37). The
Allison site (16BO167) is located on a ridge that directly overlooks the floodplain on the eastern
side of the Willow Chute area. Dart points, chipping debris, ground and polished stone artifacts,
as well as a small number of sherds were recovered from the surface and five test pits excavated
in the southwestern portion of the site. Ground and polished stone specimens consist of a broken
plummet, an engraved fragment of slate, and a flat celt fragment. Sherds from the Allison site
have distinctive silty pastes and are similar to those from the pit feature at Swan Lake (Girard
1995b).

Figure 37. Locations of Middle Woodland period components in the Willow Chute area
At the western end of the Pleistocene terrace that borders the Willow Chute locality, is a
small mound (Jim Burt Mound, 16BO23) that has been eroded and trampled by cows. During the
early 1960âs, Robert Fulton, Robert Scott, and Mike Beckman excavated a trench through the
mound and described the deposits as a homogeneous âsand-clayâ (Webb 1984:264-5).
Excavations were stopped before encountering the sub-mound surface because a historic burial
was encountered. A few sherds with clay, clay/grit, and bone temper were recovered. Although
most were undecorated, a few specimens had incised lines. In 1995, Louis Baker and I found a
Keithville point on the eroded mound surface, and a small stemmed point on the terrace slope
north of the mound. We excavated a 1-x-1-m test unit approximately 8 m southeast of the mound
and recovered sherds, flakes, and chunks of fire-cracked rock. All of the sherds have a friable,
laminated paste, similar to the Swan Lake specimens. Also encountered in the test unit was a
large lump of charcoal at approximately 50 cm below the surface. Although the charcoal was not
associated with a pit or other feature, because of its depth and apparent association with early
pottery, it was collected for radiocarbon analysis. An age of 2200Â±70 B.P. was obtained (Beta8280; wood charcoal; Î´13C=25.5%) [cal B.C. 394-40] (Girard 2002a).
A dispersed Caddo village appears to have stretched across the Willow Chute locality
beginning late in the Early Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1100). Ceramics from Swan Lake suggest that
the site may have been one of the early settlements at the south end of the community. The
Mounds Plantation site (16CD12), located immediately across the Red River from the Willow
Chute locality, probably served as a regional ceremonial center with a large residential population
during the initial expansion of the village. By the 13th century, however, the residential population
at Mounds Plantation appears to have dispersed and there is little evidence of use of the site.
Following abandonment of Mounds Plantation, at least three mounds eventually were constructed
along Willow Chute, including the small mound at Swan Lake. The timing of mound construction
is not known. However, ceramic data from the Vanceville (16BO7) and Werner (16BO8) sites
suggest use in the late 14th or early 15th centuries.
In contrast to Mounds Plantation with its multiple mounds surrounding a plaza, mounds
along Willow Chute were dispersed within the community. The reasons for placement of the
mounds are not known. The mound at the Werner site capped a large structure. The mound was

53

plowed down prior to archaeological study, but no burials or other features were reported.
Material culture associated with the remaining moundfill and underlying structure was atypical for
the Willow Chute area. An unusually high percentage of engraved sherds was present, and the
majority of these had highly polished surfaces with red and white pigments in the engraved lines.
Chipped stone tools and chipping debris, common at other Willow Chute sites, were present only
in small quantities. Numerous cut and perforated mussel shells (possible ornaments) were
recovered. The faunal assemblage was skewed to the presence of bones, particularly deer,
which would have yielded choice meat cuts. Very little habitation debris was present in the
immediate vicinity of the mound. These traits suggest that the structure beneath the Werner
mound was not a typical habitation locus, but may have served as a meeting place for community
leaders, or a place of religious or ritual significance (Webb 1983:226-232).
Although only a small test unit has been placed at the base of the Vanceville Mound,
conditions appear very different from Werner. Artifacts were numerous within and beneath the
moundfill, but they did not appear to differ significantly from those recovered elsewhere along
Willow Chute (Girard 1995b). Dense habitation debris surrounds the mound and adjacent areas.
The situation at Swan Lake appears to be more similar to Vanceville with typical residential areas
placed in close proximity to the mound. It is not clear whether or not the presence of a mound
marks higher social status of the Swan Lake residents relative to their Willow Chute neighbors.
The terminal date of Caddo occupation at Swan Lake is not known, but the site apparently
was abandoned along with the rest of the Willow Chute community by the early 15th century. I
have suggested elsewhere (Girard 1997a) that natural construction of an alluvial ridge along the
modern course of the Red River may have reached a higher elevation than the abandoned Hmr2
belt, increasing the propensity for inundation during flood stages. Historic rafting of the Red River
may have also contributed to a diminishment of habitable conditions in the area. A layer of clay,
40 to 60 cm thick, overlies the old surfaces of the natural levees along most of Willow Chute, and
early 19th century accounts depict the area as an uninhabited backswamp (e.g., Flores 2002).
Final clearing of the rafts along Red River in the 1870s opened up much of the floodplain to
farming and habitation. The Swan Lake site was cultivated in cotton by the early 20th century,
and an unknown number of tenant farm residences were present along a road on the western
side of the natural levee overlooking the lake bottom. Artifacts recovered in the test pits suggest
that these residences may have started in the late 19th century. Mechanization of farms during
the 1950s resulted in a steep drop in the number of tenant farms in the region and it is likely that
the Swan Lake tenant houses were abandoned prior to that time.
Summary of Research Significance
Few sites relating to the Middle Woodland period have been identified in northwest
Louisiana. Almost all are upland mounds with little evidence of associated habitation. The pit
feature at the Swan Lake site that was partially excavated in 1994 is the only non-mound
archaeological feature investigated in northwest Louisiana that dates to the Middle Woodland
period. The feature was a relatively short-term context that yielded datable charcoal enabling
dating of ceramics and other artifacts found within the fill. Other features relating to the
Woodland period occupation are likely to exist at the site.
The Swan Lake mound is one of only two Caddo mounds in the Willow Chute locality and
one of four identified in Bossier Parish. It is likely that the mound covers structural remains or
contains human burials (or both). Feature 3 appears to represent a posthole relating to the
Caddo occupation suggesting that broader block excavations may reveal structures and
associated features where fauna and other perishable materials are preserved. Research at the
Swan Lake site has the potential to yield a wealth of information regarding late prehistoric Caddo
community arrangement and social organization.
Many sites relating to tenant farm residences have been identified along Willow Chute
Bayou and elsewhere in northwest Louisiana. However, none have been systematically
investigated. Artifacts and faunal remains pertaining to the historic occupation of Swan Lake are
numerous, and Feature 4 indicates that intact features are present. Many aspects of early 20th

54

century tenant farmer lifeways are not well recorded in historic documents. Additional research at
Swan Lake has the potential to yield significant information regarding household economies and
social identities.
In summary, test excavations at the Swan Lake site have demonstrated that significant data
are present that will address several important research topics. The site appears to meet criteria
for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

Sites Along Toledo Bend Reservoir
Introduction
Record low lake levels on Toledo Bend Reservoir during the late summer of 2006 exposed
large areas along former tributary creeks of the Sabine River. Before levels ascended in midOctober, I recorded 18 new sites near the DeSoto-Sabine parish line, and one site farther south
in Sabine Parish. The sites were assigned numbers in the order that they were recorded (Toledo
Bend No. 1 through 19). Not surprisingly, the sites were heavily collected during the low lake
levels. No disturbances were found to human burials or other significant cultural features.
Site Descriptions
16SA91
This is the only previously recorded site visited during the survey. The site was recorded in
the fall of 1990 when the lake level was 4-5 ft lower than normal pool level. The upper portion of
a Pease Brushed Incised jar was found exposed along the shoreline (Figure 38). Neither the
remainder of the vessel, nor other artifacts, was found in the immediate vicinity. It was thought
likely that a human burial had been exposed by erosion from lake level fluctuations (Girard
1991:13).

Figure 38. Portion of Pease Brushed Incised vessel from 16SA91, Toledo Bend Reservoir
Examination of the area during the late summer of 2006 revealed no additional evidence of
cultural activity. Although no trace of the site could be found, it is possible that burials associated
with nearby site Toledo Bend No. 1 (16SA252) are present at 16SA91. Subsurface testing will be
necessary to obtain additional information. Insufficient information is available to determine
whether or not this site meets requirements for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Toledo Bend No. 1 (16SA252)
Approximately 100 m west of 16SA91 is an extensive site situated on a natural levee
adjacent to a former channel segment of the Sabine River (Figure 39). Toledo Bend No. 1 is an
essentially contiguous scatter of prehistoric artifacts that extends approximately 400 m along the
old channel scar. Artifacts are present from the channel side of the natural levee crest back
toward the uplands for a distance of almost 100 m. At normal pool level (ca. 172â asl), the site
lies beneath 9 to 10 ft of water. At the time of investigation, it was separated from SRA Park No.
4 on the Tertiary uplands by a shallow channel of water that was easily crossed. Numerous
footprints, and comments from local collectors, indicate that this site had been extensively
collected by the time of our visit in late August 2006. Surface deposits were generally fine sandy
loam, but patches of sandy clay loam, evidently where the topsoil had eroded and exposed the Bt
horizon, were visible. Although not mapped by the Natural Resource Conservation Service, soils

56

on the site probably are similar to the Gallion Series, which appears on natural levees along older
courses of the Red River in northwest Louisiana (Hudnall and Edwards 1991:108).
Despite the collecting, numerous artifacts remained exposed on the surface. Most common
was chipping debris (flakes, pebble cores) and undecorated sherds. Several dispersed
concentrations of unmodified, or perhaps fire-cracked, ferruginous sandstone cobbles were
observed, but it was not possible to determine whether or not these represent cultural features.
We collected a sample of 56 sherds from the surface for analysis. Most specimens have a
combination of grog and fine sand inclusions. It is not certain that the sand has been intentionally
added or is a natural inclusion in the clay. Sand particles tend to be angular and are not well
sorted. Surfaces of almost all specimens are rough and pitted (perhaps from loss of sand
particles), a common feature of sherds from the lake.
Most of the sherds (87.5%) are undecorated and too small to determine vessel form. The
single rim obtained is oriented inward and appears to represent a bowl with a rim diameter of
approximately 30 cm. Three sherds likely represent flat vessel bases. None are sufficiently large
to determine outline shapes. Thickness of the 50 body sherds range from 4 to 9 mm, with a
mean of 5.82 mm; well within the typical range of Caddo assemblages in the Red River drainage.
One large portion of an engraved carinated bowl was collected (Figure 40 A). The exterior
surface is slightly polished; the interior only partially smoothed. Although the rim is missing, the
curvature at the shoulder is approximately 32 cm, indicating a large vessel. The design element
consists of a negative circle surrounded by two wide curvilinear bands that are separated by
hatched bands. Execution of the design is irregular and sloppy. The specimen cannot be related
to an established type.

Figure 39. Locations of sites recorded in the SRA Park 4 area, Toledo Bend Reservoir

57

Figure 40. Selected sherds from Toledo Bend No. 1
A single sherd has closely-spaced, trailed lines (Figure 40 B) and may represent the type
Keno Trailed. The sherd is only 4 mm thick and has fine grog paste without visible sand particles.
Two sherds have zoned punctated designs. One (Figure 40 C) appears to be decorated
only on the upper part of the vessel. Rows of diagonal punctations are bordered by a horizontal
incised line. The second (Figure 40 D) is a rim sherd with a triangular zone filled with small
punctations made with a sharp instrument. The specimen appears to represent a jar, but is too
small to determine the rim diameter. One sherd has vertical incised lines and probably relates to
the type Karnack Brushed Incised (Figure 40 E). The other is from a Pease Brushed Incised jar
that has diagonal incised lines that are separated by vertical incised lines rather than the appliquÃ©
ridges more common to the type (Figure 40 F). Another Pease Brushed Incised sherd is more
typical, with vertical brushed panels and an appliquÃ© ridge panel divider (Figure 40 G).
The relatively low percentage of decorated specimens is unusual for a Middle or Late Caddo
period site. In contrast, approximately 50 percent of the sherds recovered from the Burnitt site
(16SA204), located approximately 12 km to the east near San Patricio Bayou, were decorated
(Kelley 2006:61). Toledo Bend No. 1 had been extensively surface collected by the time of my
visit, and it is possible that collectors removed many decorated specimens. However, it does not
seem that simple brushed and ridged sherds (which generally constitute the majority of decorated
specimens) would be significantly more attractive to collectors than undecorated specimens. It is
possible that occupation pre-dating the Middle Caddo period is represented, although there is no
other evidence for this. In the Red River drainage north of the mouth of Loggy Bayou, zoned
punctated pottery appears to have dropped out of use quickly in the early part of the Middle
Caddo period. It survived much later to the south, where significant amounts were present at the
15th century Fish Hatchery 2 site in Natchitoches (Girard 2006b). The zoned punctated rim from
Toledo Bend No. 1 is clearly from a jar, not a carinated bowl--the form more common with the
Early Caddo period type Pennington Punctated Incised. The Pease and brushed sherds are
indicative of Middle Caddo period occupation, and the probable Keno Trailed sherd suggests the
Late Caddo period. However, no Belcher Ridged sherds, the most common type at the Late
Caddo period Burnitt site, were recovered. The poor sample size and possibility of bias against
decorated specimens precludes making any definitive statements about time of occupation. It is
possible that the site was occupied intermittently throughout late prehistoric times.
One complete dart point (Figure 41 A) was collected. The specimen is crudely chipped and
made from a slab of silicified wood. It appears to relate most closely to the Kent type, generally

58

considered to relate to the Late Archaic period (Webb 2000:10). Two thick bifaces (Figure 41 B,
C), also of silicified wood were collected. Both lack secondary marginal retouch and may
represent coarse cutting tools or discarded blanks. Four small biface fragments (Figure 41 D-G)
probably represent flake tools broken during manufacture. Two unifacial scrapers (Figure 41 H,
I), both plano-convex in cross section, are finely retouched along the widest, convex portions of
their margins. Portions of the edges and planar surfaces are worn smooth. These tools appear
to be end scrapers of forms often assumed to relate to the PaleoIndian or Early Archaic periods.
Numerous flakes and pebble cores were present on the site surface. Examples of two pebble
cores are shown in Figure 41 J, K. The stone tools from Toledo Bend No. 1 suggest that the site
might have been occupied intermittently throughout prehistory.

Figure 41. Stone artifacts from Toledo Bend No. 1
Toledo Bend No. 1 is in fair condition of preservation. Many artifacts have been collected
from the surface and upper deposits are eroded. However, there is a possibility that intact
subsurface features exist. The site is extensive and contains many artifacts. Present information
suggests, on the other hand, that several different occupations relating to long spans of time are
mixed together. Subsurface testing is necessary to determine whether or not datable features
are present. Based on the number of sherds, it appears most likely that information concerning a
Middle to Late Caddo period occupation is likely to be the most complete and subject to
substantive interpretation. Additional investigations are needed to determine if the site meets
criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 2 (16SA253)
Toledo Bend No. 2 is located approximately 1 km south of Toledo Bend No. 1 in a similar
topographic settingâa natural levee along an abandoned channel segment of the Sabine River
(see Figure 39). Artifacts are scattered for approximately 300 m along the former channel and
extend from the lakeshore for 100 m toward the uplands, essentially covering the crest and upper
slopes of the natural levee. Pottery sherds are by far the most numerous artifacts observed.
Densities are moderate to high. A moderate amount of chipping debris, including flakes and
pebble cores, is scattered across the site. Chunks of ferruginous sandstone also are dispersed
across the site. No definable clusters of sandstone or other possible prehistoric cultural features
were noted. As with Toledo Bend No. 1, there was evidence that the site had been collected by
the time of my investigation.
The site also had a historic component represented by scattered brick fragments and a few
stoneware sherds. A possible historic feature consisted of a cluster of brick, approximately 2 m in
diameter, with several large stoneware sherds (Figure 42). The narrow range of historic materials
(brick, stoneware) suggests that the site was the location of an outbuilding (shed, barn) rather
than domestic residence.

59

Figure 42. Cluster of brick and stoneware sherds at Toledo Bend No. 2
The prehistoric pottery from this site is highly variable and it is likely that more than one
occupation is represented. The primary occupation might date to the Woodland period as mean
sherd thickness (7.47mm) far exceeds that at most Caddo sites in northwest Louisiana and
resembles that at late Woodland period contexts. Many sherds crumble easily and have irregular
margins. Pastes appear contorted and, although clay temper may be present, the particles are
not easily isolated and might be unfired. Other sherds have abundant sand in the paste with
sparse grog particles. Relatively to the first group, pastes are compact and hard. Finally, there
are a few sherds that have mixtures of grog and fine sand in the paste, similar to those at Toledo
Bend No. 1. Crushed bone was present in two specimens.
Only three of the 60 collected sherds are decorated. One specimen has curvilinear, wide
incised lines that appear to form bands filled with punctations (Figure 43 A). The interior of the
specimen also appears decorated with wide incised lines and punctations (Figure 43 B). The
specimen is thick (8 mm) and has abundant grog and sand temper. It might represent a variant
of the type Churupa Punctated (Phillips 1970:67-69).

Figure 43. Selected artifacts from site Toledo Bend No. 2

60

Another decorated specimen (Figure 43 C) has a series of parallel straight lines that appear
to form a horizontal band, probably near the rim of the vessel. The lines are sharp and thin. The
specimen is only 5 mm thick and has bone and fine sand temper. The final decorated specimen
(not illustrated) is very small, and appears to have a single curvilinear incised line. It is 7 mm
thick and has grog and fine sand temper.
Eight undecorated rim sherds were collectedâtwo of which clearly are from bowls. One jar
rim is very small and thin, and flares sharply to the exterior. Another rim is vertical with a thick,
flat lip. This specimen has contorted paste containing clay lumps as temper (possibly grog).
Three flat base sherds were collectedâtwo are 9 mm thick and one is 11 mm thick. The thinner
specimens have the distinctive clay lump temper. Two other sherds, one 10 mm thick and one 11
mm thick, are convex but may represent conical or thickened bases.
The sherds with crumbly paste from Toledo Bend No. 2 are similar to those recovered at a
series of sites (16SA183-186) along the lower reaches of Bayou La Nana in 1991 (Girard
1992:13-15). Although the Bayou La Nana sites had multiple occupations, much of the pottery
was comparable in thickness and paste characteristics to those at Toledo Bend No. 2. One
Marksville Stamped, var. unspecified, sherd was present at Bayou La Nana No. 1 (16SA183)
suggesting a Woodland period affiliation. Later occupations might be represented at Toledo
Bend No. 2 as well, but no decorated specimens characteristic of the Middle or Late Caddo
periods were found.
Stone artifacts collected from the site include six pebble cores (Figure 43 D), a battered
small cobble of quartzite likely to have been a hammerstone, two slabs of silicified wood
retouched along the margins that may have served as coarse cutting tools, and a pebble blank
(Figure 43 E) with the distal end missing.
The apparently dominant Woodland period occupation is of considerable interest because so
few contexts pertaining to that time have been investigated in the region. However, like Toledo
Bend No. 1, this site needs subsurface testing to determine whether or not buried cultural
features are present. Although a possible cultural feature is present on the surface, the historic
component of this site is not likely to yield significant information because of the sparse nature of
the material remains. Additional investigations need to be carried out at Toledo Bend No. 2 in
order to assess whether or not it contains sufficient information for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 3 (16SA254)
This site is located approximately 400 m north of Toledo Bend No. 1 adjacent to a tributary
of the Sabine known as McDonald Bayou (see Figure 39). The site is situated on a distinct rise
that appears to have been at the confluence of McDonald Bayou and an old channel of the
Sabine River. The site is relatively small (approximately 80 x 20 m) and artifacts are sparse.
Observed were a small number of flakes, one pitted grinding stone, and a chipped stone biface.
As with the previously described sites, small chunks of ferruginous sandstone are scattered
across the area. This site is only about 100 m south of the uplands and the sandstone might be a
result of natural erosion. No collections were made from Toledo Bend No. 3. Due to the sparse
nature of the material remains, it is unlikely that significant information could be obtained from
additional investigation of this site. Toledo Bend No. 3 does not meet criteria for eligibility to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 4 (16SA255)
This is a badly disturbed site adjacent to a dredged canal on the southwest side of SRA Park
No. 4. The site is situated on a low rise between the canal and the lower end of Augustine Bar
Creek (see Figure 39). The boat canal probably has cut through a portion of the site. Artifacts
are scattered across an area of approximately 140 x 70 m. Chert flakes and pebble cores are
dominant, but a few small, undecorated sherds were observed as well. The site is easily
accessible from the park and was heavily trampled and riddled with shallow holes. Collectors
reported finding many projectile points. The extensive disturbances have impacted site integrity

61

to the degree that Toledo Bend No. 4 does not meet criteria for eligibility to the National Register
of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 5 (16SA256 )
Toledo Bend No. 5 consists of four sparse clusters of flakes, pebble cores, and small sherds
adjacent to an old road that, prior to construction of the reservoir, ran south along the edge of the
floodplain. The site differs from those previously described in its setting away from the crest of
the natural levee of the old channel scar. The region between the natural levee and uplands to
the east is relatively level, but contains numerous low rises and gullies, probably due to
unchannelized drainage from the uplands. Low-density scatters of artifacts are present on
several of the low rises and definition of site boundaries is somewhat arbitrary. The four clusters
constituting this site are located within 20 m of one another. No cultural features are visible on
the site surface. Toledo Bend No. 5 probably represents an intermittently occupied camp. It
would be difficult to isolate and date specific occupations, and it is unlikely that buried features
are present. The site does not meet criteria for eligibility to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Toledo Bend No. 6 (16SA257)
This site is on a low rise approximately 50 m east of Toledo Bend No. 2 (see Figure 39). It
consists of a sparse scatter of flakes and pebble cores covering an area of approximately 100 m
x 50 m. No sherds were observed. Because of the sparse nature of the material remains,
additional investigation would not yield significant information and Toledo Bend No. 6 does not
meet criteria for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 7 (16SA258)
South of Toledo Bend No. 2, beyond a small inlet that represents the lower end of an
unnamed upland drainage, is another relatively dense scatter of prehistoric sherds, flakes, and
pebble cores. The site covers an area of approximately 150 x 75 m. Like sites Toledo Bend
No.âs 1 and 2, the scatter is situated on the crest and upper slopes of the natural levee that
borders an old meander scar of the Sabine River.
A total of 85 sherds was collected from Toledo Bend No. 7. All but four of the specimens are
undecorated. Most have grog and fine sand inclusions. Rim forms of undecorated sherds
collected from the site include a shallow bowl with a slightly thickened lip (Figure 44 A), vertical
rim bowls (Figure 44 B, C), and tall rimmed jars (Figure 44 D-H).
Three specimens (Figure 44 M) contain only abundant sand and relate to the distinctive
sandy paste wares of the Mossy Grove tradition in eastern Texas (Story 1990:256-7). Sandy
paste wares are not abundant west of the Neches River drainage, but a few specimens were
found at the James Pace site (16DS268) near Logansport (Girard 1994) and at the Bayou La
Nana sites (Girard 1992). North of the Gulf Coast, the sandy paste wares usually are indicative
of pre-Caddo (Woodland period) occupations. The mean thickness of sherds collected from
Toledo Bend No. 7 (7.33 mm, S.D.=1.40 mm) also is suggestive of the Woodland period.
Three brushed sherds were collected, but all are thick (8 mm), have coarse grog temper,
crumble easily, and have irregular margins (Figure 44 J-L). Brushed pottery has not been
recognized from Woodland period contexts in northwest Louisiana, but has for the Lower
Mississippi Valley in the types Chinchuba and Salomon Brushed (Phillips 1970: 158). The fourth
decorated specimen (Figure 44 I) appears to be from a Pennington Punctated Incised carinated
bowl, a type that relates primarily to the Early Caddo period (Suhm and Jelks 1962:121).

62

Figure 44. Rim profiles and selected sherds from Toledo Bend No. 7
No cultural features were observed on the surface of Toledo Bend No. 7, but it is possible
that subsurface features are present. Negative impacts to the site include erosion of the upper
soil horizon and collection by artifact hunters. However, as with Toledo Bend No. 2, isolation of a
Woodland period occupation would be of considerable research value for the region. Surface
observations indicate that the site had a sustained occupation that likely resulted in significant
numbers of artifacts and possible features. Subsurface investigations of this site are needed to
determine whether or not it contains sufficient information for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 8 (16SA259)
This is a small (50 x 50 m) site containing late 19th to early 20th century artifacts. The site is
situated on the crest of the natural levee adjacent to a small tributary from the uplands (see
Figure 39). Observed on the surface were undecorated whiteware/ironstone sherds, stoneware
sherds, unidentified fragments of iron, one machine cut nail, and bottle glass fragments. The
artifact density is relatively high. No brick fragments or other evidence of structural remains were
present suggesting that the artifacts might represent a trash dump. Cultural features are unlikely
to be associated with this site and, given the likelihood of secondary deposition, it does not meet
criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend Nos. 9, 10, and 11 (16SA260, 261, and 262)
These three small sites are located east of Toledo Bend No. 5, in similar topographic
settingsâon low rises interspersed with gullies due to outwash from the uplands (see Figure 39).
Site boundaries are difficult to define as artifact densities are very low. All three sites contain
flakes and pebble cores. Toledo Bend No. 9, approximately 70 m x 40 m in extent, also had a
pitted sandstone cobble and one small, undecorated prehistoric sherd. Toledo Bend No. 10
measures 30 m x 30 m and contained a dart point perform in addition to the chipping debris. No
sherds or tools were noted on Toledo Bend No. 11, which measures approximately 75 m x 30 m.
These sites might represent limited activity areas associated with habitation areas along the crest
of the natural levee to the west; or may be small camps dating primarily to the Archaic period. It
is possible that all three, along with Toledo Bend No. 5, were originally contiguous but have
become separated by subsequent drainage off the uplands. The sites are unlikely to contain
63

cultural features and material remains are sparse. None meet criteria for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 12 (16SA263)
Toledo Bend Nos. 12 through 15 are located north of the previously described sites, along
the lower reaches of Cow Bayou near the Sabine-DeSoto Parish line (Figure 45). The sites are
situated on a long ridge that extends westward into the Sabine River floodplain. At normal pool
level, the ridge is beneath 10 to 12 ft of water. Site 12 is located the farthest to the east, at the
eastern reservoir shoreline at normal pool level. The site is situated on the edge of upland
deposits associated with a Pleistocene terrace remnant that intermittently lies between the
Tertiary uplands and Holocene floodplain deposits (Murray 1948). The water has cut into the
deposits, washing away the topsoil and deflating artifacts onto the exposed Bt soil horizon.
Sandy beach deposits covered the lower portion of the slope (to the existing shoreline) at the time
of our visit. Chipping debris was present in low densities in the area of exposed clay. However,
this is a favorite area for local collectors and many dart points, including many Evans points,
reportedly have been obtained from the site. The site is relatively large, extending across an area
of at least 250 x 150 m. No features or sherds were observed, or have been reported, at this site.
The site probably represents a repeatedly occupied camp that dates primarily to the Archaic
period.
Despite the reported presence of numerous projectile points, the eroded nature of the
deposits has impacted site integrity to the point that it is doubtful that significant information could
be acquired from more intensive investigations. Therefore, the site does not meet criteria for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.

Toledo Bend No. 13/14 (16SA264)
Located at the western end of a long Holocene terrace adjacent to the old channel of Cow
Bayou is an extensive scatter of pottery sherds, chipped stone tools, and chipping debris in an
area formerly known as the Hicks Field. The eastern portion of the site lies at a distinctly higher
elevation and was initially recorded separately (Site 14) from the western end (Site 13). Since the
areas are essentially contiguous and contain similar materials, they are here combined into a
single site that covers an area of approximately 300 m x 200 m. Artifact density is high and,
despite its remote location, the site is accessible by four-wheelers and has been extensively
collected. There was no evidence of digging at the time of our investigations.
A collection of 49 sherds was made from the site surface. Only four are decorated. One
specimen has sloppy horizontal lines on a rim that flares sharply outward (Figure 46 A) with a rim
diameter of 22 cm. A punctated rim also has the decoration applied in a sloppy manner (Figure
46 B). Diagonal incised lines are present on one of the remaining decorated sherds (Figure 46
G); the other has a portion of a single wide, curvilinear incised line (Figure 46 H). Undecorated
rims include a shallow bowl (Figure 46 C), two probable jars with everted rims (Figure 46 D, E),
and a probable rim tab (Figure 46 F).

Figure 46. Selected artifacts from Toledo Bend No. 13/14
Stone tools collected from this site consist of a dart point perform (Figure 46 I) and a thick
cobble of silicified wood with bifacial retouch along portions of its margins (Figure 46 J).
Although the surface has been impacted by sheet erosion from the lake, and four-wheeler
tracks crossed the site, Toledo Bend No. 13/14 appears to be in relatively good condition. The
high percentage of undecorated pottery, and the presence of only incised and punctated
specimens, suggests occupation on the Late Woodland or Early Caddo period time level. The
site is extensive and contains many artifacts suggesting that a substantial population may have
resided there. No surface features were visible. Subsurface testing is necessary to locate
possible buried features, and to recover charcoal or additional datable artifacts to help determine
the time and cultural affiliation of the inhabitants. Present information is not sufficient to
determine whether or not the site meets criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.
Toledo Bend No. 15 (16SA265)
This site consists of a sparse scatter of stone tools and chipping debris covering an area of
approximately 75 m x 60 m along the highest elevations of the terrace along Cow Bayou (see
Figure 45). A Keithville point and flake scraper (Figure 47), both possibly associated with the
Early Archaic period, along with several flakes were found on the surface. No cultural features
were observed.

65

Figure 47. Scraper and dart point from Toledo Bend No. 15
Although the material remains appear to be sparse, the presence of a possible Early Archaic
component, unmixed with later occupations, suggests considerable research significance to this
site as little is known about this time period in northwest Louisiana. Subsurface testing is needed
to identify possible buried features and materials to help date the represented occupations.
Present information is not sufficient to determine whether or not the site meets NRHP eligibility
criteria.
Toledo Bend No. 16 (16SA266)
Two sites were recorded on the southern edge of the SRA Park 4 area (see Figure 39).
Toledo Bend No. 16 is a scatter of prehistoric Caddo and late 19th century artifacts along the
shoreline south of Site 8. Although boundaries are not well defined, the site covers an area of
about 150 m x 60 m. Prehistoric materials consist of undecorated grog-tempered sherds, flakes,
and pebble cores. A Caddo occupation probably is represented, but the absence of decorations
on the sherds precludes assessment of the temporal affiliation. Historic materials observed on
the surface include undecorated whiteware sherds, one transfer printed sherd, stoneware sherds,
bottle glass fragments, and widely scattered brick fragments. No cultural features were noted. A
historic house may have existed on or nearby the site but its location could not be determined.
The potential of this site to yield significant data appears to be limited relative to sites located
farther north such as Toledo Bend No.âs 1, 2, and 7. Material remains are sparse and widely
scattered. Toledo Bend No. 16 does not meet criteria for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 17 (16SA267)
Toledo Bend No. 17 is another dispersed scatter of Caddo and middle to late 19th century
historic artifacts (see Figure 39). The scatter covers an area of approximately 200 m x 70 m.
Prehistoric sherds are mostly undecorated and grog-tempered. One punctated sherd is
suggestive of occupation during the Early Caddo period. Also present are flakes, pebble cores,
and one hammerstone.
Historic artifacts are relatively numerous at this site and indicate that occupation probably
began in the middle 19th century. Eleven whiteware sherds were collected. Five are undecorated
whiteware/ironstone and appear to represent a mug, two small plates or saucers, a small cup or
bowl, and a soup bowl. Three shell edge flatware sherds (Figure 48 A-C) were collected. Two
flow blue transfer print specimens also were collected. One is from a soup bowl or plate (Figure
48 D), and one is a cup or small bowl decorated on both the exterior and interior (Figure 48 E).
Three other transfer printed plate sherds (Figure 48 F-H) are in the collection. Six stoneware
sherds include two salt glaze specimens, and four with unidentified slip glazes (Figure 48 I).
Numerous bottle glass fragments were observed on the surface. One black bottle neck with an
applied rim was collected (Figure 48 J). Scrap iron also was scattered across the site, including
several machine cut nails (Figure 48 K). No structural remains or other cultural features were
noted. A house apparently was present on or near the site, but its precise location could not be
determined.

66

Figure 48. Selected historic artifacts from Toledo Bend No. 17
Portions of this site might have remained underwater at the time of investigation. The
prehistoric materials are relatively sparse and unlikely to represent a component that will yield
significant research data. The 19th century component appears to be more substantial, and it is
possible that, if the lake level drops farther, additional investigations will expand the site
boundaries and discover structural remains and other features. Present information is not
sufficient to determine whether or not this site meets criteria for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places.
Toledo Bend No. 18 (16SA268)
This is a small site located at the back of the floodplain adjacent to a relatively steep bluff to
the Tertiary uplands (see Figure 39). This site is situated near the shoreline at normal pool level,
and is badly eroded by lake level fluctuations. Several modern houses are present near the site
and it probably has been collected extensively. The site consists of a scatter of Caddo sherds
and flakes that extend across an area about 60 m x 20 m. Beach deposits cover the surface to
the west, and it is possible that we were able to observe only a portion of a much more extensive
site. The pottery differs markedly from other sites recorded during the survey. Sherds are
relatively small, thin, and many have crushed bone temper. Six specimens have fine sand
inclusions (possibly natural) without visible temper. Collected were 25 sherds, seven of which are
brushed body sherds (Figure 49 D-F). Other decorated specimens include a horizontal incised
sherd (Figure 49 A), and a carinated bowl shoulder of the type Glassell Engraved (Figure 49 B).
An undecorated carinated bowl rim (Figure 49 C) also was collected.
A Middle to Late Caddo period occupation clearly is represented, perhaps on a time level
associated with the Burnitt Site (16SA204) located in the San Patricio Bayou drainage about 12
km to the east (Kelley 2006). Because of its small size and eroded deposits, the potential of
additional investigations to yield important information may be limited. However, the site appears
to have only a single component, and subsurface investigations might enable expansion of site
boundaries and detection of buried features. Additional research is needed to determine whether
or not Toledo Bend No. 18 meets criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.

67

Figure 49. Selected sherds from Toledo Bend No. 18
Toledo Bend No. 19 (16SA269)
Toledo Bend No. 19 was recorded following contact by a landowner who had property
adjacent to the lake in the southern portion of Sabine Parish. The lowered lake level exposed
artifacts at the western point of a long ridge (Pleistocene terrace remnant) adjacent to the former
channel of Arnold Creek (Figure 50). Artifacts covered an area of about 100 m x 200 m.
Additional scatters were reported on other portions of the exposed Pleistocene terrace to the
south, but the lake level covered the area before I had the opportunity to carry out additional
survey.

Figure 50. Sketch map of Toledo Bend No. 19
The landowner has amassed an extensive quantity of prehistoric artifacts that includes dart
points, arrow points, chipping debris, grinding stone fragments, and sherds. Dart point forms are
highly varied and include San Patrice, Evans, Gary, and several stemmed and notched forms of
undetermined type (Figure 51). Preforms and biface blanks are numerous indicating on-site
manufacture of tools. Decorated sherds include brushed, incised, and punctated incised
examples.

68

Historic artifacts also were present on the surface. Most abundant were undecorated
whiteware/ironstone sherds, bottle glass, and unidentifiable iron fragments. Clusters of
sandstone cobbles were visible, but these may represent relatively recent features. An old road
bed across the top of the ridge can be discerned. The road formerly crossed the Sabine
floodplain and extended into Texas.
The site appears to have been occupied intermittently throughout prehistory. Deposits are
partially eroded and deflated, and it is likely that artifacts from long spans of time are mixed
together. However, controlled surface collections and subsurface testing might enable isolation
of relatively short-term components that could yield important information on the regional
prehistory. It is possible that buried features are present at this site. The historic occupation
appears to have dated to the early 20th century. There was no evidence of a house or other
structures within the area examined, but it is likely that structures and other facilities existed
nearby. Present information is not adequate to determine whether this site meets criteria for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.

Discussion
Toledo Bend Reservoir is the fifth largest artificial lake in the United States and the largest in
the South. The lake is approximately 65 miles long and contains over 1200 miles of shoreline.
Construction began in 1964 with completion of the power plant and subsequent filling of the lake
in 1969. Archaeological surveys were conducted by the University of Texas and Southern
Methodist University during the 1960s (Scurlock and Davis 1962; Scurlock 1964; McClurkan et al.
1966; Woodall 1969; Benham et al. 1973). Although numerous sites were identified, they
constitute only a small fraction of those likely to have existed. Less than a dozen sites were
subjected to test excavations, and some of the excavations were of a very limited nature.
Consequently, our knowledge of the prehistory and early history of this portion of the Sabine
River drainage is severely limited.
Survey of exposed portions of the shoreline resulting from lowering the lake level adds
significantly to our knowledge of site distribution patterns along older stream courses on the
margins of the Sabine River floodplain. The research value of many individual sites, however,
appears limited due to severe erosion and deflation of sediments. When lake levels drop in the
future, subsurface testing for the presence of buried features is warranted at selected sites that
have substantial artifact assemblages and relatively intact deposits.

Other Investigated Sites
Sites Along Lake Vernon, Vernon Parish
In November 2006, Lake Vernon in Vernon Parish was dropped approximately 6 ft below
normal pool level (Figure 52). With assistance of members of the West Louisiana Chapter of the
Louisiana Archaeological Society, I surveyed approximately 20 acres of shoreline along the
southwest side of the lake, and recorded two sites. Rains subsequently re-filled the lake and no
additional surveys were conducted.

Figure 52. Locations of sites on Lake Vernon, Vernon Parish. LIDAR contour data distributed by
âAtlas: The Louisiana Statewide GISâ. LSU CADGIS Research Laboratory, Baton Rouge, LA,
2006. http://atlas.lsu.edu.
Lake Vernon No. 1 (16VN3600)
A small lithic scatter (approx. 50 x 20 m) was found on the margin of an unnamed bayou
feeding the lake. Surface deposits were fine sandy loam but were eroded to clay adjacent to the
water. Lithic material consisted primarily of silicified woodâsome of which may have eroded
from the adjoining uplands, but other specimens were undoubtedly chipped. Two bifaces made
on tabular slabs were collected (Figure 53 A, B). This site has been eroded by lake level
fluctuations and material remains are sparse. Lake Vernon No. 1 does not meet requirements for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Lake Vernon No. 2 (16VN3601)
The second site covered approximately 40 m x 20 m on the crest of a narrow ridge that
extended into the lake. Surface deposits were fine sandy loam. The site consisted of chipping
debris and stone tools. Three dart points (Figure 53 C-E) were collected. All three relate to the
Gary or Kent types that are common in Late Archaic contexts in the region. The landform on
which this is site is situated was only partially exposed by the drop in lake level. It is likely that
this site is more extensive and its research potential cannot be evaluated. More information is
needed to determine whether or not the site meets criteria for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.

Figure 53. Artifacts from the Lake Vernon sites, Vernon Parish
The Mulford Site (16CD317), Caddo Parish
A survey plat map made in 1837 for Township 16N Range 16W in southwestern Caddo
parish by surveyor John Boyd includes an area labeled âIndian Villageâ in Section 35 (Figure 54).
Triangular (tipi?) symbols appear to cover a ridge between a north-south road and the
bottomlands of the south branch of Boggy Bayou. In his field notes (Louisiana State Land Office,
Baton Rouge), Boyd simply noted âa deserted villageâ without further elaboration. Boydâs
notations are among the few references to Native American villages on the initial survey plats of
northwest Louisiana. The treaty relinquishing all Caddo lands in Louisiana had been signed in
1835 and ratified in January 1836. However, many Caddos remained in the area, at least
intermittently, through 1838 (Carter 1995:288-290; Smith 1995:139-140). No specific historic
references to the village depicted on Boydâs map are known.

State Land Office, Baton Rouge.

I attempted to plot the village on a modern topographic map and investigated the area that
appeared to be the most likely locationâa high ridge overlooking South Boggy Bayou (Figure
55). According to the landowner, many years ago people (whose identity is not presently known)
looking for the remains of the village found artifacts along the ridge. The ridge was in dense
woods. Recently thinned timber resulted in many branches and low weeds covering the site
surface. The ridge is part of the Tertiary uplands composed of deep sandy sediments in this
area. I surveyed the entire ridge with a metal detector, but encountered only a couple of hits
pertaining to recent metal debris. I then excavated four 30-x-30 cm shovel tests. The first test
was placed on the southern edge of the crest of the ridge. Deposits consisted of brown fine
sandy loam to a depth of 50 cm, at which level clay skins and redder bodies indicating the top of
the Bt horizon were encountered. Seven small flakes of local chert were recovered.

Figure 55. Topographic map of the Mulford Site, Caddo Parish. LIDAR contour data distributed
by âAtlas: The Louisiana Statewide GISâ. LSU CADGIS Research Laboratory, Baton Rouge, LA,
2006. http://atlas.lsu.edu.
The second shovel test was placed along the property line at the southern edge of the ridge.
Deposits were similar, but the Bt horizon was not encountered by 50 cm. One large undecorated
sherd was recovered along with six flakes. The undecorated sherd is moderately thick (7 mm)
and has fine sand and grog inclusions. Shovel Test 3 was placed on the crest of the ridge north
of Test 1. Two small, undecorated sherds and two flakes were recovered. The deposits also
contained small, unmodified chunks of silicified wood and ferruginous sandstone. A fourth shovel
test was placed a couple hundred meters to the north in a relatively level area that had been
badly disturbed by timber cutting. No artifacts were recovered.
A late prehistoric occupation is represented, but with only three undecorated sherds, it is not
possible to relate the site to a particular period. However, the thickness and paste characteristics
73

of the sherds suggest a Caddo occupation. Additional investigations are need to assess the
siteâs research potential and eligibility for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
The Mulford site clearly does not relate to the 19th century occupation depicted on the plat
map. It is not likely that Boydâs âdeserted villageâ refers to artifacts from a prehistoric occupation.
The road on Boydâs map appears to coincide with a modern highway, and the plotted site must be
close to the Mulford Site. It is possible that it was located in the adjoining bottomlands. Due to
modern drainage conditions, these areas were swampy at the time of the investigations. It also is
possible that Boydâs site is located on other relatively level upland areas located to the west.
The Delrie Site No. 1 (16NA416), Natchitoches Parish
A large surface collection has been obtained by Tommy Delrie at the Delrie No. 1 site
situated on upland deposits at the western edge of the Red River floodplain in southern
Natchitoches Parish. Delrie encountered a human burial eroding from deposits on the north side
of the house (Figure 56), but conducted no systematic excavations. In 2005, Delrie and I
excavated an auger test into a rise that was thought to be a possible earthwork. The auger,
however, demonstrated that it is natural. Ceramics in Delrieâs collection indicate that occupations
took place both during the Late Woodland period and Early Mississippi period (Girard 2005:53).

Figure 56. Contour map of the Delrie Site No. 1 (16NA416), Natchitoches Parish. LIDAR contour
data distributed by âAtlas: The Louisiana Statewide GISâ. LSU CADGIS Research Laboratory,
Baton Rouge, LA, 2006. http://atlas.lsu.edu.
In the spring of 2007, we excavated three 50-x-50-cm test units. The first unit was placed
approximately 5 m north of the Delrie house, and the second unit a few meters south of the
house. These tests were excavated in three 20 cm levels. The upper 40 to 50 cm of deposits
consisted of dark brown fine sand A horizon underlain by pale brown to yellowish brown E
horizon that extended to the depth of the excavations. No B horizons were encountered. All
74

artifacts were encountered in the upper 50 cm. The third unit was placed in the eastern portion of
the site ridge near a shed and barn. This is an eroded area where patches of sandy clay Bt
horizon deposits are exposed on surface. Flakes have deflated onto these deposits and are
exposed on the surface. The test unit encountered dark brown silty clay loam to 20 cm with red
sandy clay beneath.
Sixteen sherds were recovered from the test units. Five specimens are incised (Table 14).
All are relatively small, but one bowl rim (Figure 57 A) with diagonal incised lines in an unusual
pattern was recovered. Another rim sherd has horizontal and diagonal incising (Figure 57 B). A
body sherd, also with horizontal and diagonal incising (Figure 57 D), also was recovered. Wide
horizontal incised lines (Figure 57 C) are present on one specimen, and the final decorated sherd
has sloppy incised lines and punctations (Figure 57 E). The sherds range from 4 to 7 mm thick,
and pastes of most specimens are grog tempered and typical of late prehistoric
(Caddo/Mississippi) periods in the area. Three undecorated specimens, however, have poorlywedged, contorted paste and might pertain to the Woodland period component. On thick sherd
has grog and bone temper and apparently represents a flat vessel base.

No cultural features were encountered. Although some intact deposits remain, disturbances
from recent residential activities around the house have diminished the research potential of this
site. Artifacts are exposed on the surface to the west, but almost all of the upper deposits are
eroded. Although some intact deposits remain around the Delrie house, disturbances and
erosion are too severe to qualify the site for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.

The Chaseland Sugar Mill (16RA1374) and Chase Home Site (16RA1375)
The Chaseland Plantation, located along Bayou Boeuf in southern Rapides Parish, was
started in the early 19th century. It was one of four plantations owned by Judge George Mathews,

75

who lived from 1774 to 1836. Mathewsâ daughter, Anne, married Captain William Chase and the
Chase family resided on the property. Records from the plantation are in the special collections
at Hill Memorial Library at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge.
I was contacted by the current landowner who had an interest in learning more about ruins of
a sugar mill on the property (Figure 58). The visible structure consists only of brick rubble, but
two chimney stacks remain standing (Figure 59). A large brick cistern is present on the west side
of the structural ruins. Based on the brick scatter, the site covers an area of about 100 m x 130 m
but it is possible that associated artifacts extend across a larger area. The surface was covered
by grass and weeds at the time of the survey. However, brick and scrap iron were visible along
with four cast iron sugar kettles, reportedly unearthed by a former landowner when plowing.
Archival research has not been conducted, but the former landowner believes that the U.S. Army
burned the mill on its retreat during the 1864 Red River campaign. Later sugar mills were
constructed on the Compton Plantation (16RA882) located downstream from Chaseland, and to
the north at the Carter Mill site (16RA883) (Girard 1999:66-67).
An undated (early 20th century?) photograph provided by the landowner, shows a wood
structure near the still standing mill (Figure 60). The mill remains were overgrown with vegetation
at the time the photograph was taken. The building appears similar to another mill along Bayou
Boeuf at the Rosalie Plantation, a photograph of which was reproduced in Eakin (1987).

Sugar Mill site, Rapides Parish.

Rapides Parish.
The landowners also were aware of the approximate location of the original home of William
and Anne Chase. In that area, we found an extensive (approximately 400 m x 150 m) artifact
scatter in a plowed field (Figure 61). The artifact density is relatively high and the former
landowner reported that two brick cisterns, both destroyed by plowing, formerly were visible.
Both whiteware and pearlware sherds were present on the surface. Decorated specimens
include shell edge, transfer printed, and hand painted floral specimens. Also noted were
stoneware sherds, bottle glass fragments, and scraps of iron. The former landowner has a
padlock, lead bullets, a gun barrel, brass military buttons, and ceramic pipe fragments (Figure 62)
from the site. Also in his collection are a copper bracelet (Figure 62 B) and concho or buckle
(Figure 62 A) which might be items acquired in trade with early 19th century Native American
groups in area. A Biloxi Village site (16RA60) (Hunter 1994) is located 3 km to the south; and a
Pascagoula village site (16RA950) is located 2 km to the north (Girard 2000a). North of the
Pascagoula village were the Old Youahny village (no site identified) and Chacto Village
(16RA104) (Heartfield et al. 1978).
Both of these sites appear to contain considerable information relating to Antebellum
settlement in the region. The sugar mill ruins have the potential to yield important data relevant to
understanding early industrial technology. The Chase Home Site is likely to provide information
about architecture, trade practices, subsistence strategies, and other aspects of Antebellum life in
the area. Additional investigations are needed to obtain more information about the site deposits,
possible buried features, and site boundaries. This information will be necessary to nominate the
sites to the National Register of Historic Places. It might be possible to combine the Chaseland
Plantation sites with the Compton (16RA880) and Wellswood (16RA884) Plantations (Girard
1999) located immediately downstream to form a National Register district.

The Calvin Clark Site (16NA624), Natchitoches Parish
The landowner of the Calvin Clark site contacted me after a large pit opened up in front of
his house located south of the city of Natchitoches along Cane River (Figure 63). The landowner
had partially filled the pit with old brick, but it was clear that portions were lined with a thin layer of
concrete. We did not find brick behind the concrete, but only a small area was visible. The
opening to the pit (Figure 64) was about 1.5 m diameter. The pit was bell-shaped, but we could
not determine the depth or width. A ceramic pipe fed into the pit from the house (west) side.
The Clark property (boundaries later became Sec. 78âsee Figure 63) is part of the old
Dartigeaux Plantation. A house is plotted on the property on the 1794 Maes map of Cane River.
The accuracy of the plotting may be questionable, but the structure appears to be located north of
the site. A âwidow Dartigeauxâ is shown as the owner of the property on 1841 and 1850 survey
plats. According to the landowner, the Dartigeaux place later was known as Glory Island
Plantation.

Figure 63. Contour map of the Calvin Clark Site (16NA624), Natchitoches Parish. LIDAR
contour data distributed by âAtlas: The Louisiana Statewide GISâ. LSU CADGIS Research
Laboratory, Baton Rouge, LA, 2006. http://atlas.lsu.edu.
The nature of the feature is ambiguous. It might be a cistern or well, possibly associated
with late 19th or early 20th century occupations rather than the old Dartigeaux residence.
However, because residential occupation in the area is documented back to the late 18th century,
there is potential research significance to the site and immediately surrounding areas. Additional
investigations are needed to investigate the nature and extent of archaeological remains, and to
determine whether or not site meets criteria for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places.
