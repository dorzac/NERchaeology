Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
proposed 19-mile Admiral to Orla Pipeline that courses through northeastern Reeves County ,
Texas. The proposed right-of-way is 50 feet wide x 19 miles, for a total of 115.15 acres. The
project was entirely privately funded, however a small segment of the pipeline will cross over
General Land Office property; therefore, Texas Antiquities Permit #9090 was obtained. Photos
and files are curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State University.
A full pedestrian field survey was conducted by Tierras Antiguas archaeologists during the
period June 26-July 1, 2019. Surface visibility ranged from 80 to 100-percent along the right-ofway, and revealed predominantly eroded, deflated, and mechanically disturbed surfaces. A total
of 27 shovel tests were excavated: 17 on three newly discovered archaeological sites (41RV184186), and the remaining 10 near drainages where there was a potential for terrace deposits to
exist. Site 41RV184 is a small prehistoric campsite of an unknown age. Sites 41RV185 and
41RV186 are upland lithic procurement sites. 41RV185 is of an unknown age. However, a crude
polyhedral core and blade at 41RV186 suggest an Early Archaic/Paleoindian presence. In
addition, archaeologists documented 13 isolated finds along the right-of-way.
Our assessments of the three prehistoric sites and the 13 isolated finds were that they possess
little if any integrity or significance. None are recommended for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. Accordingly,
Tierras Antiguas recommended that construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed as it is
currently planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas
further recommended that if any undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during
development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archaeological consultant. No artifacts were collected or curated during this project, and
no historic structures were visible from the right-of-way.

review was requested by Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd.
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within at least one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
1

type of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of local soils maps in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials within or immediately adjacent to the PA

Figure 2. Project Area on large topographic map.
The proposed work includes brush clearing of a 50-foot right-of-way, 19 miles long (115.15
acres); 35 feet of the right-of-way will be used as temporary work space, and 15 feet will be used
for mechanical trenching. The maximum depth of trenching will be six feet. Otherwise, bore
holes as deep as 12 feet will be excavated in order to bore under major drainages.

Modern Setting
The Project Area lies within the
southern end of the High Plains
vegetation area (Figure 3) as
defined by Gould (1975), and
the regional flora has been
classified as being part of the
Chihuahuan biotic province
extending outward from northcentral Mexico (Figure 4). The
plants and animals of this
province have adapted to the
arid conditions in the
mountains and deserts of
southwestern North America
and the Chihuahuan Desert of
northern Mexico. As shown in
Figure 1, Reeves County is
located in far western Texas.

generally flat to undulating
terrain in the northern and northeastern portion of the county gives way to hilly and mountainous
areas in the southern and southwestern portion. Elevation ranges from about 2,500 feet in the
Pecos River valley to over 4,200 feet above mean sea level in the Davis Mountains.
An average rainfall of ten inches, along with reddish-brown and brown sands, clay loams, clays
and stony gravelly clay support the growth of sparse grasses, scrub brush, creosotebush, juniper
and mesquite trees, and assorted cacti. Most rainfall occurs in April through September.
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
rates in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another reason
irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F; humidity
is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the county’s
climate can be classified as subtropical steppe to desert-like. With its semi-arid environment, the
county is generally frost-free from mid-February through early December, allowing for a 226-day
growing season (Jaco 1980; Smith 1996).

The Pecos River forms the
northern boundary of the
county, and its watershed drains
the entire county, with its main
tributaries being Salt Creek,
Toyah Creek, Four Mile Draw,
Horsehead Draw, and Salt
Draw, all
flowing
(intermittently) generally
northeastward. The Pecos River
trends from northwest to
southeast, and eventually
empties into the Rio Grande
and Amistad Reservoir in Val
Verde County (Hayter 1996).
Although there are many
springs in Reeves County, very
few are now active. Ancient
springs that may have existed in
the area at one time have likely

pumping during modern times
(Brune 1981). One of those to survive is San Solomon Spring, one of a series of artesian springs
that emanate from rainfall runoff in the Davis and Apache Mountains that seeps through porous
rocks and bursts forth near the town of Balmorrea. Other nearby springs still active are Phantom
Lake and Giffin Springs. Otherwise, animals depend on playas for drinking water. There are
numerous playas in the county that fill during infrequent rainfalls, but then dry up. The largest
playa in the county is Toyah Lake (Smith 1996).

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area lies within the Eastern Trans-Pecos archeological region as defined by Miller
and Kenmotsu (2004). In addition, the southernmost portion of the Southern High Plains
archaeological region extends to the Pecos River. Therefore one would expect to observe
evidence of cultural influences from both regions within the archeological record.
The regional literature is somewhat a matter of semantics, and can easily be misunderstood if the
terms are not clearly defined. Therefore the reader is referred to Figure 5. “The Southern Great

of the High
Plains that
stretches
southward from
the Arkansas
River Valley in
Colorado and
Kansas to the

Plateau in
Texas” (Hughes
1991:4). When
referring to the
Texas High

discussing the
portion of the

Plains that are
in Texas. When
discussing the

and the South
Plains; the (Texas) North Plains referring to that area north of the South Canadian River, and the
(Texas) South Plains being that area south of the river. The term Llano Estacado (Staked Plain)
plateau also refers to the (Texas) South Plains that lies south of the South Canadian River.
Finally, depending on context, in some discussions the terms Panhandle Plains may be used to
denote the plains area encompassed by the politically drawn Panhandle boundary of Texas, and
the term South Plains may be used to denote the plains area south of the Panhandle (Hughes
1991:4-5).
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period on the Southern Plains is subdivided into the Clovis period (11,500 11,000 B.P. [years before present typically uses 1950 A.D. as the baseline date]) and the Folsom
period (10,800 - 8500 B.P.). In the Eastern Trans-Pecos region, the Paleoindian period is
recognized as generally from 12,000 - 8000 B.P., with three traditions from earliest to latest
labeled the Clovis Complex, the Folsom Complex, and the Plano/Cody Complex (Johnson and
Holliday 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).

5

In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of highly
nomadic, big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently,
emphasis has been placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by
these early Americans (Black 1989; Collins and Brown 2000), such as turtles and tortoises,
alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted
the large animals as well (Dibble and Lorraine 1968).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison.
Archeological evidence suggests that after 8,000 B.P., large herd animals were either extinct or
otherwise migrated from Texas (although not dated), the Berclair Site may be an exception
(Sellards 1940). Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other
medium-size or smaller game. Changes in subsistence required technological shifts that mark
the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Archaic Period
The Archaic period on the Southern High Plains is judged to be from about 8000-2000 B.P.,
while in the Eastern Trans-Pecos it is thought to be from around 8000-1050 B.P. (Johnson and
Holliday 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
et al. 1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500-6400 B.P. An economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary because of the extinction of large game animals. Hurt (1980) suggests that
the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to
pursue plants and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with
the same or slightly more effort expended.
Hughes (1991) places the Early Archaic in the Texas High Plains, which includes the Llano
Estacado, from about 7000- 4000 B.P. "…coinciding with the Altithermal Long Drought and
characterized by a pattern of localized foraging for wild plant food and small game replacing a
pattern of unrestricted bison hunting, as evidenced by the disappearance of bison kills,
replacement of stemless lance points with stemmed dart points, decreasing use of end scrapers,
and increasing use of gouges, grinding implements, hearth stones, and boiling pebbles" (Hughes
1991:15). Based on the relative absence of Early Archaic sites on the High Plains during the
3,000-year Altithermal, Hughes surmises that the High Plains may have been all but abandoned
during that time in favor of adjacent canyonland water source areas to the west, east, and south
- and the distant Edwards Plateau and lower Pecos regions.
The Early Archaic record in the Eastern Trans-Pecos region is very poorly understood, with only
one radiocarbon date from that period. The estimated range of 8500-5000 B.P. is based on
6

cross-dating projectile point styles from central Texas. It appears that large thermal cooking
features that are noticeably absent in Paleoindian components now appear during the Early
Archaic. Additionally, the increase in ground stone suggests a greater reliance on plants as a
food source.
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and
subsistence is recognized generally as the period between 5000-3000 B.P. (Hofman et al.
1989:45-47), and more specifically as 6400-4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and
Holliday 1986:46). In central Texas the Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128), but not in West Texas. Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals
on the Southern Great Plains decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet.
Hughes (1991) notes that the Pedernales points so commonly represented in central Texas'
Middle Archaic, is absent during the Middle Archaic on the Southern High Plains. Although a
few sites with fire cracked rock hearths and boiling stones, and a few other diagnostics such as
Bulverede dart points have been recovered, the High Plains was all but abandoned during the
3,000-year dry and warm Altithermal. One example of the effect of climatic stress are the
excavated wells at Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991).
Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) equate the Middle Archaic in the Eastern Trans-Pecos as
6000/5000-3200 B.P. Typically, there are a greater number of sites than in the Early Archaic,
and they are larger or contain a greater number of features. All this suggests an intensification
of subsistence and settlement in the region, particularly along drainages. At the same time,
Mallouf (1985) has observed that Middle Archaic sites can now be found in differing environs,
suggesting a need to search out and exploit a wider variety of diet. For example, the appearance
of burned rock middens and extensive hearth fields suggest that desert succulents and cacti were
regularly added to the subsistence base (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (et al. 1989:45) synthesis places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as early as
3000-2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500-2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning
to the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well
as mussel shells during the Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again
disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
Hughes places the beginning of the Southern High Plains Late Archaic at 4000 B.P., coinciding
with the beginning of our modern climatic period (Medithermal), and ending around 1750 B.P.,
(±200). “This substage is marked primarily by the use of various kinds of barbed dart points for
hunting bison and other large game” (Hughes 1991:20). Boyd (1997) has synthesized more
recent data and argues that the Late Archaic more convincingly should date to between ca. 3950
B.P. to 1450 B.P. Late Archaic sites on the Plains are prolific in quantity compared to the Early
7

or Middle Archaic, and nearly as prolific as those of the Neoindian period. Unfortunately there
is a paucity of published information on Late Archaic site excavations, and only a few have been
radiocarbon dated (Hughes 1991:20-21).
Although there is very little excavated evidence, it appears that around 4,000 years ago, near the
end of the dry Altithermal and the beginning of the Medithermal, groups began moving back
onto the Texas High Plains, and Hurt (1980) further posits that population on the western edge
of the Edwards Plateau peaked during the Late Archaic with groups moving into the area from
central Texas. Although wild plants were eaten, and both large and small animals were hunted,
bison were again exploited upon their return to the area during this time. Hughes speculates that
subsistence needs were met during seasonal rounds, and that generally there were few changes
in technology and lifeways during the Late Archaic. However, he ventures that additional
excavations and analysis should provide evidence for subtle, yet marked variances during
periodic mesic and xeric intervals (Hughes 1991:23-24).
Site types include open campsites, with base camps predominantly in sheltered, well-watered
areas, lookout sites, rock shelters, lithic quarries and workshops, arroyo bison kill sites, burial
sites, and possibly petroglyph sites. Features at these sites include hearths, sometimes with
boiling stones present, chipping stations, raw material for chipping and grinding stone caches,
bedrock mortars, and burials. Artifact types include projectile points, bifacial knives and drills,
bifacial and unifacial choppers, gravers, denticulates, a variety of scrapers, hammerstones, manos
and metates, grooved sandstone awl sharpeners, occasionally a stone bead or pendant, bone tools,
gaming pieces and pendants, and sometimes shell beads and pendants (Hughes 1991:22-23).
As Hughes emphasizes, using point types as chronological and cultural indicators on the Texas
High Plains is problematic: "Most writers who have attempted to fit High Plains dart points into
the Texas typology…have found that their specimens seldom fall neatly into one type or another.
The High Plains specimens are often smaller than their counterparts in central Texas, where
many of the types were established and where the Edwards chert is a more abundant and tractable
material than the materials generally available on the High Plains." (Hughes 1991:22). However,
most of the points found in the High Plains are similar to those found in central and north Texas,
as well as Oklahoma: the Edgewood, Ellis, Marcos, and Palmillas. Also found are the Ensor,
Trinity, Williams, and Lange. Other projectile points found on the High Plains and apparently
coming into the area from elsewhere are Duncan and Hanna points from north of the High Plains,
Augustin and Pinto Basin points from the west, and Langtry and Paisano points from the south
(Hughes 1991:22-23).
The Late Archaic Period in the Eastern Trans-Pecos Region is estimated at 3200-1050 B.P.
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Based upon the significant increases in site density, features, and
cultural material, the Late Archaic is viewed as a peak period of land use and settlement patterns
As a result, ecological niches that had previously been ignored were now being exploited.
Mallouf (1985) posits that this expansion was encouraged by a wetter climatic period and the
cooperation of inter-regional hunters and gatherers. Whether or not there was a significant
increase in population during this time frame, or if social and economic factors were at work, is
8

still a matter of conjecture. The large thermal features that were common in the Middle Archaic
are now being replaced by smaller hearths. Wild plant food processing has intensified, and a
wider species variety of fauna is present in Late Archaic components.
Ceramic, Protohistoric, and Historic Periods
The Early Ceramic Period on the Southern Plains (2000-1000 B.P.) marks a transitional period
during which Archaic projectile points are found in mixed assemblages with bow and arrow
points and ceramics. Typically, Early Ceramic period sites include Scallorn arrow points and
coarse-tempered cordmarked pottery. Other frequently observed cultural items are bone beads,
modern bison remains, and stone tools and debitage. During the Late Ceramic Period (1000-500
B. P.) Pueblo pottery and stone tools from the Southern Plains are found in association. The
pottery is usually of the eastern Jornada Mogollon variety (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The period between 1750-500 B.P. in the Eastern Trans-Pecos Region is called the Formative
Period/Late Prehistoric Period. Once again, the cultural sequence for this period in the Project
Area is not at all well-defined, and archeologists have attempted to adapt cultural sequences from
adjoining areas to understand sites thought to be from this time frame. Much of the cultural
influences likely derived from the Mesilla, Doña Ana, and El Paso phases of eastern New
Mexico and west Texas. The Mesilla Phase is characterized by pithouses, some cultigens, and
El Paso brown and Mimbres whiteware pottery. The Doña Ana Phase marks the transition from
pithouses to surface structures, the production of El Paso brown ceramics, as well as bichromes
and polychromes, and access to non-local pottery. During the El Paso Phase the people were
living in pueblos and depended heavily on agriculture. As such, they were generally sedentary
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The Protohistoric Period on the Southern Plains is generally thought to have occurred ca.
500-300 B. P. The end of the Late Prehistoric period and beginning of the Protohistoric/Historic
periods in the Texas High Plains should be characterized by written accounts of European
contact with indigenous groups. Hester (1995:450-451) agrees with Adkins and Adkins
(1982:242) when he suggests that the indigenous groups may have been affected by European
influence but we are only able to observe the materials in the archeological record because the
written accounts simply are not available. He would rather label this largely unknown period
“Protohistoric”. Hofman (et al. 1989:91) agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed
by the time when there were limited European contacts with the area and brief records of these
journeys, but no proper history.”
Problematic to this discussion of the Southern Plains Protohistoric is that although several
archeological sites have been well documented further north, the immediate Project Area should
be labled as a “shared area” (Nickels 2002:33; Boyd 1997), one in which there is no definitive
culture, but rather a blend of cultural traits from the Garza Complex to the north, the Toyah
culture from the east, the Jornada Mogollon from the northwest, the eastern Trans-Pecos, and
the Lower Pecos from the south.

Historic Euroamerican and Modern Settlement
The Pecos County/Trans-Pecos area was occupied by the Jumano Indians between 1500 and
1700. The Jumanos ranged over much of northern Mexico, New Mexico, and in Texas between
the lower Pecos River and the Colorado, hunting buffalo and trading with Spanish colonists and
other Indian tribes (Hickerson 1994, 1996).
Prior to the Civil War (1860-1865) there were very few Euroamerican settlers in West Texas.
The few settlers that were present were associated either with trading posts or military sites. The
Civil War had little immediate effect in the area. However, following the Civil War period there
was renewed interest in establishing settlements in west Texas.
Early settlers met with strong resistance from the indigenous Jumanos, Comanche, Kiowa, and
Kiowa-Apache, who had intermittently occupied the area for between 200 and 500 years. In a
series of battles of the 1870s, most notably the Red River War, the U.S. Army forcibly removed
the Native Americans from the northern plains of Texas to reservations in Oklahoma Territory.
Following these events, the Llano Estacado, Rolling Plains, and Southern Plains were settled
rapidly. At the same time, the exploitation and ultimate extermination of buffalo on the Plains
in the 1870s was carried out in earnest (Anderson 1974; Rathjen 1973), and the vast Southern
Plains in the Pecos River valley in Texas were then further available for cattle ranching.

Reeves County History
Before Reeves County was officially recognized as a political entity of Texas and established out
of Pecos County in 1883, the area was occupied by the indigenous Jumano and Muscalero
Apache Indians. These may have been the same peoples who lived in rock shelters and caves in
the Barrilla Hills, as well as large open campsites adjacent to Phantom Lake, San Solomon
Spring, and Toyah Creek. Spanish explorers reported being met by Jumano Indians near Toyah
Lake in 1583. By 1849, Anglo American explorer John Ford observed Muscalero Apaches
cultivating corn along Toyah Creek. By 1871, some 22 years later, the first Anglos began raising
irrigated crops along Toyah Creek. By 1875, Anglo Americans began to exploit the open ranges
in the Davis Mountain region for cattle ranching.
The first railroad constructed through Reeves County was the Texas and Pacific Railway, in
1881. The seed was then planted for railroad construction houses to be built at the outpost
settlements of both Pecos and Toyah, as well as a post office at Toyah in 1881. Toyah then
became a focal point for ranchers to ship their cattle via rail. When Reeves County was separated
from Pecos County in 1883, and then organized in 1884, a three-room school house and a post
office were built in Pecos.
Actually, the first community in the newly organized Reeves County was initially named
Saragosa in 1884, then the name was later changed to Lyles in 1891, and finally to Toyahville
in 1894. By 1884, Pecos had 150 residents and Toyahville had 60. By 1890, the population in
10

the whole county was 1,247. The second railroad to be constructed through Reeves County was
also completed in 1890; that being the Pecos River Railroad, from the community of Pecos to
the New Mexico Railroad along the Pecos River (54 miles).
By 1900, the county population had increased by 600, totaling 1,847. In that same year, there
were 63 farms operating in the county, with 41 of those operated by owners (65%), but with 22
of those operated by tenant farmers (35%).
Another railway, the Pecos Valley Southern Railway, completed construction of tracks from
Pecos to Toyahville in 1911, allowing for further shipment of both agricultural and ranching
products. However, in 1916, a typical long-term drought in this area of Texas devastated
croplands and dried up usually reliable water sources, forcing farmers off their land. As a result,
although the county’s population had grown to 4,457, the number of farms decreased from 225
in 1910 to 206 in 1920; 140 operated by owners (68%), and 66 operated by tenants (32%).
Oil and gas production boomed around Pecos in the early 1920s, and the population rose to
6,407. The number of farms increased to 327, but the tenancy rate rose to 65%. By 1960, the
county boasted 17,644 residents, but by 1969 the number of farms declined, with 74% of those
being run by either tenant farmers or absentee landowners. The oil and gas business in Reeves
County continued to bolster the economy in the late 1930s through the 1970s. Although a bust
cycle occurred throughout the 1980s and 1990s, new technology such as fracing and horizontal
drilling has once again provided a much needed economic jolt into the Reeves County economic
growth (Smith 1996).

Site Types that could be Expected Along the Admiral to Orla Right-of-way

Prehistoric Open Campsites
Prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the late
Prehistoric period are common in Reeves County. Some of these represent a single campfire
where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for one night. Others are very
large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people that stayed for long
periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a
period of several thousands years. Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include
among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide
variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them, ground and
smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals
consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all
types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide
variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water
sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, and cacti offered a different food source that
could be exploited, such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and
11

agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the South Texas Plains,
and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of west Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most
frequently occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in
upland settings where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients
that archaeologists look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation
in the form of charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic
stone tools or ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along
the Admiral to Orla Pipeline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken
tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old
ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at
open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of
time (However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to
make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process,
and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to
lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply
cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used
to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken
quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably
to areas of Texas, Mexico, and New Mexico where raw material is not readily available. The
snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters
in Reeves County have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland
12

slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are rare in Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present
themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels
from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains
likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as
parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Although a handful of prehistoric quarry sites have been recorded in this area of Texas, they are
rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as
the larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit
becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple
pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as
indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their
documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in this
area of Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with rockshelters,
on mesa tops, and within open campsites in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces
along streams.
Bedrock Mortar Holes
It is not uncommon to discover mortar holes in exposed bedrock in Reeves County. These
represent the persistent grinding of seeds and/or nuts over long periods of time in an effort to
reduce the seeds and nuts to meal. Mortar holes may or may not be associated with open
campsites or inhabited rockshelters. They were moreso likely located nearby plant resources that
existed at the time.
Historic Sites
Although Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th
century, and Spanish entradas began penetrating south and west Texas in the 1700s and 1800s,
there is no record of any sort of permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman
1992), the Reeves County area was generally not considered safe for settlement by whites until
after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began establishing smaller ranches and
farmlands.
13

Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
this area of Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site
types most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and
foundation remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional
family burial or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related
structures or construction projects.

Archaeological Atlas Site and Historic Maps Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within the area, the results simply provide the data that is available. As of June 24,
2019 there had been 146 sites documented within Reeves County. However, these numbers can
be deceiving. Although geological formations, terrain features, water, and food sources obviously
played a crucial role in past human subsistence and lifeways and thus the number of
archaeological sites, we submit that the contrast in the number of sites recorded per county has
very much to do with the greater number of professional cultural resources surveys that have
been conducted in for example, neighboring Pecos County, with 744 recorded sites, versus the
146 in Reeves County. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very
heavily skewed based upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those
surveys.
That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas of Archaeological Sites (Atlas) is only as
good as the surveys represent. The vast majority of Reeves County has never been subjected to
formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological
record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished
provide at least some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Reeves County
As stated above, 146 archaeological sites had been recorded within Reeves County by June 24,
2019. Of those, 66 are classified as prehistoric open campsites, 44 as lithic scatters, 11 as lithic
procurement sites, and 2 rockshelters have been identified. The single site (41RV14) that has
been designated as a State Archaeological landmark (SAL) is a very large campsite with over
100 hearth features, and includes stone tools made from Alibates flint (agatized dolomite). The
sole source for this much sought after raw material is situated near the Canadian River in the
Texas Panhandle, over 400 miles north of Reeves County. Finding Alibates tools in Reeves
County clearly suggests either long distance trade or travel by Native Americans. A second site
that has been recommended for SAL eligibility is 41RV28, a large prehistoric open campsite
adjacent to a playa.
Rock art in the forms of both pictographs and petroglyphs have also been found in Reeves
14

County. Several hundred pictographs have been documented on Owl Mesa on the Graef Ranch
(McCook 2019). Human burial remains have been discovered at 3 sites. One was within a
rockshelter, one was wedged in a crevice below the caprock, and several burials were within a
25-foot diameter rock cairn. Subsistence and related items that have been found include bison
bones and bedrock mortar holes.
Historic sites include 1900s rock, adobe and rip-rap constructed houses, a ranch headquarters
complex, windmills, stock tanks, and trash scatters. Archaeologists have also documented a
widely scattered debris field of historic artifacts (41RV55) that were likely spread across the
landscape by a 1930s tornado. The tornado field may represent the remains of the original village
of Saragosa which was destroyed by a tornado in 1938 (Atlas 2019).
The Project Area
As shown in Figures 6-9, there had been four professional cultural resources surveys conducted
within one mile (1,609 meters), and there were two documented archaeological sites within one
mile. These surveys and sites are briefly described as follows.
Surveys
As shown in Figure 6, in November and December 2015, personnel with Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., conducted a Phase I archeological survey of the proposed 716-acre West of the Pecos Solar
Project area in northern Reeves County, Texas. The survey resulted in the identification of six
previously unrecorded archeological sites, but none within one mile of the Admiral to Orla
Pipeline.
In 2017, Horizon Environmental Services archaeologists conducted cultural resources surveys
for 30 proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation projects located on property owned by the
Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Reeves County. These projects included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs).
Between late January and early April, 2017, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted cultural resources surveys of portions of the proposed Orla Residue Gas Pipeline. The
pipeline extends from the Cryo Plant near Orla in Reeves County, through Ward County, to the
south near Coyanosa in Pecos County, Texas. In Reeves County, the proposed pipeline would
span approximately 5.46 miles of lands managed by the GLO.
In June 2018, Tierras Antiguas archaeologists examined 69 drainage crossings along the 39-mile
Mark West Argo to Apollo Pipeline, resulting in the documentation of two archaeological sites
within one mile of the proposed Admiral to Orla Pipeline (41RV143 and 41RV144); they are
discussed below.
41RV143
This site was documented by TAAI archaeologists during a survey of the Mark West Argo to
Apollo Pipeline in June 2018. This site manifests evidence of both prehistoric and historic
occupations. The historic component consists of scattered trash, while the prehistoric component
consists of fire-cracked rock hearths, chipped stone tools and debitage, and a pottery sherd. It is
situated on a gentle slope trending to the west toward Incline Creek Draw, roughly 250 meters
15

distant. Other than its positioning on the landscape, the portion of the site that was to be
impacted by construction of the Argo to Apollo Pipeline did not contain significant cultural
resources, and it was recommended that construction should be allowed to proceed as planned,
with no further archaeological investigations (Nickels 2018).
41RV144
41RV144 was also documented by TAAI archaeologists during the Mark West Argo to Apollo
survey. It consists of an historic trash scatter situated on a gentle slope trending toward Incline
Creek Draw, roughly 100 meters to the west. It appears to have been a one-time discard of
household dinnerware ceramics and glass, along with a few metal scraps, probably around AD
1900. TAAI archaeologists assessed the portion of the site that was to be impacted by
construction of the pipeline did not contain significant cultural resources, and recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned (Nickels 2018).

Historic Maps
A standard source of research is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Castañeda
Library 2019). A second standard source is a large collection of maps compiled by PBS&J for
the Texas Department of Transportation (Foster et al. 2006).
In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland pasture, with no
development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock tanks, corrals, and
sparsely scattered outbuildings. In this case, the earliest map found is a 1940 Reeves County road
map, shown in Figure 10 (Perry Castañeda Library 2019), showing no structures mapped along
the Project Area in 1940.

Figure 10. Project Area overlain onto a 1940 Reeves County road map (Reeves County Map
1940).

20

Next, we were able to locate an aerial photo of the Project Area, which shows no structures along
the proposed ROW in 1953 (Figures 11-13).

Figure 11. Northeastern segment of the Project Area overlain onto a 1953 aerial photo (Earth
Explorer 2019).

2019).

22

Figure 13. Southwestern segment of the Project Area overlain onto a 1953 aerial photo (Earth
Explorer 2019).

Although no historic structures are apparent along the proposed Admiral to Orla Pipeline rightof-way, the maps are not exact by today’s standards, and it is possible that historic water tanks,
corrals, outbuildings, and other structures related to early ranching activities could be
encountered within the Project Area that do not appear on any old maps. Nevertheless, the lack
of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the paucity of cultural
resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no information is
available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial activities, or persons
of historic significance to the immediate area. Historic sites previously recorded in Reeves
County include 1900s houses of assorted construction techniques and materials, a ranch
headquarters complex, windmills, stock tanks, and trash scatters. Technically, any structures
older than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this
should be considered when the Project Area is developed.

23

Soils
A review of Reeves County soils maps and publications in printed copy and online indicated that
there are seven different soil types, or classifications, that will be encountered along the Project
Area rights-of-way (Table 1; Figure 14). The seven soil types indicate that they are of varying
depths, with different sedimentation, deposition, and erosional rates (Jaco 1980; Web Soil
Survey 2019). However, potential terrace deposits in close proximity to Incline Draw, Charlie
Ross Draw, and Sand Bend Draw and their numerous tributaries offer the highest potential for
buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. In reality, without an on-the-ground physical
examination, the true existence of deeply buried and intact archaeological deposits that could be
potentially significant to our understandings of Texas prehistory could only be modeled and
surmised.

Background Review Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
As of June 24, 2019, no archaeological sites had been documented within the Admiral to Orla
right-of-way. Notably, however, the Admiral to Orla Pipeline could encounter potential terrace
deposits along Incline Draw, Charlie Ross Draw, and Sand Bend Draw and their numerous
tributaries. A review of soil descriptions mapped for this area suggested a moderate probability
of intact terrace deposits to be extant (Web Soil Survey 2019; Jaco 1980). Intact terrace deposits
possess the potential to encapsule archaeological sites of significance, and Tierras Antiguas
recommended that the entire 19-mile right-of-way should be examined by archaeologists before
being impacted by construction. Based upon our recommendation, Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. authorized Tierras Antiguas to conduct the field survey.

25

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the Project Area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the area to be impacted had been clearly delineated with
survey stakes and flagging tape. In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, systematic and thorough
pedestrian surveys of the delineated rights-of-way were conducted.
S u r f a c e
visibility ranged
from 80 to 100
percent (see for
example, Figure
15). Particular
attention was
provided to the
crossing at
Incline Draw
(Figure 16). In
addition, all
machinery cuts,
rodent and
m a m m a l
backdirt piles,
and feral hog
ruts along the
right-of-way
were thoroughly
examined.

Figure 16. Examining cutbank at Incline Draw crossing; facing east.
In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic
artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation
of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic to Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian
diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to
the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or
other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and
included in this report of investigations. Otherwise, Finally, digital photographs representing the
surveyed rights-of-way in general were taken, and a photo log was maintained.
Because of the generally excellent visibility across eroded and deflated surfaces along the rightof-way, only 28 shovel tests were excavated; 17 on three newly discovered archaeological sites
(41RV184-186), and ten in areas that offered the potential for buried and intact cultural materials
to be extant. The locations of shovel tests, isolated finds, and archaeological sites are shown in
Figures 17-20.

Results of the Investigations
During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 95 percent of the Project Area’s
surface was disturbed either mechanically, or by severe erosion and sheetwash. In addition,
portions of the right-of-way (ROW) crossed previously constructed and buried pipelines.
However, the sparse vegetation provided for excellent surface visibility, thus allowing for the
discovery of any artifacts or features along the ROW.
The results of shovel testing on the three archaeological sites are included with the site
descriptions below; otherwise, the results of the ten shovel tests along the right-of-way are
described in Appendix A. No artifacts were found below the surface in any of the 28 shovel tests
excavated, or within any of the numerous feral hog ruts, animal burrow backdirt piles, or
cutbanks examined.

31

41RV184
Site Setting and Description
The two pieces of chipped stone
flakes and a small fire-cracked
rock hearth at this site within
the 100-foot wide road right-ofway is typical of the remnants
of a scattered, small prehistoric
open campsite (Figure 21 and
22; see also, cover photo). It is
situated on a broad, nearly level
upland devoid of vegetation
other than sparsely scattered
low brush and bunch grasses,
allowing for surface visibility
>90 percent. An unnamed broad
and ephemeral intermittent
drainage courses some 700
meters to the west. The sparse
vegetation survives within
Reakor association silty loam
soils. Within the right-of-way,
the site covers roughly 1,800
square meters as defined by the
extent of artifacts on the
surface, and slopes gradually
toward the west, between 2,931
to 2,929 feet in elevation.
Levels of Effort and Results
Figure 21. 41RV184 site map.
Following a thorough
pedestrian survey, six shovel tests were excavated within the ROW. The results of shovel testing
revealed turbated very fine silty loamy soils in the upper 12-30 centimeters, underlain by
yellowish brown clay. No evidence of cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests,
and otherwise, no diagnostics from which to surmise an age of occupation were discovered on
the surface. The only feature observed was a scattered, and deflated fire-cracked rock hearth was
documented near the south-central portion of the site, measuring approximately 50 cm in
diameter (Figures 21 and 23). Only two pieces of chipped stone were found on the site within
the ROW; both core reduction flakes fashioned from non-heat treated, fine-grained chert (Figure
24). The hearth feature was not evaluated for intact deposits or dateable materials through
subsurface investigations (e.g., trowel scraping).

Site Summary, Conclusions and Recommendation
The portion of this site that lies within the proposed pipeline ROW consists of two chert flakes,
a scattered and deflated fire-cracked rock hearth, likely representing a temporary prehistoric open
campsite. In its current condition, other than its positioning on the landscape as a prehistoric
open campsite, we assess the research value of the portion of this site that lies within the
proposed pipeline ROW as minimal at best. As such, it is the opinion of TAAI that construction
of the Admiral to Orla Pipeline will not impact significant cultural resources. 41RV184 is not
recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Antiquity Landmark. Therefore, we recommend that construction should be allowed to
proceed as planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, TAAI further
recommends that if previously undiscovered cultural resource deposits are encountered during
development, TAAI or any other professional archaeological consultant be contacted to evaluate
those finds.

41RV185
Site Setting and Description
This prehistoric lithic procurement site of an unknown age is situated on a broad, northeasterly
sloping upland plain 3,105 feet in elevation, and generally devoid of vegetation other than
sparsely scattered low brush and bunch grasses (Figures 25 and 26). The Delnorte-Chilicotal fine
sandy loam covering the site is severely eroded and deflated, exposing chert and quartzite gravels
to the surface. The nearest modern-day water source is intermittent Charlie Ross Draw, some 400
meters to the northeast.

34

Levels of Effort and Results
Within the right-of-way, archaeologists
observed surface artifacts sparsely
scattered across roughly 1,200 square
meters. Following a thorough
pedestrian survey, six shovel tests
were then excavated within the ROW.
The results of shovel testing revealed a
thin layer of pale brown fine sandy
loam with an abrupt transition to pale
yellow caliche between 1-3
centimeters below the surface. No
evidence of cultural materials were
found in any of the shovel tests. Only
three non-diagnostic pieces of chipped
stone were observed on the surface.
Although they exhibited a glossy
surface, the glossy surface appears to
be due to exposure to weather, and no
heat treating; they are shown in Figure
27.

Site Summary, Conclusions and Recommendation
The portion of this site that lies within the proposed pipeline ROW is typical of upland lithic
procurement sites in this area of Reeves County where chert and quartzite gravels have been
exposed to the surface due to erosion and deflation, and where Native Americans have exploited
these gravel resources for the fashioning of stone tools. In its current condition, other than its
positioning on the landscape as an upland lithic procurement site, we assess the research value
of the portion of the site that lies within the pipeline ROW as minimal at best. 41RV185 is not
recommended for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Antiquity Landmark. Accordingly, TAAI recommends that construction of the Admiral to
Orla Pipeline should be allowed to proceed as planned, with no further archaeological
investigations. However, TAAI further recommends that if previously undiscovered cultural
resources deposits are encountered during development, TAAI or any other professional
archaeological consultant be contacted to evaluate those finds.

41RV186
Site Setting and Description
This prehistoric lithic procurement
site of an unknown age covers a
portion of northwesterly sloping,
rolling upland plain generally
devoid of vegetation except for a
motte of low brush in a low lying
broad swale midway through the
center of the site. Otherwise,
sparsely scattered low brush and
bunch grasses are present (Figures
28 and 29). The slight variation
across the site is from 3,114 to
3,110 feet amsl. As with 41RV185
described above, the DelnorteChilicotal fine sandy loam covering
the site is severely eroded and
deflated, exposing chert and
quartzite gravels to the surface. The
nearest modern-day water source to
this site is the same intermittent
Charlie Ross Draw, but now about
1,110 meters to the northeast.
Levels of Effort and Results
W i t h i n t h e r i gh t - o f - w a y,
archaeologists observed surface
artifacts very sparsely scattered
across roughly 2,700 square meters.
Following a thorough pedestrian Figure 28. 41RV186 site map.
survey, five shovel tests were then excavated within the ROW. As with 41RV185, the results of
shovel testing on this site also revealed a thin layer of pale brown fine sandy loam with an abrupt
transition to pale yellow caliche between 1-5 centimeters below the surface. No evidence of cultural
materials was found in any of the shovel tests.
The sparse surface scatter was comprised of a chert single core, and nine primary and secondary
stage reduction flakes, none of which exhibited evidence of heat treating. Selected examples are
shown in Figure 31. Notably, flake scars on the core suggest polyhedral blade core technology, and
a crude blade flake and small blade flake are shown in Figure 31. Although blade core technology
is characteristic of Late Prehistoric occupations, larger blade cores and blades such as those shown
in Figure 31 are more similar in size to a Clovis core and blades, dating to ca. 10,800 to 11,500 years

Site Summary, Conclusions and Recommendation
The portion of this site that lies within the proposed pipeline ROW is typical of upland lithic
procurement sites in this area od Reeves County where chert and quartzite gravels have been exposed
to the surface due to erosion and deflation, and where Native Americans have exploited these gravel
resources for the fashioning of stone tools. In its current condition, other than its positioning on the
landscape as an upland lithic procurement site, we assess the research value of the portion of the site
that lies within the pipeline ROW as minimal at best. 41RV186 is not recommended for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Antiquity Landmark.
Accordingly, TAAI recommends that construction of the Admiral to Orla Pipeline should be allowed
to proceed as planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, TAAI further
recommends that if previously undiscovered cultural resources deposits are encountered during
development, TAAI or any other professional archaeological consultant be contacted to evaluate
those finds.

Isolated Finds
Isolated Find 1 - Retouched Flake @N3500342 E589683 (NAD83)
Isolated Find 1 is a primary core reduction
flake that exhibits systematic and even
unifacial flaking along its left ventral
surface (see Figure 31). It is made from
fine-grained gray chert with coarse-grained
inclusions, and is slightly patinated. There
is no evidence of heat treating. It was
discovered on an upland flat, deflated and
eroded plain generally devoid of
vegetation. A thorough examination of the
surrounding surface revealed no other
cultural materials.

Figure 31. Isolated Find 1: Retouched Flake.
Isolated Find 2 – Retouched Flake @N3501087 E592474 (NAD83)
The specimen shown in Figure 32 is a core reduction flake that exhibits crude flaking on its distal
dorsal surface, but fine flaking along its left dorsal lateral edge, possibly for use as a scraper. It is
made from fine-grained, dark grayish brown chert, with no evidence of heat treating, and only a
slight surface patina was observed. It was discovered on an upland flat, deflated and eroded plain
generally devoid of vegetation (Figure 33). A thorough examination of the surrounding surface
revealed no other cultural materials.

Isolated Find 3 – Side Scraper @N3501101
E592354 (NAD83)
Shown in Figure 34 is a convex side scraper
fashioned from a core reduction flake of coarsegrained, tan quartzite. It was discovered on a
highly deflated surface (Figure 35). A thorough
examination of the surrounding surface within the
pipeline ROW revealed no other cultural materials.

was discovered; facing north.
Isolated Find 4 – Side and end Scraper @
N3503407 E594898 (NAD 83)
This dark brown scraper was fashioned from a core
reduction flake of purplish igneous, fine-grained
basalt. It exhibits even and systematic flaking on
its slightly concave left lateral dorsal surface as
well as on its convex distal surface. There is no
evidence of heat treating or patination (Figure 36).
As shown in Figure 37, it was discovered as an
isolated piece of cultural material on a barren and
deflated landscape.

Isolated Find 5 – Crudely Flaked Uniface @N3503591 E594897 (NAD83)
As shown in Figure 38, this Isolated Find is a
multi-colored, tertiary flake of fine-grained chert
that has been retouched on three sides for possible
use as a crude scraper. Its glossy and waxy surface
suggests that it has been subjected to heat treating.
It was found on a heavily deflated fine silty loam
surface (Figure 39).

Isolated Find 6 – Blade-like Flake
This specimen is a relatively short exterior flake
chipped from a core, and that could be construed as
a blade flake. Although its fully cortex dorsal
surface is not shown in Figure 40, its ventral
surface as shown reveals that it has apparently not
been heat treated, nor has it been retouched. It does
exhibit a slight patina. It was discovered on a
heavily deflated soil surface and a sloping plain
surface (Figure 41), and a thorough survey of the
surface within the proposed pipeline ROW revealed
no other evidence of cultural materials.

Isolated Find 7 – Chopper @N3508368 E594847 (NAD83)
A chopping tool was found on a eroded and deflated upland landscape (Figures 42 and 43). It was
made from a fine-grained grey and cream colored chert cobble. The presence of step fractures on its
distal end are indicative of use as a chopper. There is no evidence that the tool was subjected to heat
treatment, and there is only slight patina on the tool’s surfaces.

Isolated Find 8 – Core Reduction Flake, Bifacial Scraper, Biface Reduction Flake @N3508473
E594847 (NAD83) Centroid
These three artifacts were sporadically spread
across a span of over 140 meters within the
pipeline ROW, all lying on deflated and heavily
eroded surfaces. As shown in Figure 44, these three
consist of a chert core reduction flake, a small
round biface, and a chert biface manufacturing
flake. None of these specimens exhibit evidence of
heat treating, and all were made from fine-grained
chert A thorough survey of the surface within the
proposed pipeline ROW between these isolated
finds revealed no other evidence of cultural
materials.

Isolated Find 9 – Core @N3509208 E594851 (NAD83)
Shown in Figure 45 is a coarse-grained,
core flaked from a banded quartzite cobble,
and found on a heavily eroded and deflated
surface. It exhibited no evidence of heat
treating and only slight patina. Four
unilateral flake scars were noted. This was
the largest cobble remnant otherwise
surrounded by very sparsely scattered
smaller chert and quartzite pebbles.

Figure 45. Isolated Find #9 - Quartzite core.
Isolated Find #10 – Biface Manufacturing Flakes @N3513045 E597368 (NAD83) Centroid
The two biface manufacturing flakes shown in Figure 46 were manufactured from coarse-grained
quartzite. These artifacts were found over 70 meters remote from each other within the pipeline
ROW, both lying on a deflated and heavily eroded surface slope amidst gravels exposures. Neither
of these specimens exhibit evidence of heat treating. A thorough survey of the surface within the
proposed pipeline ROW between these isolated finds revealed no other evidence of cultural
materials.
45

Isolated Find 11 – Crude Uniface @N3513084
E597412 (NAD83)
A core reduction flake exhibiting three unilateral
flake scars on its ventral surface is described as a
crude and expedient uniface. It is made from gray,
fine-grained chert with some coarse-grained
inclusions, and its surface is coated with a slight
patina (Figure 47). It was discovered on a heavily
eroded and deflated surface (Figure 48). A
thorough examination of the surface within the
pipeline ROW revealed no other evidence of
cultural materials.
Figure 46. Isolated Find #10.

east.

46

Isolated Find 12 – Two Biface Manufacturing Flakes @N3515319 E600714 (NAD 83)
These two biface reduction flakes were found on a
heavily eroded surface on a flat plain some 18
meters remote from each other, amidst an
ephemeral exposure of small chert gravels. They
appear to be the end result of bifacial technology
(Figure 49). They also both exhibit a highly glossy
surface with little or no patina. The unilateral
flaking, coupled with the other attributes
mentioned, suggest a likely Late Prehistoric
occupation.

Figure 49. Isolated Find #12: two biface
Manufacturing flakes.
Isolated Find 13 – Core Reduction Flake @N3515642- E604923 (NAD83)
Shown in Figure 50 is a core reduction flake manufactured from fine-grained chert. It exhibits no
evidence of heat treating, but does have a slightly patina surface, and distal post-depositonal edge
damage. It was discovered on a heavily eroded and deflated surface. A thorough examination of the
surface within the pipeline ROW revealed no other evidence of cultural materials.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
proposed 19-mile Admiral to Orla Pipeline that courses through northeastern Reeves County , Texas.
The proposed right-of-way is 50 feet wide x 19 miles, for a total of 115.15 acres. The project was
entirely privately funded, however a small segment of the pipeline will cross over General Land
Office property; therefore, Texas Antiquities Permit #9090 was obtained.
A full pedestrian field survey was conducted by Tierras Antiguas archaeologists during the period
June 26-July 1, 2019. Surface visibility ranged from 80 to 100-percent along the right-of-way, and
revealed predominantly eroded, deflated, and mechanically disturbed surfaces. A total of 27 shovel
tests were excavated: 17 on three newly discovered archaeological sites (41RV184-186), and the
remaining 10 near drainages where there was a potential for terrace deposits to exist.
Site 41RV184 is a small prehistoric campsite of an unknown age. Sites 41RV185 and 41RV186 are
upland lithic procurement sites. 41RV185 is of an unknown age. However, a crude polyhedral core
and blade at 41RV186 suggest an Early Archaic/Paleoindian presence. In addition, archaeologists
documented 13 isolated finds along the right-of-way.
Our assessments of the three prehistoric sites and the 13 isolated finds are that they possess little if
any integrity or significance. In addition, none are recommended for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. Accordingly, Tierras
Antiguas recommends hat construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed as it is currently
planned, with no further archaeological investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas further
recommends that if any undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, such
finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project, and no historic structures were visible from
the right-of-way. Photos and files are curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State
University.

Appendix A. Results of Shovel Testing
The following table presents the results of shovel testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface
(cmbs) along the Admiral to Orla Pipeline. Soil colors are based upon dry soils compared to a
standard Munsell color chart. An aerial photo and topo maps showing the locations of these shovel
tests can be found in Figures 12-15. Soil descriptions are based upon USDA Soil Conservation
Service standards as shown in Figure A-1. Notably, no cultural material was found in any of the 27
shovel tests excavated within the Project Area.
