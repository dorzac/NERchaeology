ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF FOUR SITES IN
SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA, MEXICO
LORRAINE HEARTFIELD

ABSTRACT
Four surface sites in the Desierto de Charcos de Risa were investigated.
Artifacts spanning late Paleo-Indian to modern times were recovered.
Although this region is included in the overall archeological pattern in
northern Mexico, many artifact styles are specific to a small area. Among
these, are pottery and projectile point styles.

INTRODUCTION
In 1967, I excavated four sites in the Charcos de Risa Desert of
southwestern Coahuila, Mexico (Fig. 1) (Greene 1971). The excavations were conducted under the auspices of the Northeast
Mexico Archeological Project directed by Jeremiah F. Epstein,
University of Texas at Austin. Funds were provided by the National
Science Foundation.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND ENVIRONMENT
The four sites are located in the general region known as the
Laguna or Comarca Lagunera. The Charcos de Risa basin is a narrow
elongated desert oriented northwest by southeast. The southern
mouth opens on the Laguna Mayran and the northern on the Lagunas
La Leche and Palomas. The basin is bordered on the east by the
Sierra del Sobaco and on the west by the Sierra Tlahualillo. The sites
are located along the dry channel of the Rio Charcos de Risa at the
southern end of the desert.
The Laguna lfes slightly south of the Bolson de Mapami. Eardley
(1951: Fig. 338) and Maldonado-Koerdell (1964: 5) include the area in
the Western Sierra Province. Interior drainage characterizes this
basin-and:range region, and following rains, the basins are frequently covered by water. Salts collect in the lower parts of the basins and
are observable on the surface. Active dune fields are common.
According to Tamayo and West (1964: 115), water drained into the
Laguna near San Pedro de las Colonias from the Rio Nazas before it
was dammed, creating many lakes. The largest, the Laguna Mayran,
had a diameter of more than a mile.
According to the Koeppen Classification (Escoto 1964: 205-208),
Coahuila is a true desert. The mean annual ground temperature is
greater than 77° F. The difference between day and night tern-

peratures is extreme and cold winters are contrasted by hot summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 cm. with greater than 40%
variability. Thunderstorms occur most frequently during the summer
(Ibid. 197-204).
FLORA AND FAUNA
Common flora in the Laguna includes Agave, Opuntia, Cereus,
Euphorbia, Larrea, Dasylirion and Prosopis (Aveleyra et al 1956: 41).
Many mammals are common to the area. Among these are rodents,
especially rabbits and carnivores. Birds are numerous but I observed
no water fowl. According to local inhabitants, deer are rare.
Early Spanish reports (Griffen 1966: 114) indicate that the area was
dry except near the lake margins. Fish, water fowl, fruits and nuts
were reported in the wetter areas.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Before Europeans reached the Laguna region the effects of the
Spaniards were felt. Horses extended the range of indigenous groups
in north central Mexico resulting in a rapid change in population
distribution. Later, Indians from diverse cultural backgrounds united
to harrass the Spaniards, and many punitive expeditions were then
mounted against the Indians. Also, missionization and its concommitant European diseases decimated the aboriginal population.
Finally, deportation, assimilation and extinction obliterated the
native inhabitants of the Lagmla.
William B. Griffen (1966) has written an extensive study of the
early historic period in north central Mexico. Readers are referred to
this excellent report for greater detail.

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
Before 1967, only two major archeological investigations had been
conducted in the study area. The first of these was in the central part
of Coahuila, the Cuatro Cienegas Basin. W. W. Taylor (1956, 1966)
surveyed open sites and excavated several cave deposits. Subsequently he developed a cultural sequence based oll artifact
typology and radiocarbon dates from the cave materials.
Aveleyra et al [1956] described archeological materials from caves
and open sites throughout the Laguna. The most spectacular site is a
rich mortuary cave, Cueva de la Candelaria.
Many archeological investigations were conducted under the
auspices of the Northeast Mexico Archeological Project. In 1960,

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Jeremiah F. Epstein conducted archeological surveys in Nuevo Leon
and Goahuila. This was followed by excavation of the San Isidro site
in Nuevo Leon (Epstein 1969). Parts of Nuevo Leon and extreme
Southeastern Goahuila were surveyed by Burney B. McClurkan and
Glen S. Greene in 1963. Both McGlurkan (1966) and Nance (1971) excavated sites in Nuevo Leon. The central part of Southern Goahuila
from the Nuevo Leon border to Torreon was surveyed by Dudley M.
Varner (1967). In 1966 an intensive survey was conducted near
Torreon by Ronald W. Ralph and me. Also, in 1966, William Irwin
located and excavated two large sites in the Laguna Mayran. Finally,
in the spring of 1967 1 returned to the Laguna and excavated the four
sites that are the subject of this paper ..........................

THE SITES AND EXCAVATION PROCEDURE
The sites C-189, C-190 and C-191 are adjacent to and almost continguous with one another. Site C-190 lies between C-189 and the
riverbed; site C-191 is slightly south of C-190. These three sites consist
of from 100 by 100 to 100 by 200 meters of scattered debris; cracked
basalt, hearths, burials, lithic and ceramic artifacts.
Site C-198 is located several kilometers northeast of the other sites.
One edge of the site is adjacent to a large mesquite stand. The surface, 150 by 300 meters is littered with debris which includes streamrolled cobbles. Milling stones are more prevalent on the surface than
at the other sites.
The sites proved to be extremely shallow. It was hoped that some
stratigraphic artifact distribution would be discovered, but there was
little cultural material below i0 centimeters and no artifact differentiation existed from the surface to the lower limit of the deposit.
Each site was mapped and excavation units were established.
Placement of the units was based on high artifact concentration and
an attempt to sample different parts of each site. It was hoped that
the excavation units would indicate spatial differences among the artifact assemblages. Unfortunately, this was not the case.
The lack of spatial differences (both vertical and horizontal) among
the artifact assemblages within each site is a function of the unconsolidated midden matrix and erosional factors. Wind deflation of
the sites lowered the artifacts onto a common (present day) surface
and destroyed the vertical record. Horizontal mixing of artifact
assemblages is due to lateral movement caused by sheet erosion; all
of the sites are subject to widespread vertical runoff of flood waters
following heavy rains.
Intensive surface collections were made at each site. A dune area
between C-190 and C-191 was sampled and all specimens are treated

as members of the collection of either C-190 or C-191. For provenience
detail, see Greene (1971).

FEATURES
Burials
Three burials were removed from C-189. Skeletal remains at C-191
and C-198 were not removed due to extreme decomposition from exposure and because the field season was concluded prematurely, The
terminology applied to the burial descriptions is adopted from
Sprague (1968: 479-485}.
The remains of the first burial, Feature 6, were badly deteriorated.
The axis of the skeleton was east by west with the cranium in the
east. The burial was a primary inhumation extended on the back. No
artifacts or pit outline were associated with the burial. No age and
sex determination could be made. However, the individual was
probably a small child beCause 0nly the central portions of the long
bones remained: These long bone fragments were small,
Two additional burials (Features 7 and 8) were lying side by side.
Both skeletons were partially scattered on the surface. The maximum
depth of both burials was 10 cm: below the surface.
The long axis of one burial (Feature 7) was northwest by southeast
with the cranium in the southeast. The burial was a primary
inhumation, extended on the back with the hands along the sides’ The
skull, lower limb long bones, pelvis and all but three vertebra were
missing or fragmented. The outline of an irregular burial pit was
evident around the lower portion of the skeleton. No artifacts were

associated with the burial. The individual is believed to have been an
adolescent because the vertebral epiphysis were unfused. No sex
determination was possible.
The long axis of the second burial (Feature 8) was east southeast by
west northwest. The cranium was in the west northwest. The burial
was a primary inhumation extended on the back with the hands along
the sides and the left leg crossed Over the right. The individual was an
adult because all epiphysis were fused. No sex determination was
made. There were no artifacts nor evidence of a burial pit.
Hearths
Three possible hearths were documented during excavation of site
C-189. One possible hearth was excavated at site C-190:

132

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Features i and 2 from C-189 are probably parts of a single hearth.
Thirty-two small (diameters range between 5 and i0 cm.) basalt rocks
were scattered across an area of 50 cm. diameter. There was no apparent orderly arrangement among the stones. No evidence of firehardened earth, charcoal or artifacts was associated with the
features.
The second possible hearth at C-189 is Feature 3. Three basalt
rocks (approximate diameters, 15 cm. each) and one smaller rock
were scattered across an area of 25 cm. diameter. There was no
orderly arrangement, associated charcoal or artifacts.
Features 4 and 5 represent the third possible hearth from C-189. A
cluster of 7 stones (diameters of 15 cm. each) were scattered within
an area 29 cm. in diameter. A large charcoal fragment was recovered
from among the rocks. There was no fire-hardened earth nor were
there artifacts associated with this possible hearth.
The single possible hearth from C-190 was excavated. This
(Feature I) consisted of 9 basalt rocks and charcoal fragments. Seven
of the stones were located along an irregular north-south axis. The
two remaining stones were 23 and 30 cm, west of these. No artifacts,
charcoal, or fire-hardened earth was discovered.

ARTIFACTS
Analysis of artifacts from northern Mexico is hampered by the lack
of detailed comparative information. Therefore, lengthy descriptions
of all artifact categories are included and related to established,
culturally significant types. Since categories have been combined
from the 1971 report (Greene 1971) they are carefully referenced
here. All unclassifiable fragments are omitted from this report.
Because analysis of the artifacts indicated that no vertical or
horizontal significance could be demonstrated, artifacts are reported
only by site. Refer to Tables I, II, III, and IV for proveniences not ineluded in the text.
Projectile Points
Primary sorting criterions are dart and arrow point categories.
Mean dart point weights are greater than 2.5 grams and mean arrow
point weigl~ts are less than 2.5 grams (Fenega 1953).
The outlines of the proximal or basal portions of projectile points
are used to define the primary categories. These are: contracting

on the observation that stem or base treatment is significant:

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

133

although obviously, not all sub-categories within a single stem treatment are contemporaneous. This is not unique. Johnson (1967) demonstrated the chronological significance of basal characteristics among
projectile points from central and southwestern Texas. Stem characteristics are refelcted in the typology of central Coahuila (Taylor
1966) and are significant among the projectile point changes in northern Mexico and adjacent Texas which are summarized by Epstein
(1969).
The final sorting criterion is based on common typology. Projectile

points are compared to

types when possible and provisional

types are described. Many point forms from central and southwestern Coahuila have been briefly described by Aveleyra et al
(1956) and TaylOr (1966) but systematic description is lacking. In order to provide comparative data, detailed descriptive information
about each projectile point type. provisional type and untyped
category is included in the text of this paper.
DART POINTS
A total of 167 dart points was recovered from the four sites. These
include: contracting stemmed (49 specimens), straight stemmed (3
specimens), expanding stemmed (80 specimens), side-notched (17
specimens), miscellaneous stemmed (4 specimens), unstemmed (14
specimens).

CONTRACTING STEMMED
Among the contracting stemmed dart points are three types defined

by Taylor (1966), one provisional type and four untyped categories.
Acatita (Fig. 2, a-c)
There are seven specimens in this provisional type. The blades are
triangular with recurred or convex edges. Alternate or unifacial beveling
of the blade edges is common. With one exception the stems are short,
narrow and strongly contracted to slightly expanded. The exception has a
long stem. Stems may be asymmetrica! to the medial axis of the blade with
thinned or Unthinned bases. The regularly barbed shoulders are equal to or
slightly longer than the stems. One shoulder of a single specimen is descending. It may have been fractured. Dimensions: length, 2.6-318 cm.; length of
stem, 0.8-1.0 cm. and exception, 1.4 cm.; width across sh0ulders, 2.1-2.9
cm.; width of base, 0.8-1.1 cm.; thickness 0.5-0.7 cm.; weight, 2.3-4.3 grams.

33; Plate 2, m-q and 44.
Duran (Fig 2, d-f)
These thirty specimens conform to Taylor’s Duran type (1986: Fig. 3, bottom row left). They are characterized by opposed blade notches, barbed or

134

straight shoulders and bulbous stems. Most are crude and thick although
two have thin broad" blades. Most specimens have two sets of opposed
blade notches but one set or more than two sets does occur. Dimensions:
length, 2.5-4.0 cm.; width across shoulders, greater than 1.2-2.3 cm."
thickness, 0.4-0.7 cm. Remarks: Similar specimens from Poza Salada are

Gobernadora (Fig. 2,g)
This specimen conforms to the Gobernadora type as illustrated by
Taylor (1966: third row right). The blade is triangular, edges straight and
barbs are regular. The stem is bulb shaped, expands medially and contracts to a sharply pointed bffacially thinned base. Dimensions: length, 6.3
cm.; width across shoulders, 2.9 cm.: thickness, 0.6 cm. Remarks: Greene

lora (Fig. 2,h)
Three specimens are comparable to lora points (Taylor 1966; Fig. 3. first
row). The stern is broken from one dart point. The triangular blades have
concave or convex edges. Shoulders are variable, being both regularly barbed or one regularly barbed and the other descending. Bases are bifacially
thinned and convex. The base of each stemmed specimen has a shallow
central notch, thus differing from Taylor’s examples. One specimen has an
alternately beveled blade and stem. The beveling on the blade and stem are
opposed. Dimensions: length, 3.8-4.1 cm.; width across shoulders. 2.6-3.3
cm.; thickness, 0.543.7 cm. Remarks: Aveleyra et al. (1956: Lam II a) also

Untyped A (Fig. 2,i-j)
These four specimens have triangular blades with straight, convex or
recurred edges. Shoulders are regularly barbed and shorter than the
stems. Stems are straight or asymmetrical with bifacially thimled bases.
On one specimen, one blade edge is unifacially notched from file tip to the
shoulder. Dimensions: length, 2.8-3.9 cm.; width across shoulders, 1.6-2.2
cm.; thickness, 0.443.8 cm. Remarks: Greene (1971) Class I, Group 2,

STRAIGHT STEMMED
Only three dart points have straight stems. None can be placed in a
previously described or provisional type.
Untyped E (Fig. 2,n)
Of these three specimens only one is complete. Two specimens are
stemless but the blade morphology is so similar that they are tentatively included in the description. All are symmetrical and well-made. Blades are
long, triangular and have slightly convex edges. Shoulders are small and
straight or slightly barbed. On the complete specimen the stem and base
edges are straight. The base is bifacially thinned. Dimensions: length,
greater than 3.5 cm.; width across shoulders, 2.4 cm.; thickness, 0.6 cm.
Remarks: Greene (1971) Class II, Group I and possible Group 1: pages 2627; Plate 2, u-w

EXPANDING STEMMED
Among the expanding stemmed dart points are three provisional
types and six untyped categories.
Charcos (Fig. 2, o-p)
Although the forty-nine artifacts in this category are considered members of a provisional type, research beyond the scope of this paper indicates that temporal and spatial bounds are definable (Greene 1971).
ThuS, a confirmed type is indicated The specimens are divided into three
varieties On the basis of a morphological feature: blade notching. The
varieties may not be culturally significant and are presented here for
descriptive purposes onlY. The varieties are: Charcos unnotched (7), singlenotched [39), and double-notched (2).
Charcos dart points have triangular blades with irregular, straight or
convex edges. Shoulders are asymmetrical" one undeveloped or descending, the opposite barbed. One specimen has two barbed shoulders but one
is shorter than the other. The barbed shoulder ranges from short to long,
narrow to wide and is usually hooked toward the stem. The blade edge
distal to the weakest shoulder is straighter than the opposite edge. Bifacial
or unifacial notches occur on this straighter edge. Stems vary from short to
long with bifaciaUy thinned concave, straight or convex bases. Dimensions:

MISCELLANEOUS STEMMED FORMS
There are only two categories of miscellaneous stemmed forms.
Although one category includes a specimen that is comparable to
specimens in a defined type, the others cannot be compared to known
forms.

one descending shoulder and adjacent concave stem edge. The opposite
shoulder is barbed with a short stem. It appears to be a tang jutting from
the blade edge (Fig 3, n) The second specimen has a triangular blade with
one unnotched edge. The opposite edge is notched. The final specimen is a
proximal fragment. One blade edge is straight with a small projection or

ARROW POINTS

A total of 49 arrow points were recovered from the four sites.
These include: contracting stemmed (nine), side-notched (thirty-four
specimens), unstemmed (six specimens).
CONTRACTING STEMMED
Among the contracting stemmed arrow points are three untyped
categories. No specimens comparable to known or provisional types
were recovered.

single type. They may represent a hodgepodge of unfinished or rejected
specimens of several types. All are crude and asymmetrical having been
made by modifying only the flake edges. Five specimens have regularly
barbed shoulders, two have one barbed and one descending shoulder. Four
have a single unifacial notch on one blade edge. One has a unifacial notch
on both blade edges. These specimens are comparable to some flake points
attributed to the Coahuila or Jora Complexes by Taylor (1966: Fig. 6, first
row left). Dimensions: length, 2.1-3.7 cm.; width across shoulders, 1.6-2.2

SIDE-NOTCHED
Side-notched arrow points are comparable to three known types
and one provisional type. One of the known types, Scallorn, has not
previously been described in Coahuila.
Diaz (Fig. 4, c-e]
The three specimens in this provisional type are thick. Cross sections at
mid-blade are almost circular. Blade edges are irregular and alternately
beveled. Shoulders are descending. The stems are irregular with concave
edges. Only one base is bifacially thinned. Dimensions: length. 2.7-2.9 cm.:
length of stem, 0.7-1.1 cm.; width across shoulders, 1.3-1.8 cm.; width of

143

However, Sca!!orn points have not been previously reported in Coahuila.
Dimensions: length, 1.9-3.0 cm.; width across shoulders, 1.4-1.7 cm.;
thickness, 0.3-0.5 cm. Remarks: Greene (1971} Class IV, Group 4,

specimens among Coahuila and Jora Complex projectile points.
Toyah or Sierra Madera (Fig: 4, j)
These two specimens are comparable to Toyoh arrow points (Suhm and
Jelks i962) or sierra Madera projectile points (Taylor 1966: Fig. 27, top row
and second row left). They are thicker and cruder than the Harrell points
with proportionately smaller blades and larger stems. Shoulders are
descending. Dimensions: length, 2.7 cm.; width across shoulders, 1.4-1.5
cm.; thickness, 0.4-0.6 cm. Remarks: Similar projectile points from Poza
Salada are illustrated by Aveleyra et al. (1956: Lam. IV. c-d; Lam. X, d).

UNSTEMMED
Only two unstemmed categories of arrow points were found. Both
are comparable to known types.
E1 Muerto or Fresno (Fig. 4, k)
Five arroW points are E1 Muerto type (Taylor 1966: Fig. 27, fourth row]
which are assigned to the Jora Complex. Blades are thin and triangular
with straight Or concave bases. One long and narrow specimen has finely
serrated blade edges. BaSes are bifacially thinned. Dimensions: length, 1.82.9 cm.; width, 1.5-1.7 cm.; thickness, 0;3-0.4 cmi Remarks: These are
similar to specimens from Poza Salada (Aveleyra et al 1956: Laml IV, h-n).

described by Taylor (19661 Fig. 27, sac6nd r0~ right) as Cienegas points
have a notched concave baSe. The base 0f this specimen is notched but not
concave. He assigns Cienegas points to the Jora Complex.

SUMMARY AND CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT OF PROJECTILE
POINTS
A total of 216 projectile p6ints were recovered from the four sites in
the Desierto de Charcos de Risa. Both dart and arrow point forms are
represented and include specimens of thirteen previously defined
types, five provisional types and eighteen untyped categories.
Although stratified deposits from the Charcos de Risa were not encountered, comparison of similar projectile point forms from surrouncling areas enables the presentation of a chronologically ordered

sequence. This sequence is based on projectile point stem and base
characteristics discussed by Taylor (1966) for the Cuatro Cienegas
Basin in central Coahuila, Epstein (1969) for northern Mexico and adjacent Texas, and Johnson (1967) for central and southwest Texas.
The southwest Texas sequence is further supported by Dibble (1967)
and Story and Bryant (1966). Although the projectile point sequence
is established, absolute chronological dates are difficult to confirm
and should be regarded as estimates in this paper.
References to the Altithermal climatic period are based on Antevs
(1955, 1962) but no effort is made to determine the applicability of the
concept in northern Mexico. Nance (1972) regards Altithermal
climatic conditions to have been a factor affecting cultural developments in northern Mexico. Bryant (1974) discusses the pollen record
in the Amistad Reservoir of southwest Texas and considers the
possibility that Post-Glacial climatic change was gradual and increasingly arid.
A lengthy cultural succession is indicated by projectile point comparisons. Points ranging from late Paleo-lndian to late prehistoric
times are included among the sample recovered from the Charcos de
Risa.
The earliest projectile points recognized are two Lerma and four
Abasolo specimens. Both types are unstemmed dart points. Lerma
dart points are associated with Late Paleo-lndian, pre-Altithermal
times. Nance (1972: 171-175) notes that Lerma points have been dated
between 7,500 B.C. and 5,000 B.C. The terminal date in northeastern
Mexico is uncertain but the Lerma type probably does not persist
after 5,000 B.C. Abasolo is more difficult to place temporally but
appears to post-date Lerma. Epstein (1972:54) points out that in
Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, Abasolo may post-date the Altithermal
[5,000-2,500 B.C.). The major problem seems to be one of type recognition. Taylor (1966: Fig. 4, top row left) illustrates specimens of
the Espantosa type which are comparable to the Abasolo points recovered from the Charcos de Risa. Taylor recovered these among
Early Coahuila Complex materials indicating a pre-Altithermal association. Thus, if the four Abasolo specimens from the Charcos de Risa
are related to Taylor’s Expantosa points, a pre-Altithermal, pre-5000
B.C. time is indicated. If the Abasolo specimens are representative of
the defined type, they postdate the Altithermal and 5,000 B.C. (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:165].
Following late Paleo-lndian, pre-Altithermal times, there appears
to be a gap in the cultural sequence in the Charcos de Risa. No Early
Archaic (Altithermal) projectile points have been recognized in the
sample. Johnson (1964: Table 1, Fig. 25) dates the Early Archaic in

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

147

southwestern Texas between 5,000 and 3,000 B.C. At Arenosa Shelter
Early Barbed dart points were associated with a C-14 date of
3410+ 170 B.C, (Dibble 1967). Story and Bryant (1966) place Early
Barbed forms between 7,000-4,000 B.C. and Nolan and Pandale
between 4,000-2,500 B.C. The hiatus in the dart point sequence
reflected inthe Sample from the Charcos de Risa is not unexpected.
Epstein (1972: 54, 55) discusses the apparent absence or recognition
of occupation in northern Mexico during Altithermal times and Nance
(1972) considers the problem in detail.
In the Charcos de Risa, the stemless Late Paleo-lndian projectile
points are followed by typically Middle Archaic contracting stemmed
dart point forms, A total of 49 contracting stemmed dart points are
among the sample. Seventy percent (34) are comparable to types
described by Taylor (1966) indicating similarity between the Charcos
de Risa and Central Coahuila during the Middle Archaic part of the
Coahuila Complex. These types are: Duran (30 specimens), Gobernadora (i speciman), and Iora (3 specimens). The seven provisional
type Acatita points and eight specimens from untyped categories A-D
appear to be forms confined to the Charcos de Risa and are not
represented in the sample Taylor recovered from the Cuatro Cienegas
Basin, It should be noted that arrow point form, untyped category Q is
comparable to dart point form untyped category A. A larger sample is
needed to determine the range of form and weight among similar dart
and arrow points.
Concrete dates from the Middle Archaic in Coahuila are
problematical. In Nuevo Leon, McClurkan (1966: 70) reports contracting stemmed Gary points are approximately 1,200 A.D. and
Shumla points from A.D. i00 to A.D. 200. MacNeish includes Gary
points in the artifact assemblage of Tamaulipas from 200 or 150 B.C.
until A.D. 500 but did not find Shumla type points, lohnson (1964: Fig.
25) places contracting stemmed types Almagre, Langtry, and Shumla
in the Texas cultural sequence between 3,000 B.C. and sometime after 2,000 B.C. Story and Bryant (1966: Table 1) place Almagre,
Langtry and Val Verde types between 2,500 B,C, and 1,000 B.C. Absolute dates for the Middle Archaic in Coahuila will, of course,
depend on excavation of stratified deposits and recovery of radiocarbon samples.
Contracting stemmed dart point forms are followed by expanding
stemmed, corner notched dart points which probably mark the inception of the Late Archaic. A total of 80 dart points were recovered:
three provisional types and six untyped categories are represented.
Only 12 percent (5 provisional type Finesterre and five provisional
type Vertiente specimens) are comparable to forms recovered by

148

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Taylor in Central Coahuila. This indicates divergence of specific attributes but adherence to the overall projectile point form among the
inhabitants of southwestern and central Coahuila during these times.
The remaining corner notched specimens are provisional type Charcos (49 specimens) or Untyped categories F-K (21 specimens). One exceptionally large artifact may be associated with the Charcos point
style. It is described as a Miscellaneous Stemmed Charcos-like
specimen. Although confirmation is lacking the Charcos projectile
point form may have persisted throughout the Late Archaic and
possibly later.
During the Late Archaic, side-notched dart points appear later
than the corner-notched forms (Johnson 1964: Fig. 25). In the Charcos
de Risa this form is represented by thirteen Ensor-like and four Untyped categories L and M dart points. Taylor (1966) illustrates sidenotched Ensor-like specimen among Middle and Late Coahuila Complex projectile point styles.
The Late Archaic is difficult to date by inference and no direct
dates can be provided for Coahuila. In nearby Nuevo Leon, McClurkan (1966: 70) found no comparable expanding stemmed cornernotched forms. However, he has dated the side-notched Ensor type
from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1,090 or later. In Texas, Johnson (1964: Fig. 25)
indicates that corner-notched and side-notched dart points span the
period from sometime before 1,000 B.C. until after 1,000 A.D.
Arrow points, commonly accepted as markers of Neo-lndian times
are a complex assemblage in the Desierto de Charcos de Risa. They
include: (1) corner-notched forms; three provisional type Diaz, three
Harrell, twenty-six Scallorn-like, two Toyah or Sierra Madera type.
(2] unstemmed forms; five E1Muerto or Fresno type, one Garza type.
Only the provisional type Diaz specimens are not comparable to Jora
Complex points illustrated by Taylor (1966), suggesting widespread
projectile point similarity throughout Coahuila during late times.
The problem of relating arrowpoint forms and late dart point forms
in Coahuila is expressed by Taylor’s (Ibid.} hesitancy to place a terminal date on the Coahuila Complex and a firm beginning for the Jora
Complex. Apparently, the Jora Complex begins sometime after A.D. 1
(Taylor, 1966: Fig. 30). McClurkan dates arrow points in the NL92
deposits in Nuevo Leon by A.D. 800 (1966: 70). Story and Bryant (1966:
Table 1) note the introduction of arrow points in southwestern Texas
between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1600.
Internal chronological divisions among arrow point forms is also
problematical. McClurkan (1966: 70) found both stemmed and side
notched specimens at NL92 but could not stratigraphically separate

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

149

the types. It should be noted that the form most common among the
Charcos de Risa Sample, Scallorn-like, was not recovered in Nuevo
Leon.
According to Suhm and Jelks (1962) Scallorn arrow points slightly
postdate (A.D. 500 to A.D. 1200) the Ensor type (100-200 B.C. to A.D.
500-1000). The relationship and dates of these two forms in Coahuila
is an interesting problem. Also, in Texas (Ibid.) Scallorn apparently
pre-dates Harrell, Toyah, Fresno and Garza types.
Two unstemmed dart point forms, Catan and Matamoros specimens
were recovered. These can not be placed in the chronological scheme
at this time. Epstein [1972: 55) notes that triangular points in norrhea stern Mexico span Archaic and early Neo-Indian times and can
not be used as time markers. Taylor (1966) did not find these types in
Coahuila but current research indicates that Catan and Matamoros
are important among projectile point forms in Coahuila.

flakes. They are characterized by bifacial edges struck by percussion from
around a portion of the circumference. The side opposite the bifacial edge
is blunt. All have semicircular outlines. Three are fragments. Dlmenmons:
circumference, 7.0 X 7.9-10.7 X 12.3 cm.: thickness, 2.8-3.7 cm. Remarks:
These specimens seem to correspond closely with Epstein’s continuous
edge bifaces group A and B (1969, pages 48-50 Fig. 8). Greene (1971} Thick
Bifaces Class I; pages 98-99. Mcclurkan [1966, Fig 17, p. 49) reports heavy
choppers but the:~ tend to have a rectangular outline. MacNeish also reports sub-rectangular choppers (1958: 85; Fig. 29,13-14}.

MODIFIED FLAKES
Two hundred and thirty-five flakes exhibit one or more modified edges.
Dimensions: length, 1.5-10.0 cm.; width, 1.8-7.0 cm.; thickness, 0.4-2.6 cm.
Remarks: Greene (1971) Thin Unifaces Classes Ill and IV; pages 111-115;
Plates 9, l-n, 10, a-f.

Cores
Three categories of cores were recovered from the sites. Because
additional flake removal from the cores would be impractical or yield
exceptionally small flakes, all of the cores are considered exhausted.
Therefore, flake scars on the cores are reminiscent of flakes which
were least desirable. Specimens from two categories have been
secondarily modified.
ROUND-OVAL (Fig. 5, f)
These twelve cores were fashioned from round or oval cobbles as well as
large primary flakes. They are subcircular in outline with biconvex cross
sections. Cores from which flakes were struck in regular succession
around the circumference tend to have a dorsal and ventral apex. On the
other hand. cores from which flakes were struck from two opposing edges
of the circumference tend to have a dorsal and ventral longitudinal ridge.
Cortex remnants are sometimes evident on the apexes or as blunt obstructions at right angles to the edge. These cores are bifaces. One
specimen is limestone. Dimensions: circumference, 5,6 X 8.7 cm.;
thickness. 3.2-5.6 cm. Remarks: Greene (1971) Cores Class I; page 122-125:
Plate 11, i-l.
SUBCYLINDRICAL (Fig. 5, g-h)
The twenty-four cores in this category are made from cobbles or large
initial flakes. They are subcylindrical to subconical in longitudinal cross
section. The central faces are either natural or prepared striking platforms with slightly convex, fiat or concave surfaces. Scars of the flakes
struck from these platforms taper toward the dorsal ends. As a result, the
dorsal surface of a core is either a sharp apex or an irregular face smaller
in diameter than the ventral platform. The sides are long and essentially
straight, bearing the scars of the removed flakes. Some specimens are battered. Dimensions: length, 2.6-5.3 cm.; ventral diameter, 2.2 X 2.9-7,2 X 7.9
cm.; dorsal diameter, not measurable-2.2 X 5.9 cm. Remarks: Greene (1971)
Cores Class II; pages 125-130; Plates 12, a-j.

IRREGULAR (Fig. 5, i-j)
The eleven specimens in this category consist of asymmetrical pebbles
and one large flake from which flakes have been removed in a nonpatterned fashion. There are cortex remnants on ten specimens. Irregular
edges on each specimen indicate attempts to prepare a platform or shape
an artifact. Thus, additional evidence is needed to determine if these
specunens are cores or pebbles discarded after initial efforts to shape
them failed. Three specimens are battered. Dimensions: length, width and

Special Features on Chipped Stone Artifacts
BEAK LIKE PROJECTIONS
The twenty-eight beak like projections or gravers were formed: (1) on the
pointed end, (2) on a corner, (3) on the side at the junction of two flake
scars. All were made on thin unifaces. Remarks: Greene (1971) Special
Features on Chipped Stone Artifacts Class I; pages 132-134: Plate 10. c.
SEMI-LUNATE CONCAVITIES
Twenty-eight specimens have semi4unate concavities cut into a continuous edge. Three have two concavities. Two also have beak like projections. With the exception of a single thin biface, all are on thin unifaces.

Ground and Pecked Stone
BOWL SHAPED MORTAR
This is an irregularly circular limestone bowl with a flat base and
restricted rim. The lip is flush with the rim. The interior is conical with the
wider end at the mouth. Interior and exterior surfaces were shaped by
pecking. The interior surface is smoother than the exterior The incised
rim pattern includes a single irregular horizontal line 1.8 cm. below the lip.
The enclosed zone between the lip and line is filled with adjacent alternate
point-up/point-down triangles. A faint remnant of red paint is visible on
the body. Dimensions: maximum diameter, 14.6 X 16 cm.; height, 10.4 cm.;
diameter of mouth, 8.6 X 8.7 era,; depth of interior, 5.3 cm. Remarks:
Greene (1971) Bowl Shaped Mortar; page 137.
MILLING STONES
Of the four milling stones, three are large slabs of rock and one is a flal
cobble. None shows evidence of intentional shaping. One specimen has an
elongate ground depression, another has a circular depression. Three are
limestone and three are vesicular basalt. The entire surface of two
specimens is slightly ground. Dimensions: length and width. 21.7 X 27.0

large with medium to large particles most abundant. Although the concentration of temper ranges from sparse to abundant, abundant is by far
the most common. In most sherds the paste is nearly obscured by the vast
number of temper particles. The paste is fine and soft.
Texture: Compact to very friable depending on the amounl of temper
present. Friable sherds are the most common.
Color: Various shades of buff, brown, black and red are represented.
Considerable variation on a single sherd is common.
Core: Cores vary from darker in the center than on the edges to light or
dark throughout.
Wall thickness: 9.4-1.6 cm.
Lip and rim: Inverted, straight, everted with thinned, unthinned and
thickened lips.
Method of manufacture: Coiling.
Special features: Sherds have perforations or mending boles.

Shape and size of vessels: A portion of a small vessel with a globular body
and constricted rim was recovered from the dune surface between sites C190 and C-191. Height is approximately 18.8 cm. and the wall thickness
ranges from 0.6-0.9 cm. Three fragments of a possible open spout were
recovered from the surface of site C-190. One conical leg fragment was
recovered from the surface of C-189.

Shape and size of vessels: Portions of four vessels, two large jars and two
bowls were found. The first jar (Fig. 5, m) includes 85 sherds from the surface of C-190. The vessel has a globular body, slightly thickened base, constricted neck and a straight thinned rim. Interior and exterior surfaces are
smeared with red wash. Dimensions are: body diameter, 29.3 cm.; neck
diameter, 25.2 cm.; diameter of mouth, 22.6 cm.; height, 28.3 cm.; wall
thickness, 0.7-1.0 cm. Thirty eight sherds of a jar were recovered from the
dune surface between C-190 and C-191. The lip is thinned and the neck
strongly inverted. Four opposed pairs of perforations apparently were
made to mend a fracture. The vessel diameter is approximated between 35
and 40 cm. and the wall thickness ranges between 0.6-0.8 cm. Redwash is
visible on exterior and interior surfaces. A portion of one bowl recovered
from C-191 indicates a globular body and constricted neck. Red wash occurs on interior and exterior surfaces. Diameter of the mouth is in excess
of 37.0 cm. and the wall thickness ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 cm. A second
bowl was recovered from the dune surface between C-190 and C-191.
Twenty-three sherds revealed a globular body and slightly thickened base.
The lip is thinned and the rim inverted. The diameter exceeds 33.0 cm. The

157

wall thickness is between 0.7 and 1.9 cm. Decoration: Red wash applied to
interior and/or exterior surfaces. It appears to have been smeared with a
cloth or handful of weeds for red wash occurs in broad bands or covers an
entire portion of a vessel. It is frequently difficult to distinguish between
sherds washed red or fired red. The frequency of red wash on interior
surfaces indicated bowls or jars with large orifices. The large size of some
vessels of this type is confirmed by the particially restorable vessels
described.

body sherds are described among six categories: (1) circular punctations (Fig. 6. a); (2) double rings of circular panctations (Fig. 6, b); (3)
diagonally opposed rows of parallel incised lines (Fig. 6. c); (4) irregular
linear punctatinns, usually in rows as if made with a comb (Fig 6. d); (5)
combination of linear punctations and incised lines as in categories 3 and 4
(Fig. 6, e); (6) combination of circular punctations and incised lines as in
categories 1 and 3 (Fig. 6, f). There are six incised lip designs: (1) alternating rows of parallel lines (Fig 6, g]; (2) diagonally placed rows of
parallel lines, may be fragments of category i (Fig. 6, h); (3) simple zig zags
(Fig. 6, i); (4) chevrons (Fig. 6, j); (5) single horizontal line bifurcating the lip
(Fig. B, k); (6) bifurcated chevrons (Fig. 6,1).
There is a total of 528 sherds (omit the appendage); of these, 120 are lip
sherds. Of the lip sherds, 107 are decorated and 13 are plain. The body portions of 437 sherds are decorated. Among the lips occurring with decorated
bodies 13 of the lip surfaces are plain and 16 are decorated.

parallel-incised lines that are diagonally opposed, and category 4,
irregular and slightly linear punctations are represented. Shape and size
of vessels: No restorable vessels were recovered. A single vessel leg was
found which is a horse shoe-shaped projection modeled from the side of a
vessel. The open end is almost flush with the vessel wall and the closed end
of the horse shoe is raised. The vessel wall adjoining the appendage is incised with irregular lines. The pattern is too fragmentary to be defined.

CHALCHIHUITES-LIKE POTTERY
These five sherds are definitely intrusive and are comparable to
Chalchihuites wares. Chalchihuites ceramics span A.D. 300 or 500 to A.D.
1350 (Kelley 1966: 102,109).
One sherd, suggestive of a bowl with smoothed interior, has an unthickened base that sharply undercuts the vesse! side. One subconical leg
extends from the base at the junction of base and side. Wear on the bottom
of the leg indicates that the appendage was angled away from the body of
the vessel. A single dark red line encircles the vessel at the junction of base
and side; the upper margin is sinuous and the lower, straight. On the side
above the line a fragment of red paint remains. The leg is smeared with red
paint, interior and exterior surfaces are smoothed and slightly lusterous.
Unpainted areas are buff and gray.
Another sherd is a base and body fragment or a base and rim fragment.
It is sharply angular in cross section. The sherd is buff or orange with two
red horizontal lines on the lower part of the sherd. An irregular fragment
of a pattern occurs on the upper portion.
Two buff colored sberds have fragments of red designs on the interior
surfaces. One of these is illustrated in (Fig. 5, k).
One sherd (Fig. 5. l) has an everted thin lip and appears to be a fragment
of a short vessel. The lip and exterior surface are painted with a red
design. There is a thick line around the lip. Just below the lip there are two
horizontal lines. The upper has a single tick mark extending towards the
lip. The lower has tick extending down. Two unticked horizontal lines occur below the first set. The panel between this lower set contains an
irregular scroll pattern and scattered circular dots. There is a thin shallow
groove on the exterior surface. The sherd was snapped but the fracture did
not follow the groove. Number of specimens: Total, 5. C-190: body, 3; total,
3. C-198: body, I. Remarks: Greene (1971) Pottery Class X.
CONCHOS PLAIN
Temper and paste: Although large and medium sized white particles are
visible on the surface and throughout the interior of each sherd, they are
less frequent and smaller than those in El Paso Brown and El Paso
Polychrome-wares. Clear and vein quartz are the most frequent temper
particles. Mica and feldspar are present. Particle shape ranges from
subrounded to subangular Particle size range is from small to large with
large particles slightly smaller than those of the El Paso pottery. Medium
and small particles are the most abundant. The paste is platy, fine or
granular.
Texture: The texture range includes compact to slightly friable
specimens. No sherds are as friable as some of the Arenal specimens.
Color: Color is one of the most consistent and striking features of these
sherds. They are dark buff to reddish brown.
Core: Cores are very distinct in this type. They are thick and dark grey.
Wall thickness: 0.5 to 0.8 cm.
Lip and rim: One everted rim has an unthinned lip, another straight rim
sherd has a thickened lip.
Method of manufacture: Not determined.
Special features: None.
Decorations: The dark red on the surfaces of some sherds may be red
wash or paint.

.....................
Remarks: Greene (1971) Pottery Class III; pages 151-152. These sherds
were compared to Conchos Plain sherds collected by J.C. Kelley and stored
in the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas.
Schackelford (1955) assigns Conchos pottery to the time between A.D. 1200
to A.D. 1800.
EL PASO BROWN AND EL PASO POLYCHROME WARES
Temper and paste: The most distinctive feature of this class is the temper. Large white particles are evident on the surface and throughout the
paste of each sherd. Clear and vein quartz, the most abundant temper particles, range from subangular to angular. Some of the temper may have
been crushed. The paste ranges from platy to granular.
Texture: Ranges from compact to slightly friable. No specimens are as
friable as Arenal pottery.
Color: Shades of brown, red, buff and black occur.
Core: Most cores are dark gray or black but some sherds are light
throughout.
Wall thickness: 0.3 to 0.8 cm.
Lip and rim: Rims are everted with thinned or thickened lips.
Method of manufacture: Not determined.
Special features: One specimen has a possible circular perforation.
Another specimen has a ground and snapped edge.
Shape and size of vessels: No indication.
Decoration: 105 sherds are plain; 4 have a possible red wash; 11 are
brushed; i is incised and i is covered with black paint.

Remarks: Greene (1971) Pottery Class If; pages 148-150. These
specimens were compared to El Paso sherds from near Samalavuca,
Mexico and loaned by Vernon R. Brook. El Paso ware is commonly reported
from adjacent areas of southeastern New Mexico, Texas and northern
Mexico [Vernon Brook, 1971: personal communication). Hester and Hill
(1969) report similar sherds from south Texas. Taylor (1966: 63, 83) reports
El Paso Brown sherds probably associated with Iota Complex and Late
Coahuila Complex. McGregor (1965: 359-360) places El Paso Brown and El
Paso Polychrome pottery between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1400 and associates
them with Mesilla, Dona Aria and El Paso phases of the lornado Branch of
the Mogollon.
SANTIAGO
Temper and Paste: The specimens in this provisional type have a temper
of assorted minerals, primarily clear and vein quartz. Particle shape
ranges from subangular to subrounded; size, from small to large with
medium sized particles most abundant. The amount of temper ranges from
moderate to abundant with moderate most common. The paste is granular
or occasionally platy.
Texture: Ranges from slightly compact to friable. Most sherds are
slightly friable.

Color: Shades of buff, brown, red and black are common.
Core: Cores may be light or dark throughout or darker in the center.
Wall thickness: 0.5 to 0.9 cm.
Lip and rim: With one exception, all have everted rims with thinned, unthinned or thickened lips. The exception is thinned and straight.
Method of manufacture: Coiled.
Special features: One sherd has been ground to a disc shape. There is no
perforation.
Shape and size of vessels: No indication.
Decoration: Body sherds are plain or red washed on either or both surfaces. The lips and rims of some sherds are red washed. On the exterior of
one sherd two verticle stripes extend from a red lip.
Number of specimens: Total, 660. C-189: body, 270; lip, 16; total, 286. C190: body, 181; lip, 12; total, 193. C-191: body, 67; lip, 10; total, 97. C-198:
body, 73; lip, 11; total, 84.
Remarks: Greene (1971) Pottery Class IV; pages 152-153. Although some
of the sherds grade into Arena! on one extreme and Conchos on the other, I
feel that they are separable on the basis of temper, texture and core
characteristics.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION OF POTTERY TYPES

A total of 4,818 potsherds was recovered from the four sites in the
Charcos de Risa. They include intrusive as well as locally manufactured ceramics.
The most numerous pottery category is 3,957 sherds of provisional
type Arenal. Four varieties are included: undecorated, 3,022; red
washed, 337; incised and punctated, 529; variant, 59. On the basis of
numbers and wide distribution, this provisional type is considered indigenous. Seriation studies beyond the scope of this paper indicate
that Arenal pottery may be the earliest in the sample and the
varieties may be temporally significant. Undecorated vessels are
common throughout the sequence. Incised designs appear to be
overlapped or replaced by punctated designs and in later times, only
undecorated and red wasl~ed varieties persist. Arenal variant is a
compact variety that includes undecorated, red washed and incised
and punctated sherds. The compactness may be a result of increased
firing temperature and reflect refined technique.
The other provisional type, Santiago, also appears to be locally
manufactured. A total of 660 sherds (undecorated and red washed)
were recovered. Seriation indicates that this type did not appear until
after linear incised pottery of the Arenal provisional type disappeared.
The termination of provisional types Arenal and Santiago is
mknown but Correlation with dated intrusive types indicate that both
:ypes survived until after A.D. 1200-1300.

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

Among the intrusive pottery are five sherds comparable to
Chalchihuites wares. Chalchihuites types occur between A.D. 300 or
500 and A.D. 1350 (Kelley 1966: 102, I09}.
Seventy three Conchos Plain sherds were recovered. These date
between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1800 (Schackelford 1955). Conchos Plain
is considered an intrusive type but future research may extend its
range into southwestern Coahuila.
Intrusive, El Paso Brown and El Paso Polychrome wares were also
found. The sample includes 123 specimens; 105 undecorated, 4
possible red washed, 1 black painted and 11 brushed. These occur in
far west Texas, adjacent New Mexico and Mexico between A.D. 900
and A.D. 1400.
The combined time span of the three intrusive ceramic categories
are from as early as A.D. 300 or 500 (Chalchihuites-like] to A.D. 1800
(Conchos). However, the three wares overlap temporally between
A.D. 900 and A.D, 1350. There is no evidence that all of the intrusive
types reached the Charcos de Risa during this brief span.

Other Ceramic Artifacts
PIPE FRAGMENTS
Three cylindrical pipe stems and one bowl fragment were recovered.
The paste of the stem fragments is hard and smooth. Temper is sparse and
consists of small sand grains. The paste and temper of the bowl fragment is
comparable to Arenal pottery. Greene (1971) Pipe Stems and Possible Pipe
Bowl Fragment; page 162. Mason (1937: 134-141; Figs. 2, a, 3) reports i pipe
stern from Pueblito, 5 kin. south of Durango City, and another from Arroyo
Quelito near Zape. MacNeish (1958: 130) reports a pipe stem fragment
from Tamaulipas and attributes it to the Los Angeles Component.
CLAY BALLS AND HEMISPHERES
There are a total of 40 specimens. Thirty-seven are clay balls shaped by
rolling the clay between the palms. There is considerable range in slze
[diameters of 1.9-3.6 cm.} and degree of roundness. Surface finishes range
from smooth to rough. The surfaces of three specimens are scratched. One
specimen has a single groove incised around the circumference. One other
specimen has several deep furrows on the surface made while the clay was
wet. Three specimens are hemispheres. Apparently, these were made by
cutting clay balls in half and grinding the fiat side smooth. Thirty four
specimens are comparable to Arenal pottery. Five others are comparable
with Arenal Variant and one with the temper and paste of the pipe stems.
Greene (1971} Clay Balls and Hemispheres; pages 162-164. MacNeish
(1958: Fig. 43, el illustrates an incised and punctated clay ball.

SPINDLE WHORLS
Biconical
Sixteen specimens were recovered. One is so small that it may be a
bead. All are biconically shaped with a single perforation through the vet-

tical axis. They are crude and surfaces are eroded. The surfaces of three
specimens are scratched. One specimen was mashed while wet. The temper and paste of 13 specimens corresponds to Arenal pottery. Two are
comparable to the temper and paste of the pipe stems. The height and width ranges from 1.8 X 2.3-2.2 X 3.8 cm. with one exception, 1.0 X 1.6 era.
Greene (1971) Spindle Whorls, Class I; pages 164-165; Fig. 15, c. Mason
(1937, page 136, 138) reports biconical spindle whorls from a site located
on the Nazas River near Hervideros, Durango.
Discs
There are seven perforated potsherd discs. All are irregularly circular
with crudely ground edges. Four specimens were made from Arena1 pottery, one from Arena1 Variant and one from Santiago pottery. Greene
(1971) Spindle Whorls, Class II; page 166.
FIGURINES
The sample consists of four cylindircally shaped figurines. The tops of
the heads are flattened. Three specimens have no arms or legs. Two of
these have lower ends larger in diameter than the upper or head ends. The
nose of one specimen (Fig. 7. a, b) is a small vertical wedge. There are:
eyes on either side of the nose; two nostrils beneath the nose; and below the
nostrils, a mouth. All are small circular punctations. The lower portion of
the second specimen (Fig. 7. c, d) is divided into two distinct legs. Above the
abdomen is a single, deep, circular perforation. There is a deep fracture on
one side of the upper front. The wedge protruding from one side may
represent an arm, a turned head, or a breast. There are no eyes, nostrils or
mouth. The third specimen (Fig. 7 e) has punctated eyes, nostrils and
mouth as well as a vertical wedge nose. The nose of *the last specimen (Fig.
7 f) is a small beak. There is one eye (the other may be eroded); a fracture
in the nostril region; and no mouth.
The temper of three specimens is sparse, fine sand and the paste is
dense and fine. The temper and paste of two specimens is slightly finer
than Arena! pottery. Greene (1971) Figurines pages 166-167; Plate 15, d-i.
Shafer (1975) discusses clay figurines recovered from southwestern
Texas. These anthropomorphic forms may include males as well as
females. They are associated with the Middle Archaic period. Association
of the southwestern Texas forms with the Charcos de Risas specimens in
unconfirmed.

CLAY CYLINDERS
Twentythree irregularly shaped cylinders were recovered. All are fractured on at least one end. They may represent coil fragments, figurine
parts and possibly vessel legs. None are decorated. Nineteen specimens
have temper and paste identical to Arenal pottery. The paste of the remaining specimens is compact and fine and the temper is fine and sparse
sand. Greene (1971) Miscellaneous Clay Cylinders, page 68.
DAUB
Fifty-one specimens appear to be daub. They are small amorphously
shaped clay lumps with grass and stick impressions on the surfaces. These
may be fragments from burned clay covered brush structures or clay lined
hearths. Greene (1971) Daub; page 168.

Shell and Bone
SHELL
Disc Beads
Eight of these beads are circular and one is rectangular. All have a
single central perforation drilled from one or both sides. Seven are white
and two are black. Greene (1971) Beads. Class I; pages 170-171.
Gastropod Beads
Six beads are Marginella and Olivella shells from which the apex was
removed. The shells include: oliVella undotella Lamark, 4 specimens;
Olivella sp., 1 specimen Marginella sp. of M. apicina Menke or M. curta
Dowerby (Peter Rodda personal communication 1969]. Four other
specimens were fashioned from unidentifiable gastropod shells. Both apex
and base were removed so that the beads consist of the cylindrical body
whorl. Greene (1971) Beads Class II’. pages 171-172.
Pelecypod Fragments
Five pelecypod valve fragments with one or two perforations were found
classified as beads. Shape ranges from rectangular with rounded edges to
irregular with dubious edge modification. Greene (1971) Miscellaneous
perforated shells; pages 172-172.

Remarks on Beads
The shell and stone beads can be compared with those from Cueva
de la Candelaria (Aveleyra et al. 1956: pp. 118-128 and Lain. 43-44).
Beads were found strung on bracelets, necklaces, and in strings of eccentric patterns. Also, they were found onflores (rattle-like objects of
fiber and wood), strung on a shaft of wood, and forming mosaic-like
patterns on the base of guardpuas. The marine shell beads recovered
from Candelaria are Olivella sama, a Pacific shell, and Marginella
apicina, a Gulf of Mexico gastropod (Ibid., p. 126).

BONE
An irregular-elongate, flat bone fragment has a single perforation. The
perforation is located in the center of the fiat surface and was drilled from
both faces. The fragment is eroded and was broken when recovered.

Historic Artifacts
Fragments of modern bottles, pottery, metal and plastic were recovered
from the surfaces of sites C-189 and C-198. Cartridge cases and a spent
bullet are among the artifacts from C-198, C-190 and the dune surface near
C-190. None date earlier than 1895.
Sixty-four of the pottery specimens are indistinguishable from pottery
used today. However, much of that pottery was used in the area during
early historic times. It is notable that all but ten sherds were recovered
from C-198.
Two sherds of tin-enameled earthenware of probable nineteenth century
origin (Tunnell 1966) were recovered from C-198. Both have green exteriors and cream white interiors. The glaze of both surfaces has bubble
holes. Greene (1971) Historic Artifacts, pages 174-180.

FAUNAL REMAINS
Gastropods (John Clark: personal communication, 1969) include
Heliosoma trivolis (Say), Rabdotus alternatur marias
(Albers), Rabdotus sp. and Pseudosuccinea columella (Say). The pelcypod
Uniomerus tetralasmus (Say) was identified by Henry Van der $chalie
(personal communication: 1969). All live in ponds, sloughs or lakes.
Van der Schalie suggests that the pelecypods may represent the
southernmost range of the species.
Vertebrate remains include: Canis latrans, Citellus spi!osoma,
Lepus californicus, Odocoilus virginianus, Sigmodon hispidus and
Sylvilagus floridanus (James E. Corbin: personal communication,
1969). Medium and large bird bone fragments were recovered.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Comparison and internal analysis has revealed much about the
cultural sequence and artifact associations in the Desierto de Char-

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

168

cos de Risa, Coahuila, Mexico. In the following sections, discussion of
the artifact sequence and conclusions are presented. These include
brief summaries of the projectile point and pottery sequences presented within the text of the artifact descriptions as well as; lithics other
than projectile points, ceramics other than pottery, shell and bone artifacts, historic artifacts and faunal remains. Comments on cultural
processes in the Charcos de Risa concludes this section. A statement
of major problems and concluding remarks close the paper.
Hopefully, the brief problem section will help the reader understand
the difficulties facing researchers concerned with the prehistory of
northern Mexico.
Summaries and Comments
THE PROJECTIL E POINT SEQUENCE
The projectile point sequence will be briefly recounted in this section. It is based primarily on comparisons with established sequences
in surrounding areas discussed by Epstein (1969), Johnson (1964 and
1967), Taylor (1966), Dibble (1967) and Story and Bryant (1966).
The earliest projectile point forms recovered in the Charcos de Risa
are stemless, leaf shaped dart points: Lerma and possibly Abasolo.
Similar dart point forms were found (Taylor 1966) in the Cuatro
Cienegas Basin and related to the Early Coahuila complex. Lerma, a
late Paleo-lndian form, has been dated in northern Mexico as early as
7,000 B.C. and probably persisted no later than 5,000 B.C. (Nance
1972). Thus, it appears to be confined to the time of the preAltithermal climatic interval.
As expected, no expanding stemmed Early Barbed dart points were
recognized in the sample. These are dated during the Early Archaic
period in Southwestern Texas from 5,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C. [Johnson
1964 and 1967) or 7,000 B.C. or 4,000 B.C. (Story and Bryant 1966).
Slightly later dart point types, Nolan and Pandale were not found. EPstein (1972) and Nance (1972) consider the absence of Early Archaic
dart point forms to be an apparent gap in the cultural sequence
during Altithermal times.

of Central Coahuila. Dates for the Middle Archaic in Texas are referred and should be regarded as estimates. Johnson (1964) dates the
Middle Archaic in Texas between 3,00{3 B.C. until sometime after
2,000 B.C. In Nuevo Leon, McClurkan (1966: 70) dated Shumla type

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

169

dart points from A.D. 100 to A.D. 200 and Gary points at approximately A.D. 1200. Story and Bryant (1966: Table 1) place Middle
Archaic dart point types between 2,500 B.C. and 1,000 B.C.
Expanding stemmed, corner notched dart points are evidence of
Late Archaic occupations in the Desierto de Charcos de Risa. Only 12
percent of the specimens are comparable to forms recovered by
Taylor (1966) in Central Coahuila indicating less homogeneity between the two regions during the Late Archaic (Middle and Late
Coahuila Complex). This speculation is further supported by the large
number of provisional type Charcos points, a well developed, but
regionally confined dart point style.
In Texas, the later part of the Late Archaic is marked by the appearance of side notched dart point forms (Johnson 1964]. The sample
from the four sites in the Charcos de Risa includes Ensor-like and 4
untyped categories of side notched dart point forms. Taylor (1966) includes an Ensor-like form among Middle and Late Coahuila Complex
points.
Dates for the Late Archaic are uncertain. In southwestern Texas,
the Late Archaic began before 2,000 B.C. and persisted later than
1,000 B.C. (Johnson 1964). In Nuevo Leon, McClurkan (1966) found no
comparable corner notched forms but the slightly later side-notched
Ensor type was recovered and dated from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1000.
Arrow points, representing late prehistoric times, include both side
notched and stemless forms. With the exception of provisional type
Diaz, all are comparable to forms recovered from Central Coahuila
(Taylor 1966). Efforts to place arrow point stern or base attributes into a sequence are premature. Although Scallorn type appears to predate Harrell, Toyah, Fresno and Garza types in Texas (Suhm and
lelks, 1962) McClurkan was unable to stratigraphically discriminate
among arrow point forms recovered from NL92 in Nuevo Leon.
Both Catan and Matamoros dart points were recovered from the
Charcos de Risa. These stemless forms can not be placed in a temporal framework. Epstein (1972) discusses the uncertain position of
triangular points within the northern Mexican chronological scheme.
OTHER LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Both bifacial and unifacial chipped stone artifacts were recovered
and several forms are comparable to specimens from nearby regions.
Many of the biracial and unifacial categories probably represent
blanks and preforms; stages within the tool manufacturing sequence,
Among the bifaces are symmetrical, irregular and notched gouges.
The irregular specimens are similar in form but smaller than Clear
Fork gouges recovered from the San Isidro Site in Nuevo Leon (Ep-

170

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

stein 1969). Clear Fork gouges have been associated with Paleo-Indian
projectile point forms, but because the sample from the Charcos de
Risa is small (2 specimens) and divergent in size it should not be considered evidence of these early times in southwestern Coahuila. Eight
thick bifaces were. recovered. They may be comparable to forms in
Nuevo Leon (Epstein 1969; McClurkan 1966) and Tamaulipas (MacNeish 1958). No chronological associations are evident. The only
unifacial form comparable to examples elsewhere is a single stemmed
specimen. Similar artifacts were recovered from the adjacent Laguna region by Aveleyra et al. (1956).
It is difficult to place biracial and unifacial artifacts within a temporal framework at this time. However, Taylor (1966: 67) suggests
that, in Central Coahuila, bifacial implements occurred earliest,
then gave way to both biracial and unifacial forms which were later
replaced by a predominance of unifacial forms. Finally, retouched
flakes replaced unifacial forms in frequency. Portions of this sequence are supported by finds at the San Isidro Site in Nuevo Leon (Epstein 1969: 119-120).
Three categories of cores were recovered from the four sites. Most
appear to be exhausted. These remains indicate that chipped stone
tools were manufactured on the sites. None of the cores can be placed
within a chronological framework and the location of the stone
quarries is undetermined.
Among the ground and pecked stone artifacts are: a bowl shaped
mortar, unshaped milling stones, hand stones, and a stone maul or
pestle. All are evidence of plant food preparation on the sites. None of
the artifacts can be dated.
Disc-shaped stone beads are similar to undated specimens
recovered from the adjacent Laguna (Avelyera et al. 1956). Other
stone artifacts include a tubular stone pipe and a spherical ground
stone fragment. Tubular stone pipe fragments were recovered from
NL92 in Nuevo Leon (McClurkan 1966) but no spherical ground stone
objects have been reported from nearby sites.
THE POTTERY SEQUENCE
Apparently, two types of pottery were manufactured by the prehistoric inhabitants of the Charcos de Risa. The earliest, provisional
type Arenal, includes several varieties which may be temporally
significant: (1) Plain vessels were probably manufactured throughout
the sequence. (2) Incised designs may be temporally overlapped or
replaced by punctated design elements. (3) Although the inception of
red washed decoration is undetermined, this technique persisted un-

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

171

til the end of the Arenal sequence. The compact variety, Arenal
Variant, may be the result of more intensive firing techniques. The
temporal significance is undetermined.
A slightly later, locally manufactured pottery is provisional type
Santiago. It appears that this pottery was not manufactured until after linear incised pottery of provisional type Arenal was no longer
made.
Although no absolute dates can be associated with Arenal and Santiago pottery, correlation with intrusive types suggests that both
provisional types persisted later than A.D. 1200-1300.
The intrusive pottery includes Chalchihuites-like, Conchos, and E1
Paso Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome ceramics. A lengthy time span is
covered by these wares: A.D. 300 or 500 to A.D. 1800. The intrusive
pottery overlaps chronologically between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1350 but
there is no evidence that all three were introduced into the Charcos
de Risa during this time.
OTHER CERAMIC ARTIFACTS
Cylindrical pipe stems and a bowl fragment were found. Although
pipe stems have been reported from Durango (Mason 1937) and
Tamaulipas (MacNeish 1958) it is impossible to make cultural or temporal associations.
Other clay artifacts difficult to place within an absolute temporal
span are: clay balls and hemispheres, biconical spindle whorls, and
circular discs fashioned from potsherds. The paste of most of these
artifacts is comparable to the paste of Arenal pottery and probably
contemporaneous. One potsherd disc was made from a Santiago
sherd.
Four cylindrical clay figurines were found. Three specimens have
recognizable heads with facial features. One specimen has two legs,
no recognizable face and a possible arm, nose or breast. Based on
examples from southwestern Texas (Sharer 1975), the Charcos de
Risa specimens may represent three male and one female forms. By
association with dated projectile points, Sharer correlates several
southwestern Texas figurines with the Middle Archaic. Although
similar to the Texas specimens, none of the Charcos de Risa
specimens are identical and none have been found in the region between Texas and southwestern Coahuila. Thus, on the basis of the
small sample and lack of supportive comparisons, I am hesitant to
place the anthropomorphic figurines from the four sites within a
specific time period.
Numerous clay cylinders appear to be remnants of coils, figurines
or vessel legs. The paste of most specimens is identical to Arenal pot-

172

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

tery paste. This is additional evidence that Arenal pottery was
manufactured on the sites.
Daub specimens are the only evidence of constructed features such
as living structures or hearths. No associated pit or floor outlines
were found.

SHELL ARTIFACTS
Two categories of shell beads were recovered; circular and rectangular disc shaped, Marginella and 01ivella shells with removed
apexes. Similar specimens were found in nearby Cueva de la Candelaria (Aveleyra et al., 1956). Taylor (1966: 83-84) attributes these
and other elaborate materials from the Laguna region to the Mayran
Complex. He states that these artifacts may have some time depth and
persisted until approximately A.D. 1500.
The Marginella and 01ivella shells include Pacific and Gulf of
Mexico species. These, considered with intrusive pottery indicate
widespread external contacts.
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
Most of the historic artifacts are indistinguishable from articles
commonly used in the region today. However, two sherds of tinenameled ware are probably of 19th century origin. These may be
earlier because a mission was established in the Laguna during the
16th century (Griffen 1966).
FAUNAL REMAINS
Few faunal remains were recovered. These include gastropods,
species usually associated with standing water. Small mammals, deer
and bird skeletal material was also found. Little can be concluded
but, damper climatic conditions during parts of the past may be
indicated.
Cultural Processes in the Charcos de Risa
On the basis of the materials recovered from the four sites, the
Desierto de Charcos de Risa was occupied by prehistoric peoples
throughout a long time span extending from Late Paleo-Indian to
historic times. Undoubtedly, climatic conditions fluctuated through
ime but analysis of these changes is beyond the realm of this report.
The continuity of occupation of the four sites is undetermined. With
the exception of the Early Archaic Period there is no evidence that the
sites were or were not abandoned seasonally or for long periods of
time. During the Early Archaic the area mayhavebeen abandoned or

SOUTHWESTERN COAHUILA

173

suffered severe population depletion. The gap in the cultural sequence is based on negative evidence; lack of radiocarbon dates and
the absence of Early Barbed points which are markers of the Early
Archaic in southwestern Texas. We must not neglect the possibility
that other projectile point forms such as leaf-shaped stemless or contracting stemmed dart points occurred in southwestern Coahuila
during the Early Archaic or Altithermal times and that there is no gap
in the cultural sequence.
The archeological evidence indicates that during Archaic times the
inhabitants of the Desierto de Charcos de Risa were mobile hunters
and gatherers with no permanent settlements. The lifestyle was comparable to the lifestyle of Archaic peoples throughout arid northern
Mexico and adjacent Texas. Some of the inhabitants of the region
may have maintained an Archaic-like economy during post-Archaic
times. Locally manufactured pottery, spindle whorls, and inferences
from the historic records are evidence that some form of agriculture
may have been practiced during post-Archaic times. There is no
evidence of permanent settlements which suggests that dependence
on planted foodstuffs was marginal.
Outside contact is indicated by the presence of intrusive pottery
from the north, south and west although these items may have
reached the Charcos de Risa through a complex trade network. The
intrusive ceramics date the time of exterior contact between A.D. 300
or 500 to A.D. 1800.

Problems
There are numerous problems in Coahuila archeology today,
Nearly all can be attributed to two factors: (1) There are few written
reports and these contain little descriptive detail; (2) Few stratified
cultural deposits have been excavated.
1, It may be difficult or impossible to locate stratified deposits in
the future. Most cave deposits have been looted or mined. Surface
sites are subject to wind deflation and sheet erosion.
2, Climatic regimes are not well defined in this vast region.
Geochronological, paleobotanical and faunal analysis are needed.
3. There are discrepancies in the absolute dates between Texas
and northern Mexico although general artifact sequences seem consistent.
4. There is no confirmed evidence of man or his activities during
the Middle Archaic (Altithermal) period.
5. The projectile point sequence is not confirmed by stratigraphic
evidence. Major considerations are: the place of triangular points in

174

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

the temporal and spatial framework, the local development and intrusion of arrow points, and development of a model of lithic implement production and function reflecting changes in time and
space.
6. Lithic associations are restricted to projectile points. Little is
known about the other items in the lithic assemblage.
7. Although intrusive ceramics can be dated in a general manner,
specific dates and associations with local ceramics and other artifacts is conjectural.
8. Most artifact comparisons have been made with materials
recovered from Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and adjacent Texas.
Western and southern affiliations (Zacatecas, Durango, Chihuahua.
and southern Texas} have rarely been considered.
9. Several internal problems are specific to Coahuila. Burial practices are not conclusive; association between open site burial and
mortuary caves (such as Candelaria)are unknown. The sparse
evidence of Spanish influence is unsettling. Projectile point form
diversity between southwestern and central Coahuila is not
adequately described.

Closing Remarks
A general model of the cultural sequence in the Desierto de Charcos de Risa has been presented. A list of problems is included. These
are not all of the problems but they indicate the vast amount of
research still to be done. Hopefully, future investigations will answer
many of the questions posed and add much needed detail to the model
of prehistoric settlement in southwestern Coahuila.
