ABSTRACT
In August 2006, American Archaeology Group LLC conducted an archaeological
survey of 5,137 feet of a 50-foot right-of-way for the City of Temple’s proposed FM
2305 Wastewater Lines Project. The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey
supported by mechanical trenching. No archaeological sites were identified during the
survey. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area should be allowed to proceed as planned without archaeological monitoring.
No artifacts were recovered; therefore, no curation was arranged.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple proposes to construct a 5,137 foot wastewater line (with a rightof-way of 50 feet) in Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on the
Belton and Moffatt 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic quadrangle maps (Figure 2). The project area
begins east of the intersection of FM 2271 and FM 2305 and will be located eastward along
the north and south sides of FM 2305. The UTM coordinates for the approximate center of
the tract are Zone 14 Northing 3444306 and Easting 647162. The proposed wastewater line
will be approximately 15 feet below the surface. The project was funded by the City of
Temple and was conducted under the auspices of the Texas Antiquities Permit Number
4170 in order to comport with provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) in
anticipation of review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). A Research Design and
Scope of Work was prepared and submitted to the Texas Historical Commission along with
the Antiquities Permit Application (Appendix I).
The project area is located within the Brazos River drainage basin, one of the largest
rivers in the state. The nearest major drainage to the project area is a tributary of Cox’s
Hollow, which transects across the project area and eventually flows into the Leon River.
The elevation of the project area is between 657 feet and 700 feet above mean sea level
(amsl).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:112-116) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern
Texas. The size and location of this province is described below by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards
Plateau as limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4),
the Lampasas Cut Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as 1946
in Blair]), and the Central Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the
Edwards Plateau lying west of the Pecos, and often referred to as the
Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred instead to as the
Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west.
Bell County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been classified by
Thornwaite (1948) as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential
evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell County
is 34 inches, the January minimum temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum
temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and
Harris 1983).
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this
province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of
the region include Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus spp.),
sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata),
Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia
Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana).
Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian wildrye (Elymus
canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and
red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily overgrown with juniper
and mixed oaks and grasses.

Hydrology
The project area is located within the Brazos River drainage basin, one of the largest
rivers in the state. The nearest major drainage to the project area is the Leon River, now a
part of Belton Reservoir. The Leon River flows in a general north-south direction less than
500 meters to the east of the project area.
Wildlife
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province, which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding
provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon
(Prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo),
morning dove (Zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and
the bullsnake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).
Soils
There are two soil series in the study area depicted in Figure 2 and on sheet 28 of
the Soil Survey of Bell County, Texas (Huckabee et al. 1977), Purves silty clay (PrB),
and Tarrant Association (TAD). Both of the soils are in situ, residual soils. The Tarrant
Association and the Purves silty clay developed on the undivided lower Washita Group
(the lower Cretaceous Denton Clay, Fort Worth Limestone, and Duck Creek Limestone)
and the Edwards Limestone (Figure 3). Because of the soil forming process, both in situ
soils have a very low potential for buried intact assemblages of artifacts. The western
half of the survey area was on developed land. The surface of this area would have a low
to moderate potential for intact assemblages of artifacts due to construction and high
pedestrian traffic. The western half of the project has not been developed and may have a
higher potential for intact assemblages of artifacts.
The Purves series consists of gently sloping to sloping and undulating, clayey
soils on uplands. These very shallow to shallow, calcareous soils are underlain by
interbedded chalk, marl, and marly material weathered mainly from limestone of the
lower Washita Group. Purves soil solum is 20 to 51 centimeters thick. The A horizon,
mostly eroded or deflated in the study area, is dark brown, dark grayish brown, to very
dark grayish brown silty clay. The horizon is calcareous and moderately alkaline with
moderate to strong fine to medium sub angular blocky structure and fine granular
structure in the lower horizon. The horizon contains up to 35 percent by volume
limestone fragments and flagstones. The underlying material, R horizon, is a hard,
nodular, limestone (Huckabee et al. 1977).

The Tarrant series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, undulating to
rolling, clayey soils on the uplands. In the study area, Tarrant soils develop on
interbedded chalk, marl, and marly material weathered mainly from limestone of the
lower Washita Group. The Tarrant soil solum is 15 to 51 centimeters thick. The A
horizon is dark brown, dark grayish brown, to very dark grayish brown silty clay. The
horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline with fine to medium sub angular blocky
structure and 40 to 80 percent limestone fragments and flagstones throughout. Some
limestone fragments up to one foot in diameter were encountered. The underlying
material of the R horizon is limestone bedrock.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most
archaeologists and is rich in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have been prepared
by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell
counties, Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et
al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site
(Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967).
Summaries of the region have been published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt
(1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were
published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. These works,
entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by Michael B. Collins (1995) and
"Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas Archeological Region" by
Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major
synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following discussion is
taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although, according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
"Paleoindian," it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian
typically refers to those cultures, which were oriented toward big game hunting with food
collecting not a major pursuit. Eileen Johnson (1977:65-77) states that it has been
erroneously stereotyped as a migratory systematic big game procurement adaptation. Collins
(1995:381) argues that subsistence in Clovis times, for example, Paleoindians exploited a
diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and
horse but also included smaller animals such as water turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice,
badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rockshelter, a paved floor suggests that the inhabitants of
this site returned to the same site as part of a regular hunting and gathering strategy in
contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game. It is, therefore, assumed that an
array of plants presumably also constituted part of Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins
et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have been
excavated. As of 1985, for example, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell
County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of
surface collected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, this period is
represented by distinctive projectile points found in multicomponent surface sites and as
isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from
about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart point types
Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by Suhm and Jelks
(1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).
7

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be
more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some
rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a
considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in Central
Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is
the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985). Collins (1999) reported on the
Gault Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still being studied.
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period, which lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to
Prewitt (1981:71), "The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas."
Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987) has
questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases
occurring before the Middle Archaic. These have been grouped into Early, Middle, Late,
and Terminal periods by Carlson et al. (1986:15).
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a "strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was
of low density." This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases
(8500 B.P. - 5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very
specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds
(Prewitt 1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during the
Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000 B.P. - 2600 B.P.). An
overall decrease in burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic. Bison were
important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600
B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The Terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al.
(1986), includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. - 1250 B.P.). An
increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seems to have
occurred during Prewitt's (1981:82) Driftwood phase.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al.
1954), Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Technological changes are the primary distinguishing characteristics of this stage. The
Austin (1250 B.P. - 650 B.P.) and Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this stage of
prehistory. During this time arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics and possibly
horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that only the bow and arrow
appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture developed last
and was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering, a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are
8

referred to as early and late by Collins (1995:385) with the break between the long-standing
Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period occurring at circa 800 B.P. when Toyah
replaced Austin as the prevailing archeological manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the
southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah phase but not during the
preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples
had virtually disappeared. The early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the late
17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Bell County is situated within
the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the 16th Century
(Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the Comanche and
Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They have been
described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers and who lived
along the streams and rivers of Central Texas.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including
the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is
known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and
subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key animal
resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by
the occurrence of glass beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European
manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell
County. In adjacent Coryell County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at
41CV1, a group burial along the Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has
been reported as an isolated find on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell
County (Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who settled
along Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836,
reoccupied, and deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The early
settlements were constantly harassed by hostile Indians and, although several forts were
established, by 1838 all settlers had left the county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians suffered a
decisive defeat at what is referred to as the "Famous Bird Creek Fight" about one and a half
miles northwest of the present site of Temple, Texas. However, settlement did not return to
the Bell County area until after 1843.

9

Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell.
Nolan Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December 16,
1851 the name was changed to Belton. Early settlement was along the creeks and rivers.
William Pepper and his family were living on the west side of present-day Kegley Road
when the 1850 census was taken. The Kegleys, Carpenters, and others settled near Pepper
Creek during the 1850s, and some members of these early families are buried at Eulogy
Cemetery. Early histories of Bell County refer frequently to the Shallowford Crossing on
the Leon River as an important transportation route for wagon traffic. The exact location of
this crossing has not been identified, but it substantiates the importance of this part of Bell
County during its early settlement. By 1860, most of the land had been taken. The last
serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem apparently resolved,
settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to 20,518
in 1880. The number of farms in the county increased from 640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871,
and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural region with cotton and corn the
leading crops. The construction of Fort Hood led to a population increase in the county
from 44,863 in 1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and Bell
County Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These include articles in
the form of bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at
TARL or with society members. Bell County has been the subject of intensive
investigations by members of the Central Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the
above-mentioned investigations, "Bell County is one of the better known Central Texas
counties and has provided significant information toward the understanding of prehistoric
chronologies in this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners
and artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Bell and
Coryell Counties. Also present are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do
not provide information concerning author and date of preparation. Information regarding
previous work in other parts of Bell and Coryell Counties appear in the various references
cited above, especially the Fort Hood series.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the project
area. Recent surveys in the nearby Temple, Texas area by Bradle and Moore (1998),
Moore, Bradle and Nordt (1996a, 1996b); Moore and Bradle (1996) recorded 8 prehistoric
and historic sites on Pepper Creek, 2 sites (1 prehistoric and 1 historic) on Fryers Creek, and
1 site containing prehistoric and historic materials on an unnamed tributary that flows into
Bird Creek. Three of these sites (41BL1066, 41BL1069, 41BL1070) have been subjected to
Phase II testing (Bradle et al. 1997).
An archeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and treatment
improvement in 1982 and 1984 by the Texas Department of Water Resources (Fox and
Whitsett 1984) recorded eight prehistoric sites prehistoric sites (41BL259 - 41BL264 and
41BL278 - 41BL279). According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some site-specific
investigations have been done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but as yet detailed
archeological investigations have not been conducted in the Temple-Belton area." Except
for testing at 41BL260 by Wayne C. Young (1987) of the Texas State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation, Highway Design Division (now Texas Department of
Transportation) in 1987, and the three tested sites mentioned above, no additional sitespecific investigations were identified during the literature search for this project.
There are no previously recorded sites within one kilometer of the project area.
However, within two kilometers of the project are sites 41BL33, 41BL55, 41BL172,
41BL304 and 41BL972. East of the current project area are sites 41BL1065, 41BL1066,
41BL1071, and 41BL1072. These were reported by Moore et al. (1996a) and subsequent
testing at 41BL1066 by Bradle et al. (1996) reported a C14 date of 1280+-70 BP from one
hearth, thus determining it was a Late Prehistoric occupation.
Bell County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks.
11

However, certain sections of the county have not been adequately investigated. The current
project area falls within this category. There is reason to believe that a large number of
unrecorded sites exist along the major streams of this area in the form of surface sites,
possible rockshelter sites, and buried sites. The reader is advised to consult the Fort Hood
series and other sources mentioned above for more specific investigations in other parts of
the county.

12

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for
previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports
documenting work in the region were examined for information concerning archaeological
surveys and other work relevant to the project area. The project was discussed with
representatives of the City of Temple and Kasberg Patrick & Associates LP.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method supported by
backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was excellent over much of the project area. The
excellent ground surface exposure is due to erosion and intensive farming activities over the
years since the proposed project is on private property and parallels the property fences.
In addition to intensive surface inspection, twenty-three (23) backhoe trenches were
excavated in order to provide a more expansive view of subsurface soil deposits and all were
negative (Appendix II). A sample of matrix from the backhoe trenches was screened using
one-quarter inch hardware cloth in addition to observing all back dirt. No cultural material
was encountered in any of the backhoe trenches. One shovel test was excavated where the
backhoe could not access, and it was negative (Appendix III). Additionally, nearby creek
bank exposures afforded opportunities to look for any observable subsurface deposits. No
cultural materials or deposits were observed along the creek bank.

13

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area.
Large-scale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort Hood
have recorded the vast majority of sites in Bell and Coryell Counties (see Archaeological
Background and Previous Investigations above). Recent projects by American Archaeology
Group LLC (AAG) personnel have provided the majority of new data regarding prehistoric
and historic utilization of the general project area (see Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey did not identify any archaeological sites within the project area. It is
concluded that the project area is not an area that was not considered suitable for habitation
by prehistoric groups, most probably due to the recent age of the soil development. Even
though parts of the project area were probably utilized in some way during historic times, no
specific evidence that would constitute a site was found. Overall, the area is very disturbed
from erosion and plowing and contains shallow soils in many places, one meter or less in
depth. Should any sites be present, the possibility for significant research potential is
considered low. The average depth of all backhoe trenches (BHT) was 40.86 centimeters
below ground surface.

14

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the proposed FM 2305 Wastewater Lines Project in Bell
County, Texas performed for the City of Temple did not identify any historic or prehistoric
sites in the project area. American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) recommends that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that buried cultural
materials can be missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites be located
during the construction of this project, all work within the site area should cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, in
consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC and the City of Temple.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will
contact the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by
telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the
project area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since
A.A.G. has conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD)
of the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities
permit will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed.
Normally, A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any
fieldwork. This is done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work
required for this project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded
and disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Michael R.
Bradle will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe
trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by
the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for
buried cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in
areas of high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will
be screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to
sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried
sites, select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be
subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in
the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through
the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the
22

official State of Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work
outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on
a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL,
unless a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has
been approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be
delivered to AD-THC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes,
photographs, site forms, and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a
work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before
entering the field.

III.

Obtain an antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with the representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing,
and examination of all exposed areas such as creek banks for buried or displaced
artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with
deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for
review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit the final report and
turn in the artifacts for curation.
