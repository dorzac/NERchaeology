EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Gators DU #1H
well pad location and the associated lease road located in southeastern Shelby County, Texas.
This cultural resources investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to
Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc. The purpose of this document is
to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of
obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as
amended, and other cultural resources legislation.
Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records search to identify previous cultural
resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological and historic sites recorded by those
efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface investigations via the excavation of
screened shovel tests and the examination of exposed soil profiles. Fieldwork for this project was
conducted on 15 January and 7 May 2010.
This survey encountered no significant cultural resources in the project area. Construction of the
Gators DU #1H well pad and the associated lease road will have no adverse effect on any
significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended. In the unlikely event that any cultural materials are
inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction, use, or maintenance of the well
pad, all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission and the Bureau of
Land Management should be notified of the discovery.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.00.05.02), under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services,
LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc., for the proposed Gators DU #1H well pad and associated lease road
(Bureau of Land Management [BLM] Lease No. TX NM 108073). The proposed project area is
located near the headwaters of Bell Creek in southcentral Shelby County, Texas (Figure 1). The
Shelbyville, Texas, is located approximately 6.3 km (3.9 mi) to the north. The landscape
encompassing the proposed project area consists of pasture immediately adjacent to the Sabine
National Forest.
The Gators DU #1H project area consists of a 7.46-acre well pad to be shared with the Bearcats
DU #1H well and an associated lease road right-of-way. The initial design included a 2,866Â­
linear-foot right-of-way (ROW) extending east-to-west along the southern property boundary and
turning north at the southwest property corner (see Figure 1). This option was modified in favor
of a 2,612-linear-foot ROW sited to avoid adverse impacts to National Forest property to the
south and wetland areas in the southwest corner of the property. The total area to be
encompassed by the project is 9.81 acres. This proposed infrastructure will be constructed on
private property owned by James Lynn Busbee of Lufkin, Texas. The mineral rights, however,
are the possession of the BLM, and this project is therefore under the oversight of that agency.
This work was conducted under BLM Cultural Use Permit No. 103-2920-06-X for review by the
BLM Field Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Fieldwork for this project was initially conducted on 15 January 2010 by Geo-Marine Project
Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Staff Archeologist Lindsey Skelton. Due to
modifications to the final position and orientation of the proposed lease road, additional cultural
resources survey was conducted on 7 May 2010. Melissa Green served as the project Principal
Investigator throughout the process of this investigation. As per BLM cultural resources survey
requirements, a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was surveyed around the proposed well pad
location, and a 50-ft-wide (15 meter [m]) buffer was included along the proposed lease road
alternatives. This resulted in the cultural resources survey of approximately 25.2 acres for this
project.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The proposed project area is located on an interfluves between Morrison Creek and an unnamed
tributary of Bell Creek in the southcentral portion of Shelby County in East Texas. The project
area is situated in the Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). The soils
of the region are derived from in situ weathering of the underlying Wilcox Formation (Griffith
2006). This area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943).
Often referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960), this region once supported a diverse
variety of flora and fauna.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Shelby County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas. This
region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the stratified shales and
sandstones of the Wilcox Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is
located within the Tertiary Uplands subregion of the South Central Plains in the Sabine River
basin. The proposed project area is situated on a southeastern-facing slope of an interfluve
(Figure 2) at an elevation range of 80ï­92 m (262â302 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) on slopes
of 0â20 percent.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is within the Sabine River basin. Numerous unnamed, small-order drainages
extend across the floodplains and rolling uplands of the area, creating a complex network of
streams, swamps, and sloughs. The proposed project area is located largely on a southeast-facing
interfluvial slope between Morrison Creek and an unnamed tributary of Bell Creek (see Figure 2).
Bell Creek joins Beauchamp Creek, a tributary of Tenaha Creek, approximately 7.5 km (4.7 mi)
to the north.

SOILS
The Gators DU #1H project area is situated across four soil series and one soil complex (see
Figure 2, Table 1). The soils mapped in the project area are typically slowly permeable fine
sandy loams. Soil textures range from very fine sandy loams to fine sandy loams. These soils are
derived from in situ weathering of the underlying clastic and carbonate bedrock of the Eoceneage Wilcox Formation. All information regarding the soils of the project area has been
synthesized and summarized from information supplied by the Soil Conservation Service
(Griffith 2006) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (2010).

Meth Series
Meth series soils are classified as fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs. These soils
are well drained but moderately slowly permeable and formed in weakly loamy and clayey
upland sediments of Tertiary age. The surface layer typically consists of dark yellowish brown
fine sandy loam 8 centimeters (cm; 3 inches [in]) thick underlain by an E horizon of brown fine
sandy loam, which might range from 18â30 cm (7â12 in) below surface. Fragments of ironstone
are common in these horizons. A series of red clay Bt horizons overlaying a BC horizon at
116ï­158 cm (46ï­62 in) below surface is typical.

Maben Series
Maben soils are classified as fine, mixed, active, thermic Ultic Hapludalfs. These soils are well
drained but moderately slowly permeable and formed in thinly stratified sandy to clayey
sediments and soft shale or laminar clays on slopes of 2ï­60 percent. The surface layer typically
consists of dark brown fine sandy loam 13 centimeters (5 in) thick underlain by yellowish red Bt
horizons of clay loam to around 58 cm (23 in) below surface. A red loamy B/C horizon
overlaying a C horizon at 104ï­152 cm (41ï­60 in) below surface is typical.

5

Latex Series
Latex soils are classified as fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Glossic Paleudalfs. These
soils are moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy Pleistocene-age
sediments over clayey Tertiary-age deposits on upland terraces. The surface layer consists of a
thin, brown fine sandy loam A horizon over a thin, brown fine sandy loam E horizon followed by
a series on Bt and Bt/E horizons.

Owentown Series
Owentown series soils are classified as coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Oxyaquic
Dystrudepts. Formed in loamy alluvium along streams, these soils are moderately well drained
and moderately permeable. The surface layer consists of a thin A horizon composed of dark
yellowish brown loamy fine sand over a series of yellowish brown, brownish yellow, and brown
loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam Bw horizons.

Metcalf-Sawtown Complex
The Metcalf-Sawtown complex consists of intermingled areas of the well-drained fine sandy
loams of the Sawtown series and the relatively poorly drained silt loams of the Metcalf series.
Metcalf series soils are classified as fine to silty, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Glossaquic
Paleudalfs, and the Sawtown series are fine to loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Typic
Glossudalfs. Both series exhibit an A-E-Bt horizon sequence. Based on subsurface
investigations in the Mean Green DU #1H project area, soils of the Sawtown series appear to be
the most widespread soils at this location. The surface layer consists of brown very fine sandy
loam underlain by a light yellowish brown very fine sandy loam E horizon and a series of loamy
Bt horizons ranging from strong brown to brownish yellow with depth.

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine and Angelina rivers support a
diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous aquatic
vertebrates and invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae) and 104 species of
freshwater fish (Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically,
include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black
bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Elmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
6

sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Shortleaf (Pinus echinata), longleaf (P. palustris), and
loblolly pine (P. taeda) are the three native species of southern yellow pine. Uplands may harbor
certain hardwoods, such as post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
Bottomlands near rivers and other major drainages are most often dominated by native
bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q. nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q.
nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N.
sylvatica), and sweetgum. Dense understory growth may often be found in forest areas in the
form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica
cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum
rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive species such as Chinese tallow (Triadica
sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), and soda apple (Solanum viarum) have
become well established throughout the Pineywoods as well. Much of the general area is
managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 135 centimeters (cm; 53 inches [in]),
primarily as rainfall distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature
recorded in nearby Center, Texas, is around 27 degrees Celsius (Â°C; 80Â°Fahrenheit [F]), and the
average winter temperature is 8Â°C (47Â°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0Â°C (32Â°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The following chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native
American cultural chronology and Euro-American history of Northeast Texas. Given the size of
the region and the depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this
chapter must necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the
information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas draws
from previous summaries by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985,
1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). A generalized cultural sequence for the Northeast
Texas culture area is outlined in Table 2.

Paleoindian (Â±10,000â7000 B.C.)
Evidence suggests human migration into the northeastern Texas region by approximately 10,000â
9500 B.C., although the exact timing and nature of the arrival is the subject of some dispute. In
Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile point styles, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988:17). Unfortunately, however, few Paleoindian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and those that have
received any sort of systematic excavation are scarce.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize settlement mobility and intensity of site occupation,
drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on comparisons with other
areas. The people of this period are often characterized as living in small bands of highly mobile
hunter-gatherers, specializing in the hunting of now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. For instance,
a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of group mobility in the broad
distribution of Paleoindian artifacts over the landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal

lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story
1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large megafauna by Paleoindians in
the western United States, coupled with the known presence of similar species in Northeast Texas
between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has
resulted in the popular conclusion that âbig game huntingâ was part of the Paleoindian
subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association between a Clovis point
and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support this likelihood,
increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that Paleoindian
groups were less dependent upon âbig game huntingâ than has been assumed in the past. A more
accurate view of Paleoindian life likely includes use of a much wider array of resources (Ferring
1989).
The late Paleoindian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate point styles that appear to be part of a
more western or âplains-derivedâ subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes
Dalton and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389â391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed âheavy, woodworking tool,â to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleoindian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
9

in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic (Â±7000â200 B.C.)
With the end of Pleistocene glaciation, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop
into populations of efficient hunter-gatherers exploiting localized resource bases. This period,
and the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become termed the âArchaicâ period.
Representing a significant period of time (approximately 6,800 years), this period is characterized
by gradual changes in subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. Archaic
populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and gatherers with more limited
geographic ranges than the preceding Paleoindian peoples. At the present time, there is no
evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic period in Texas, although this
is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates on
the basis of cross-correlation with more confidently dated and stratified sites in surrounding areas.
Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to
2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this
portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985,
1990). Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with later
material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981). General trends have been proposed that characterize
the Archaic period in Northeast Texas as (1) increasing development of complex settlement
system, (2) increasing population size and density, (3) increasing sedentism, and (4) development
of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988:17; Story 1985:52). Despite these changes, however,
no evidence of any level of horticulture has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site
(Perttula 1988:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food
production were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347â349; Watson
1988).

Early Ceramic/Woodland (200 B.C.âA.D. 800)
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.âA.D. 800)ârepresenting the introduction of ceramics into
the Northeast Texas regionâis generally not well defined and is largely identified by similarities
in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche Maline tradition north of the Red River
(recent overviews that provide good information for this period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic artifacts consist of coarse plainware
ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary projectile points. The ceramics
generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the wide range of temporal and
spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or more undefined varieties of
that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the remains of the Early Ceramic
period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to Schambachâs (1982:188) Fourche
Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities to Fourche Maline, however, no Early
10

Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas portion of the Great Bend. The few that
are known in East Texas occur in the southern Sabine and Neches river basins around the Toledo
Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story 1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48;
on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana) and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites
(Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of such evidence in Northeast Texas
leaves open the question of whether or not this area was undergoing the same processes of
cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development of burial mound use elsewhere
(see Perttula 1988:18; Story 1990).

Formative (A.D. 800â1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000â1200)
The Formative (A.D. 800â1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000â1200) periods in the Great BendÂ­
Neches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Conversely, in the Cypress Creek region, Caddo
occupation of the area is well documented from ca. A.D. 800 to the period of historic contact. For
detailed cultural and chronological information, consult Thurmondâs (1990) treatise on the
archeology of the Cypress Creek Basin.
The Formative and Early Caddo periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from the Coles Creek culture to the
east and appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new
characteristics (Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan
arrow points), new ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode
of vessel decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize,
led to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988:18â19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas,
including the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
known as Hudnall-Pirtle, site 41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site
with six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddo
component of this site likely indicates an immigrant group from the middle Sabine River area,
possibly the Bivins-Flanagan area, arriving prior to ca. A.D. 900 (Story 1990:325).

Middle Caddo (A.D. 1200â1400)
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200â1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data largely from C. B.
Mooreâs excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities from
the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who were
accompanied by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26). This phase was centered
in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas also fall
within its peripheral influence. Haley phase components are recognized at the Hatchel site in
Bowie County (Davis 1970:44). Other Haley components, including the Cabe Mounds site
(Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site (Cliff et al. 1997), are known in the area. Coker
Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based on radiocarbon dates and a
reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula et al. 1997:17â20). Despite its
presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was apparently most fully elaborated in the
Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Perttula and
Rogers 2007), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, and Tyson (41SY92) in
the Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the
EarlyâMiddle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24â25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
burial sites, and the larger centers were important civic-ceremonial areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granary structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex socioÂ­
political extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to the late A.D. 1200s, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the eastâwest Caddo Trace and the
northâsouth Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to the George C. Davis site, which was essentially
abandoned by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24â29).

Late Caddo (A.D. 1400â1680)
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400â1680) includes the conclusion of the prehistoric period and
the initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish entrada
apparently entered Northeast Texas ca. 1542, and the latter part of this period appears to have
overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and traders
into northeastern Texas. Numerous archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, several of which overlap their spheres of influence into the Sabine River. The
Bossier phase, though centered on the Great Bend region of Arkansas, has been identified in the
Sabine River valley (Dieste et al. 1985:2â20; Gadus and Howard 1988:31). The Titus phase
appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast Texas Pineywoods
and post-oak savanna. The Bossier, Titus, and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by
small hamlets or farmsteads that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting
agriculturalists. These farmsteads are apparently characterized by a limited number of structures
12

and a small family cemetery (see Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks
1961; Perttula 1988; Wormser 1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more
permanent suprahousehold sites, including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which
served to integrate the scattered households into a unified social group.

Historic Native American Period (A.D. 1680â1860)
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680â1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding of the
short-lived French colony Fort Saint Louis by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, on the
Texas coast and ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing
decades of the seventeenth century, French explorers, such as Henri de Tonti, Jean Baptiste Le
Moyne de Bienville, and Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, traveled through the upper Red River
valley and made contact with the Native Americans residing in the area. The primary Native
American groups inhabiting the Great BendâNeches/Angelina region at that time consisted of
Caddoan speakers, presumably descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far
back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan populations were divided very generally into the Kadohadacho
in the Great Bend area north of the Sulphur River and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina River
region south of the Sabine River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groupsâthe Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoche, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo TerÃ¡n de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the earlier Hernando de Soto entrada (cf., Smith
1989).
The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainai,
Nabedache, Nacogdoche, Nasoni, Nadaco, Neche, Nacono, Nechaui, and Nacao, but membership
apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization pertaining
especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a relatively weak
social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate chiefs of each tribe
and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males inherited these offices,
females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the female line.
RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. By the late 1600s, a
regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In 1690, the Spanish
established missions in the Hasinai areaâSan Francisco de los Tejas and SantÃ­simo Nombre de
MarÃ­aâbut abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to comply with Spanish
attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46â49). In response to St. Denisâs 1714
French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were established in 1716âa
second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River, and two in the main
13

villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n, likely on the Angelina River)
and the Nacogdoche (Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La NaÃ±a) (Swanton
1942:46â49). In 1779, a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River moved into the
Nacogdoches area, and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the Deshazo site.
These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to emigrate westward to the
prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control of Louisiana,
only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase. The area
was now open for American immigration, which effectively forced the remaining Hasinai to
move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian Territory in Oklahoma in
1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71â88).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The initial European penetration into the general area of East Texas occurred in the middle of the
sixteenth century (ca. 1542; Table 3) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish
entrada, led by LuÃ­s de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Sotoâs death, entered Texas, probably
somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas, in their attempt to
reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). In 1690, the Spanish
introduced the first of their missionsâwith the goal of eradicating the indigenous religions and
Christianizing the native populationsâin the Hasinai area of East Texas, but abandoned them in
1693 after failing to convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46â49).

The earliest French presence in Texas was led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who
established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the Texas coast in present-day Victoria County (Davis
and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), followed later by Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis, who in 1714 set up a trading post at Natchitoches in present-day Louisiana, and by BÃ©nard
de la Harpe, who in 1719 began his trading post, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, in present-day
Bowie County (Harper 2002). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the
decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of buffer missions and presidios in present-day
East Texas and Louisiana (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46â49). When
France and Spain went to war over the issue, the French forced the Spanish to abandon the area
14

(Newcomb 1961:288). However, after the truce in 1721, the French withdraw from Texas, and
the Spanish reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
After briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it to the United States in 1803 as part
of the Louisiana Purchase.
Following the sale of Louisiana in 1803, the United States considered most of Texas to be part of
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). The
area to become Shelby County was known at that time as a refuge for outlaws and fugitives
because of its proximity to the âneutral ground,â a disputed area between Spanish and American
territories until 1806 (Coleman et al. 1984; Neill 1950). The first official American exploration
of the region was by the Freeman-Custis Expedition in 1806 (Flores 1984). The earliest settlers
were largely subsistence farmers residing on small holdings, confined to the areas immediately
adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the prairies along river
tributaries and early roads such as Daytonâs Road and Trammelâs Trace (LaGrone 2008). By
1818, John Latham, the first Anglo-American resident of Shelby County, had settled in the
southeastern portion of the area (Harper 2009).
After Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government first organized
Shelby County as part of the Nacogdoches Municipality and established Nashville as the county
seat in 1824 (Coleman et al. 1984; Harper 2009). For the most part, East Texas was beyond the
direct range of the 1835â1836 battles for Texas independence that took place primarily in South
and Central Texas. In 1836, the Congress of the Republic of Texas officially named Shelby
County after Isaac Shelby, a Revolutionary War hero and governor of Kentucky (Coleman et al.
1984:19; Harper 2009). By 1847, the county population had grown to approximately 3,500
residents (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009).
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on 29 December 1845, entering the union as the
twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Shelby County came from other
Southern states and thus introduced large-scale agriculture, livestock raising, and slavery (Harper
2009), although slave ownership was not predominant in Shelby County. After the presidential
election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession, since the sympathies of most of the AngloAmerican residents of Texas lay with the South. On 1 February 1861, Texas became part of the
Confederate States of America (Harper 2009). Shelby County wholeheartedly supported the war
effort of the Confederacy (Harper 2009), with an estimated 750 men from Shelby County serving
in either Texas or Confederate army units (Harper 2009). The defeat of the Confederacy in 1865
brought about the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation
system, a distressed economy, and the presence of a Union army of occupation (Harper 2009).
After the Civil War, the large plantations were broken up and partially sold off to speculators and
investors, and the majority of former slaves and poor whites became sharecroppers (Harper
2009). The town of Center officially became the Shelby County seat in 1866 and currently
retains this title (Harper 2009). After 1870, as the population began to gradually increase and the
railroads arrived, the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war. The lumber
industry began to grow (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009) as railroads allowed transportation
of lumber from timber-rich Polk, Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and
Nacogdoches counties. Small towns along the rail routes and sawmills to process this lumber
sprang up throughout these East Texas counties (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824), but small,
owner-operated farming continued to be important. By 1940 agriculture and population began a
slow, steady increase (Harper 2009), even though the population of Shelby County declined after
15

World War II. However, by 1970, the population again rose after the Sabine River Authority was
created in 1950 and Toledo Bend Reservoir was dedicated in 1960 (Coleman et al. 1984:22).
Leading the present economy of Shelby County are sawmills and timber/lumber-related industries
as well as farming and lignite coal, sand, oil, and gas production (Harper 2009). The Sabine
National Forest also currently contributes to the economy by attracting recreational tourism and
through lumber, grazing, hunting, and oil production (Harper 2009; Miller and Tull 1984).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
proposed project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and shovel test excavations undertaken using the field methods
described in this chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on
National Register of Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Â§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted.
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources survey has been conducted
within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. This survey was conducted in 1982 by the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service within the Sabine National
Forest 0.6 km (0.4 mi) south of the proposed project area. Further details regarding this survey
are not available. One cultural resource, the historic period McWilliams Cemetery, is located
0.8 km (0.5 mi) northeast of the proposed project area and will not be adversely affected by it.
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These
materials include historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record
cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography.

17

Based on a review of these historic records and previously recorded archeological site locations,
it is evident that the area has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more
recent records, however, indicates that the substantial development has occurred in recent years,
altering much of the historic landscape. Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of nearby
previously recorded cultural resources with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils
suggests that prehistoric occupation of the area was typically confined to stream valleys. Historic
period habitation within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century, but settlement
increased markedly during the twentieth century.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Gators DU #1H well pad project area had a low probability of containing cultural materials.
Given the amount of groundcover, the recent silviculture, and the nature of archeological sites in
the region, it was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to
visual inspection and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to
adequately survey the area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30â40 cm (11.8â15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated systematically across the proposed
project area to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft), to the extent of Holocene deposits, or until an obstruction
such as the water table or fragipan was encountered. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXTâ¢ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process. Areas that were inundated, waterlogged, or completely disturbed by features
such as roads, stock ponds, or other construction were systematically investigated and
documented, but not shovel-tested. Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g.,
cutbanks), were also examined for cultural materials as they were encountered during survey. As
per BLM cultural resources survey requirements, a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was
surveyed around the proposed well pad location, and a 50-ft-wide (20-m) buffer was surveyed
along lease road alternatives. This resulted in the cultural resources survey of approximately 25.2
acres for this project.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The recognition of a âsiteâ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural items of at least two different
materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 20-m [66-ft] area); the
extent of the surface material is then defined at the site boundary. When artifacts are encountered
18

in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In
cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation shovel tests are placed
to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and delineate a site are typically
placed at intervals of 10â20 m (33â66 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in each of the cardinal
directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or the project area
boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are encountered and
contain at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is then defined within the extent of positive
shovel tests.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas
Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL)
to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database. Conversely, the discovery of
cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past
human activity and are simply documented by location and content; likewise, historic-era
material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only
location and content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. An isolated find is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of its
failure to meet site definition and its insignificance in contributing to the archeological record.

National Register of Historic Places Eligibility Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [aâd]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a âhistoric
property.â Federal regulations state that âThe term âeligible for inclusion in the National
Registerâ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (aâd)].

19

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to meet to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Gators DU #1H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management
considerations and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the
final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources investigation has been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area and one historic period cemetery, the
McWilliams Cemetery, been documented within the search radius. The McWilliams Cemetery is
located approximately 0.8 km (0.5 mi) to the northeast of the project area. The proposed Gators
DU #1H project will have no adverse effect on this cemetery. Archival research focused on the
historic period settlement in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The 1863 von Rosenberg
map of the Sabine River valley indicates that several family farms and small communities existed
across the region at that time. The proposed Gators DU #1H project area is located to the
southwest of the former McWilliams farm along the San Augustine Road, present-day Highway
147. By the mid-twentieth century dispersed rural communities had been established across the
region but none were documented historically within the proposed project area.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed Gators DU #1H well pad location and its associated lease road were intensively
investigated to determine the presence of cultural resources using a combined technique of
systematic visual reconnaissance and the excavation of screened shovel tests. Investigations
adhered to BLM cultural resources survey requirements pertaining to minimum buffer areas (see
Chapter 4). Initially, the proposed well pad area and lease road were investigated on 15 January
2010. After the initial survey, the lease road was modified to avoid adverse effects to adjacent
National Forest property as well as wetlands within the corridor of an unnamed tributary of Bell
Creek. It was also reported that earth-moving activities had inadvertently begun at this location.
Additional cultural resources survey efforts were carried out on 7 May 2010 to adequately assess
21

modifications to the lease road and inspect the impact of the construction activities at this
location. In total, approximately 25.2 acres were investigated and 21 shovel tests were excavated
as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3).
The proposed Gators DU #1H well pad location is situated on the southeastern slope of a
dissected interfluve between Morrison Creek and an unnamed tributary of Bell Creek (Figure 4).
The associated lease road crosses several minor interfluvial slopes along the southern property
boundary (Figure 5). Vegetation within the project area consists primarily of pasture grasses with
a wooded riparian corridor along the unnamed tributary of Bell Creek. An earthen stock tank and
dam are located immediately east of the proposed well pad (Figure 6). Eighteen shovel tests
(Shovel Tests [STs] 1â18) were excavated and two areas of exposed soil were profiled during the
initial investigations (see Figure 3). Soils encountered in shovel tests on the minor interfluvial
ridges along the lease road corridor consisted primarily of thin (4â10 cm [2â4 in]) thick dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam with redoximorphic concreations overlying a reddish
yellow (7.5YR 7/6) or light yellowish brown (10YR6/4) fine sandy loam over red (2.5YR 5/8)
clay. Soils encountered in shovel test excavations on the margins of the proposed well pad
consisted of a thin layer of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam to a depth of approximately 12
cm (4.7 in) below surface (bs), below which red clay loam was common. Some areas within the
central portion of the landform exhibited a mantle of brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam
gradually transitioning to a yellowish (10YR 7/6) sandy loam with depth. A single artifact,
consisting of a pale yellowish brown chert projectile point base, was recorded along the eroded
bank of the stock tank (Figure 7).
This projectile point fragment, designated as Isolate 1, was located along the eroding bank of the
stock tank. Systematic inspection of the area and the excavation of three shovel tests in 1-m (3.3â
ft) intervals in the cardinal directions around the artifact encountered no additional artifacts or
cultural features. The soil profile of these adjacent shovel tests consisted of brown (7.5YR 4/3)
fine sandy loam to a depth of approximately 18 cm (7 in) overlying red (2.5 YR 4/8) clay.
Exhibiting incurvate blade edges, expanding barbs, fine pressure-flaking, and a rounded or
bulbous base, Isolate 1 is suggestive of arrow point styles designated as the Alba, Homan, and
Hayes styles in northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma (Figure 8). These point styles are
described as the Alba Cluster by Justice (1995:235â237) and are all temporally diagnostic of the
Late Prehistoric period, circa 1000â1300 AD, in the region. In the absence of additional artifacts,
Isolate 1 does not meet the criteria for archeological site designation. In addition, this artifact
does not contribute significant information regarding the Late Prehistoric period in the region and
this location is therefore not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The location of this temporally
diagnostic artifact has been documented, and no further work is recommended.
Additional cultural resources survey efforts were carried out on 7 May 2010 at the proposed
Gators DU #1H location to adequately assess modifications to the proposed lease road and to
inspect the impact of the construction activities that had taken place. In the interval between the
two visits, a pipeline had been constructed parallel to the proposed lease road (Figure 9) and a
significant amount of fill had been deposited at the proposed well pad location (Figure 10). The
area exposed by the construction of the pipeline was systematically inspected for artifacts or other
cultural features. The majority of the lease road ROW had not shifted significantly and did not
warrant additional shovel-testing, however three additional shovel tests (STs 19â21; see Figure 3)
were excavated along the westernmost portion of the lease road where modifications to its layout
did warrant additional cultural resources survey. Areas exposed during the construction of the

proposed Gators DU #1H well pad were also inspected for artifacts or other cultural features.
Finally, the location of IF 1 was revisited. No additional artifacts or other cultural features were
observed in any of these locations. This cultural resources survey encountered no cultural
resources, as defined under 30 CFR 60.4, within the project area. The area affected by the
proposed Gators DU #1H well pad and associated lease road holds a very low probability of
containing significant cultural resources.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within a
25.2-acre area for the proposed Gators DU #1H well pad and associated lease road and to provide
adequate and relevant information for use in the management of cultural resources within the
project area. One previously recorded cultural resource site within the vicinity of the project area,
the historic McWilliams Cemetery, is located approximately 0.8 km (0.5 mi) to the northeast of
the project area and will not be adversely affected by any of the proposed construction activities
associated with this project. This intensive pedestrian survey resulted in the excavation of 21
shovel tests and the examination of two exposed soil profiles. A single Late Prehistoric projectile
point base conforming in morphology to the Alba Cluster (sensu Justice 1995:235â237) was
located as an isolated surface artifact in an eroded area adjacent to a stock tank during the course
of this survey. All shovel tests and other areas of exposed soils were found to be negative for
cultural materials. The area affected by the Gators DU #1H project holds a very low probability
of containing significant cultural resources.
Given the lack of significant cultural resources in the proposed project area, it is recommended
that construction of the Gators DU #1H well pad be allowed to proceed. No historic properties
(i.e., cultural resources eligible for inclusion in or listed on the NRHP) will be affected by the
construction of this well pad. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended within the surveyed project area. In the unlikely event
that any cultural materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction, use,
or maintenance of the Gators DU #1H well pad, all work should cease immediately and the THC
and BLM should be notified of the discovery.
