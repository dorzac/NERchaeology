ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100-percent intensive areal archeological survey
for the proposed City of Austin’s Austin Energy Dunlap Electrical Substation location in eastern
Travis County, Texas. The survey was conducted on behalf of the City of Austin for Antiquities
Code of Texas compliance. Lacking any federal funding or permitting, the project is not subject
to federal cultural resource regulations outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(as amended). Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission under
Texas Antiquities Committee Permit #5921. The proposed facility within the proposed 22-acre
project area measures approximately 884 x 932 feet (270 x 284 meters) and will connect with the
existing Austrop to Sprinkle electrical transmission line east of Taylor Lane over aerial
easements. Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the proposed project area on foot utilizing
transects spaced 30 meters apart. The survey consisted of surface inspection supplemented by
shovel testing (n=25) within the project area. Two shovel tests were positive for prehistoric
materials, although it was determined that their contextual matrix was disturbed push pile
sediment created by plowing and terracing of the surrounding landform. In addition to these
positive shovel tests, archeologists noted natural chert cobbles, tested cobbles, cores, flakes, and
occasional bifaces and unifaces intermittently scattered across the surface of the plowed field.
Visual inspection indicated that these artifacts extend northwest beyond the project boundary
towards Site 41TV1317 and that the artifacts noted within the proposed project area represent a
southern extension of this site. With contexts that have been disturbed from plowing and terrain
modification and with a lack of temporal diagnostics and discernable features, the segment of
Site 41TV1317 within the proposed project area is recommended as ineligible for listing as a
State Archeological Landmark. Following field investigations, Hicks & Company recommended
that the proposed undertaking could proceed with no further cultural resource coordination. The
Texas Historical Commission concurred with this recommendation on September 27, 2011
(Appendix C). All project-generated notes, forms, and photographs will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In April of 2011, investigators from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive archeological
survey of the 22-acre tract of the proposed Dunlap Electrical Substation, south of Manor in
Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). Hicks & Company was contracted by INTERA to identify
potential cultural resource constraints and obligations associated with the proposed facility.
According to current engineering information, the proposed substation measures approximately
884 x 932 feet (270 x 284 meters) and will connect with the existing Austrop to Sprinkle
electrical transmission line east of Taylor Lane over aerial easements, well above the ground
surface. The entire site will be scraped and graded to some degree, and foundations, piers, duct
banks and retention ponds will be added to various locations within the proposed project area.
The proposed project area is located on land to be owned and controlled by the City of Austin
through Austin Energy and is therefore subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT);
however, the project lacks any federal funding or permitting that would require compliance with
the federal cultural resource regulations outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended. Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit #5921 was obtained from the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) prior to the initiation of archeological field work.
The archeological investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey of the entire 22-acre tract
augmented by shovel testing. A total of 25 shovel tests were excavated within the proposed
project area with only two tests (STJH3 and STMM2) positive for cultural material. Cultural
materials from both positive shovel tests were encountered from 0-10 centimeters below ground
surface (cmbgs) within sediment that was disturbed from recent plowing and terracing of the
surrounding landform. In addition to the positive shovel tests numerous artifacts were noted
across the area’s surface, including occasional flakes, tested cobbles, cores, bifaces, and unifaces.
Collectively these artifacts represent the extension of Site 41TV1317, recorded during the linear
survey of the Austrop to Sprinkle electrical transmission line, conducted in 1987 by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA).
Because this survey was confined to the right-of-way (ROW) corridor of the proposed
transmission line, it was estimated that Site 41TV1317 extended south into the current project
area; however, until now, this was not confirmed. The continued expression of Site 41TV1317
recorded during this survey reveals that the southern extent of the site has similar manifestations
to the site’s previously recorded northern extent. Based on the results of the investigations, Site
41TV1317 does not contain deposits that warrant designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL).
John Fulmer was the Principal Investigator for the project, while Josh Haefner served as the
Project Archeologist. Josh Haefner and Marin Millen conducted the field investigations. The
report was authored by Josh Haefner. Jerrod McCleland conducted the Geographic Information
System (GIS) data processing and produced the maps. Cheryl Hardy supervised the formatting
of the report and report production. No artifacts were collected as a result of this investigation.
All project records and photographs will be curated at TARL in Austin, Texas. This report
serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of TAC Permit #5921.

Introduction and Management Summary

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The City of Austin’s Austin Energy Dunlap Electrical Substation project area is located
approximately four miles southeast of the city of Manor and five miles east of the city of Austin
in eastern Travis County, Texas, within the Blackland Prairies physiographic region (Figure 2).
This region forms a broad wedge between the Edwards Plateau and the Cross Timbers and
Prairies to the west, and the Post Oak Savannah to the east, with which it intermingles. This
swath spans approximately 6.1 million hectares from the Red River on the north to near San
Antonio in south Texas. It is part of a tall-grass prairie system that runs from Manitoba to the
coast of Texas. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by gently rolling to nearly level
topography, with dark-colored calcareous clay soils interspersed with gray acid sandy loams that
underlay prairie grass-forbs vegetation. The region is dissected by numerous rivers and by low
gradient streams. Land uses associated with urbanization and agriculture have altered the native
communities of vegetation and wildlife in the region.
GEOLOGY, SOILS, AND HYDROLOGY
According to the Austin Sheet of the Geological Atlas of Texas, the proposed facility is primarily
situated on Cretaceous-age Navarro Group and Marlbrook marl, with Taylor marl (Khnm) near
its boundary with Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits (Qhg) to the east (BEG 1972). The
predominant soils in the area are Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes (estimated at 60 percent
coverage of the proposed project area); Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (19 percent);
Heiden clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes, moderately eroded (13 percent); and Ferris-Heiden complex,
8 to 20 percent slopes, severely eroded (8 percent). The soils of the Heiden, Houston Black, and
Ferris-Heiden complex are described as upland soils derived from residuum weathered from
clayey shale belonging to the Eagleford or Taylor Marl groups and are typically located on ridge
formations. Sites in these contexts are usually shallow and often readily visible on the ground
surface. Topography of the area is gently sloping east-southeast, with a gradual descent toward
the unnamed tributary to Gilleland Creek located approximately 80–100 meters east of the
proposed project location (BEG 1996). There are no streams that traverse the project area;
however, there is an unnamed tributary to Gilleland Creek located approximately 80–90 meters
to the east (Figure 3).

VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
The project area lies in the Blackland Prairie vegetation area near its boundaries with the
Edwards Plateau and the Post Oak Savannah vegetation areas of Texas (Gould 1962). The
Blackland Prairie vegetation area is characterized by a dissected plateau originally covered by
open savannah with trees and brush occupying rocky slopes and stream bottoms. Today, the
region is predominantly Live Oak-Ashe Juniper woodland, interspersed with rangeland (Correl
and Johnston 1979; Hatch et al. 1990).
The project area is situated near the western edge of the Texan biotic province, near its interface
with the Balconian biotic province (Blair 1950). The Balconian province represents a
transitional zone where many wildlife species are reaching the limits of their ecological tolerance
(Blair 1950). The eastern edge of the Balconian province is formed by the Balcones Escarpment
which separates the Balconian from the Texan and Tamaulipan provinces of east and south
Texas, forming a formidable barrier for faunal migration. Numerous streams dissect the eastern
and southern edges of the Balconian biotic province, providing major avenues of dispersal for
many species. Dice (1943) defined the Texan biotic province as the broad ecotonal area that lay
between the forests of the Austroriprarian and Carolinian provinces of eastern Texas and
Oklahoma and the grassland savannahs of the western parts of these states. Within the Texan
province, vegetation is highly dependant on edaphic controls with moisture content vacillating
from surplus to deficiency. Where sandy soils are predominate, oak-hickory forests comprised
of post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica) and hickory (Carya huckleyi) are
present. Originally, areas of clay soils supported a vast tall-grass prairie that now has largely
been cultivated. Where the grass prairie remains, dominants include western wheatgrass

(Agropyron smithii), little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius), Texas wintergrass (Stipa
leucotricha), and hairy woolly grass (Triodia pilosa) (Blair 1950). Occasionally, characteristic
associations of the Austroriparian are found in the Texan province. For instance, in Bastrop
County, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is found in mixed stands with blackjack oak.
Blair (1950) reports that at least 49 species of mammals,5 species of urodelians, 39 species of
snakes, 18 anurans, 2 species of land turtle and 16 species of lizards are found within the Texan
biotic province. Forty-one of the mammal species are also found in the Austroriprarian while
eight range into the area from grasslands to the west, southwest or north. Common species of
mammals that occur in the Texan province include: the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps), harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus),
swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), striped ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), hispid
pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), and the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus).
The climate of Travis County is considered humid subtropical, characterized by hot summers and
cool winters, with an average low temperature in January of 38 degrees Fahrenheit and an
average high temperature in July of 96 degrees. Annual average precipitation is 81 centimeters
(32 inches), with peak precipitation in May and September. Summers are generally dry with
occasional thunderstorms.
LAND USE
The proposed project location encompasses 22 acres southeast of the intersection of the Austrop
to Sprinkle Transmission Line and Travis Lane. The northern portion of the project area is
composed of overgrown rangeland with dry clay loams covered with low shrubbery with
intermittent areas of natural chert cobbles and, rarely, exposed limestone bedrock (Figure 4).
Travelling south, although still rangeland, the shrubbery gives ways to sparse short grasses and
cacti (Figure 5). Soils in this area are best described as sandy clay loams. The southern half of
the project area was characterized by increased evidence of mechanical disturbance, with
frequent small berms and push piles noted.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Archeological Background
The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region (Figure 6). Most of the
recent chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct periods, representing a roughly
12,000 year sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the cultural-historical sequence from Collins
(2004) and Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800–
5800 BP), Middle Archaic (5800–4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000–1400 BP), Post-Archaic or Late
Prehistoric (AD 600–1600), and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions
represent convenient temporal categories, they are also based in large part on perceived
adaptations in subsistence and are reflected in changes in lithic and other technologies.
The Central Texas archeological area is one of the better known regions of Texas. More sites
have been recorded, tested, and excavated in Central Texas than any other part of the state (Black
1989). Most of the prehistoric sites in Central Texas are open, unprotected sites situated on
alluvial terraces adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). A typical open site in Central Texas
contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken chert tools, fragmented burned rock, land
snails, fragmented animal bone (uncommon), and charred plant remains (rare) (Black 1989).
Burned rock middens are Central Texas’ most characteristic archeological feature. These firecracked and discolored limestone features are dominantly found in terrace or upland settings.
They usually contain other cultural debris in association, indicating their significant role in
prehistoric occupations. An additional trait of open campsites is the presence of diagnostic stone
tools often representing occupations from different periods or phases, ultimately suggesting
repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands of years.

Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The Early Paleoindian culture in south and Central Texas is believed to be related to the wellknown big-game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the welldocumented Early Paleoindian sites in Texas associated with extinct megafauna are located north
and west of Central Texas on the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains.
In general, Early Paleoindian sites are scarce in Central Texas, or are at least not as visible as
later sites. Conversely, Late Paleoindian sites are much more numerous in south and Central
Texas, although both are usually identified from only surface-collected artifacts (Black and
McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several Late Paleoindian sites does suggest, however,
that small game was exploited rather than extinct megafauna. This data supports the idea that a
hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been adopted across much of southwest and
Central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas are typically associated with lanceolate projectile
points such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Meserve and stemmed points such as
Scottsbluff (Turner and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (Collins
2004, 41WM235) equate three styles of projectiles to the Late Paleoindian period:
Golondrina/Barber, St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson. The Wilson component is dated at 10,000 to
9650 BP (stemmed points) and is associated with features, a burial, and artifacts that are more

Cultural Background

Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from Wilson Leonard suggests
the archaic nature of the adaptation continues during the ensuing Golondrina/Barber and St.
Mary’s Hall components. These are dated between 9500 and 8800 BP and may represent a
transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.

Early Archaic (ca. 8800–5800 BP)
At the Wilson-Leonard Site (41WM235), the Early Archaic period is subdivided into three
projectile point style intervals: Angostura, Early Split Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to
6000 BP (Collins 2004). At this site, the shift from Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies
is measured by a change in technology focused on the use of burned rocks to process geophyte
plant foods. This shift is traced back as early as 8800 BP at the Wilson-Leonard Site and to
roughly comparable ages at several other Central Texas sites (Black et al. 1998; Decker et al.
1999; Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, the use of earth ovens and burned rock technologies for
the possible processing of plant foods is associated with lanceolate Angostura projectile points.
The use of Angostura and Late Paleoindian lithic technologies may have continued on into the
Early Archaic period for a time but was gradually replaced by the bifurcate base split-stem and
Martindale/Uvalde styles.
The Early Archaic marks a shift to the use of multiple tons of burned limestone and other rocks
in the form of scatters, hearths, middens, and other features for the processing of plant foods.
This represents the start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition which lasted from roughly
8800 to 1400 BP. This tradition was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and
the creation of burned rock middens at strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence
practices began with a distinctive cooking technology using layered arrangements of heated
rocks in earth ovens which allowed for the exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These
included upland xerophytic plants like sotol and other species such as Lily family onion bulbs,
which grow in wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool Late
Pleistocene environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most
pronounced during the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000–7000 BP) (Ricklis and Collins 1994). In
contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests that the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards
Plateau during the Pleistocene and early Holocene/Paleoindian period witnessed a brief dry
interval during Late Paleoindian times, shifting towards mesic conditions again during the
ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000–5800 BP). Whether the Early Archaic climate
reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994) or a more mesic interval within an
overall, long-lived trend towards aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the
use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence-related
processing began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests Early Archaic
occupations were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw
1985). Explanations for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy
involving relatively high group mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations.
Additionally, broad spectrum, well-adapted, highly mobile subsistence strategies are theorized.

Cultural Background

Regional population density may have been low, though this could reflect a sampling bias in
terms of well-documented Early Archaic sites (Ricklis and Collins 1994).

Middle Archaic (ca. 5800–4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic period marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to
process plant and other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and
Collins (1994) recognize a pronounced mid-Holocene drying event from 7000 to 5000 BP,
though it may have lasted longer. Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards
interval along the eastern Edwards Plateau from roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this
includes the cessation of significant overbank sediment aggradation at a number of Central Texas
sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions caused extensive downcutting and erosion along
many Central Texas streams. Dryer conditions favored the spread of desert succulent xerophytic
plants and fostered the proliferation of burned rock middens. Dryer conditions may also have
engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the Middle and Late Archaic intervals. The
proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point styles at the beginning of the Middle
Archaic possibly coincided with the return of bison to the Edwards Plateau and adjacent
Blackland Prairie. Within archeological literature, these broad-bladed points have been
associated to the exploitation of bison. Additional Middle Archaic styles include Early
Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and Travis.

Late Archaic (ca. 4000–1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic period into intervals
I and II (Johnson 1995). Interval I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile points,
which along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall, and Montell) were likely used to
hunt bison and other large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late
Archaic I interval. Resources processed in large earth ovens included yucca, sotol, and perhaps
agave lechuguilla. Other middens are simply dumps for kitchen type debris which contain
sizeable quantities of animal bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson
1995). Pedernales peoples, in particular, were apparently well-adept at both hunting and the
processing of large volumes of plant food materials.
The Late Archaic II interval was a time of increasingly mesic conditions for all but the western
and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of more mesic
conditions likely would have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic (dry weatheradapted) plants and perhaps bison (Johnson 1995), which would have forced adjustments in
prehistoric subsistence strategies. There appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock
middens that can be directly attributable to the Late Archaic II interval. The projectile points
used at this time are typically smaller and are characterized by such styles as Ensor, Fairland,
Frio and Darl. The large projectiles well-adapted to bison hunting may have been gradually
replaced. There is evidence that the spread of Eastern Woodland religious cults may have had an
influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of Central Texas (Johnson 1995).

Cultural Background

Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600–1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600–1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is
marked initially by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in
the shift from dart points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994).
Despite the shift to the bow and arrow, it is indicated that the broad based hunting-gathering
economy of the Late Archaic persisted into and through most of the Late Prehistoric period. The
latter part of this period is marked by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of
tools composed of contracting-stem Perdiz arrow points; an abundance of unifacial end scrapers;
thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives; and drills or perforators made on flakes and blades. The
Post-Archaic era again turned dry and somewhat arid towards the middle of the Late Prehistoric,
during which there was a rather dramatic increase in bison exploitation, indicating bison hunting
was an important economic activity during the later part of this period.

Historic Period (ca. AD 1528–Present)
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and other
survivors of the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528, although there may have been
earlier landings (Cecil and Greene 2001). In any case, the influences of European colonization
were not felt strongly in Texas for several centuries. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
however, the Spanish had established missions in east Texas and settlements in south Texas.
This resulted in massive depopulation and cultural disintegration among native Indian groups.
The most radical changes in the Native American history of Central Texas came during the
historic era (Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North America by Spanish settlers in
the sixteenth century. Nomadic groups, initially the Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted
the horse and rapidly altered the aboriginal situation of Central Texas. These nomadic groups
entered Central Texas from the plains and mountain areas to the north and west and, within 150
years, had forced most of the native peoples to flee. Most groups were destroyed by the
combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the foreign diseases introduced by the Europeans.
Others moved south, entering Spanish missions and settlements, or eastward to join various
agricultural groups such as the Wichita (Black 1989).
Previous Investigations
Background research conducted using the THC’s Online Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas)
revealed one previous archeological survey and four archeological sites within the project area
(Appendix A: Plate I). A linear survey conducted in 1987 by TARL for LCRA along the
Austrop to Sprinkle transmission line runs adjacent to the northernmost edge of the proposed
substation site. During this survey, two sites (41TV1316 and 41TV1317) within close proximity
to the currently proposed project area were recorded. Both sites are described as prehistoric open
campsites/lithic scatters with various chert tools, burned rocks, and lithic debitage, though each
lacks diagnostic artifacts. Neither site was recommended for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as an SAL.

Cultural Background

Site 41TV160 is located approximately 250 meters south of the project area and is described as
an open campsite with burned rock, chert tools (including untyped dart points), and lithic
debitage. Recorders from the Travis County Archeological Society recommended additional
investigation of the site during original documentation in 1965, though no information regarding
additional work is available on the Atlas. Site 41TV687 is likely a component of Site 41TV160
and is currently mapped within its boundaries. It was recorded by a private landowner in 1983
and is also described as an open prehistoric campsite, though minor historic farmstead
components are mentioned on the site form. Portions of the site were recommended as SALeligible by the recorder. The project area does not contain any further documented surveys, sites,
Official Texas Historical Markers, or other known cultural resources.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
While geology and soils background research indicated that there is limited potential for deeply
buried intact cultural deposits, the THC’s Sites Atlas notes that there are archeological sites
within the immediate area of the proposed Dunlap Electrical Substation, indicating a moderate to
high probability of encountering previously unrecorded prehistoric archeological sites within the
project area. Because of this, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100-percent
intensive pedestrian areal survey of the entire proposed project area. The survey of the project
area was conducted in accordance with the minimum standards established by the Council of
Texas Archeologists for projects of 11–100 acres. The project area was divided into west–east
transects approximately 300 meters in length. Each transect was surveyed separately, and the
pedestrian investigations were supplemented by a total of 25 shovel tests. The shovel tests were
dug to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters or to termination due to sterile sediment, bedrock, or
impenetrable matrix, whichever occurred first. Sediment was screened through ¼-inch mesh
hardware cloth. Each shovel test location was demarcated using a Trimble Geo ExplorerXT submeter GPS unit, and pertinent information was recorded on standardized shovel test forms.
The pedestrian survey resulted in the extension of the site boundaries of prehistoric Site
41TV1317, originally recorded as adjacent to the project’s northeast boundary. A total of two
shovel tests conducted during the project were positive for cultural materials (STJH3 and
STJH2), although the containing matrix was noted as sediment disturbed by plowing and
terracing of the area. While the extension of Site 41TV1317 was largely delineated from
artifacts scattered intermittently across the surface, shovel testing was continued across the
project area in order to assess the horizontal and vertical extents of the plow disturbance and to
ascertain if any areas within the project area contained the potential to house intact buried
deposits. The site extension was mapped using GPS technology, and several photos were taken
to document cultural materials, their condition, and the site area in general. A full TexSite
Archeological Site Revisitation form was completed for site and was provided to the TARL in
order to update information on Site 41TV1317.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
The intensive archeological survey of the 22-acre tract that is part of the Austin Energy’s
proposed Dunlap Electrical Substation resulted in the boundary extension of one prehistoric-age
archeological site, Site 41TV1317. At the time of the investigations, the proposed project area
contained a mix of sparse mesquite, low shrubbery, sporadic short grasses, and occasional cacti
(Figure 7). It is evident that the property was cleared and cultivated at one time, with evidence
of artificial terracing throughout the area (Figure 8). The project area appears to have been
recently used for livestock grazing; however, the land is not currently used for any agricultural
practice. Average visibility across the project area was estimated at 50–65 percent.

Figure 8: Overview of project area facing east from approximate center of project area.

Investigators began surveying at the southwestern extent of the proposed project area along its
highest topographical point (Figure 9). Utilizing transects spaced 30 meters apart, the project
area was traversed west to east, generally following a gradual descent towards the unnamed
tributary to Gilleland Creek that runs north–south, approximately 80–90 meters beyond the
project’s eastern boundary. Two shovel tests (STMM2 and STJH3) excavated along the
southern extent of the project area were positive for cultural materials. A biface (Figure 10) was
recovered in shovel test STMM2 at a depth of 1–3 cmbgs, and a flake was recovered from 1–8
cmbgs. Within shovel test STJH3, a single chert flake was recovered from approximately 4
cmbgs. Spaced approximately 10–30 meters away from these positive tests in the four cardinal
directions, shovel tests STMM3, STMM4, STJH2, STJH4, and STJH5 were all negative for
cultural materials (Appendix A: Plate II). In addition to being devoid of artifacts, these shovel
tests indicated that deposition of the immediate area was varied in depth. As demonstrated by
shovel tests STJH1, STJH2, STMM2, STMM3, and STMM4, minimal deposition was noted in
most locations with sediment consisting of clay loams with inclusions of natural gravels and
fragmented bedrock. Other shovel tests conducted in the immediate area (STJH3 and STJH4)
demonstrated moderate deposition with sandy loams overlying clay loams (Appendix B: Shovel
Test Results). These shovel tests that exhibited increased deposition were noted as centered on
or adjacent to the rises of the bermed terrain, and it was noted in-field that these areas were likely
the result of land modification from recent plowing of the project area.

Results of Field Investigation

Following shovel testing in the immediate vicinity of positive shovel tests STMM2 and STJH3
transect survey resumed, supplemented by shovel testing at 50 to 75 meter intervals (STJH1,
STJH2, STJH6-STJH13, STMM1, and STMM5–STMM11). With the exception of shovel test
JH7, these shovel tests demonstrated shallow, disturbed sediment characterized by sandy clay
and clay loams. Shovel test JH7 was placed along the project area’s eastern boundary at its
lowest topographical point. The sediment here was noted as undisturbed, slightly moist clay
loam with inclusions limited to rootlets and a small amount of calcium carbonate precipitate at
40–60 cmbgs. Clay content was observed to increase steadily with depth and, at 60 cmbgs, was
dense and very compact. Shovel test JH7 likely represents the westernmost extent of the
floodplain of the unnamed tributary to Gilleland Creek observed east of project area, and its
immediate vicinity is the only demonstrable area of intact deposition within the proposed project
area.
Site 41TV1317
While no shovel tests beyond STMM2 and STJH3 excavated during this survey were positive for
cultural materials, artifacts were observed on the ground surface intermittently throughout the
area, generally extending from the southeast corner of the proposed project area toward its
northeastern terminus (Appendix A: Plate III). From this location, archeologists had a
viewshed of the Austrop to Sprinkle Transmission Line corridor in which Site 41TV1317 was
originally recorded, and it was noted that the surficial artifacts continued beyond the current
project boundary in this general direction (Figure 11). Similarly, during its original recordation
in 1987, it was noted that the boundary of Site 41TV1317 extended beyond the survey
transmission line ROW corridor southeastward in the direction of the unnamed tributary to
Gilleland Creek. Further, this site was described in similar context (cores, thick bifaces and
debitage located on and within a plow zone) to that observed during the current investigation.
Because of these observations, the artifacts noted during the survey of the Dunlap Electrical
Substation are considered an extension of Site 41TV1317 (Appendix A: Plate IV).
Beyond tested cobbles, cores, and primary reduction flakes, two general types of bifaces were
noted as occurring within the extended boundary of Site 41TV1317: large-sized bifaces
expediently fashioned from tabular chert cores through large flake removal along both sides of
one margin (Figure 12 and Figure 13), and smaller, crude bifaces fashioned from initial core
detachments (Figure 14). Within contexts that have been disturbed from plowing and terrain
modification and with a lack of temporal diagnostics or discernable features, the segment of Site
41TV1317 within the proposed project area is not recommended as SAL-eligible.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
With the exception of the surficial and subsurface artifacts noted during survey that resulted in
extended boundaries of previously recorded prehistoric Site 41TV1317, no cultural remains were
recovered during survey of the 22 acres of pasture land anticipated for use by the City of
Austin’s proposed Austin Energy Dunlap Electrical Substation. The intensive cultural resources
survey included a pedestrian survey supplemented by 25 shovel tests, all but two of which were
negative for subsurface cultural material. In general, the project area is predominately located
within an upland area with a low density of ground cover and minimal deposition of sediments
that are not conducive to site preservation. Further, the few (n=2) buried artifacts recovered in
shovel tests were located within plowed, terraced, and push-piled deposits that lacked contextual
integrity. The cultural remains associated with Site 41TV1317 included occasional flakes, tested
cobbles, cores, large bifaces and unifaces. No surficial or subsurface diagnostic artifacts or
cultural features were noted during survey. Due to modern disturbance, the integrity of Site
41TV1317 is considered to be poor, and the research potential of this site is minimal.
Following field investigations, it was recommended that the portion of Site 41TV1317 that is
within the current proposed project area did not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or designation as
a SAL on an individual basis and that no further archeological investigations were warranted for
the site. Furthermore, it was noted that the potential for cultural resources to exist on the
remainder of the 22-acre tract was very low, and no further archeological investigations were
recommended for the proposed project area prior to construction. The THC concurred with this
recommendation on September 27, 2011 (Appendix C).
In the event that unrecorded cultural resources not included in this report are encountered during
future development, all ground-disturbing activities in the project area will cease pending
notification and comment from the THC relative to the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section
106 of the NHPA. Hicks & Company offers this final report in partial fulfillment of Texas
Antiquities Committee Permit #5921. All project related materials will be curated at TARL in
Austin, Texas.
