ABSTRACT
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC) conducted a three-phase cultural resource investigation of
the Capers Ridge Pump Station location and diversion alignment for the Luce Bayou Interbasin Transfer
Project (LBITP) in Harris and Liberty Counties, Texas. This work began as a reconnaissance-level
pedestrian cultural resource survey investigation of the Pump Station location and the LBITP diversion
alignment in Harris and Liberty Counties, Texas. The pedestrian cultural resource survey was performed
between January 5, 2009 and April 2010. Initial reporting and consultation with the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Galveston District, resulted in the decision to expand the survey into a full-scale 100
percent pedestrian cultural resource survey of the entire project area. A second fieldwork phase was
conducted to fully delineate by shovel testing all the sites identified in the initial survey and fill in any
gaps left by the reconnaissance-level pedestrian survey. The results of this second field phase were
integrated into the initial report draft and presented for review to the Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District, and to the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC). After this
consultation with the THC, mechanical trenching was conducted in some portions of the LBITP
alignment during December 2011, as specified by the Archeology Division reviewers.
The ultimately 100 percent intensive-level pedestrian survey of the LBITP area included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trenching) examination. A total of 1,046 shovel tests and 44 backhoe
trenches were excavated. The investigations relocated one previously recorded site, 41LB42, and
identified 26 new archeological sites (41HR1073-1076 and 41LB97-118). Four locations where shovel
testing produced only a single prehistoric artifact were determined to be isolated finds (IF 1-4) and were
not designated as archeological sites. A total of 1,568 artifacts were recovered during these
investigations.
Of the 26 newly discovered locations, three are historic and 23 are prehistoric. 41HR1073 and 41HR1076
appear to be historic farmsteads that date to the early 20th century, while 41HR1075 contained artifacts
associated with late 19th century occupations. All three appear to have potential subsurface features that
may be partially filled cisterns, etc. However, the late period of occupation for these three historic sites
do not appear to demonstrate potential for future study, and are thus not recommended for further
investigations. Further, 41HR1076 is a historic farmstead located on the May family property and the
LBITP will avoid this property entirely. Once the current report is finalized, the diagnostic and nonredundant artifacts recovered from the three historic sites will be curated at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). No potentially historic structures were observed within or near the survey
alignment.
Sixteen of the prehistoric sites, 41HR1074, 41LB98, 41LB100, 41LB101, 41LB102, 41LB105, 41LB106,
41LB107, 41LB108, 41LB109, 41LB110, 41LB111, 41LB113, 41LB114, 41LB115, and 41LB116, each
appear to contain deposits of very limited artifact density and diversity, and are not recommended for
further investigations. At one of these sites, 41LB105, only the portion of the site that was located within
the APE was delineated and assessed for NRHP eligibility. Should impacts be planned for the portion of
41LB105 located outside the current APE boundary, additional investigations should be conducted to
determine the NRHP eligibility for the additional site area.
One newly discovered site, 41LB118, was identified in an area that no longer is part of the LBITP ROW.
This site was not fully delineated since it is no longer in the APE of the proposed project. The level of
investigations conducted at this site was insufficient to assess it for NRHP eligibility. Consequently,
additional delineation and assessment of site eligibility should be conducted if future impacts are
proposed for the site.

ii

Six of the newly discovered prehistoric sites, 41LB97, 41LB99, 41LB103, 41LB104, 41LB112, and
41LB117, appear to potentially contain intact cultural deposits that exhibit low-moderate artifact densities
and diversity. Each of these six sites warrant further investigations to determine their potential
significance for future research. These sites should be avoided, or if this is impossible, additional
investigations will be necessary to determine eligibility prior to the initiation of construction.
The previously identified prehistoric site, 41LB42, was greatly expanded in size by the current
investigations, and areas of denser and more diverse artifact concentrations within the site were identified
that warrant further investigations. Another previously identified prehistoric site, 41LB43, could not be
relocated at the published coordinates. This site was either originally plotted incorrectly or has eroded
away. If misplotted, the site may lie outside the surveyed alignment or could be represented by one of the
newly discovered sites 41LB100 or 41LB101 (which are located more than 200 m to the east of the siteâs
reported UTMs). Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered from 41LB42 and the 23
newly discovered prehistoric sites will be curated at TARL.
In the event that additional archeological deposits or features should be encountered during construction,
work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC) conducted a three-stage cultural resource
investigation of the Capers Ridge Pump Station location and diversion alignment for the Luce
Bayou Interbasin Transfer Project (LBITP) in Harris and Liberty Counties, Texas. This work
began as a reconnaissance-level pedestrian cultural resource survey investigation of the Pump
Station location and the LBITP diversion alignment in Harris and Liberty Counties, Texas. The
pedestrian cultural resource survey was performed between January 5, 2009 and April 2010.
Initial reporting and consultation with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District, resulted in the decision to expand the survey into a full-scale 100 percent pedestrian
cultural resource survey of the entire project area. A second fieldwork phase was conducted to
fully delineate by shovel testing all the sites identified in the initial survey and fill in any gaps left
by the reconnaissance-level pedestrian survey. The results of this second field phase were
integrated into the initial report draft and presented for review to the Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District, and to the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
After this consultation with the Texas Historic Commission, mechanical trenching was conducted
in some portions of the LBITP alignment during December 2011, as specified by the Archeology
Division reviewers.
The project area is depicted on the Huffman, Plum Grove, Simmons Bottom, and Capers
Ridge, Texas 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle maps (Figures 1 and 1A through 1D).
An AECOM map illustrating the location of the LBITP parcels is also provided in Appendix 1
(Figure 1-1). The initial objective of the investigation was to identify subdivisions of the project
alignment into areas of high and low probability of the occurrence of cultural resources sites, as
well as incorporate data on known cultural resource sites and surveys. The investigations
(MAC Report of Investigations No. 553) were conducted at the request of DESCO, LP, WCW
International, Inc., AECOM, and the Coastal Water Authority, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5082. The LBITP is also subject to permitting under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
and there is a USACE, Galveston District, Permit SWG-2009-00188 established for this project.
The Luce Bayou Project has a long and complex history. The concept of diversion of
Trinity River water into Luce Bayou to supply the City of Houston and its industries was
expressed in a Houston Chronicle newspaper article as early as March 22, 1938. The project first
moved toward realization in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some studies (including
archeological investigations) conducted prior to a long hiatus in the project. Archeological
investigations1 during this period included an intensive pedestrian survey of the Capers Ridge
Pump Station tract and of the diversion alignment (Chaffin-Lohse 1978) and National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing at historic site 41LB41 within the Capers Ridge Pump
Station tract (Heartfield Prince and Greene 1982).
The current diversion alignment departs significantly from the 1978 survey alignment,
while the Capers Ridge Pump Station tract remains the same. Site 41LB41 was the only cultural
resource identified within the Capers Ridge Pump Station property in 1978. Testing conducted in
1982 revealed that 41LB41 was not eligible for NRHP or State Archeological Landmarks (SAL)
designation (Heartfield Prince and Greene 1982:8-1). This site is therefore given no further
consideration in this study. Only two small prehistoric sites (41LB42, 41LB43) on Capers Ridge
Pump Station property of the six sites identified in the 1978 survey are proximal to the current
alignment. Avoidance of these sites was recommended in the 1978 report. The current

testing project.

archeological investigations included efforts to relocate, delineate, and re-evaluated these two
sites.
Reviewers and other readers will note that our level of effort in the current volume far
exceeds that normally expected under what began as a reconnaissance-level Antiquities Permit
investigation. The tight project schedule combined with an unexpectedly high number of sites
found, time-limited access, and availability of logistical resources made it both possible and
justifiable to continue the work, first through delineation of essentially all of the sites found
during the reconnaissance, and second, to fill in gaps in shovel testing along the alignment in any
land parcel where ROE was granted and shovel testing was allowed. In the final phase of survey
investigations, a series of mechanical trenches were excavated in both site and intersite areas
along the Capers Ridge portion of the alignment as requested by the Archeology Division
reviewers. Each transition from one level of survey intensity to a higher one was accompanied by
consultation with the USACE archeologist for the Galveston District and did not proceed without
his consent.
It was never our intent to preclude the USACE or the Archeology Division of the THC
from its proper role in reviewing and amending, where necessary, the scope of work for this
project, which now clearly qualifies for a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey. The Survey
Scope and Research Design for the current report evolved with the USACE and THC reviewers'
analysis of the currently available survey data at each earlier stage of the investigation, all of
which was collected by customary methods and principles as presented in the State Survey
Standards. Only now, with the current report, are we presenting this data as sufficient for
completion of a 100 percent intensive survey, since we have now completed all the work
specified for such an investigation by the project reviewers.
The anticipated â and achieved - benefit of the approach taken with this report is that it
allowed the Coastal Water Authority to complete a 100 percent survey that provides a completed
field investigation that is reasonably expected to be acceptable to the reviewers on the first round
of review (at draft submission) since the methodology for each step of the investigation has been
defined in direct consultation with the USACE archeologist and/or the THC Archeology Division
reviewer and based on the results of the preceding step. This approach also allowed us to carry
on with the analysis and assessment of significance for each of the already-discovered sites
concurrently with the review of the Draft Reconnaissance Permit thereby expediting the transition
to the subsequent Testing Permit phase of the investigation, which appears to be necessary for
some of the sites identified along the LBITP alignment.
The ultimately 100 percent intensive-level pedestrian survey of the LBITP area included
both surface and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trenching) examination. A total of 1,046
shovel tests (Figure 2) and 44 backhoe trenches (Figure 3) were excavated, resulting in the
discovery of 26 new archeological sites (41HR1073-1076 and 41LB97-118), and the
identification of four isolated find locations (IF 1-4). The locations of the two previously
identified sites, 41LB42 and 41LB43, were revisited, and resulted in the significant expansion of
41LB42. 41LB43 could not be relocated. The field investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field technicians Richard Alba, Sarah Blake, Rebecca Carroll,
Eleanor Dahlin, Rachael Going, Sally Morehead, and Lisa Rodriguez. Roger Moore served as the
projectâs principal investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
The Harris and Liberty County areas are located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province (Hunt 1974). In the Southeast Texas region, the surface topography of
the plain is characterized by relatively flat topography that dips slightly toward the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies atop the Lissie Formation, a surface outcrop that
extends from just east of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, to Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1982). The formation was deposited during a series of glacial and interglacial
events during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting and erosion of the
formation occurred during the periods of lower sea levels associated with the Wisconsin
glaciation. During the Holocene, after sea levels rose once more, the resulting river valleys filled
with alluvial soils, creating broad, level floodplains.
The project area is depicted on sheet 26 of the Soil Survey of Harris County (Wheeler
1976), and on sheets 22, 25, 26, 28, 29, 33, 39, of the Soil Survey of Liberty County (Griffith
1996). The soil types identified in the Harris County portion of the project area include Aldine
very fine sandy loam (Am), Atasco fine sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes (AtB), Bernard clay
loam (Bd), Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (LcA), and Midland silty clay loam (Md).
The soil types identified in the Liberty County portion of the project area include Aldine silt
loam, 0-2 percent slopes (AdA), Aldine-Aris complex (Ae), Anahuac-Aris complex (An), Aris
silt loam (Ar), Beaumont clay (Ba), Bernard clay loam (Be), Bernard-Morey complex (Bm),
Bienville loamy fine sand, 0 to 2 percent slopes (BnB), Fausse clay, frequently flooded (Fa),
Guyton-Aldine complex (Gy), Kemah-Aris complex (Km), Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1 percent
slopes (LaA), Mocarey-Yeaton complex (My), Spurger fine sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes
(SrB), Verland clay loam (Ve), Waller loam (Wa), Woodville fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (WvB), and Woodville fines slandy loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes (WvD).
Climate
The modern climate of Harris County is moderated by winds from the Gulf of Mexico,
resulting in mild winters and relatively cool summer nights (Wheeler 1976:2, 66). Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C). Annual
precipitation averages 46 inches (117 cm). In Liberty County, the summers are hot and humid,
while the winters are warm and only occasionally interrupted by cold air from the north (Griffith
1996:2). Summer temperatures average 82Â°F (28Â°C), while winter temperatures average 52Â°F
(11Â°C). Annual precipitation averages 53.6 inches (136 cm).
Hydrology
The LBITP traverses the upland areas between the Trinity River on its east end and Lake
Houston downstream of Luce Bayou (within the San Jacinto River watershed) on its west end. In
addition, a portion of the project alignment roughly parallels Cedar Bayou at a distance of 700 to
2500 m. While there are a limited number of small unnamed drainages for Cedar Bayou, few of
these drainages extend very far into the uplands.
Flora and Fauna
Harris and Liberty Counties lie within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950:98101). Not determined by a marked physiographic break, the western boundary of this province is
loosely identified by the distribution of pine and hardwood forests on the eastern Gulf coastal
plain. The county is situated within the pine-oak subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939). Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species of the pine-oak forest subdivision as
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak

10

(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests are found on
lowlands within the Austroriparian and are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water oak
(Quercus nigra), and other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly diagnostic
Spanish moss (Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).
Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard (1990) identify the following mammals as common
within the Austroriparian province: white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra
zibethicus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus subflavus), eastern red bat
(Lasiurus borealis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans), pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), slender harvest
mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat
(Oryzomys palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat (Neotoma floridana), eastern
cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands at various times in the past (Gadus and Howard
1990:15). Common turtles include eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina) and Terrapene ornata,
as well as snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin). Common lizards
include green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
skink (Leiolopisma laterale), broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps), six-lined racerunner
(Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), and eastern glass lizard (Ophiosaurus ventralis). Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable numbers and diversity.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Southeast Texas Culture History
The LBITP area is located within the southeast Texas archaeological region (Patterson
1995; Story et al. 1990). The culture history of the region extends back at least 12,000 years into
the past. A number of researchers have compiled chronological frameworks to describe the
cultural histories of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991; Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide human occupation into four broad stages, Paleoindian,
Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are based on a proposed
sequence of economic strategies as they are revealed through the archaeological and/or historical
record. These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways consider cultural, economic, and
technological factors to provide a heuristic model useful for attempting to understand ancient and
early historic populations. While the dates assigned to the period interfaces are based on
"absolute" dating methods, they of course represent a generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the following discussion will be drawn from Ensor
(1991) and are presented in Table 1.
The earliest period of occupation in southeast Texas is identified as the Paleoindian stage.
Based on the earliest securely dated appearance of populations in the New World, this stage
begins around 11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for approximately 4,000 years. During this time, it
is proposed that populations continued with a highly nomadic hunting tradition brought with them
from the Old World. Traditional models emphasize the heavy reliance that these groups placed
on the hunting of the large mammals of the Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game undoubtedly
supplanted this diet, and may have played a more important role than previously thought (Black
and McGraw 1985; Patterson 1995). Artifact types associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In general, due to a
paucity of well-stratified older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains poorly defined in southeast
Texas.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin glaciation had ended, increasing climatic aridity and
creating extensive changes in the environment. As a result, the majority of Pleistocene
megafauna became extinct. This required drastic changes in the dominant subsistence strategies
of the affected populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the Early Archaic stage, the remaining
southeast Texas populations had adapted to the environmental changes by shifting to a lifeway
dominated by seasonal scheduling. This type of subsistence economy specializes in a regionally
circumscribed and repetitive exploitation of specific floral and faunal resources. By remaining in
familiar territory, the nomadic populations were able to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

12

However, research has suggested that human population densities remained low in the
area, and may have even decreased significantly during this time (Moore and Moore 1991).
Eventually, the stabilization of the climate by around 1000 B.C., the start of the Late Archaic,
appears to have led to increasing populations. This rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of long-distance trade, technological innovations, and
changing social relations (Patterson 1995).
The final prehistoric period in southeast Texas is marked by the emergence of ceramics.
Ceramic artifacts appear in the archaeological record of the Galveston Bay area by approximately
A.D. 100, and by A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of inland populations (Pertulla et al.
1995). A plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of decorated varieties and tempering materials were also
present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan pottery in southeast
Texas around A.D. 1000-1300 has been used to suggest the presence of extended trade networks
or migration during this time (Aten 1983). The period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).
Historic Overview
European contact in the area began in the early 16th century with the ill-fated NarvÃ¡ez
expedition that, in 1528, deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas coastline, possibly on
Galveston Island. More long-term contacts resulting from permanent European settlement did
not directly impact aboriginal lifeways in southeast Texas until the early 18th century (Patterson
1995). However, European diseases introduced by explorers and early traders had begun to affect
Native American populations in Texas by the 16th century (Ewers 1974). Throughout the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases, the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases exterminated, the indigenous populations residing in the
region.
A detailed historic context for the project, as well as site specific research on historic sites
41HR1075 and 41HR1076, all authored by historian Terri Meyers of Preservation Central. Inc.,
of Austin, Texas, is presented as Appendix 3.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to beginning field investigations, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., performed
a background investigation of archeological and historical literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes site inventory records on file at TARL, previous
archeological investigative reports on file at the THC and Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
and other published literature pertinent to the current project. The archival background search
determined that there are three previously recorded archeological sites, 41LB41-41LB43, located
within the project area. All three of these sites were recorded during a 1978 study for a
previously proposed water diversion project described below.
The first iteration of the Luce Bayou diversion project necessitated an approximately 13
mile long pedestrian archeological survey between the Trinity River and Luce Bayou that was
conducted in 1978 by archeologists subcontracted by Brown and Root, Inc., on behalf of the City
of Houston (Chaffin-Lohse 1978). The easternmost approximately 4.6 mile long section of this
earlier project occupies the same route as the current project alignment. This section included
some of the current approximate 90-acre Capers Ridge Pump Station property and the traverse of
the proposed pipeline across the top of Capers Ridge. The survey identified six archeological
sites, three of which were located within the route of the current proposed project. These
included 41LB41, a historic occupation and midden site, and two prehistoric sites, 41LB42 and
41LB43. All three of these sites were judged to be potentially significant, and it was
recommended that the two prehistoric sites be avoided. Testing excavations conducted in 1982 at
the historic site, 41LB41, determined that the site was not eligible for NRHP or SAL designation
(Moore and Heartfield 1982). This site is therefore excluded from further discussion in this
investigation.
A second archeological survey project intersected a portion of the current alignment in
2006 and 2007. Conducted by HRA Gray and Pape, LLC, for the proposed ENSTOR Houston
Hub Storage Project, archeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of a total of
approximately 960 acres, of which only the northernmost extent intersected with the current
project (Fugate and Scott 2008). The investigations documented extensive past and current
agriculture disturbances throughout the survey area. No historic or prehistoric cultural resources
were identified.
The west end of the current water transfer project terminates at Luce Bayou, upstream
from its confluence with the Lake Houston Reservoir. This reservoir is fed primarily by the San
Jacinto River watershed. Two previous surveys have been carried out in proximity to the western
end of the current project. A cultural resources survey was conducted by Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. in 1988 near the end of the West Fork of the San Jacinto River for the proposed
West Lake Houston Parkway (Moore and Pettus 1988). The survey identified two prehistoric
sites, 41HR615 and 41HR616, both of which were judged to be potentially significant. While
41HR615 was determined to be outside of the projectâs construction APE, site 41HR616 was
recommended for significance testing. Test excavations were conducted in 1988 (Moore 1989),
and indicated the site had intact stratified deposits. The site was recommended as potentially
eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
In 2008, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. conducted a reconnaissance level survey
as part of a predictive model for Lake Houston Park, which is situated between the confluences of
Caney Creek and the East Fork San Jacinto River, in Harris and Montgomery Counties (Moore
and Driver 2009). The reconnaissance examined a total of 193 testing localities (ca. 200 acres)
within the approximately 5,000 acre park, and identified 39 new prehistoric archeological sites.

14

Because the survey was limited to a reconnaissance-level examination of areas within the project
property, it was recognized that the data generated for any newly discovered sites would be
minimal (consisting of a single positive shovel test), and would thus be too cursory to generate
sufficient information to fully delineate site boundaries, nor would the survey provide sufficient
information to determine the eligibility of any of these sites for nomination as a State
Archeological Monument or for inclusion on the NRHP. The results of the study indicated that
the park is potentially a very important preserve for prehistoric cultural resource sites, and that the
predictive model was quite successful in identifying areas that will probably yield sites dating
from prehistoric times. However, additional evaluations of each of the newly identified
archeological sites will be required in order to determine their research potential and significance.
That work will most likely be driven by park development, as intensive surveys are necessary to
evaluate the tracts scheduled to be disturbed. Most sites within this nature reserve will probably
be preserved indefinitely.

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The methods employed during the fieldwork phase of the LBITP varied along the
alignment from section to section and through the year of field work as information was gathered
and data collected and analyzed. The particular set of field methods used when in a given area
depended on factors such as intactness of soils, right of entry (ROE) status for a given parcel, and
probability that a given area would hold intact cultural deposits. The length of time of the
investigations influenced the methodology because at the initial stages, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc. was conducting a reconnaissance-level investigation in accordance with the
scope of work. After some investigations had been conducted, and data collected and reviewed, it
seemed prudent to conduct an approximation of an intensive-level survey of the alignment for
specific areas to provide time and cost effective services to our client, the Coastal Water
Authority. Successive agency reviews of the results of this increasingly more intense survey have
culminated in this 100 percent intensive survey report.
1. The general methodology for intensive survey within undisturbed areas included the
excavation of two lines of shovel tests, each at 100 meter (m) intervals, on either side of the
centerline of the alignment. The shovel tests would be staggered to limit the gap between
shovel tests to approximately 50 m along the alignment. In certain cases, for example in
areas of extensive pimple mounds, the distance between tests was modified so that every
mound within the alignment was tested.
2. In areas of active or past farming practices, or other type of disturbance, in areas with
remnant dikes, ditches, and terracing from rice farming, typical field methodology involved
single transects with tests every 100 m or greater, depending on site-specific conditions.
Often, the footprint of the farm fields was very obvious from a review of aerial photography.
In these areas and instances a less extensive number of shovel tests were performed. In
general, again, in areas of obvious prior disturbance based on historic or current aerial
photographs and field observations, a single transect with shovel tests at 100 m intervals or
greater was performed.
3. In some rare cases, ROE to a specific parcel was not granted by the landowner. However, it
was generally more common that landowners restricted access to their properties, especially
in cases of active farming operations. At the time of the survey, there were many parcels in
active rice farming and the owners asked that no excavations be performed. There were also
properties where there were no obvious intact soils anywhere in the proposed LBITP ROW.
In those instances, the investigation was limited to photo-documentation of existing
conditions.
4. Reconnaissance level survey in undisturbed areas included at most, a single line of shovel
tests at 100 m intervals.
5. After the completion of the shovel testing program, consultation with the THC determined
that mechanical trenching needed to be included at several of the identified sites and along
the Capers Ridge portion of the alignment to achieve 100 percent intensive survey. A total of
44 trenches were excavated, 25 within established site boundaries, and 19 within intersite
areas along the ridge (Figure 3). Trench placement in areas between sites varied due to
topography, but tended to occur at intervals ranging from 150-200 m.
All but one of the archeological sites (41LB118) located during the survey were
provisionally delineated with shovel tests in cardinal directions from the original positive test.

16

Sometimes the shovel tests took the direction of the obvious landform instead of cardinal
directions. The site boundaries were located using a combination of positive and negative shovel
test orientations, and landforms. All newly discovered sites were recorded on State of Texas
Archaeological Site Forms, and update forms were completed for the two previously identified
sites.
All shovel tests were recorded on shovel test forms so that all pertinent data are included
and summarized. The backhoe trenches were recorded on trench forms, and for each trench, a
side wall was cleaned and the profile was drawn and photographed. Photographs were taken
throughout the survey area and recorded on photograph logs. A set of daily field notes was kept
throughout the project.
Summary of Investigations by Parcel
The following section provides a detailed methodological description for each parcel. A
summary of the field results by parcel is provided in Appendix 1. An AECOM map illustrating
the location of the LBITP parcels is also provided in Appendix 1 as Figure 1-1.
Parcel 1 Reconnaissance- and Intensive-Level Survey. Parcel 1 is the Capers Ridge Pump Station
property. This property was among the first to be surveyed and was therefore surveyed at a
reconnaissance level of investigation. Located, delineated, and recorded prehistoric sites
41LB98, 41LB104, 41LB105, 41LB108, 41LB109, and 41LB110 are on this parcel. Historic site
41LB41 is located in this parcel but was deemed not significant based on prior testing. Two
potential prehistoric sites were identified, but after additional delineation efforts, were determined
to be isolated finds (IF) 2 and 4. Backhoe trenches (BHT) 33-42 were excavated within this
parcel. No additional survey-level investigations appear warranted at this time, subject to review
and concurrence.
Parcel 2 Intensive Survey Approximate 50 m Shovel Tests. Parcel 2 is a small, linear strip of
land located between Parcels 1 and 4. Delineation of previously identified sites from Parcel 1 and
4 through the boundary of Parcel 2 has been completed. Prehistoric site 41LB99 was located,
delineated, and recorded within this parcel. BHTs 31 and 32 were excavated within this parcel.
No additional survey-level investigations appear warranted at this time, subject to review and
concurrence.
Parcel 3 No Survey Necessary. Parcel 3 is a narrow strip of land adjacent to Parcels 1 and 4.

Parcel 4 and Parcel 4.5 Reconnaissance- and Intensive-Level Survey Completed. Parcel 4 is an
approximate 3,000-acre property although the LBITP generally is contained in a 100 m ROW
along Capers Ridge and within the proposed 20-acre sedimentation basin. Reconnaissance level
surveys were performed and a number of sites were identified. Delineation of the identified sites
has been performed and the number of shovel tests conducted exceeded those needed for an
intensive survey. Prehistoric temporary sites 41LB97, 41LB100, 41LB101, 41LB102, 41LB103,
41LB106, 41LB107, 41LB112, 41LB113, 41LB114, as well as 41LB42 were located within
Parcel 4. Two potential prehistoric sites were identified, but after additional delineation efforts,
were determined to be isolated finds, IF 1 and 3. In addition, 41LB118 was identified in an area
that no longer is part of the LBITP ROW. This site was not fully delineated since it is no longer

Site Descriptions
41LB42 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
Site 41LB42 is a previously recorded site atop Capers Ridge that was revisited and
expanded during the current survey (Figure 6). The site consists of a series of prehistoric buried
campsites connected by a more or less continuous buried lithic scatter. Site dimensions are 600
m E/W by 40-60 m N/S. There are prehistoric sites to the east and west of 41LB42 along the
ridge. 41LB100 is located approximately 40-50 m to the west of the westernmost end of 41LB42,
and 41LB102 is about 400 m to the east of the easternmost end of the site. The topography at this
site consists of a general E/W trending ridgeline that slopes to the north and south into old
meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated wetlands. There is a wellmaintained dirt road running along the apex of the ridge. The area is heavily wooded with oak,
elm, magnolia, yaupon, and pine. The landform at 41LB42 consists mainly of the ridge feature,
which is 40-60 ft higher than the meander scar areas to the north and south. There are also high
and low points along the ridge itself. Many of the high points contain deep sandy soils where
there are concentrations of artifacts.
The site was identified and horizontally defined by 103 shovel tests, 60 of which were
positive for cultural materials. In addition, a total of five backhoe trenches (BHTs 13-17) were
excavated within the site (Figures 7-11). Four of these trenches, BHTs 13-16, produced cultural
materials. A basin-shaped hearth (Feature 1) was revealed in the east profile of BHT 13. The
hearth measured 1.25 m in diameter and had a maximum thickness of 40 cm. The upper limit of
the feature was located at a depth of 45 cm below the modern ground surface. All of the cultural
materials recovered from this trench were associated with Feature 1, and was recovered from on,
immediately above, its uppermost interface (Level 5), or from the base of the feature fill (Level
8). Although the feature fill was dark in color, no charcoal fragments were visible. BHT 15
revealed two features in its north profile. Feature 2 had a basin-shaped profile with almost
vertical sides that extended down 40 cm from the top of Zone 2, and measured 45 cm in diameter.
The feature fill contained a light scatter of charcoal flecks, but no artifacts. Feature 3 was
irregular in shape, and also contained charcoal flecks but no artifacts. The shape of this feature
suggests it may be the remains of a burned tree root rather than a cultural feature. The east profile
of BHT 16 contained a faint, lenticular charcoal stain at a depth of 150 cmbs. No artifacts were
associated with the stain, and it is unclear whether it represents a cultural feature.
The general character of this site is one of greater artifact concentration and diversity in
certain areas with thin lithic scatters in between. This ridge has no doubt not only been an
attractive place to live but also a convenient route for transportation given its high elevation.
There is evident modern bioturbation occurring along the ridge including moderate slope wash,
root activity, and animal burrowing that are common in SE Texas wherever sandy sites are found.
A combination of natural bioturbation and human movement along the ridge through time may
account for the lithic scatter between the artifact concentration areas. The areas in the site that
contain artifact concentration have potential for intact features.
The shovel testing produced a total of 395 artifacts (Table 2). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-12 (0-120 cmbs), with relatively consistent numbers of artifacts in
Levels 2-10 (20-100 cmbs). The artifacts included 191 pieces of lithic debitage (111 chert, 38
quartzite, 42 silicified wood), one chert Perdiz arrow point (Figure 12), one quartzite Gary dart
point (Figure 13), one chert biface fragment, one utilized flake of silicified wood, 126 Goose
Creek sherds (119 plain, 7 incised), 39 faunal bone fragments (unidentifiable mammal, some with
evidence of light burning), and 35 pieces of burned clay. The presence of the pottery sherds in
Levels 1-10, and 12 (0-120 cmbs), and the arrow and dart points, both of which were found in

25

Level 3 (20-30 cmbs; and both in association with pottery), indicate the site dates to the Early and
Late Ceramic periods.
In summary, 41LB42 is a large prehistoric occupation site that dates to the Early and Late
Ceramic periods. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-12 (0-120 cmbs), and the artifact
assemblage exhibits medium artifact density and diversity. In terms of the horizontal distribution
of artifacts, the site contains areas with greater artifact concentration and diversity, with thin lithic
scatters in between. Based on the results of backhoe trenching, the site has a high potential for
containing preserved subsurface cultural features. We recommend that further investigations be
conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential eligibility for the
National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB42 will be curated at TARL.

41LB43 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
Site 41LB43 is a previously recorded site atop Capers Ridge. A revisit of the site was
made using the site digitization data UTM coordinates available from the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas. Three shovel tests, STPs 1031-1033, were placed at this location but failed to produce
any cultural materials. It appears that the site was originally plotted incorrectly or has eroded
away. If misplotted, the site may lie outside the surveyed alignment, or possibly, could be
represented by one of the newly discovered sites 41LB100 or 41LB101, which are located more
than 200 m to the east of 41LB43âs reported UTMs.
41LB97 (prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB97 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 20 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 14). This site sits on top of Capers
Ridge about 30 m south of 41LB112, and is the southerly most site on a 1 km long string of sites
on this N/S leg of Capers Ridge. The site measures 30-40 m E/W by 120 m N/S. Nine of the
shovel tests were positive for cultural materials. We did not delineate the site any further to the
east because the ridge quickly goes to a steep degree slope after walking in that direction from the
top of the ridge. There is a modern circular hog trap in this siteâs perimeter. Two backhoe
trenches (BHTs 25, 26) were excavated within the site (Figures 15, 16). A basin-shaped hearth,
Feature 1, was identified in the south profile of BHT 25. The feature measured 40 cm in width
and 35 cm in depth, and contained a significant amount of minute carbonized wood fragments.
All six of the artifacts from BHT 25 were recovered from within the feature fill.
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east into an old meander scar of the Trinity River, containing seasonally inundated wetlands.
The topography slopes off to the west into a large drainage that drains an area of wide upland at
this end of Capers Ridge. There is a dirt road running along the apex of the ridge that crosses the
site. The vegetation here includes pine, oak, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species. The
vegetation is somewhat thinned out due to a recent forest fire.
The shovel tests and backhoe trenches produced a total of 25 artifacts (Table 3). The
artifacts were recovered from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs), with the majority of the artifacts recovered
from Level 1 (0-10 cmbs). The artifacts included 24 pieces of lithic debitage (20 chert, 4
silicified wood) and one chert dart preform (Figure 17). The presence of the dart preform and
lack of pottery sherds suggest the site dates to the Archaic period.
In summary, 41LB97 is a large prehistoric occupation site that dates to the Archaic
period. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs), and the artifact assemblage
exhibits low artifact density and medium artifact diversity. We recommend that further
investigations be conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential
eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the
artifacts recovered from 41LB97 will be curated at TARL.

41LB98 (prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB98 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 18 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 18). This site sits on top of Capers
Ridge about 35 m north of 41LB104, and is the northern most site on a 1 km long string of sites
on this N/S leg of Capers Ridge. The site measures 30 m E/W by 45 m N/S. Four of the shovel
tests were positive for cultural materials. We did not delineate the site further to the east and west
because the ridge quickly goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions from the
top of the ridge. A single backhoe trench (BHT 35) was excavated within the site, but produced
no cultural materials or features (Figure 19)
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east and west into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a dirt road running along the apex of the ridge that crosses the site. The
vegetation here includes oak, pine, magnolia, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species. The
woods are thin in and around the site where there is a lot of downed timber from the recent
hurricanes.
The shovel testing produced a total of 10 artifacts (Table 4). The artifacts were recovered
from Levels 1-9 (0-90 cmbs), with the majority recovered from Level 2 (10-20 cmbs). The
artifacts consisted of 10 pieces of lithic debitage (7 chert, 3 silicified wood). Though no
chronologically diagnostic materials were recovered, the lack of pottery sherds suggests the site
dates to the Archaic period.
In summary, 41LB98 represents a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits
low artifact density and low artifact diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential
for future study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.
No further archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts
recovered from 41LB98 will be curated at TARL.

41LB99 (prehistoric) Parcel 2
41LB99 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 18 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 20). This site sits on top of Capers Ridge
about 45 m south of 41LB104, 40 m north of 41LB103, and is in the middle of a 1 km long string
of sites on this N/S leg of Capers Ridge. The site measures 70 m E/W by 50 m N/S. Six of the
shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east and west into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a dirt road running along the apex of the ridge and across the ridge that both
cross the site. The vegetation here includes oak, pine, magnolia, yaupon, blackberry, and various
grass species. The woods are sparse in and around the site where there is a lot of downed timber
from the recent hurricanes.
We did not delineate the site any further to the east and west because the ridge quickly
goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions from the top of the ridge. Buried
charcoal was common throughout the profile in the site but was not collected. There was also a
light scatter of modern historic debris in Level 1. There is a modern deer camp just NE of this site
with an old school bus for a cabin. Two backhoe trenches (BHT 31, 32) were excavated within
the site, but produced no cultural materials or features (Figures 21, 22)
The shovel testing produced a total of 17 artifacts (Table 5). The artifacts were recovered
from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The artifacts consisted of 17 pieces of lithic debitage (5 chert, 3
quartzite, 9 silicified wood). Though no chronologically diagnostic materials were recovered, the
lack of pottery sherds suggests the site dates to the Archaic period.
In summary, 41LB99 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that dates to the
Archaic period. The artifact assemblage exhibits medium artifact density and low artifact
diversity. We recommend that further investigations be conducted at the site in order to
determine its significance and potential eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places.
Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered from 41LB99 will be curated at

41LB100 (prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB100 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 10 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 23). This site sits on top of Capers Ridge
about 50 m west of the west end of 41LB42 and about 45 m east of 41LB101. This site is on the
west end of a 1 km long E/W string of sites on this section of Capers Ridge. The site measures
roughly 25 m in diameter. Two of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials. A single
backhoe trench (BHT 12) was excavated within the site, but produced no cultural materials or
features (Figure 24).
The topography at this site consists of a general E/W running ridgeline that slopes off to
the north and south into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a road running along the apex of the ridge, which is on the south side of the
site. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, magnolia, yaupon, and pine.
We did not delineate the site any further to the north and south because the ridge quickly
goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions from the top of the ridge. Buried
charcoal was common throughout the profile in the site but not collected. The vegetation here
includes oak, pine, magnolia, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species.
The shovel testing produced a total of 10 artifacts (Table 6). The artifacts were recovered
from Levels 1-8 (0-70 cmbs). The artifacts consisted of six pieces of lithic debitage (2 chert, 3
silicified wood), three pieces of burned clay, and one Goose Creek plain sherd. The presence of
the pottery sherd indicates the site dates to the Early-Late Ceramic period.
In summary, 41LB100 represents a small prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB100 will be curated at TARL.

41LB101 (prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB101 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 13 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 25). This site sits on top of Capers
Ridge about 75 m west of the west end of 41LB42 and about 45 m west of 41LB100. This site is
on the west end of a 1 km long E/W string of sites on this section of Capers Ridge. The site
measures 35 m E/W by 55 m N/S. Three of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a general E/W running ridgeline that slopes off to
the north and south into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a road running along the apex of the ridge, which is on the north side of the
site. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, magnolia, yaupon, and pine.
We did not delineate the site any further to the north and south because the ridge quickly
goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions from the top of the ridge. Buried
charcoal was evident throughout the profile in the site but not collected.
The shovel testing produced a total of five artifacts (Table 7). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-2, and 7 (0-20, 60-70 cmbs). The artifacts included 5 pieces of lithic
debitage (4 chert, 1 silicified wood). Though no chronologically diagnostic materials were
recovered, the lack of pottery sherds suggests the site dates to the Archaic period.
In summary, 41LB101 represents a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits
low artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future
study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No
further archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts
recovered from 41LB101 will be curated at TARL.

41LB102 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB102 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 8 shovel tests and a well-defined landform (Figure 26). Three of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. A single backhoe trench (BHT 19) was excavated within the site,
but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 27). The site is 275 m east of the east end
of 41LB42 and about 600 m west of 41LB113. The site sits on a prominent high spot on this
E/W stretch of Capers Ridge. The site measures 25 m E/W by 35 m N/S.
The topography at this site consists of a general E/W running ridgeline that slopes off to
the north and south into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a road running along the apex of the ridge, which runs directly through the
site. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, magnolia, yaupon, and pine. This particular site
is on a prominent high point on the ridge.
The site produced one flake from two different shovel tests that were about 20 m apart
from one another (Table 8). The artifacts are recovered from Levels 4 and 9 (30-40, 80-90 cmbs).
This appears to be a very minimal occupation probably representing lithic scatter from more
prominent sites up and down the ridgeline. We did not delineate the site any further to the north
and south because the ridge quickly goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions
from the top of the ridge.
In summary, 41LB102 represents a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits
low artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future
study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No
further archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts
recovered from 41LB102 will be curated at TARL.

41LB103 (prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB103 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 25 shovel tests on a well-defined landform (Figure 28). Eleven of the shovel tests were positive
for cultural materials. Two backhoe trenches (BHT 29, 30) were excavated within the site, both
produced cultural materials (Figures 29, 30). The site is 45 m south of 41LB99 and about 50 m
north of 41LB112. This site is on a string of sites that runs for almost a kilometer on this stretch
of Capers Ridge. The site measures 120 m SW/NE by 60 m SE/NW.
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east and west into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There are two dirt roads running along the ridge, which surround the site. The area is
heavily wooded with oak, elm, holly, yaupon, and pine. This particular site is on a prominent
high point on the ridge.
The shovel tests and backhoe trenches produced a total of 36 artifacts (Table 9). The
artifacts were recovered from Levels 1-6 (0-60 cmbs), with the highest densities in Level 2 (10-20
cmbs). The artifacts consisted of two biface fragments (1 chert, 1 silicified wood), one chert core,
and 33 pieces of lithic debitage (17 chert, 4 quartzite, 12 silicified wood). Though no
chronologically diagnostic materials were recovered, the lack of pottery sherds suggests the site
dates to the Archaic period.
The bulk of the material seems to be concentrated along the easternmost ridgeline. There
was also common charcoal throughout the profile. We did not delineate the site any further to the
east and west because the ridge quickly goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those
directions from the top of the ridge.
In summary, 41LB103 is a large prehistoric occupation site that dates to the Archaic
period. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-6 (0-60 cmbs), and the artifact assemblage
exhibits medium artifact density and diversity. We recommend that further investigations be
conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential eligibility for the

52

National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB103 will be curated at TARL.

41LB104 (prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB104 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 21 shovel tests on a well-defined landform (Figure 31). Two backhoe trenches (BHTs 33, 34)
were excavated within the site (Figures 32, 33). One of these trenches (BHT 104) produced
cultural materials. This site sits on top of Capers Ridge about 45 m north of 41LB99 and about
35 m south of 41LB98, and is at the northern end of a 1 km long string of sites on this N/S leg of
Capers Ridge. The site measures 80 m E/W by 65 m N/S. Nine of the shovel tests were positive
for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east and west into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There is a dirt road running along the apex of the ridge that cuts through the site. The
vegetation here includes oak, pine, magnolia, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species. The
woods are sparse in and around the site where there is a lot of downed timber from recent
hurricanes.
The shovel testing produced a total of 21 artifacts (Table 10). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-4 (0-40 cmbs). The artifacts included 18 pieces of lithic debitage (11
chert, 7 silicified wood) and three pieces of burned clay. Though no chronologically diagnostic
materials were recovered, the lack of pottery sherds suggests the site dates to the Archaic period.
We did not delineate the site any further to the east and west because the ridge quickly
goes to a steep degree slope after walking in those directions from the top of the ridge. Buried
charcoal was common throughout the profile in the site but was not collected. The artifacts
appear to be from 0-40 cmbs as the clay begins to appear by that time in this area. There was also
a light scatter of modern historic debris in Level 1. There is a modern deer camp just SE of this
site with an old school bus for a cabin.
In summary, 41LB104 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that dates to the
Archaic period. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-4 (0-40 cmbs), and the artifact
assemblage exhibits medium artifact density and low artifact diversity. We recommend that
further investigations be conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential
eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the
artifacts recovered from 41LB104 will be curated at TARL.

41LB105 (Prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB105 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 11 shovel tests on a riverside landform (Figure 34). A single backhoe trench (BHT 41) was
excavated within the site, but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 35). The site is
about 375 m ENE of IF 2 and about 200 m NE of 41LB109. The site measures 25 m E/W by 25
m N/S. Four of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of the high bank side of the Trinity River. The site is
about 30 m west of the Trinity River high bank drop off. The topography lies fairly flat with only
a slightly elevated sandy ridge form paralleling the river. 41LB105 sits right on the northern PA
boundary. The site undoubtedly continues northward out of the PA as the landform continues in
that direction. The vegetation here includes oak, pine, sweetgum, yaupon, blackberry, and various
grass species.
The shovel testing produced a total of 5 artifacts (Table 11). The artifacts were recovered
from Levels 2-3 (10-30 cmbs). The artifacts included 4 pieces of lithic debitage (3 chert, 1
quartzite) and one Goose Creek plain sherd. The presence of the pottery sherd indicates the site
dates to the Early-Late Ceramic period.
Some buried charcoal was found throughout the profile in the site but was not collected.
There was some historic debris found in the upper levels of this site that were no doubt associated
with 41LB41, a historic site nearby that had been national register tested previously and found
ineligible.
In summary, the portion of the prehistoric occupation site 41LB105 that is located within
the project APE is small in size, and exhibits a low artifact density and low artifact diversity. The
portion of the site that lies within the APE does not appear to possess the potential for future
study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No
further archeological work is recommended. Should impacts be planned for the portion of the site
located outside the current APE boundary, additional investigations should be conducted to
determine the NRHP eligibility for the additional site area. Once the current report is finalized,
the artifacts recovered from 41LB105 will be curated at TARL.

41LB106 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB106 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 13 shovel tests on a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 36). A single backhoe trench
(BHT 1) was excavated within the site, but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 37).
The site is about 1700 m WSW of 41LB102 and about 200 m NNE of 41LB107. The site
measures 50 m E/W by 35 m N/S and probably averages 50 cm in height. Four of the shovel tests
were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a well-defined sandy mound in the uplands, among
other sandy mounds. The site is about 300 m west of the fossil upland edge where an old channel
of the Trinity River used to run. The topography around the mound is fairly flat, low lying, and
seasonally inundated with water. The vegetation on the mound includes oak, pine, sweetgum,
yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species. Off mound vegetation is similar but includes a
few water tolerant species.
The shovel testing produced a total of 6 artifacts (Table 12). The artifacts were recovered
from Levels 2-5 (10-50 cmbs). The artifacts included 5 pieces of lithic debitage (3 chert, 1
quartzite, 1 silicified wood) and one Goose Creek plain sherd. The presence of the pottery sherd
indicates the site dates to the Early-Late Ceramic period. Some buried charcoal and fired clay
fragments were found throughout the profile in the site but not collected.
In summary, 41LB106 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is
thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB106 will be curated at TARL.

41LB107 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB107 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 6 shovel tests on a well-defined sandy bermed pond landform (Figure 38). The site is about
200 m SSW of 41LB106. The site measures 12 m E/W by 25 m N/S and probably averages 50
cm in height. Three of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a well-defined bermed pond in the uplands that has
sandy berms surrounding a low area that is seasonally inundated with water. The site is about
300 m west of the fossil upland edge where an old channel of the Trinity River used to run. The
topography around the berm is fairly flat, low lying, and seasonally inundated with water. The
vegetation on the berm includes oak, pine, sweetgum, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass
species. And off mound vegetation includes the same only with a few water tolerant species.
The shovel testing produced a total of six artifacts (Table 13). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-8 (0-80 cmbs). The artifacts included five pieces of lithic debitage (3
chert, 2 silicified wood) and one Goose Creek plain sherd. The presence of the pottery sherd
indicates the site dates to the Early-Late Ceramic period. Some buried charcoal was found
throughout the profile in the site but not collected.
In summary, 41LB107 is a small prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low artifact
density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is
thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB107 will be curated at TARL.

41LB108 (Prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB108 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 10 shovel tests on a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 39). The site is about 75
m WSW of 41LB109. The site measures 35 m E/W by 20 m N/S and probably averages 30 cm in
height. Two of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of a somewhat eroded sandy mound on the high, right
bank-side of the Trinity River. The site is about 120 m west of the Trinity River. The topography
around the mound slopes slightly toward the east, and toward the river. The vegetation around the
site includes oak, pine, sweetgum, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species.
The shovel testing produced a total of three artifacts (Table 14). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The artifacts consisted of three pieces of lithic debitage
(2 chert, 1 silicified wood). Though no chronologically diagnostic materials were recovered, the
lack of pottery sherds suggests the site dates to the Archaic period. The artifacts occur on and off
of the mound. There was also some historic glass found in Level 1.
In summary, 41LB108 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB108 will be curated at TARL.

41LB109 (Prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB109 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 12 shovel tests on a riverside high bank landform (Figure 40). The site is about 75 m
ENE of 41LB108. The site measures 45 m E/W by 30 m N/S. Four of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. A single backhoe trench (BHT 40) was excavated within the site,
but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 41).
The topography at this site consists of a slightly eastward sloping flat area on the high,
right bank-side of the Trinity River. The site is about 20 m west of the Trinity River. The
vegetation around the site includes oak, pine, sweetgum, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass
species.
The shovel testing produced a total of 12 artifacts (Table 15). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The artifacts included 12 pieces of lithic debitage (9
chert, 3 silicified wood). Though no chronologically diagnostic materials were recovered, the
lack of pottery sherds suggests the site dates to the Archaic period.
In summary, 41LB109 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered

41LB110 (Prehistoric) Parcel 1
41LB110 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 9 shovel tests (Figure 42). The site is about 120 m SSW of IF 2 and 320 m east of
41LB98. The site measures 35 m E/W by 15 m N/S. Two of the shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials.
The topography at this site consists of the section of ground between the end of the
Capers Ridge landform and the Trinity River. This area slopes gradually from Capers Ridge in
the west to the river in the east. As the ground descends toward the river, the ridge character of
Capers Ridge gradually flattens out. This site is on the south side remnant of Capers Ridge just
above a seasonally inundated cypress wetland. The woods are sparse in and around the site where
there is a lot of downed timber from recent hurricanes. The vegetation around the site includes
oak, pine, sweetgum, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass species.
The shovel testing produced a total of three artifacts (Table 16). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1 and 2 (0-10, 20-30 cmbs). The artifacts consisted of three pieces of
lithic debitage (2 chert, 1 silicified wood).
In summary, 41LB110 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered

41LB111 (Prehistoric) Parcel 8
41LB111 is a buried prehistoric campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 7 shovel tests on a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 43). The site is 160 m SSW of
41LB115. The site is atop an elliptical shaped sandy mound that measures 15 m in diameter by 1
m in height. Two of the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography here consists of a natural sandy mound in a flat wooded area in the
uplands near the east end of the PA. There is a pipeline that barely clips the site on its west side.
The vegetation at the site consists of pine, oak, elm, yaupon, blackberry, and various grass
species.
The shovel testing produced a total of four artifacts (Table 17). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 3-5 (20-50 cmbs). The artifacts included one piece of silicified wood
lithic debitage and three Goose Creek plain sherds (2 plain, 1 incised). The presence of the
pottery sherd indicates the site dates to the Early-Late Ceramic period.
In summary, 41LB111 is a small prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low artifact
density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is
thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered

41LB112 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB112 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 47 shovel tests on a well-defined landform (Figure 44). Nineteen of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. Two backhoe trenches (BHTs 27, 28) were excavated within the
site, one of which produced cultural materials (Figures 45, 46). The site is 45 m SSW of
41LB103 and about 40 m north of 41LB97. This site is on a string of sites that runs for almost a
kilometer on this N/S stretch of Capers Ridge. The site measures 145 m N/S by 60 m E/W.
The topography at this site consists of a general N/S running ridgeline that slopes off to
the east and west into old meander scars of the Trinity River that contain seasonally inundated
wetlands. There are also several remnants of sandy mounds that appear to be artifact
concentration areas within this site. There are two dirt roads running along the ridge, which
surround the site. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, holly, yaupon, pine, blackberry, and
various grasses. There has been a recent forest fire in this site area that has cleared much of the
smaller vegetation and burned some trees all the way through their root balls.
The shovel tests and backhoe trenches produced a total of 96 artifacts (Table 18). The
artifacts were recovered from the surface and from Levels 1-6 (0-60 cmbs), with the highest
densities in Levels 1-2 (0-20 cmbs). The artifacts included 78 pieces of lithic debitage (42 chert,
7 quartzite, 29 silicified wood), a dart point (Kent, Figure 47) and dart preform (Gary/Kent,
Figure 48), four tested cobbles (1 chert, 3 silicified wood), and 12 Goose Creek plain sherds. The
presence of the dart preform and the pottery sherds indicate the site dates to the Early Ceramic
period.
The bulk of the material seems to be concentrated around three sandy mound remnants,
not necessarily all on the mounds. There was also common charcoal throughout the profile but as
mentioned before, there has been a recent extensive forest fire here that has burned many trees
deep into the ground. We tried delineating down the 45-degree slope to the east of the site and
were still getting cultural material. We came to the conclusion that these positive tests
represented slope wash of soils and artifacts from further up on the flat part of the site. The
artifacts are present from 0-60 cmbs in this site. The character of this site is that of obvious
occupation zones interspersed by stretches of thin lithic scatter. The main artifact-producing
portion of this site is around the eroded sandy mound area. Shovel tests 297, 586, 589, 590, 765,
and 778 all had artifacts from several layers. This site seems to hold the possibility of intact
features with stratified deposits.
In summary, 41LB112 is a large prehistoric occupation site that dates to the Early
Ceramic period. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-6 (0-60 cmbs), and the artifact
assemblage exhibits medium artifact density and diversity. We recommend that further
investigations be conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential
eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the

41LB113 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB113 is a prehistoric buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 6 shovel tests on a well-defined landform (Figure 50). Two of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. A single backhoe trench (BHT 23) was excavated within the site,
but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 49). The site is 600 m east of 41LB102 and
about 140 m WSW of 41LB114. The site measures 20 m N/S by 30 m E/W.
The topography at this site consists of a large flat area of uplands between the E/W and
N/S legs of Capers Ridge. This large flat area is bisected by a deep drainage that does not appear
on the topographic map. This site sits on the western bank of this drainage just east of an eroded
sandy mound. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, yaupon, pine, and various grasses.
The shovel testing produced a total of three pieces of chert lithic debitage (Table 19).
The artifacts were recovered from Levels 1-2 (0-20 cmbs).
In summary, 41LB113 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB113 will be curated at TARL.

41LB114 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB114 is a prehistoric buried campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 9 shovel tests on an eroded sandy mound landform (Figure 52). Five of the shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials. A single backhoe trench (BHT 24) was excavated within the site,
but produced no cultural materials or features (Figure 51). The site is 140 m east of 41LB113 and
about 100 m W of 41LB97. The site measures 30 m N/S by 25 m E/W.
The topography at this site consists of a large flat area of uplands between the E/W and
N/S legs of Capers Ridge. This large flat area is bisected by a deep drainage that does not appear
on the topographic map. This site sits on the remnant of a sandy mound on eastern bank of this
drainage. The area is heavily wooded with oak, elm, yaupon, pine, and various grasses.
The shovel testing produced a total of eight artifacts (Table 20). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The artifacts consisted of eight pieces of lithic debitage
(6 chert, 2 silicified wood).
In summary, 41LB114 is a medium-sized prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low
artifact density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB114 will be curated at TARL.

41LB115 (Prehistoric) Parcel 8
41LB115 is a buried prehistoric campsite identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 8 shovel tests and a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 53). The site is 160 m NNE
of 41LB111. The site is atop a 12 m E/W by 18 m N/S by 1m in height sandy mound. Two of
the shovel tests were positive for cultural materials.
The topography here consists of a natural sandy mound in a flat wooded area in the
uplands near the east end of the PA. There is a pipeline that barely clips the site on its east side.
There are also some drainage ditch disturbances to the site on its west side. The vegetation at the
site consists of pine, oak, elm, yaupon, blackberry, and various grasses.
The shovel testing produced a total of two artifacts (Table 21). The artifacts were
recovered from Levels 2-3 (10-30 cmbs). The artifacts included one piece of silicified wood
lithic debitage, and one Goose Creek plain sherd.
In summary, 41LB115 is a small prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low artifact
density and diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is
thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB115 will be curated at TARL.

41LB116 (Prehistoric) Parcel 43b
41LB116 is a buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the basis of 7
shovel tests on a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 54). The site is 15 m in diameter
and 1 m in height. Two of the eight shovel tests were positive for cultural material.
The topography here is a flat wooded area in the uplands near the west end of the PA.
The woods are thin pine, oak, yaupon, and elm. The area is generally flat and there are a few of
these natural sandy mounds in the area.
The site produced two pieces of chert lithic debitage at 20-30 cmbs of a single shovel test
on top of the mound (Table 22). This appears to be a very minimal occupation probably
representing an overnight hunterâs camp.
In summary, 41LB116 is a small prehistoric occupation site that exhibits low artifact
density and artifact diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study,
and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered
from 41LB116 will be curated at TARL.

41LB117 (Prehistoric) Parcel 42
41LB117 is a buried prehistoric camp site identified and horizontally defined on the basis
of 28 shovel tests and a well-defined sandy mound cluster (Figure 55). Two backhoe trenches
(BHTs 43, 44) were excavated within the site, but produced no cultural materials or features
(Figures 56, 57). The site is about 3,000 m north of 41LB116.
The topography here is a flat wooded area in the uplands near the west end of the PA.
There is a cluster of about 12 sandy mounds here that are very prominent. The mounds average
20 m in diameter and over 1 m in height and are about 10-15 m apart. The area between the
mounds is low and seasonally inundated with water. The woods are thin pine, oak, yaupon, and
elm on the mounds with the same in between the mounds only with more water tolerant species.
This site involves three of these mounds that are generally in a row E/W of each other. The site is
100 m E/W by 35 m N/S.
Six of the shovel tests were positive for cultural material. The cultural material was
found only on the mounds and never off of them. The shovel testing produced a total of 22
artifacts (Table 23). The artifacts were recovered from Levels 1-8 (0-80 cmbs). The artifacts
included nine pieces of chert lithic debitage, the medial fragment of a biface, and 12 Goose Creek
plain sherds. The presence of the pottery sherds indicate the site dates to the Early-Late Ceramic
period.
In summary, 41LB117 is a large prehistoric occupation site that dates to the Early-Late
Ceramic period. The cultural deposits extend from Levels 1-8 (0-80 cmbs), and the artifact
assemblage exhibits medium artifact density and diversity. We recommend that further
investigations be conducted at the site in order to determine its significance and potential
eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. Once the current report is finalized, the
artifacts recovered from 41LB117 will be curated at TARL.

41LB118 (prehistoric) Parcel 4
41LB118 is a prehistoric site on a sandy ridge along a fairly deep ENE/WSW drainage
that drains a large flat area joining two sections of Capers Ridge (Figure 58). The site sits on the
same edge of the drainage and about 100 m north of 41LB114. The current vegetation at the site
is a mixture of pine with some oak and other hardwoods, yaupon, and blackberry.
A single shovel test was conducted and produced 4 pieces of lithic debitage from Level 1
(Table 24). There was also minimal charcoal in the profile. Clay was reached in the test at 18
cmbs. The site was not fully delineated because it lies outside the LBITP ROW and is no longer
in the APE of the proposed project. The level of investigations conducted at this site were
insufficient to assess it for NRHP eligibility. Consequently, additional delineation and
assessment of site eligibility should be conducted if future impacts are proposed for the site.

41HR1073 (Historic, early-mid twentieth century) Parcel 53
41HR1073 is a buried historic site that sits on the upland edge above Luce Bayou (Figure
59). The site was identified and horizontally defined on the basis of 34 shovel tests. Horizontal
site dimensions are 115 m N/S by 95 m E/W. Seventeen of the shovel tests produced cultural
material. 41HR1073 is on the western end of the Luce Bayou alignment near the town of
Huffman.
The topography consists of a flat wooded area on the upland edge close to Luce Bayou.
The woods are older growth with pine, oak, elm, cedar, yaupon, blackberry, and others. A
structure is depicted at the location of this site on the 1920 and 1949 topographic maps. At the
time of investigation there were no structures still standing, or above ground evidence remaining
of the site.
The shovel testing produced 108 typical farmstead type artifacts (Table 25). They were
recovered from Levels 1-4 (0-40 cmbs), with the majority in Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The
artifacts included 22 sherds of historic ceramics (1 porcelain, 4 stoneware, 1 terra cotta, 16
whiteware), two pieces of metal hardware (1 rivet, 1 thumbtack), five cut nails and fragments, 28
wire nails and fragments, 16 shards of flat glass, 27 shards of curved glass, and eight brick
fragments. There were no diagnostic artifacts that would indicate a date earlier than the early 20th
century.
No noticeable subsurface features were identified other than a single sinkhole at the NE
corner of the site. Excavation of a single shovel test (STP 482) in the sinkhole produced artifacts
from 0-40 cm (Levels 1, 3, 4) below the surface. There was also a line of charcoal in the test at 8
inches below the surface. This small sinkhole could indicate a feature associated with the
structure that was once here such as a well or cistern. But again, the artifacts found did not
indicate occupation before the early 20th century. The site does not appear to possess the
potential for future study, and is thus not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places. No further archeological work is recommended. Once the current report is
finalized, the diagnostic artifacts recovered from 41HR1073 will be curated at TARL.

41HR1074 (Prehistoric) Parcel 52
41HR1074 is a buried lithic scatter identified and horizontally defined on the basis of 8
shovel tests and a well-defined sandy mound landform (Figure 60). The site is atop an elliptical
shaped sandy mound that measures 15 m in diameter by 1 m in height. Two of the eight shovel
tests were positive for cultural materials. Recovered artifacts consisted of lithic debitage only.
The topography here is a flat wooded area in the uplands near the west end of the PA.
The woods are thin pine, oak, and elm. The area is generally flat and there is roughly 4-6 of these
natural sandy mounds in a cluster here. There has been modern historic occupation near this site,
but the sandy mound appears to have been only minimally impacted. There is lots of water
loving understory immediately around the mound.
The site produced one piece of chert lithic debitage from each of two different shovel
tests that were only a meter apart from one another on top of the mound (Table 26). This appears
to be a very minimal occupation probably representing an overnight hunterâs camp.
In summary, 41HR1074 is a small prehistoric site that exhibits low artifact density and
diversity. The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is thus not
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further archeological work
is recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the artifacts recovered from 41HR1074
will be curated at TARL.

41HR1075 (Historic) Parcel 51
41HR1075 is a historic site that sits on the east side of State Highway 2100 just north of
Huffman, Texas (Figure 61). The site was identified, and horizontally defined on the basis of 37
shovel tests. Horizontal site dimensions are 55 m N/S by 35 m E/W. Twenty-one of the shovel
tests produced cultural materials.
The topography here consists of a flat wooded area next to the highway. The woods are
older growth with pecan, pine, oak, elm, yaupon, blackberry, and others.
The shovel testing produced 551 typical farmstead type artifacts (Table 27). They were
recovered from Levels 1-8 (0-80 cmbs), with the majority in Levels 1-2 (0-20 cmbs). The
artifacts included 36 sherds of historic ceramics, two pieces of metal hardware (1 axe head), 199
pieces of indeterminate metal, 18 cut nails and fragments, six wire nails and fragments, four
pieces of wire, 18 shards of flat glass, 32 shards of curved glass, 147 bricks and brick fragments,
nine pieces of mortar, one plastic button, and 79 pieces of faunal bone (some burned). There
were no diagnostic artifacts that would indicate a date earlier than the late nineteenth to early 20th
century. Also, no noticeable sub-surface features were identified other than a single sinkhole in
the south central portion of the site. Excavation of a single shovel test (STP 980) in the sinkhole
produced artifacts from 10-80 cm (Levels 2-8) below the surface. This small sinkhole could
indicate a feature associated with the structure such as a well or cistern.
The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is thus not eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further archeological work is
recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the diagnostic artifacts recovered from
41HR1075 will be curated at TARL.

41HR1076 (Historic) Parcel 47 (May Family Tract)
The site is a historic farmstead identified as the property of the May family. A total of 38
shovel tests were excavated, of which 32 were positive for cultural materials (Figure 62).
Recovered artifacts consisted of historic ceramics, glass, iron, brick, mortar, and square nails. As
with the nearby historic site 41HR1075, this site has a small sunken spot that proved to contain a
debris deposit after a small test probe was excavated in its center. This area is a cattle pasture
with a few very mature pecan, oak, sycamore, yaupon, and pine trees. The topography is flat with
noticeable areas where the old road came through the property. There are also some mound-like
features along the old entry road that may be associated with its construction.
On Wednesday, September 9, 2009, Roger Moore, Sarah Blake, and John Ferguson went
to the May family home to meet with Mr. May and his daughter Robin to discuss the possibility
of a family oak tree and home site on their property which a realignment of the LBITP would
affect. The Mays gave us some information and family photos from the early 1900s that showed
the oak and a couple of sycamore trees in association with a wood frame home. They then
showed us the location of the trees on their property and the vantage point from which they
believed the photos were taken. The spot looked convincing enough for us to go ahead with some
shovel testing around the general area to try and assess whether there was a home site there, how
old it might be, and whether there were any intact remnants.
The home site area is now used for cattle grazing. There are a few round bale hay feeders
scattered across the lot. These feeders have been in place for so long that the elevation of the
ground beneath them is a good deal higher than the surrounding area. The vegetation includes
quite a few very mature trees, most of which could date back to the time of occupation or earlier.
There is the one large 17 ft circumference oak, two or three large sycamore trees, the same
number of old pecan trees, and quite a few younger trees of the same species. The surface of the
ground is fairly flat excepting for a couple of old roadbeds to the north and south of the proposed
home site. There are also a couple of low mounded areas to the north of the home site that follow
the old roadbed.
On September 17 and 18, 2009, we returned to the May family tract and did some shovel
testing and site delineation in the site we had looked at with the Mays in the previous week. We
excavated a total of 38 shovel tests, six of which were negative. The artifacts seemed to come
from generally levels 1-3. One of the tests, STP 486, recovered artifacts down to Level 8. STP
490, located next to a suspicious looking depression, had artifacts down to Level 6. The
depression we found later was previously a hole (well, cistern), as a probe in its center produced
an abundance of modern glass and ceramics. It is evident from STP 515 that the soils around the
home site are probably intact as we found an intact wagon wheel rim in Level 1 that was still
perfectly round. If the land had been plowed over, the rim would no doubt have been affected in
some manner. We did not locate any well-defined features during the shovel testing that would
indicate an exact location of the house site. However, based on the sheer numbers of artifacts per
shovel test, it appears we were able to identify the area of most intense occupation activity. STP
521 is located about 10 m west of the possible well/cistern/privy pit, and contained a total of 315
artifacts. Other high-count tests within 20 m of STP 315 produced total artifact numbers of 124,
77, 78, 55, 51, and 44 respectively. The artifact counts per test decrease significantly after this 20
m radius. The old roadbed that led to the house runs about 25 m north of the highest count shovel
test and the artifact counts subside substantially north of this. The artifacts do pick up again
about 40 m south of STP 521 but the counts are not as high.
The shovel testing produced 210 typical farmstead type artifacts (Table 28). They were
recovered from Levels 1-8 (0-80 cmbs), with the majority in Levels 1-3 (0-30 cmbs). The

106

artifacts included five sherds of historic ceramics, four pieces of metal hardware, 34 pieces of
indeterminate metal, 17 wire nails and fragments, 25 pieces of wire, nine shards of flat glass, 29
shards of curved glass, 80 bricks and brick fragments, one piece of mortar, one round of modern
ammunition, one piece of jewelry, and four pieces of faunal bone. The artifacts indicate a period
of occupation around the turn of the 20th century or later.
The site does not appear to possess the potential for future study, and is thus not eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. No further archeological work is
recommended. Once the current report is finalized, the diagnostic artifacts recovered from
41HR1076 will be curated at TARL

IF 1 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
Isolated find (IF) 1 produced only one piece of lithic debitage and will be designated as
an isolated find (Figure 63). The isolated find was identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 8 shovel tests on a well-defined landform. One of the shovel tests was positive for
cultural materials. This location appears to represent an isolated find and will not be recorded as
a site.

IF 2 (Prehistoric) Parcel 1
Isolated find (IF) 2 is a prehistoric location identified and horizontally defined on the
basis of 8 shovel tests on an eroded sandy mound landform (Figure 64). One shovel test was
positive for cultural materials. A single piece of lithic debitage was recovered. This location
appears to represent an isolated find and will not be recorded as a site.

IF 3 (Prehistoric) Parcel 4
This is a sandy mound far from water that had a single flake in the initial shovel test
(Figure 65). We came back and put 4 more tests at the location with no more positive results.
This location appears to represent an isolated find and will not be recorded as a site.

Backhoe Trenches Placed in Areas Between Sites
A total of 19 backhoe trenches were placed between sites located on Capers Ridge.
Depending on the topography and the locations of identified site boundaries, these were located at
intervals of approximately 150-200 m. None of these trenches produced cultural materials or
features. Locations of the trenches are shown on Figures 67-85.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc. (MAC) conducted what began as a
reconnaissance-level pedestrian cultural resource survey of a Capers Ridge Pump Station location
and diversion alignment for the LBITP in Harris and Liberty Counties, Texas, and ultimately was
expanded and enhanced, with constant agency consultation and agreement, into a 100 percent
Intensive Cultural Resources Survey. That final product is presented herein. The pedestrian
cultural resource investigations were performed between January 5, 2009 and April 2010. After
consultation with the THC, mechanical trenching was conducted along portions of the LBITP
alignment during December 2011. The project area is depicted on the Huffman, Plum Grove,
Simmons Bottom, and Capers Ridge, Texas 7.5-minute USGS topographic quadrangle maps
(Figures 1 and 1A through 1D). The initial objective of the investigation was to subdivide the
project alignment into areas of high and low probability of the occurrence of cultural resources
sites, as well as incorporate data on known cultural resource sites and surveys. This objective
was modified, however, due to the large number of sites encountered. These investigations
(MAC Report of Investigations No. 553) were conducted at the request of DESCO LP, WCW
International, Inc., AECOM, and the Coastal Water Authority, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 5082. The LBITP is also subject to permitting under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
and there is a USACE, Galveston District, Permit SWG-2009-00188 submitted for the proposed
LBITP.
The pedestrian survey of the project area reported herein ultimately included both surface
and subsurface (shovel test and backhoe) examination. A total of 1,046 shovel tests and 44
backhoe trenches were excavated. The investigations relocated one previously recorded site,
41LB42, and identified 26 new archeological sites (41HR1073-1076 and 41LB97-118). Four
locations where shovel testing produced only a single prehistoric artifact were determined to be
isolated finds (IF 1-4) and were not designated as archeological sites. A total of 1,568 artifacts
were recovered during these investigations.
Of the 26 newly discovered locations, three are historic and 23 are prehistoric.
41HR1073 and 41HR1076 appear to be historic farmsteads that date to the early 20th century,
while 41HR1075 contained artifacts associated with late 19th century occupations. All three
appear to have potential subsurface features that may be partially filled cisterns. However, due to
their late periods of occupation, none of these three historic sites appear to demonstrate potential
for future study, and thus are not recommended for further investigations. Further, 41HR1076 is
a historic farmstead located on the May family property (Parcel 47; Appendix 3) and the LBITP
will avoid this property entirely. Once the current report is finalized, the diagnostic and nonredundant artifacts recovered from the three historic sites will be curated at TARL. No
potentially historic structures were observed within or near the survey alignment.
Sixteen of the prehistoric sites, 41HR1074, 41LB98, 41LB100, 41LB101, 41LB102,
41LB105, 41LB106, 41LB107, 41LB108, 41LB109, 41LB110, 41LB111, 41LB113, 41LB114,
41LB115, and 41LB116, each appear to contain deposits of very limited artifact density and
diversity, and are not recommended for further investigations. At one of these sites, 41LB105,
only the portion of the site that was located within the APE was delineated and assessed for
NRHP eligibility. Should impacts be planned for the portion of 41LB105 located outside the
current APE boundary, additional investigations should be conducted to determine the NRHP
eligibility for the additional site area.

121

One newly discovered site, 41LB118, was identified in an area that no longer is part of
the LBITP ROW. This site was not fully delineated since it is no longer in the APE of the
proposed project. The level of investigations conducted at this site was insufficient to assess it
for NRHP eligibility. Consequently, additional delineation and assessment of site eligibility
should be conducted if future impacts are proposed for the site.

Six of the newly discovered prehistoric sites, 41LB97, 41LB99, 41LB103, 41LB104,
41LB112, and 41LB117, appear to potentially contain intact cultural deposits that exhibit lowmoderate artifact densities and diversity. Each of these six sites warrant further investigations to
determine their potential significance for future research. These sites should be avoided, or if this
is impossible, additional investigations will be necessary to determine eligibility prior to the
initiation of construction.
The previously identified prehistoric site, 41LB42, was greatly expanded in size by the
current investigations, and areas of denser and more diverse artifact concentrations within the site
were identified that warrant further investigations. Another previously identified prehistoric site,
41LB43, could not be relocated at the published coordinates. This site was either originally
plotted incorrectly or has eroded away. If misplotted, the site may lie outside the surveyed
alignment or could be represented by one of the newly discovered sites 41LB100 or 41LB101
(which are located more than 200 m to the east of the siteâs reported UTMs). Once the current

122

report is finalized, the artifacts recovered from 41LB42 and the 23 newly discovered prehistoric
sites will be curated at TARL.
In addition, Parcel 43A (North) would require survey-level investigations after right of
entry (ROE) has been obtained, or when property acquisition has been completed. These
recommendations are subject to review and concurrence. The parcel location map is located in
Appendix 1 as Figure 1-1.
In the event that additional archeological deposits or features should be encountered
during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

APPENDIX 3
Historic Sites in the Gilbert Brooks League, Harris County, Texas
Terri Meyers
Preservation Central, Inc., Austin, Texas
This section of the report discusses the origins and development of two historic period
resources in the Gilbert Brooks League, Harris County, Texas. It is part of a larger archeological
survey and assessment of historic cultural resources in support of a proposed revised alignment
segment of the Luce Bayou Project corridor. This section contains a description of the
methodology used by the Project Historian to develop a context within which the historic-period
homesteads identified as 41HR1075 on State Highway 2100 (also known as the Crosby-Huffman
Road), and 41HR1076, on Wolf Road, can be understood and evaluated. Both homesteads lie
within the Gilbert Brooks League (Abstract 6). Although the league straddles the Harris-Liberty
County line northeast of Houston, most of the subject properties lie within Harris County. In
addition to the context, this report also provides a brief history of each site, including
identification of early landowners and land uses through the historic period ending in 1960.
Methodology
The Project Historian conducted primary and secondary research to develop a historic
context to cover European exploration and early American settlement for the area including the
subject land parcels 41HR1075 (Huffman-Somers homesteads) and 41HR1076 (Samuel May
homestead). It includes a narrative history of the May and Huffman families who were among
the first Americans to settle in western Liberty and eastern Harris counties in the late 1830s, and
of Ben Somers, who later purchased a farm on the Crosby-Huffman Road, possibly from
descendants of the Huffman family.
The Project Historian first reviewed documentation supplied by the Project Archeologist,
Roger Moore, including property descriptions, deed references, and a preliminary archeological
report. She attempted to trace a chain of title from the various deed references and property
descriptions to identify early owners and occupants in the project area.
Secondary source materials provided general background material on the region in which
the project area lies. The Project Historian obtained the following books for their relevance to the
subject property and surrounding area: Houston: A History (David G. McComb, 1981), Seven
Pines: Its Occupants and Their Letters, 1825-1872 (Camilla Davis Trammel, 1986), and Liberty,
Liberty County, and the Atascosito District (Miriam Partlow, 1974). She then accessed articles
from The Handbook of Texas Online about Liberty and Harris counties, the town of Liberty, and
the communities of Crosby, Huffman, and Lynchburg, which are among the oldest and closest
communities to the subject properties. From these sources the Project Historian gained an
understanding of the historical settlement and development of western Liberty and eastern Harris
counties.
Further investigations were conducted at the Texas Historical Commission library which
houses files on all Texas National Register properties and state historical markers. The Project
Historian reviewed all files for properties and subjects in Liberty and Harris counties. No direct
links could be made to the subject properties but some files were copied for contextual
information. The Project Historian also reviewed files for Texas Family Land Heritage properties
at the Texas Department of Agriculture. The Billy J. Smith Ranch on FM 2100 was registered in
the program. The ranch lies on the Crosby-Huffman Road, very close to TS-30. In fact, Billy J.

184

Smithâs son, Guy, married a direct descendant of David Huffman, Willie Mary Scott, and the
couple lived on the ranch for the remainder of their lives. No other files were directly linked to
the May or Huffman properties but several nearby farms were included in the program and files
for these farms and ranches were copied for contextual information.
Since little or no references to the May or Huffman families were found in secondary
sources, primary research was essential to the project. The Project Historian reviewed
Population, Agricultural, and Slave schedules in the United States census records at the Texas
State Archives and Library and online through Heritage Quest. She also researched 19th century
ad valorum tax records, voter registration rolls, and land certificate records for the May and
Huffman families at the State Archives.
Primary records proved fruitful. Although the first diennial census of Texas was not
conducted until 1850, 20th century historians have compiled a record of male occupants in Texas
in 1840 based on a variety of legal documents including tax and land grant records. Samuel May,
the original settler of the May Farmstead, was identified as a resident of Texas in 1840, on the
basis of his land grant issued April 1838. According to this unofficial census, David Huffman
was not living in Texas in 1840. His conditional land grant was issued in 1841. Family accounts,
however, claim that Huffman lived in Texas in the late 1830s and founded the community of
Huffman in 1839. Susan Huffman, a relative of David, also lived in the area by 1840. The May
and Huffman families appear in the 1850 and 1860 census records for Harris County. Neither
May, Huffman, nor their immediate neighbors appear in the 1870 Population or Agricultural
census records; they were likely neglected by the enumerator as they were all recorded ten years
later in the 1880 census. By the turn of the 20th century, Samuel May, David Huffman, and Susan
Huffman had passed from the scene but several of their children including Adam Huffman and
Robert May appear in early 20th century census records.
Census records show that the Huffmans came to Texas from Louisiana. Samuel May,
although born in Mississippi, lived in Louisiana where he met his wife, Sarah Huffman May. As
southerners, they would have been accustomed to slavery. Slave schedules for 1850 and 1860
show that several members of the Huffman family owned three or four slaves but May owned no
slaves in 1850 and only one in 1860. Few of their immediate neighbors owned significant
numbers of slaves and many owned none. Agricultural records from the antebellum period
indicate that little plantation farming was conducted in the area which could account for the
relatively small number of slaves.
The Project Historian traveled to eastern Harris County and met with archeologist Roger
Moore to view the project area for a better understanding of the land and its resources. She
returned to the area and conducted research at the Sam Houston Regional Archives in Liberty.
No information directly related to the subject properties was found there.
Ms. Myers obtained a copy of the 1966 Edgar Tobin Aerial Survey ownership map of
northern Harris County to identify property owners at the end of the historic period. She found
that several members of the Somers family, including father Ben H. Somers and his sons, Joe and
Willie, owned the land containing the Huffman Cemetery and surrounding property. A
comparison between the ownership maps and the survey site maps indicated that either Willie
Somers or his father, Ben, owned the subject property (TS-30) in 1966. From their locations
relative to neighboring properties in early 20th century census records, the Project Historian was
able to determine that Ben Somers purchased the land between 1900 and 1910. His sons lived
with him through 1930. He later subdivided his property into three farms as shown on the Tobin
map; he retained his homestead and provided a farm for each of his sons.

185

From these secondary and primary sources the Project Historian wrote a general context
for the project area and more specific histories for the subject properties.
Historic Context: Western Liberty and Eastern Harris Counties
European Exploration and Settlement
Although most of the Gilbert Brooks League now lies in northeastern Harris County, its
early history may be more closely tied to that of nearby Liberty County, on the east. Prehistoric
Indian artifacts found in Liberty attest to its occupation as early as 1,000 B. C. and in Harris
County as early as 4,000 B.C. It was not until the 18th century that Europeans began to explore
the area in earnest. From the early 18th century to the early 19th century, Spain and France vied
for hegemony throughout the region now encompassed by Liberty and Harris counties. France
hoped to extend its reach westward from its territory in Louisiana while Spain considered the area
part of its vast domain to the south and west. As early as the 1730s, French explorers from
Louisiana ventured into present Harris County where they traded with local Indians at Spring
Creek. They also appeared on the Gulf coast in present Liberty County. Although they
established no settlements, the French carried on trade in present East Texas until about 1745.
When the Spanish heard rumors of the French intrusion into what they considered their territory,
they sent exploratory expeditions to discourage further French forays into the region.
To establish a presence in the area, the Spanish built missions and presidios. In 1756,
they built Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Luz Mission to serve the Akokisa and Bidai in present Liberty
County. They also founded San Augustin de Ahumada Presidio near the mission. By the
following year, Spanish maps depicted the settlement as Atascosito and outlined the Atascosito
Road, which crossed the Trinity River near the present town of Liberty. At the same time, they
erected a mission and presidio complex at the mouth of the Trinity River in present Harris
County. The missions and presidios were short-lived, however; Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Luz was
destroyed in a storm in 1766 and San Augustin de la Ahumada presidio was abandoned in 1772.
A small trading outpost called Arkokisa or Arkosisa lingered near the later townsite of Liberty,
from about 1770 to 1790. The mission and presidio at the mouth of the Trinity River were
abandoned by 1771 (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ; Henson âHarris Countyâ).
Direct Spanish influence in the area faded in the late 18th century and French ex-patriots
sought to fill the void. In 1818, Charles F. A. Lallemand and Antoine Rigaurd sought to establish
a refuge for exiled Bonapartists near the present town of Liberty. The effort proved futile,
however, and its demise spelled an end to further French ambitions in the territory (Kleiner,
âLiberty Countyâ).
Mexican Texas and the War for Texas Independence
While the Spanish succeeded in staving off French intrusion, they were unable to stem
the flow of American immigrants to Texas, many of whom came from Louisiana and Mississippi,
attracted by the prospect of open land. Some of the first Americans in Texas launched
filibustering expeditions to aid Mexican Republicans in their rebellion against Spain. Mexico
won its independence in 1820 and assumed authority over present Texas, including present
Liberty and Harris counties. After Mexico won its sovereignty from Spain in 1820, Americans
were encouraged to settle in Texas. The government promised large land grants to empresarios
who brought immigrant parties to the country. In 1826, the Mexican government granted much
of the land that includes present Liberty County and adjacent territory to empresario Joseph B.
Vehlein. That same year, new settlers established a new Atascosito District as an independent

186

colony. The district included the Gilbert Brooks League in present Liberty County (Kleiner,
âLiberty Countyâ).
During the period of pioneer settlement in the 1820s and 1830s, American men typically
came to the Atascosito District ahead of their wives and families. They explored the region in
search of good farmstead sites and many built log houses before returning to their home states to
collect their families. They often traveled in small groups of related families that formed the
nucleus of rural communities once they arrived in the new land. This is apparently the course
taken by Samuel May and David Huffman in the Gilbert Brooks League. The men came to Texas
in the early to mid-1830s and brought their families to the region about 1840.
Texians chafed against Mexican authority from the outset. The Mexican government
prohibited slavery, expected colonists to convert to Catholicism, and demanded obedience to
Mexican law. Mexican leaders became increasingly suspicious of American settlers and by virtue
of the Law of April 6, 1830, the government stopped further American immigration to Texas.
The law did little to discourage the now constant flow of Americans into the region, however, and
new settlers joined with old in defying Mexican rule.
In 1831, Mexican land commissioner JosÃ© Francisco Madero organized a local
government in the Atascosito District dubbed Villa de la Santisima Trinidad de la Libertad. The
formation of the municipality was intended to support local landowners and give them a greater
measure of security and self-determination. The municipality was bounded by the Sabine River
on the east, by the San Jacinto on the west, by the Nacogdoches Municipality on the north, and
the Gulf of Mexico on the south. The new seat of government, which lay about three miles
southwest of old Atascosito, was called Liberty. By 1835, about 1,000 people lived in the
municipality (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
As more Americans flooded the region in the early 1830s, tensions grew between the
Texians and the Mexican government. The men of Liberty formed volunteer militias to protect
their homes and families. In the ensuing war, the Liberty Volunteers fought at the battle of
ConcepciÃ³n and the siege of Bexar. Liberty also contributed the Third Infantry Company,
Second Regiment, which fought at the Battle of San Jacinto. After Texas gained its
independence, Liberty County was organized in 1836. Originally, the county included all of the
future Tyler County and parts of what later became Hardin, Chambers, San Jacinto, and Polk
counties. The town of Liberty was named the county seat and incorporated in 1837 (Kleiner
âLiberty Countyâ).
Antebellum Era
In the twenty-five years between the Texas Revolution and the Civil War, Liberty and
Harris counties developed fairly diverse economies largely invested in farming, stock raising,
timber, and shipping. Numerous plantations were established along the Trinity River where crops
including cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, indigo, grains, and vegetables were grown. As early as
1831, James Taylor White ran 3,000 head of cattle on what became an extensive cattle ranch at
Turtle Bayou in present Chambers County (Partlow 1974: 123). Others followed suit and in just
a few years, stock raisers were driving large herds of cattle to market in New Orleans, while
others sold animals to meatpacking plants at Liberty Landing. Cattle formed the basis of the
areaâs agricultural economy during the antebellum period; the county counted 14,058 head of
cattle in 1840, a number that more than tripled to 45,670 head by 1850 (Kleiner âLiberty
Countyâ).

187

The East Texas region was heavily forested and a number of sawmills emerged in Liberty
County in the 1840s and 1850s. In fact, lumber grew to rival stock raising in importance and was
the countyâs major industry during this period. At the same time, shipping became an important
occupation. Timber products and agricultural goods, including cotton, hides, Indian corn, and
cattle were all shipped down the Trinity River to waiting vessels in the Gulf. Transportation
through the county improved and steamboat traffic on the Trinity flourished. Efforts to extend
the navigable portion of the Trinity began in 1852 and continued off and on thereafter. Railroad
construction was also initiated in the area during the 1850s. By 1860, the Texas and New Orleans
Railroad laid rail lines from Houston, via Liberty and Beaumont, to Orange. An early attempt to
build a railroad from Liberty to Livingston was interrupted by the Civil War (Kleiner âLiberty
Countyâ).
Civil War and Reconstruction
Along with most Texas counties, Liberty sided with the South in the Civil War. Many
early settlers in the region had emigrated from southern states, particularly Mississippi and
Louisiana. Slave ownership was common across economic lines in Liberty and Harris counties;
wealthy plantation owners, small farmers, and businessmen alike owned slaves, though the
numbers varied widely (U. S. Bureau of the Census, Slave Schedule, Harris County, 1850). Not
surprisingly, Liberty County voted 422 to 10 for secession and contributed to several Confederate
units in the Civil War. A militia company was charged with protecting the home front (Kleiner
âLiberty Countyâ).
After the war and the emancipation of slaves, some freedmen remained with their former
masters for awhile before starting their own small farms. The black population of Liberty County
rose considerably from 1860 to 1870, possibly due to an influx of immigrants â both white and
black â from southern states that had been devastated by the war. In 1860, the census counted
1,079 slaves in Liberty County; in 1870, the number of freedmen was nearly double that at 1,975.
The loss of âpropertyâ and the rise in the black population after Emancipation may have
contributed to significant racial conflict in the Reconstruction era. Former Confederates resented
the Freedmenâs Bureau that operated in Liberty from 1866 to 1868. Tensions grew so intense
that the number of Republicans in the county fell from 255 in 1869 to 0 in 1873, so hated were
they by the defeated Confederates. Despite these difficulties, the numbers of black and white
citizens of Liberty County were nearly the same in 1880. Thereafter, blacks decreased in
proportion to whites and comprised about a third of the population through the early 20th century
(Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
Steamboat travel on the Trinity River resumed after the Civil War but the construction of
numerous railroad lines through the area dealt a blow to the port of Liberty. Railroads reached
the many timber towns, which once shipped their products by boat, to outside markets.
Nevertheless, efforts were made to improve navigation on the Trinity River and several hundred
miles of waterways were constructed in the county by 1940 (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
Timber and agriculture remained the countyâs greatest industries and attracted many new
residents in the latter part of the 19th century; occupations in these fields attracted many new
residents and the countyâs population nearly doubled from 4,230 in 1890 to 8,102 in 1900. In the
following years, the development of rice culture and the discovery of oil expanded the countyâs
economic base even further. Around the turn of the 20th century, irrigation systems were installed
in the county to promote rice farming, which grew to rival cattle raising as the countyâs top
agricultural product. At the same time, oil fever began to take hold in Liberty County as

188

numerous wells were struck, primarily in the southern part of the county, and pipelines crissÂ­
crossed the county (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
Early 20th Century
The countyâs population continued to grow in the early 20th century, from 14,637
residents in 1920 to 24,541 in 1940. Agriculture remained an economic staple and farms in the
county rose from 1,001 in 1900, to an all-time high of 1,961 in 1940. Corn, rice, and cotton, the
major crops, accounted for 85 to 92 percent of Liberty Countyâs agricultural revenue in the 1920s
and 1930s. Farmers continued to raise beef cattle and hogs in large numbers throughout the first
half of the 20th century. The county typically claimed about 30,000 head of cattle through 1950
and in the 1930s, it led the state with 31,242 hogs. Timber remained an important source of
revenue through the early 20th century, as well (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
Due to its diverse economy, Liberty County survived the agricultural ravages of the
1920s and the economic crisis of the Great Depression better than some Texas counties. The boll
weevil infestation in the 1920s may have contributed to the increase in tenant farming; their
numbers grew from 294 in 1920, to 709 (46 percent of county farmers) in 1930 and remained
high through the 1930s. Despite the rise in tenancy, farm values actually increased by nearly 30
percent during the 1930s and agriculture and timber remained the countyâs largest employers on
the eve of World War II (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
In 1930, the Gilbert Brooks League remained a sparsely settled corner of rural
northeastern Harris County. The Crosby-Huffman Road traversed the area north to south,
connecting farmsteads and logging camps to the town of Huffman a few miles to the south.
Principal east-west roads were Wolf Road, to the north, Havard Road, to the southwest, and the
Huffman-Eastgate Road to the southeast. No settlements lay in the area but a grocery store
fronted onto the Crosby-Huffman Road south of its intersection with Wolf Road (U. S. Bureau of
the Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1930).
About thirty-five households lay
between Wolf Road on the north and Havard Road on the south, toward Huffman. In addition, a
number of single men lived in the area.
Most of the areaâs residents were engaged in agriculture, either as farmers or farm
laborers, but a number worked as section hands for the railroad, and still others worked in logging
camps. One man was a merchant who ran the grocery store where he and his children worked.
Virtually all of the farmers lived in households with their families, which generally consisted of
two parents and their minor children. Households might also include in-laws, nieces and
nephews, and grandchildren. Of the thirty-five heads of household, 18 owned their homes and 13
rented. Several were not identified as owners or renters. Railroad workers and loggers typically
lived in boarding houses or camps near their job sites (U. S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Schedule, Harris County, 1930).
All of the inhabitants of this dispersed community were listed as âwhiteâ in the 1930
census, though a number of âMexicanâ section hands for the railroad lived nearby, to the south.
A few residents were foreign born; one family hailed from Germany and another from
Czechoslovakia. The great majority, however, were southerners, among them many native
Texans, Mississippians, and Louisianans. Virtually all spoke and read English. Young children
attended public school while older ones worked as farm laborers, likely on their family farms.
The nearest community center was Huffman, a few miles to the south.

189

World War II and the Postwar Era
At the onset of World War II, Liberty County had little in the way of manufacturing
businesses but industries sprang up to meet the demands of war. Industrial plants more than
doubled from the pre-war figure of 22 plants employing 370 workers in 1940, to 52 firms
employing 744 workers in 1948. Among the countyâs new industries was the Texas Gulf Sulfur
Company which mined sulfur at Moss Bluff, south of Liberty. Manufacturing and chemical
plants increased in the postwar years, as well. During that time, Cleveland became a lumber and
oilfield supply center, Dayton a rice and oilfield center, and Liberty rose as a key port on the
barge canal, shipping sulfur, chemicals, and steel. (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
Despite new industries, agriculture remained the mainstay of the countyâs economy in the
postwar era. Farm tenancy had declined dramatically in the 1940s and agribusiness emerged on
the scene. Cotton and corn no longer dominated agricultural production but soybeans rose to
become one of the countyâs most important crops, along with rice. By the 1980s, 52 percent of
Liberty County remained in farmland with 36 percent of the land under cultivation during the
1980s. Principal crops included rice, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and hay, although some land was
devoted to watermelons, peaches, and pecans. While the majority of the county land was
dedicated to agriculture, the number of individual farms decreased to 858 in 1980, about half of
that recorded in 1940 (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ). Some of the decline can be attributed to
agribusiness with its tendency to purchase and consolidate numerous adjoining farms.
In addition to agriculture, new industries located in Liberty County and established ones
flourished in the 1980s. The county produced oil and gas, sulfur, veneer and plywood, concrete,
steel, and metal goods. The region continues to be known for its forests, both for timber products
and recreation. In the 1990s, a section in the northern part of the county was designated as the
Big Thicket National Preserve (Kleiner, Liberty County, handbook). In addition, the county
boasted over 900 businesses. While new jobs were created, Liberty County residents increasingly
commuted to Houston for work thanks to the construction of U.S. Highway 59 which was built
through the county in the 1960s (Kleiner âLiberty Countyâ).
The May, Huffman, and Somers Farmsteads
Introduction
Samuel May, Susan Huffman, and David Huffman were among the first settlers in the
Gilbert Brooks League which straddles the Harris and Liberty County line, northeast of Houston,
Texas. They arrived in Texas from Louisiana in the mid- to late-1830s and selected farmsteads
along present Wolf Road and the Crosby-Huffman Road (FM 2100). In 1839, David Huffman
founded the community of Huffman, a few miles south of his homestead. About 1840, Samuel
May and David Huffman returned to Louisiana to retrieve their families and bring them back to
their farmsteads in the Gilbert Brooks League. Susan Huffman and her young son, Adam, moved
to Texas and settled near Samuel May and David Huffman. Members of the Huffman and May
families occupied their farms through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.
Descendants of Samuel May still own and occupy their traditional farmstead. At least one direct
descendant of David Huffman lived on an adjacent ranch, the Smith Ranch near the intersection
of FM 2100 and 1960, through the 20th century. Her name was Willie Mary Scott and she
married Guy C. Smith in 1920. Susan Huffmanâs son, Adam, was one of the last members of the
family to live on his farmstead as recorded in the 1900 census. He appears to have sold at least
part of his land to Ben Somers who settled on the Crosby-Huffman Road between 1900 and 1910.
Somers and his sons owned farms along the road from before 1910 through at least 1966.

Gilbert Brooks League
The project area is in the Gilbert Brooks League, most of which lies in eastern Harris
County; a small portion extends across the county line to western Liberty County. The league
was granted to Gilbert Brooks, a Connecticut native who came to Texas in 1831 when he was just
24 years of age. David G. Burnet may have persuaded the young man to seek his fortune in
Texas by building and operating a sawmill at Lynchâs Ferry (aka Lynchburg). As soon as Brooks
arrived in the area, the two men formed a partnership and by the end of the year they established a
boiler and a steam engine at Lynchâs Ferry, at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and the San
Jacinto River, in east-central Harris County. Nathaniel Lynch had established the crossing at the
north end of Burnet Bay in 1822. In 1834 or 1835, shortly after Brooks and. Burnet located their
mill at the site, Nathaniel Lynch platted his property into town lots and named the town
Lynchburg after himself. It became one of the principal settlements in the region before the battle
of San Jacinto (About Cedar Bayou: A Condensed History).
Burnet may have funded the mill project but Brooks oversaw its day-to-day operations.
In 1834, Brooks petitioned for, and received, a league (4,428.4 acres) and Labor (177.1 acres) of
land in the Mexican municipality of Villa de la Santisima Trinidad de la Libertad â today in far
western Liberty County and northeastern Harris County (White Vol. 3). When hostilities broke
out between the Mexican Government and the Texians in the Texas War for Independence,
Brooks enlisted for service under the command of Colonel Morgan (Young 1995: 46). At the
battle of San Jacinto, Sam Houston detached Brooks to escort Burnet and state documents to
safety (About Cedar Bayou: A Condensed History).
After the Texas War for Independence, Brooks settled in Cedar Bayou where he
established a home and farm. In 1837, Brooks married Frances Whiting, the daughter of an early
settler in the area, Dr. Harvey Whiting. He later married Caroline Chamberlain, in 1850, and
finally, Melissa Whiting Bauer, sister of his first wife, in 1855. Brooks fathered a number of
children by his three wives and today he has many descendants in the Cedar Bayou area (Young
1995: 46).
Brooks was also active in civic affairs and in 1844, he was one of nine organizers of the
Cedar Bayou Methodist Church. In 1847, the trustees oversaw the construction of a log church
building on ten acres of land on the west side of Cedar Bayou. Known as Alexander Chapel for
the presiding elder of the Galveston District, the church quickly became the center of community
activity. Soon after its construction, the congregation held a Fourth of July ceremony and
barbeque attended by none other than Sam Houston. The Cedar Bayou church was one of the
most important stations on a circuit that included Lynchburg, San Jacinto, Harmony Grove, and
Bay Mission. In 1855, Brooks chaired a committee to build a new church near the site of the log
building; the frame church was completed in 1857 and doubled as a public school house (About
Cedar Bayou: A Condensed History).
Huffman and May Farmsteads
Members of the Huffman and May families came to Texas from Louisiana in the midand late-1830s. Susan Huffman and David Huffman were born in Louisiana and lived in Rapides
Parish by 1820 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1820, 1830). The 1850 census indicates that Susan

191

lived in Texas as early as 1835, but that may be a mistake in the record. 1 She likely came with
her husband in the late 1930s as later census records show that her son Adam was born in
Louisiana about 1838. David Huffman, possibly Susanâs son or nephew, came to Texas by 1839.
His wife, Elira, gave birth to her first child, Eliza, in Texas in 1840 (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
Population Schedule, Harris County, 1850).
Samuel May was related to the Huffmans by marriage. He was born in Mississippi about
1816,2 and moved to Louisiana in the 1830s, likely with his parents. As a young adult, May
traveled to the Republic of Texas. He is thought to have arrived in Texas between March 2, 1836
and October 1, 1837, because he later became eligible for a Class 2 land certificate based on his
residency during that time (General Land Office). His exact whereabouts are unknown, though
he may have lived near Lynchâs Ferry in what was then Liberty County, now eastern Harris
County. On April 26, 1838, May filed for a conditional Class 2 land certificate as a married man.
Under the terms of the allotment, a married head of household was entitled to 1,280 acres of land
(White 1966).
May apparently returned to Louisiana where he married Sarah Huffman, a girl of thirteen,
by April 1838. Sarah is thought to be David Huffmanâs sister. Sarah gave birth to their first
child, Robert, in Louisiana, about 1839. 3 Samuel may have returned to Texas ahead of his family
to claim residency and establish a homestead in what was then Liberty County. Mayâs family
joined him in Texas by 1839. When he proved up his land certificate on October 4, 1841, May
claimed that he had lived in Texas for three years, since at least 1838 (White 1966).
By 1840, the Susan Huffman, David Huffman, and Samuel May families all lived near
one another in the Gilbert Brooks League. Mayâs closest neighbor was his brother-in-law, David
Huffman, who is thought to have lived in Texas as early as 1839. 4 May and Huffman probably
knew each other in Louisiana and may have come to Texas together. A close neighbor of the
May and Huffman families was Susan Huffman who headed her own household consisting of
herself, her son Adam, and daughter Hester. Susan Huffman was born about 1795. Like David
Huffman and Sarah Huffman May, she was born in Louisiana. Susanâs children, Adam and
Hester, were probably born in Louisiana in 1835 and 1837, respectively (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1850). Susan was likely related to Sarah Huffman
May and David Huffman by marriage, but their exact relationship is unknown.
Early Settlement in the Gilbert Brooks League
The land Samuel May chose for his homestead lay in the Gilbert Brooks League
(Abstract 6) in the piney woods of what was then Liberty County. Mayâs brother-in-law, David
Huffman, occupied the land to the west by 1839. Other members of the Huffman family lived
nearby and together the May and Huffman homesteads formed the nucleus of a small, dispersed,
agricultural settlement.

1

Early census records show that Susan Huffmanâs son, Adam, was born in Texas in 1835, placing
Susan in the state at that early date. Later records show Adamâs birthplace as Louisiana. These records are
likely correct.
2
Census records disagree; some indicate that he was born in 1816 while others indicate 1815.
3
Sources differ as to Robertâs birthplace. The 1850 census indicates that Robert was born in Texas
but the 1860 and 1880 records show that he was born in Louisiana. These later records are probably
correct.

The Handbook of Texas states that David Huffman founded the settlement of Huffman in 1839.

When the May and Huffman families moved to the Gilbert Brooks League in the late
1830s, the territory was almost entirely forested; they were among the first settlers in the league.
A few scattered farmsteads dotted the landscape but they were rare. The closest settlements were
at Lynchburg, which lay about 17 miles to the south, and Cedar Bayou, which was about 40 miles
to the south. In 1839, David Huffman established the first settlement in the Brooks League. It
was called Huffman, a name it holds to the present.
The Huffman and May families had much in common with others in northeastern Harris
County. Nearly all adults in the vicinity of Huffman had emigrated to Texas from other Southern
states. They typically were single or headed young families and most of their children were born
in Texas. Nearly all adult men worked as farmers or stock raisers, most on their own land (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, Population and Agricultural schedules, Harris County, 1850).
Little else is known about the pioneers before the 1850 census. By then, the county lines
had been redrawn and the May and Huffman families were enumerated in Harris County. The
families likely lived in one- or two-room log houses until they could build more substantial
homes. Their first activities in the unbroken land probably consisted of clearing trees for
household gardens and building animal shelters or enclosures for horses, cattle, hogs, and
chickens. Following that, they cleared land for field crops as indicated in the 1850 agricultural
census.
By 1850, Samuel and Sarah added three more children to their family, Joseph (age 10),
Elizabeth (age 5), and Hester Anne (age 3). Robert, the oldest, was 12 years old. The familyâs
closest neighbors were Sarahâs brother, David Huffman (age 35), and his family consisting of his
wife Elira (age 30), and five daughters Eliza (10), Sarah (8), Susan (6), Anne Elizabeth (3), and
Mary (1). David and Elira Huffman had both been born in Louisiana but all their children were
born in Texas, starting in 18405 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, Harris County,
1850).
In 1850, Susan Huffman headed her own household consisting of herself (55), her son
Adam (13), daughter Hester (13), and a boarder, William Owens (19). Owens, a native of
Louisiana, was listed as a farmer in her household. According to the 1850 census, Susan
Huffman also owned seven slaves. One was a thirty-year old woman but the rest were children
under the age of fourteen. Susan may have brought the woman and older children with her from
Louisiana but the younger children were probably born in Texas. Neither Samuel May nor David
Huffman owned slaves according to the 1850 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population and
Slave schedules, Harris County, 1850).

All three families engaged in modest crop production with much more unimproved land
(pasture, woodland, other), than improved (crop fields). The 1850 agricultural census for Harris
County shows that Samuel May owned 15 acres of improved land and 185 acres of woodland;
David Huffman owned 8 acres of improved land and 292 acres of unimproved land; Susan
Huffman owned 20 acres of improved land and 180 acres of unimproved land. While they likely
all had vegetable gardens, their only field crops were sweet potatoes and Indian Corn. Susan
Huffmanâs farm produced 80 bushels of Indian corn and 80 bushels of sweet potatoes; Samuel
Mayâs farm yielded 250 bushels of Indian corn and 70 bushels of sweet potatoes; and David
Huffmanâs farm produced 250 bushels of Indian corn and 80 bushels of sweet potatoes in 1850.
They planted no oats, wheat, rye, rice, or tobacco (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Agricultural
Census, Harris County, 1850). Almost certainly, the sweet potatoes and Indian corn were grown
for personal use and as food for livestock, rather than for sale.
In fact, the families could better be described as stock raisers than farmers. All three
families owned considerable livestock, as did their surrounding neighbors. Each listed horses,
milch cows, working oxen, beef cattle, and hogs. Susan Huffman owned ten horses, well above
the average number in the area. Each of the families appeared to have substantial dairy
operations; Samuel May owned 15 milch cows, producing 350 pounds of butter, Susan Huffman
owned 30 milch cows, yielding 100 pounds of butter, and David Huffman owned 35 milch cows,
producing 100 pounds of butter. The families owned between 20 and 50 swine apiece. Beef
cattle, however, surpassed all other livestock; May owned 200 head of cattle, Susan Huffman
owned 200 head of cattle, and David Huffman owned 100 head of cattle. The families valued
their livestock at $650 for David Huffman, $1,050 for May, and $1,200 for Susan Huffman. May
and Susan Huffman both valued their farms at $600 while David Huffmanâs farm was worth only
$300 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Agricultural Schedule, Harris County, 1850).

The 20 farms surrounding the May and Huffman properties ranged from 5-50 acres of
improved land and 10-1,180 acres of unimproved land with most consisting of 10-20 acres of
improved land and 200 acres of unimproved land, much like the Huffman and May operations.
Likewise, the surrounding farms were valued at $100-$1,000 but most were worth between $200
and $500, similar to David Huffmanâs farm at $300 and Susan Huffman and Samuel Mayâs farms
at $600 apiece. Virtually all the surrounding farmers raised some beef cattle with most
possessing between 10 and 50 head, although one prosperous stock raiser owned 900 head of
cattle. Although livestock values varied widely from $60-$4,000 per farmer, most listed their
worth at between $500 and $800 total. The Huffman and May herds were worth slightly more
than average for their area (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Agricultural Schedule, Harris County,
1850).
After a little more than a decade on the land, the Huffman and May families had
succeeded in establishing fairly substantial farms. They may have replaced their initial log
dwellings with somewhat larger, if still modest, houses to accommodate their growing families.
The first known occupants of the region, they cleared the wilderness for 8-20 acres of field crops.
They probably built and maintained shelters for their large numbers of milch cows, swine, and
poultry but left their beef cattle to forage in the woodland areas of their farms. Some of the first
cattle drives in Texas originated in this part of the state; they were driven to Louisiana and points
further east. Since the May and Huffman families raised substantial numbers of beef cattle â as
did their neighbors â they may have participated in such cattle drives.
On the Brink of Civil War
By 1860, the Huffman and May families were well-established in the Gilbert Brooks
League having lived there for more than a decade. They were enumerated in the Lynchburg Post
Office district of Harris County. Susan Huffman may have passed away as she was not listed in
the 1860 census, but her son Adam appears to have assumed her estate based on its proximity to
Samuel May and David Huffman in the census record; Adam Huffman was listed next to Samuel
May in the place where Susan Huffman had previously been shown (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
Population Schedule, Harris County, 1860).
Samuel May and David Huffman headed large households that included their wives,
numerous children, and several laborers. Samuel and Sarah May had nine children living at home
in 1860. Their eldest son, Robert or R. J., was 21 years old, living with his parents, and engaged
in farming either for his father or another farmer. The other children ranged in age from
seventeen to two years old. P.J. Sessums, a 21-year old laborer, and James Fowler, a 26-year old
horse breaker, lived on the May farm. Samuel Mayâs occupation was given as âfarmerâ. He

195

owned $7,000 worth of real estate and $2,855 in personal property in 1860 (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1860).
David and Elira Huffman had eight daughters living at home. Their oldest, Eliza, was
apparently gone from the household. Of the remaining daughters, Sarah, age 16, and Susan, 15,
may have been named for Susan Huffman and Sarah Huffman May, who were possibly their
grandmother and aunt, respectively. In addition to the immediate family, a young man named
R.J.D. Curtis lived with in the household. No occupation was given for Curtis but he was born in
Louisiana and may have been related to the Huffman clan. David Huffman, too, listed his
occupation as âfarmerâ. His wealth was comparatively high for the area; he claimed $10,788
worth of real estate and $1,722 in personal property (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Schedule, Harris County, 1860).
Adam Huffman was a young man of twenty-two in 1860. He listed his occupation as
âstock raiserâ instead of âfarmerâ. His wife, Emeline, was nineteen years old and the couple had
a two-year old girl named Caroline. Despite his youth, Adam Huffman claimed $1,000 worth of
real estate and commanded $3,120 in personal property (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Schedule, Harris County, 1860).

In addition to family members and hired help, the Huffman and May families owned a
number of slaves in 1860. David Huffman owned four slaves outright and held two in trust for
unnamed minor heirs. Nancy Huffman, possibly Davidâs eleven year old daughter, owned one
slave, a thirty-three year old woman. Samuel May owned one slave in 1860, a twenty-two year
old man. Adam Huffman was not listed in the Slave Schedule of 1860. By their sexes and ages,
the Huffman and May slaves may have been among those listed as belonging to Susan Huffman
in the 1850 census. As property, the slaves would have been subject to distribution among her
heirs (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Slave Schedule, Harris County, 1860).

In the ten years since 1850, the May and Huffman families considerably expanded their
fields, acquired more unimproved land, and increased their wealth. In 1860, Samuel May
claimed 30 acres of improved land and 1,370 acres of unimproved land, David Huffman had 25
acres of improved land and 275 acres of unimproved land, while Adam Huffman increased his
improved land to 50 acres and unimproved land to 500 acres. Their farms were similar to others
in the region. A study of 20 nearby farms showed that while the range of improved land extended
from only 10 acres to 170 acres, most farmers had between 25 and 50 acres of tilled fields. Most
farmers in the sample owned between 150-300 acres of unimproved land (woodland, pasture). In
this regard, Samuel May and Adam Huffman greatly exceeded the average (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, Agricultural Schedule, Harris County, 1860).
Mayâs farm was valued at $7,000, while David Huffmanâs farm was worth $3,000 and
Adam Huffmanâs land was worth $1,000. If Adam Huffmanâs farm value was lower than his
neighborsâ, his livestock operation far surpassed theirs; Samuel May owned 78 head of beef
cattle, David Huffman owned 100 head, but Adam Huffman owned 500 head of beef cattle, far
more than most of the surrounding farmers. All three farmers owned milch cows, working oxen,
and large number of hogs. They had significant numbers of horses; Samuel May owned nine
horses while David Huffman owned 40 and Adam Huffman owned 45 head. While the May and
Huffman families, and their neighbors, all grew some crops â mainly Indian Corn âlivestock was
the most valuable component of their farms. Samuel May valued his livestock at $1,544, David
Huffman valued his at $2,421, and Adam Huffman approximated the worth of his livestock at
$4,120. All made some money from the sale of slaughtered animals, with the average farm
yielding between $100 and $200 per year (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Agricultural Schedule,
Harris County, 1860).

197

Indian corn remained the most important field crop for the Huffman and May families, as
it did for all of the surrounding farmers. The yield varied widely from farm to farm; of 20 nearby
farms, including those of the May and Huffman families, corn production ranged from 20 to 600
bushels in 1860. Most of the farmers raised between 200 and 300 bushels of corn, however.
Samuel May and Adam Huffman each grew 300 bushels of corn while David Huffman doubled
that amount at 600 bushels. The farmers in this area did not typically grow wheat, rye, or rice,
but they were beginning to grow cotton. Most produced 1-3 bales although Samuel May
produced six bales and Elle Dunks, his immediate neighbor, grew 51 bales. Since each bale
consisted of 400 pounds of ginned cotton, May raised 2,400 pounds and Dunks produced a
whopping 20,400 pounds (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Agricultural Census, Harris County, 1860).
On the eve of the Civil War, the Samuel May, David Huffman, and Adam Huffman
families appeared to have successful farm and ranch operations. May owned the largest, most
valuable, farm but had fewer head of horses and beef cattle than his in-laws. At the same time,
May turned some of his acreage to cotton, a cash crop that promised increased stability, and even
wealth, in the future.

Reconstruction and Latter 19th Century
It is not known how the May and Huffman families fared in the years following the Civil
War. Neither they, nor their immediate neighbors, appear in the 1870 census record for either
Liberty or Harris counties. Likewise, the community was omitted in the 1870 Agricultural
Schedule. It appears that the enumerator simply passed over their part of the county.

All three families appear in the 1880 population and agricultural census records. By that
time, the families had lived in eastern Harris County for over 40 years. However, their fortunes
appear to have diminished somewhat by 1880. All had less improved acreage and all reported
lower farm values than they had in 1860; Samuel May had only 15 tilled acres and 300
unimproved acres â down from 1,370 in 1860 â David Huffman had 22 tilled acres but claimed
600 unimproved acres, and Adam Huffman had 10 tilled acres and 185 unimproved acres. More
telling were the farm values. Samuel May reported that his farm was worth $700 and his
livestock worth $200, David Huffman assessed his farm at $1,000 and his livestock at $2,000,
and Adam Huffman claimed his farm was worth $700 and his livestock $5,000 (U.S. Bureau of
the Census, Agricultural Schedule, Harris County, 1880).
May, in particular, was less prosperous and less productive in 1880. His farm had been
reduced in value from $7,000 to $200, his cattle had been reduced in number from 78 head to 15,
and their value slashed from $1,544 to $200. He had no oxen, no milch cows, no swine, and only
ten chickens. Furthermore, he did not produce any field crops, including Indian corn, and grew
no cotton. In comparison, David Huffman owned five oxen, 13 milch cows, 285 beef cattle, 15
hogs, and 75 chickens. He grew 300 bushels of Indian corn and ginned three bales of cotton.
Likewise, Adam Huffman claimed 15 milch cows, 600 beef cattle, 15 hogs, and 75 chickens. In
addition, he produced 150 bushels of Indian corn on his 15 acres of tilled soil. According to the
1880 agricultural census, David and Adam Huffman owned farms on par with their neighbors, all

Turn of the 20th Century
Between 1880 and 1900, all of the original Huffman and May pioneers disappeared from
Harris County. They were all represented in the 1880 census but the 1900 census has no record
for Samuel or Sarah May, David or Elira Huffman.6 A search of all Texas census records failed
to locate any of these early settlers and it may be that they died or moved from the state in the two
decades since they were last recorded in 1880.
Among the second generation, Adam Huffman and two of Samuel and Sarah Mayâs sons
still lived in the Huffman community in 1900. All were married and heads of large households.
Robert J. May was a 60-year old farm laborer who rented his farm. He was married to a German
native, Louisa (Mary Louisa), and was the father of four children still living at home. His three
sons, Eugene (18), Kenny (14), and Emery (14), all worked as farm laborers while his daughter,
Vera (10), attended school. Although Robert rented his farm, he appears to have been living on
his parentsâ homestead, judging from the names of his immediate neighbors who were listed next
to his parents in the 1880 census. Everyone in the family was literate (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
Population Schedule, Harris County, 1900).

Robertâs brother, Thomas, owned a farm in a nearby community comprised largely of
Bohemian, Austrian, and Swedish immigrants. In 1900, Thomas was 47 and his wife, Maggy,
was 31. Maggyâs mother was an Irish immigrant. Thomas and Maggyâs three oldest children,
James (14), John (12), and David (10), attended school. Six younger children were daughters
Carmin (8), Myrtle (4) and Masel (4), and sons Milton (6), Addison (3), and Aaron? (1). The
adults and school-aged children could all read and write (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Schedule, Harris County, 1900).
Ben Somers
By 1910, the Huffman presence in the area had diminished. Sometime after 1880, David
and Adam Huffman began to sell their land on the Crosby-Huffman Road to various farmers
including the Williams, Smith, Scott, and Somers families. In the late 19th or early 20th century, a
farmer named Ben H. (Henry) Somers purchased several hundred acres of land just south of
Wolfe Road. His property straddled the Crosby-Huffman Road and the 2-acre Huffman cemetery
lay in the western part of the parcel.
Somers was the son of Henry and Sarah Summers. His father was from Germany and
apparently met and married his mother, Sarah, in Mississippi where their son George
Montgomery was born about 1848. The family moved to Texas sometime between 1848 and
1854, when their daughter, Angeline was born. By 1860, they resided at Cedar Bayou, in
Chambers County. The household consisted of Henry, then a 38-year old farmer, his 40-year old
wife, Sarah, daughter Angeline, age 6, and sons George Montgomery (12), Henry B. (2), and

Breckinridge (1). In later census records, Henry B. was known as Ben H. Somers (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, Population Schedule, Chambers County, 1860).

By 1870, Henry and Sarah Somers were no longer represented in the census. It is
possible that they died as Angeline lived in the household of John and Martha Bauer (Bamer?) in
Houstonâs first ward. Because Martha Bauer was born in Mississippi, like Angelineâs mother,
Sarah, it is possible that Martha and Sarah were sisters. Martha may have taken Angeline into her
household (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1870).
Ben Somers was not located in the 1870 census but he appeared in the 1880 record.
Listed as Benjamin H. Somers, he worked as a farm laborer for the Bayland Orphanâs Home and
Farm (Census, Harris County 1880). About 1887, Ben Somers (Summer) married his wife
Fanny. At that time, Ben was a young man of twenty-nine and Fanny was a girl of fifteen.
Although Fanny and her father were born in Texas, her mother was a native of Mississippi. By
1900, the couple lived in Justice Precinct 4 in Harris County. Somers was a farmer and owned
his own farm. By then, they had three young sons, Bertran, age eight, Robert J., age four, and
Willie C. J., age one. A hired man, Henry C. Copeland, shared the household (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1880, 1900).

Between 1900 and 1910, Ben Somers purchased a little over 300 acres of land in the
Gilbert Brooks League, possibly from David or Adam Huffman. David Huffman, who was
enumerated in the 1900 census, was the last of his immediate family to live in the area. He may
have sold his farm to Ben H. Somers (Summers, Sommers) between 1900 and 1910. The land
straddled the Crosby-Huffman Road just south of Wolfe Road. In the 1910 census record, Ben H.

Sommers (sic) was enumerated as living with his sons Joe (Robert J.) and Willie along the
Crosby-Huffman Road at or near the site of TS 30. His wife, Fanny, was not counted in the
household and later records indicate that she and Ben divorced. Although still young, both
surviving sons worked for a living: Joe, age fourteen, worked as a cook on a farm and Willie, age
12, worked as a farm laborer (U. S. Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, Harris County
1910, 1930).

When the Ben Somers family moved to the Gilbert Brooks League, nearly all of the
neighboring families worked in agriculture, either as general farmers, truck farmers, or farm
laborers. Many heads of household owned their own homes and farms. A few other occupations
were listed including that of river ferry operator, engineer man, and log teamster. Several women
worked as seamstresses and school teachers. All of the people along the Crosby-Huffman and
Huffman roads were white and many were born in southern states or had parents who were born
in the south (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, Harris County, 1910).
Although none of the Somers family members appear in the 1920 census, they were
likely overlooked by the census as they lived on the land in 1910 and 1930. In fact, none of the
known residents along the Crosby-Huffman Road were enumerated in the 1920 census.
By 1930, Ben Somers was an elderly man of seventy-two. He still lived on the CrosbyHuffman Road, just south of Wolfe Road, where he owned his farm. At that time, his son Joe
lived with him. Joe was thirty years old and worked as a laborer. Willie was not recorded in the
household and did not appear to live in the vicinity (U. S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Schedule, Harris County, 1930). About that time, Ben divided his farm and gave each of his sons
a farm. All three farms straddled the Crosby-Huffman Road. Willie owned 115.5 acres close to
Wolfe Road. His land surrounded the 2-acre Huffman cemetery. Ben (Henry B.) Somers
retained 115.5 acres for his homestead. He carved a 1-acre plot on the east side of the road that
he sold to E. L. Spear. Joe Summers owned the farm immediately south of his fatherâs land. He
sold 47.27 acres on the west side of the road to Jack C. Smith and retained a 73.8-acre tract for
himself (Edgar Tobin Aerial Surveys, 1966).

In 1930, the project area remained a sparsely settled corner of rural northeastern Harris
County. The Crosby-Huffman Road traversed the area north to south, connecting farmsteads and
logging camps in the project area to the town of Huffman a few miles to the south. Principal eastwest roads were Wolf Road, to the north, Havard Road, to the southwest, and the HuffmanEastgate Road to the southeast. No settlements lay in the area but a grocery store fronted onto the
Crosby-Huffman Road south of its intersection with Wolf Road (U. S. Bureau of the Census,
Population Schedule, Harris County, 1930). About thirty-five households lay between Wolf
Road on the north and Havard Road on the south, toward Huffman. In addition, a number of
single men lived in the area.
Most of the areaâs residents were engaged in agriculture, either as farmers or farm
laborers, but a number worked as section hands for the railroad, and still others worked in logging
camps. One man was a merchant who ran the grocery store where he and his children worked.
Virtually all of the farmers lived in households with their families, which generally consisted of
two parents and their minor children. Households might include in-laws, nieces and nephews,
and grandchildren. Of the thirty-five heads of household, 18 owned their homes and 13 rented.
Several were not identified as owners or renters. Railroad workers and loggers typically lived in
boarding houses near their job sites (U. S. Bureau of the Census, Population Schedule, Harris
County, 1930).
All of the inhabitants of this dispersed community were listed as âwhiteâ in the 1930
census, though a number of âMexicanâ section hands for the railroad lived nearby, to the south.
A few residents were foreign born; one family hailed from Germany and another from
Czechoslovakia. The great majority, however, were southerners, among them many native
Texans. Most spoke and read English. Young children typically attended public school while
older ones worked as farm laborers, likely on their family farms (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
Population Schedule, Harris County, 1930).
Because census records after 1930 are not available, and because no secondary sources
have been found that document the farming community along the Crosby-Huffman Road, little is
known about its later history. When an ownership map of the area was prepared in 1966, it
identified the farms and acreage of Henry B. Somers (Ben), Joe and Willie. By that time, the Pan
American and Sinclair Prairie pipelines crossed the farms north to south, roughly paralleling the
Crosby-Huffman Road. Other long time families were represented on the map in the many Scott,
Smith, Dunks and Wolfe tracts, all neighbors to the Somers men. Most plots ranged between 40
and 160 acres, although larger and smaller parcels existed (Edgar Tobin Aerial Surveys, 1966).
The area north of Huffman to Wolfe Road had not been subdivided into suburban housing tracts
and probably remained in cultivation or forest land at the end of the historic period.

Conclusion
The first known inhabitants of the area encompassing both 41HR1075 and 41HR1076,
were Samuel May, his wife, Sarah Huffman May, Susan Huffman and her son Adam, and David
and Elira Huffman. These related families came to Texas seeking land and settled in the Gilbert
Brooks League of Harris County, near the Liberty County line. Members of the May family
remain in the area to the present. Although David Huffman founded the nearby community and
cemetery, no family members bearing the Huffman name are known to live on their original
homesteads. Billy J. Smith who owns a ranch nearby is a descendant of David Huffman through
his mother, Willie Mary Scott. Some members of the Huffman family sold parts of their
homesteads to other families, including Ben Somers and his sons who owned the property
through 1966. Somers and his sons farmed adjoining parcels of land from about 1905 through
1930 and possibly beyond.
41HR1075 appears to lie on the Willie B. Somers 115.5-acre farm and may have been
occupied earlier by one of the Huffman families, likely Adam Huffman. Members of the
Huffman family lived in the area since at least 1839 but it is unknown when 41HR1075 was first
occupied. 41HR1076 lies on the Samuel May farm which was later occupied by his son, Robert.
Samuel May applied for his land certificate in 1838 and brought his family to Texas about 1839.
It is unknown whether 41HR1076 is the original or later May homestead site. No significant
events in Texas history are associated with either site; they appear to have been typical
farmsteads owned and occupied by early pioneer settlers in the area.
