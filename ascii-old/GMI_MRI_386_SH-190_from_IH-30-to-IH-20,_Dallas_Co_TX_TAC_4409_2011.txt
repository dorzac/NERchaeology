EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Engineering firm Carter & Burgess, Inc., the prime contractor for the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) subcontracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct the
archeological survey of the East Branch of the SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives (GMI
Project #30389.00.07). This report presents the findings of the archeological background
research and the archeological reconnaissance and preliminary pedestrian survey along the
proposed East Branch of the State Highway (SH) 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives, between
Interstate Highway (IH) 30 and IH 20 (CSJ 2964-06-011 and CSJ 2964-06-012), as presented in
December 2006 by TxDOT. GMI was responsible for investigating the project area in
preparation for adherence to issues raised by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat.
915] requiring an archeological survey. In addition, since the ultimate client, TxDOT, was
created under enabling state legislation, it is regarded as a political subdivision of the State of
Texas and hence must comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the
Natural Resources Code of Texas]. GMI was responsible for providing information relating to
compliance under Texas Antiquities Code permit #4409.
The scope of work consisted of the performance of an archeological survey focusing on those
properties granting right-of-entry (ROE) and conducting an impact evaluation on those properties
restricting access. The contract stipulated that an archeological site inventory would be
performed. This work would include the processing and preparing of recovered cultural materials
for curation, preliminary analysis and interpretation of the results, and the preparation of a
published report.
ROE limitations restricted pedestrian survey to 25 percent of the preliminary corridor
alternatives; the remainder was subjected to an impact evaluation. Thus, survey will be resumed
once additional ROE has been granted, but for purposes of efficiency and maximization of
resources, it is recommended that all efforts be exhausted to narrow the number of alternative
routes and obtain maximum ROE before archeological survey is resumed. One of the main
reasons for this recommendation is because the present placement of the highway alternatives
within a flood plain environment will require a systematic deep-testing strategy to assess
accurately the majority of the inaccessible portion of the project area. Regardless, seven new
documented historic sites (41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455, and
iii

41DL456), one prehistoric site (41DL457), and one nonsite locality (Locality #1) were identified
during this survey. In addition, two previously documented sites (41DL412 and 41DL260),
identified as being within the project area, are discussed but could not be revisited due to ROE
restrictions.
Materials related to this project will be curated at the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory in
Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the findings of the archeological background research, and the archeological
reconnaissance and preliminary pedestrian survey along the proposed State Highway (SH) 190
East Branch Preliminary Corridor Alternatives between Interstate Highway (IH) 30 and IH 20
(CSJ 2964-06-011 and CSJ 2964-06-012), as presented December 2006 by the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) and Carter & Burgess, Inc. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was
subcontracted by Carter & Burgess, the prime contractor, to conduct the archeological survey of
the SH 190 East Branch Preliminary Corridor Alternatives (GMI Project #30389.00.07). The
survey work presented in this report was undertaken to provide baseline information for the
project environmental impact statement (EIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. §§ 4321–4347; P.L. 91–190; 83 Stat. 852]. These investigations
were conducted to address issues raised by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915],
requiring archeological survey. In addition, the ultimate client, TxDOT, created under enabling
state legislation, is thus regarded as a political subdivision of the State of Texas and must comply
with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas].
Accordingly, the present investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Code permit
#4409.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigations was to identify and inventory cultural
resources properties contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their potential for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). GMI archeologists were contracted to conduct an intensive
pedestrian survey of 11 miles of proposed alternative highway corridor with a right-of-way
(ROW) width of 250 feet, totaling 355 acres. The full extent of the proposed ROW was
inaccessible for survey at the time fieldwork was conducted in February and March 2007 due to
the lack of right-of-entry (ROE); therefore, archeological survey was completed only in those
locations where ROE had been granted. The remainder of the project area was subjected to
reconnaissance survey and analysis.
In February and early March 2007, archeological survey was conducted along the proposed SH
190 highway corridor alternatives extending north-south from IH 30 through the Dallas suburbs
of Garland, Sunnyvale, and Mesquite to IH 20. The project area is confined on the southwestern
1

shore of Lake Ray Hubbard and crosses U.S. Highway (U.S.) 80 as it approaches IH 20. Three
project alternative corridors were examined: Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and Alternative 2B.
These alternatives were subdivided into sections according to municipality (Table 1, Figure 1).

This preliminary survey documented nine new cultural properties: seven historic sites (41DL450,
41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455, and 41DL456), one prehistoric site
(41DL457), and one nonsite locality (Locality #1). In addition, two previously recorded sites,
historic site 41DL260 and prehistoric site 41DL112, were identified during the background
research as being within the project area. Unfortunately, these two sites could not be revisited
during this survey effort due to ROE restrictions.
Fieldwork for this survey was completed between 7 February and 7 March 2007 and involved
GMI personnel Mr. Aaron Naumann (Project Archeologist), Ms. Kristen Bastis (Project
Archeologist/Field Technician), Ms. Diamond Kapanday (Field Technician), Ms. Lisa Shaddox
(Field Technician), and Mr. Sam Barrick (Field Technician/GPS Technician).
The remainder of this report provides information on the natural setting of the project area
(Chapter 2) and outlines the previous archeological studies conducted nearby, providing a
synthesis of the regional cultural setting (Chapter 3). The research goals and methods associated
with this survey are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 presents the results of the survey that
include detailed descriptions of each of the newly identified eight sites and one locality and the
two previously documented sites, and also presents the results of a reconnaissance survey
conducted on those segments within the project area where access was restricted due to
complications with ROE. Concluding Chapter 6 presents recommendations for the cultural
resources investigated during the survey concerning their eligibility for NRHP inclusion or for
SAL designation. The results of this investigation form the basis for the recommendations of

2

future survey once ROE has been obtained based on background research. The full list of
references cited in this document follows the main body of the report. Included as appendices are
a detailed discussion of the soils present within the project area (Appendix A), ecofact summary
and analysis (Appendix B), historic artifact summary and analysis (Appendix C), and a list of
curated materials (Appendix D). Materials related to this project will be curated at the Texas
Archeology Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located on the eastern margin of Dallas County along the southwestern portion
of Lake Ray Hubbard and near the shared boundary between Dallas, Kaufman, and Rockwall
counties. The project area is completely contained within the East Fork of the Trinity River
drainage. This chapter summarizes the modern natural environmental conditions of the survey
area, providing information about the regional flora and fauna, climate, local topography,
hydrology, and soils. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the regional geological context
of the project area and a summary of a synthesized regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction,
including a brief overview of the regional soil sequence.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The region in which the project area is situated is collectively referred to as the Texan biotic
province (Blair 1950) and the Blackland Prairie portion of Central Texas (Fenneman 1938; Kier
et al. 1977). The location of this project area is within one the most distinctive and diverse zones
within the Trinity River drainage, according to summarized General Land Office (GLO) notes
(Peter et al. 1988:18).

Topography
At the northern end of the project area, the topography consists of the western uplands of the East
Fork of the Trinity River, presently the southwestern shore of Lake Ray Hubbard. These uplands
give way to the Duck Creek drainage; two of the three proposed highway alternatives in Segment
III closely parallel the creek, and the third alternative traverses the uplands closer to the Lake Ray
Hubbard shore. All three alterative routes converge near the confluence of Duck Creek and the
East Fork of the Trinity River. The project area then bends southward, meandering along the
western edge of the East Fork of the Trinity River flood plain, moving between the flood plain
and the uplands until reaching Scyene Road. The project area ends at IH 20 with two
alternatives: one passing along the western bluff of the East Fork of the Trinity River and the
other passing through the western edge of the East Fork of the Trinity River flood plain. The
total project area ranges in elevation from 375–480 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl); the
majority of the project area is in or near the 400-ft amsl interval (see Figure 1).
5

Geology
The regional surface geology of the project area is composed of three geological formations:
Quaternary terrace deposits (sands and gravel), Quaternary alluvium (muds, sands, and gravels),
and the Upper Cretaceous Taylor Formation (marls). The area is bordered to the west by Upper
Cretaceous Upper Austin Formation (limestone). Thus, the regional geology is characterized by a
series of marls, some chalks, clays, sands, and limestone deposits, making the presence of the
types of stones used by prehistoric peoples uncommon in the area. The major sources of stone,
especially chert, are associated with the sparse gravels eroding downstream from more western
origin points (Allen and Flanigan 1986; Bureau of Economic Geology 1991).

Soils
This section of the chapter briefly describes the major soil sequences contained within the
highway corridor segments of the project area and also provides a general overview of the
archeological potential of each soil type. An abbreviated discussion of the definition of each of
these soil series can be found in Appendix A, and the full discussion can be reviewed in the
reference titled the Soil Survey of Dallas County, Texas (USDA 1980). The discussion of the
soils within this project area is from north to south, based on the preliminary corridor alternatives
as outlined in Chapter 1 (see Table 1), beginning with a discussion of Segment I/Alternative 1 and
concluding with Segment V/Alternatives 1 and 2. The soils reported and discussed here will be
referenced in the Chapter 5 discussion of the recommended backhoe strategy for the project area.
Segment I is composed entirely of upland-related soils, even within the unnamed intermittent
stream locations. The segment begins with a series of Burleson clays that are formed as a result
of aggregated alluvial clays. This soil type has a moderate potential of providing suitable
sedimentary context for archeological materials, but in this instance, it is largely disturbed
because of its use as a residential district. Segment I terminates at an unnamed stream surrounded
by Heiden clays or the Ferris-Heiden complex of clays. These soils are directly formed from the
decomposition of the underlying geology and have a low potential of providing a depositional
environment conducive to the preservation of archeological materials because both the degree of
slope and the nature of the soil itself would have been of little value to prehistoric populations. It
should be noted that these clays are associated with a drainage possessing the continual presence
of water due to the construction of the Lake Ray Hubbard reservoir, which has caused the
surficial water table to back-up the headwaters area of an unnamed intermittent western tributary
of the East Fork of the Trinity River.
Segment II alternatives traverse a soil sequence similar to that reported for Segment I, in that both
cross Heiden clays or Ferris-Heiden complex clays. The difference between the two segments
lies in the fact that Segment II/Alternative 2 has been impacted by both the excavation of water
storage pools and a railroad.
Segment III/Alternatives 1 and 2B largely parallel each other and cross the same soils by first
passing over the Branyon series of clay, which has a low probability of containing prehistoric
archeological contexts but a moderate probability of possessing historic archeological materials.
These alternatives then pass in succession over the Houston Black clay, Altoga silty clay, and
Lewisville silty clay until reaching the Duck Creek drainage. The Houston Black clay and the
Lewisville silty clay have moderate probabilities for containinging both prehistoric and historic
archeological materials. The Altoga silty clay is characterized as being a heavily eroded sloping
6

soil series with a low probability of providing useful archeological information. Once
Alternatives 1 and 2B enter the Duck Creek drainage, they pass over Frio silty clays and Trinity
clays until they converge with Segment III/Alternative 2.
Frio and Trinity clays are the soils resulting from the recent aggradations of alluvial deposits,
which have an excellent potential to represent moderate to deep sedimentary deposits that could
conceivably contain or overlie archeological remains. These soils tend to require deep-testing
survey methods to assess accurately archeological potential. Hence, a deep-testing survey
strategy is recommended for the entire Duck Creek drainage, along with the other locations
possessing Frio and Trinity clays.
Segment III/Alternative 2 lies within the uplands to the east of the other alternatives in this
segment and passes through similar soil distributions as those observed in Segments I and II. The
exception is that as the segment approaches the confluence of Duck Creek and the East Fork of
the Trinity River, the islands of Houston Black clay and Lewisville clays become larger. The
entire segment has a low probability for containing prehistoric archeological materials with
contextual integrity, but has a moderate potential for containing historic-period sites.
Segment IV/Alternative 1 is almost entirely situated within Trinity clays except for a small
section along both the northern and southern edges of U.S. 80. A deep-testing strategy is
recommended for the areas where these Trinity clays are present. The soils near U.S. 80 are
Lewisville silty clays, mostly disturbed by gravel mining, terracing, and road construction
activities.
The northern halves of Segment V/Alternatives 1 and 2 are closely aligned and pass over
Branyon clays on the top of the uplands, with bands of Ferris-Heiden complex, Heiden clay, and
Houston Black clay ringing both the ascent and descent over the local topographic highs. The
potential for in situ prehistoric archeological materials is low, but there is a moderate potential for
historic-era materials. Alternative 1 continues southward onto the East Fork of the Trinity River
flood plain and remains entirely within the confines of the Trinity clay series after passing over a
band of Houston Black clay. The majority of the southern portion of Alternative 1 is
recommended for deep testing. Alternative 2 passes over alternating bands of Houston Black
clay, Altoga silty clay, Heiden clay, Ferris-Heiden complex, Branyon clays, and Trinity clays as it
crosses the North and South Mesquite creek drainages to intersect with IH 20. The area has
limited potential for providing prehistoric information, except for streamside locations. The area
has a moderate potential for yielding information relating to historic-era archeology.

Hydrology
The confluence of two main tributaries, the Elm and West forks, form the Trinity River in
western Dallas County, and the East Fork flows into the Trinity farther downstream just southeast
of Dallas County at the Kaufman/Ellis county line. Together, these three major tributaries
compose the Trinity River basin that drains most of Northcentral Texas and empties into Trinity
Bay at the Gulf of Mexico, more than 560 km (350 miles) to the southeast. The East Fork
stretches roughly 80 miles north-to-south. Much of the water from the East Fork derives from a
combination of surface runoff and numerous springs (Brune 1981). The construction of two
reservoirs in the mid-twentieth century creates a convenient set of boundaries for the subdivision
of the East Fork of the Trinity River into four sections: the Upper, Lake Lavon, Lake Ray
Hubbard, and the Lower segments (Figure 2).
7

Flora and Fauna
Northcentral Texas consists of a series of relatively narrow, north/south-alternating vegetation
bands of oak-hickory forests and open grasslands. A west-to-east cross section of the region
indicates transitions beginning in the Western Cross Timbers, crossing into the Grand Prairie,
followed by the Eastern Cross Timbers, and concluding in the Blackland Prairie. The project area
occurs in the Blackland Prairie portion of the region, which is one of several tall grass prairies in
this part of Texas. The region is also assigned to the Texan biotic province, which is
representative of its intermediate location between the grasslands of the Southern Plains to the
west (Kansan Balconian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces) and the deciduous forests of the
Southeast (Austroriparian and Carolinian biotic provinces). Almost all of Dallas County falls
within the Blackland Prairie (Blair 1950; Fenneman 1931, 1938; Kier et al. 1977).
No endemic vertebrate species are in the Texas biotic province, but 49 species of mammals are
commonly found in the region. These mammals include several animal species, such as white tail
deer, bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, muskrat, and raccoon, of particular economic benefit to present and
past human populations. Other species of limited benefit include a range of turtles, snakes, frogs,
fishes, and freshwater mussels, along with bird species such as bobwhite, quail, and pheasant.
Other species associated with this region include meadowlark, field sparrow, sage grouse, lark
bunting, gray fox, and red fox (Schmidly 1983; USDA, SCS 1980:50). The present faunal
community in Dallas County no longer reflects the entire continuum of indigenous species,
because the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth area has drastically changed the localized
environment and displaced several of these species.
Vegetation in the Blackland Prairie is dominated by grasses in the uplands; woodlands are
restricted to streams and river bottoms. Prior to the historic period, the project area was covered
with a water oak-elm-hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water
marshes and ponds (McMahan et al. 1984). Today, where it exists, this bottomland forest can
include cedar elm, American elm, willow oak, southern red oak, white oak, black willow,
cottonwood, red ash, sycamore, pecan, bois d’arc, flowering dogwood, dewberry, coralberry,
dallisgrass, switchgrass, Virginia wild rye, Johnsongrass, giant ragweed, yankeeweed, and
Leavenworths eryngo (McMahan et al. 1984:22), if not also through the majority of the
Holocene. Cherry, sweetgum, hawthorn, blackberry, sedge, Indiangrass, giant cane, and beaked
panicum were probably also present (USDA, SCS 1980:50, 92).

Climate
The climate of Northcentral Texas is characterized by a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid
climate that is generally mild, with brief periods of extremely hot and cold weather. The
prevailing winds are southerly. Temperatures remain above 0oC (32oF) approximately 240 days
each year (USDA, SCS 1964:72–73, 1969:51–51). Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly distributed,
with the maximums occurring in April and May and the minimum in August. Much of this
rainfall is in the form of heavy thunderstorms, resulting in rapid runoff, limiting absorption by the
soil. Snowfall is rare, generally lasting less than one week and averaging less than 2.5
centimeters (cm; 1 inch [in]) per year.

9

Geomorphology
Studies elsewhere in the Trinity River basin have identified a series of Holocene-age cut-and-fill
alluvial sequences that seem to correlate across the river basin and indeed correlate with events
identified in the Colorado and Brazos rivers. In addition, during periods of terrace construction,
the vegetation cover (probably grasslands) contributed organic carbon at a rate faster than
sediment deposition, resulting in a series of buried soils and the accumulation of soils as the
terrace treads aggraded. These soils have been named and radiocarbon-dated at several locales
across the Trinity River basin. The following is an overview of the geomorphic situation
expected for the region.
From studies elsewhere in the upper Trinity River basin, it is likely that as many as three
alloformational stratigraphic units comprise the Holocene terrace (Ferring 2001:28–39). Each is
marked by an erosional unconformity at the top and pedogenic or soil development. Along the
Elm Fork, these consist of the Aubrey Alloformation, dating ca. 14,200 to perhaps 13,400 years
ago, at the bottom; the Sanger Alloformation dating between 10,900 and 5,700 years ago; and
capped by the Pilot Point Alloformation that dates from 4,525 to about 700 years ago (Ferring
1990:47–48). The Arlington paleosol developed in the upper part of the Sanger Alloformation
depositional unit, whereas the West Fork paleosol developed in the Pilot Point Alloformation. In
some places, an unnamed recent alluvium measuring up to 1.5 meters (m; 4.9 ft) thick caps the
Pilot Point alluvium, and it too has developed a pronounced soil in some places.

CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Three major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the culture-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988), much of the excavation effort within the
upper Trinity River basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm Fork
(Brown and Lebo 1991; Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Lebo 1995a, 1995b; Lebo and
Brown 1990; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the East Fork (Dawson and
Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966). Field school excavations
by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on Grapevine Creek were also
reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Jurney et al. 1988;
Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site, 41TR68 (Peter et al.
1987), have provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding of the
adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Reservoir studies along the East Fork have included work at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard.
Lake Lavon was surveyed in 1949, with test excavations being conducted at the Campbell Hole
(41COL10) and Hogge Bridge (41COL1) sites (Stephenson 1949). Additional excavations
conducted at the Hogge Bridge site resulted in the formal definition of the Wylie focus, a Late
Prehistoric manifestation believed to be characterized by arrow points, flexed burials, large pits
(often), and trade pottery from cultures to both the east and west (Stephenson 1952). In 1964, the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project conducted an inventory survey of a planned enlargement of
Lake Lavon (Lorrain 1965). Later, excavations were carried out by Southern Methodist
University (SMU) at selected sites found during the survey (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott
1975). Lake Ray Hubbard, formerly known as Lake Forney, was surveyed with the help of
Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) members in 1963 (Harris and Suhm 1963); excavations were
carried out subsequently at the Glen Hill (41RW4) and Upper Rockwall (41RW2) sites (Ross
1966), and the Lower Rockwall site (41RW1) (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968). Much of this work
concentrated on excavations at “Wylie focus pit” sites in an effort to better understand the
11

function of these large depressions. The designation of the Wylie focus in the light of more
recent data has called for the abandonment of this as a cultural unit (Peter and McGregor 1988;
Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986).
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) has sponsored many projects within Collin
County. In 1990, GMI undertook a pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching at Lake Lavon
along the western perimeter of the federal property. The project resulted in the recording of one
prehistoric site (Peter et al. 1990). In 1991, another survey along the eastern edge of Lake Lavon
also resulted in the recording of one prehistoric site (Hunt et al. 1991). Another survey
undertaken on the southern edge of Lake Lavon during 1993 did not locate any cultural properties
(Hunt 1993). In 1992, a geoarcheological investigation was conducted for NTMWD at the City
of McKinney landfill (Hunt et al. 1992). No cultural properties were identified. During 1993–
1995, GMI conducted a reconnaissance, intensive pedestrian survey, and geoarcheological
investigation for the NTMWD Cooper Water Transmission Line (Hunt et al. 1995). Four sites
were found during this project, three of which were considered ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL, but the fourth was considered of unknown eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL. During 1996, GMI conducted a survey of 8.1
kilometers (km) for a pipeline along the western edge of Lake Lavon (Hunt and Peter 1996a). No
cultural properties were discovered. During 1998, GMI undertook a survey for the Princeton Lift
along the northwest edge of Lake Lavon (Hunt et al. 1998). Four historic sites were discovered
during the project, but all were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. During 1999, a survey was conducted for a 23-acre expansion at the
Wilson Creek Water Treatment Plant near Lucas, Texas (Clow 2000). No cultural properties
were discovered.
Many other small projects have been undertaken in Collin County within the same drainage as the
current SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives project. In 1974, a survey of the Soil
Conservation Service’s Clemons Creek Watershed was undertaken by SMU (Hughston and
Lynott 1974). Investigations initiated by the Texas Water Development Board were completed
for the cities of Renner (Whitsett 1977) and McKinney (Fox 1979) in the late 1970s. A survey of
a pipeline proposed to cross the northern section of Collin County by Matador Pipelines, Inc., was
completed in 1981 (Peter 1981). In 1984, a survey was sponsored by the Farmers Electric
Cooperative (Skinner 1984). During 1985, AR Consultants, Inc., (ARC), conducted a cultural
resources survey of the Maxwell Creek landfill site (Skinner 1985). No sites were discovered. In
1990, ARC conducted a survey of the Wilson Creek Park IV in the city of McKinney (Skinner
1990). A survey of the Spring Creek Nature Area was undertaken for the City of Richardson by
ARC in 1991. An Archaic site and a historic cemetery were discovered. The City of
McKinney’s Stonebridge Park was surveyed by ARC in 1992; no cultural resources were
discovered (Skinner 1992). During 1994, the City of Plano sponsored a cultural resources survey
of the Plano Municipal Golf Course (Skinner and Whorton 1994), and Ferring (1994) completed
a survey of two water pipelines for the Danville Water Supply Corporation. Ferring recorded one
prehistoric site. Also during 1994, GMI conducted a pedestrian survey of proposed Dallas Area
Rapid Transit (DART) light rail lines in Dallas and Collin counties (Green et al. 1997). One
historic site, the Jacob Routh homestead and cemetery (41COL83), was identified and recorded in
Collin County. In 1995, GMI undertook a survey of 280 acres at Lake Lavon as part of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers Recreation Partnership Initiative (Hunt and Peter 1996b); four nonsite
localities were discovered at Lake Lavon. In 1996, ARC conducted a cultural resources survey
for the Dallas North Tollway Extension (Skinner 1996). No cultural resources were discovered.
Also during 1996, ARC conducted cultural resources evaluations of two sites, 41COL79 and
12

41COL78 (Graves Farm), at Stonebridge Ranch west of McKinney (Skinner and Trask 1996;
Skinner and Whorton 1996). Both sites were recommended ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
ARC also conducted a survey of the Allen Station Park site (Skinner and Skinner 1996). Three
historic sites were discovered, but no further work was recommended. During 1997, the Texas
Water Development Board undertook survey of a proposed sewer line along Tickey Creek, south
of Princeton (Davis 1997). A pedestrian survey of the 2.74-km pipeline was conducted in
addition to the excavation of 14 backhoe trenches as part of a geoarcheological investigation in
the Tickey Creek flood plain. No cultural resources were discovered during the investigation.
Also during 1997, ARC conducted an archeological survey of the 50-acre Hedgecoxe Road
Athletic Site for the City of Plano (Skinner 1997). No cultural properties were discovered.
During 1998, ARC completed an inventory survey of the 18-acre Eldorado Heights Park in the
City of McKinney (Kent et al. 1998), but no cultural properties were identified. In 1999, GMI
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and geoarcheological investigation for the 55-km Lake
Chapman Pipeline in Collin and Denton counties (Owens and Gibson 2000). Three historic sites
were discovered, but these sites were considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as SALs.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
available data allow delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 2). Investigations at Joe Pool
Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for
the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at Joe
Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a chronological sequence of
six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on diagnostic artifacts from surface
contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the upper Trinity River basin. The
generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted
largely from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the adaptations associated
with these periods is presented below and includes data derived from the GMI investigations at
41TR170 (Lintz et al. 2005).

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the bestknown Paleo-Indian site within the region. Although the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000
B.P.) contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the
controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally
occurring lignite as either a fuel in these hearths or an inadvertent inclusion contaminated the
radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000–10,000 B.P. for Clovis­
period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of
Northcentral Texas. Knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early
occupants is extremely limited. However, recent excavations at the Aubrey site, a well-preserved
Clovis-period site in Denton County, has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big
game animals alone; rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 2001).
Whether this pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis
adaptations in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now-extinct, big game species is more
characteristic of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in Northcentral Texas is tentatively dated between 6550 B.C. and A.D. 700.
As is true for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle,
and Late subperiods, has been applied in Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early
Archaic has been dated from 6550 to 4050 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4050 to 1550 B.C., and
the Late Archaic from 1550 B.C. to A.D. 700. Archaic remains are usually found in upland
settings and are frequently mixed with later material. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas (Crook and Harris 1952) that defined the Carrollton and Elam foci
was based upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space
constructs are no longer recognized as being acceptable for this area of Texas (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends that have been proposed
as characterizing the Archaic period in Northcentral Texas include an increasing complexity of
settlement systems, increasing population size and density, decreasing mobility, and the
development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6550–4050 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested as reflecting high group mobility within large and poorly
defined territories, with a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy (Story 1985:35, 39).
Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly documented, and no
sites with isolated Early Archaic components in this area are known (Prikryl 1990). Based on
surface collections, Prikryl (1990) hypothesizes a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy
during this period, with high group mobility, a lack of regionalization, and “little in the way of
recognized territorial boundaries” (Prikryl 1990:71). Projectile point forms that may be
associated with the Early Archaic in Northcentral Texas include Early Split Stemmed and
possibly Angostura points (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).

14

In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period in Northcentral Texas (4050–1550
B.C.) is even less well known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for
any other period, but the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional
cultural differences by the end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be
associated with the Middle Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek,
Bell, and Andice), Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure
31). An intact Middle Archaic component was identified at the Calvert site (41DN102) at Lake
Ray Roberts and is summarized by Ferring and Yates (1997:305):
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the Middle Archaic period are evident.

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period (ca. 1550 B.C.–A.D.
700) in Northcentral Texas, as indicated by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of decreasing mobility (Prikryl 1990). At
the same time, as group mobility may have become more limited, interregional contact may have
also diminished. If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to
unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing
use of all available floral and faunal resources. Throughout Northcentral Texas, Late Archaic
period occupation sites are relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of
shallowly buried sites are also known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring 1990a:51). Dart
points that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis,
Trinity, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure
31).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that remains of the Late Archaic period are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbit, turtle, and
mussel being primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). The results of investigations at
numbers of Late Archaic sites at Lake Ray Roberts are summarized by Ferring and Yates
(1997:305):
The most substantial occupations of the project area took place in the later part (post-3,000 yr b.p.) of
the Late Archaic period. This is clearly a broad regional trend . . . although poor site exposure limits
our understanding of earlier periods. Late Archaic sites here uniformly register mobile foragers that
exploited all habitats available to them. Residential mobility . . . is implied. Repeated occupations at
multiple sites were characterized by use of rock-lined and unlined hearths. On stable surfaces these are
recorded as rock middens. In aggrading environments, discrete hearth construction events are clear.
Import and curation of chert tools is evident, and contrasts with core-biface curation in the Middle
Archaic period. Chert was preferentially used for straight, expanding and corner-notched points, while
local raw materials were reduced on-site and dominate the contracting-stemmed forms. Despite quite
good resource availability, dietary stress is recorded from skeletal and dental analyses. . . .

15

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of what is called the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1700) in the upper
Trinity River basin is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the
start of this period is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage
to the west. Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) propose that the Late Prehistoric period be
divided into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting
Southern Plains influences. In this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is
characterized by sand- and grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba
arrow points (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and is
associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period.
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddo occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research:
There are no woodland-like sites in north central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland influence or
contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were found with
LPI [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These appear
to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation compared to the
Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these occupations are
essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological information, rather than
environmental change, probably is the factor behind the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites,
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr b.p. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the LPII faunas indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized deer
procurement, and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about
as frequent as in the LA, and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not
evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this
time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis
(Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts
prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the LP period largely
independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

In light of these results, the status of the Cobb-Pool site is even more striking. Whether the CobbPool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate
from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent analysis of a
16

Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas County also
suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years old. Radiocarbon
dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155 and 1275; a carbon isotope ratio of
-17.7 ‰ suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major part of her diet (Peter and
Clow 1999). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping of disturbed
human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in Dallas County. This site,
located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River), yielded remains of at
least four individuals, dated by tree-ring calibrated radiocarbon dates on bone collagen to cal A.D.
1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell
gorget were present; a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 ‰ suggests that the group’s diet was not high
in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared
to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area
ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that divergent subsistence patterns
were practiced by groups in the Dallas area.

Historic-Era Native American Groups
The Historic Indian period in Northcentral Texas dates between A.D. 1700 and 1850 (Prikryl
1993). Prior to the founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European presence in the Southwest
and on the Southern Plains had been sporadic at best (Coronado in 1540–1541, the RodriguezChamuscado party in 1581, Espejo in 1582–1583, etc.). Although there are only brief records of
journeys through the area, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains after
1598, but contact between Europeans and Native Americans continued to be limited (Hofman
1989b; John 1975). It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the physical
presence of Europeans in this region became commonplace—the result of increasingly peaceful
relations between the Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north and the acquisition of
Louisiana by the United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725–1750, Apache groups appear to have
dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains, known as the High Plains, but after this
time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of
the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the
Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967; Hofman 1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups occupied the
Dallas area at the start of this period. However, the early historic period in Northcentral Texas
was a time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).
Available data suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of
the Great Plains, including Northcentral Texas, were Caddoan language speakers—from the
Arikara in the north to the Wichita and Kichai in the south. Some researchers suggest that the
Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were
Caddoan speakers and were the same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the
latter part of the seventeenth century, who lived “on the Blackland Prairies between the
Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Waco”
(Newcomb 1993:24). If the prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas
were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other
Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita
proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were
17

probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes, and some may even have joined amalgamations of
a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa, during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries.
The most important Apache group in the Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas was the Lipan,
who inhabited the area from the upper Nueces and Medina rivers to the upper Colorado and Red
rivers, and ranged as far south as Mexico. The Spanish first encountered the Apache in the
sixteenth century, and hostilities soon developed. The Apache acquired the horse around 1660,
and this increased mobility made them even more dangerous to the Spanish (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:54–55). Beginning in the early eighteenth century, the Lipan Apache came under
increasing pressure from the Comanche, who were at that time expanding into Texas. To gain
allies against these new enemies, some Lipan bands made peace with the Spanish and asked that
missions be established for them. One of these missions was San Sabá de la Santa Cruz, in
present-day Menard County (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:55). This mission was destroyed by an
alliance of Wichita and Comanche in 1758. The subsequent defeat of a punitive Spanish
expedition with Apache allies under Diego Ortiz Parilla by the Wichita at Spanish Fort on the
Red River in 1759 (John 1975:297–298, 350–352; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:55) marked the
ascendance of the Wichita and Comanche on the Southern Plains. Thereafter, the Lipan Apache
in Central Texas were increasingly allied with the Europeans against the Western Apache and the
Comanche. They negotiated a peace treaty with Mexico in 1832 and aided Colonel John H.
Moore’s company of Texas Rangers in 1839 and Colonel John Coffee Hays’s company in 1841
against Indians on the frontier. They participated in general Indian treaties with the Republic of
Texas in 1844 and with the United States in 1846. Finally, the remaining eastern Lipan merged
with a band of Tonkawa and were removed to Indian Territory in October 1848 (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:55).
The term Wichita refers to a group of linguistically related tribes, including the Wichita,
Taovayas, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai, many of whom apparently entered the Southern
Plains in the seventeenth century from Kansas and southern Nebraska to escape the hostilities of
the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita were true Plains Villagers, with an
economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and bison hunting. They occupied
permanent villages of beehive-shaped grass houses, from which they conducted seminomadic
bison hunts. Between 1719 and 1772, they moved from the Arkansas River in northern
Oklahoma to the middle Trinity and upper Brazos rivers (Hofman 1989b:95). In 1772, the year
they concluded a nominal peace with the Spanish, one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the
Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of Dallas (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705).
Wichita groups were included in treaties with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United
States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live
between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855, when the Tawakoni and Waco were
placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number of
other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212; 2:905). As a
result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian Territory in 1859
(Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210).
The Comanche were a Shoshonean group who left the upper Yellowstone and Platte rivers at the
beginning of the eighteenth century for the Southern Plains, where they drove a wedge between
the Apache to the west (driving them farther south and west) and the Pawnee and Wichita to the
east. By the early nineteenth century, their range was at its greatest, stretching from central
Kansas to Austin, and from Oklahoma City westward to Raton Pass in New Mexico. The most
18

important divisions of the Comanche were the Yamparika (root-eaters), who ranged along the
Arkansas River; the Kotsoteka (buffalo-eaters), who were just to the south of the Yamparika; the
Nokoni (Wanderers), who occupied the territory along the Red River; the Quahadi (Antelope
People), located on the High Plains; and the Penateka (Honey-eaters), who were the southernmost
Comanche group in Texas, living on the fringe of the East Texas timber-belt (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:385). In 1758 they helped in the destruction of the mission of San Sabá (see above), and
for the next 117 years, they waged intermittent warfare against first the Spanish, then the
Mexicans, the Texans, and finally the United States (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385). The
Comanche were nomadic Plains hunters, whose lifestyle depended upon the bison as a source of
meat and raw material for clothing, shelter, etc., and upon the horse as a means of hunting and
transport. The Comanche were signatories to the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the United States
in 1867, in which they agreed to cede all of their territory except for a 5,546-square-mile
reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Subsequent to a general uprising by the Comanche and
Kiowa in 1874, they were defeated by the United States Army in 1875 and permanently confined
to their Oklahoma reservation (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:385).
The Kiowa were a Tanoan group who may have moved onto the Southern Plains from the
headwaters of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers in what is now Montana (Hays 1989:255).
Prior to 1790, the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache were intermittently at war with the Comanche, and
the Kiowa actually may have been responsible for pushing the Comanche out of the Black Hills
area and onto the Southern Plains. In 1790, however, they made a lasting peace with the aid of
the Spanish and were allied thereafter (Wallace and Hoebel 1952). Like the Comanche, the
Kiowa were nomadic bison-hunters, with no permanent villages, agriculture, or pottery. The
Kiowa were divided into six or seven semiautonomous bands (including the Kiowa-Apache) and
generally occupied western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. The first regular trading contact
with the Americans began in 1834, and the first treaty with the United States was signed in 1837.
Following a general uprising of Plains Indians in 1864, the Kiowa signed the Medicine Lodge
Treaty in 1867, which committed them to life on a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma.
Intermittent raiding continued into Texas for the next seven years, and the Kiowa finally were
confined permanently to a reservation in 1875 (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:964–965).
Archeological remains that can be associated with these early historic groups are rare compared
to the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, and in Dallas County
itself, little evidence of these historic-era Indian groups has been found, except for a few Native
American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). Some accounts suggest that, by the
nineteenth century, the area was considered a neutral, shared hunting ground for a number of
tribes (Caldwell and Fitzhugh 1986). All of these groups are best represented in the region
surrounding the upper Trinity River valley by the Wheeler and Edwards complexes in Oklahoma,
and the Tierra Blanca and Garza complexes in Texas.
The Wheeler complex, a series of unexcavated sites in westcentral Oklahoma (Bell and Bastian
1967; Hofman 1984:355–357), is typified by triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno), large
planoconvex end and side scrapers, expanding-base drills, and a dark, sandy-paste pottery
referred to as Edwards Plain. Sites also contain abundant remains of bison and a few artifacts of
Southwest origin, including Glaze paintware, obsidian, and turquoise. The early historic age of
these sites is demonstrated by a limited number of European trade goods (including beads) and
possible native-made gunflints (Hofman 1989b:95-96). Cross dating with the Southwest material
indicates that these sites date between A.D. 1650 and 1725. The ethnic affiliation of the occupants
of the Wheeler complex sites is presently unknown, but they may have been either Wichitarelated or Apache groups (Hofman 1989b:96–97).
19

The Edwards complex, another series of sites in western Oklahoma (Hofman 1984:348–354,
1989b:97-98), contains small, triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno) and the sandy-paste Edwards
Plain pottery. Other artifacts include expanding-base drills, small- to medium-sized end and side
scrapers, bone awls and toothed fleshers, bone and shell beads, and possibly scapula hoes.
Imported ceramics consist of both Caddo and Pueblo wares (Hofman 1989b:97). The economy
of these Edwards complex groups appears to have focused heavily on bison hunting and possibly
on the trade of bison-derived products such as hides and dried meat (Hofman 1989b:98). These
sites are believed to date between about A.D. 1400 and 1650, and may be associated with
fortifications and apparent posthole structures.
Possible Apache sites have been identified along the border of the High Plains to the northwest
along the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River in Texas (Hughes 1978; Katz and Katz 1976).
These sites contain small, triangular arrow points and a thin, dark, often micaceous, plain pottery
that is apparently of local manufacture. The late date for these sites is based on the presence of
late Pueblo painted wares from New Mexico. To the west of these sites, Hughes (1991:35) has
defined a Tierra Blanca complex at the site of the same name. The site is believed to postdate
A.D. 1400 and has yielded evidence of a tipi ring, a semisubterranean slab-lined circular structure,
and a windbreak or small arbor (Hofman 1989b:99). The Tierra Blanca complex, in general, is
suggested to date between A.D. 1400 and 1650. The sites contain Glaze paintwares and a dark
utilitarian ware, as well as a low frequency of Garza and Lott arrow points (the former a
triangular form with a single basal notch, and the latter a triangular point with an expanding stem
and a central basal notch).
The Garza complex, farther south along the caprock, appears to be a late Apache complex that
includes Garza and Lott points and micaceous paste wares similar to those found in the north as
well as to Perdido Plain and Tierra Blanca Plain. The ceramic assemblage also contains a high
proportion of Southwest pottery, in addition to turquoise, obsidian, and marine shell beads. Sites
that belong to this complex have been identified in the Justiceburg Reservoir area in Texas and
are associated with Pecos Glaze Polychrome V and Pecos Faint Striated ceramics (Boyd and
Tomka 1990:260). The complex is dated between A.D. 1500 and 1650 and is characterized by an
apparently heavy reliance on bison hunting, with little or no horticulture.
Groups of the Wichita Confederacy have left much more substantial archeological remains.
Numerous villages that belonged to historic Wichita groups have been identified and investigated
in Oklahoma, within Northcentral Texas, and along the boundary of Northcentral Texas and
Northeast Texas (Bell 1984; Fox 1983:41–46). On the basis of excavations at the Pearson site in
Rains County, Texas, due east of Dallas County, the Norteño focus has been proposed for these
historic-era Wichita components (Duffield and Jelks 1961). The most extensive archeological
work has been conducted at several sites along the Red River in Texas and Oklahoma, near the
present-day Texas town of Spanish Fort, northwest of Dallas County, which some believe to be
the site of the village attacked by Parilla in 1759 (Bell et al. 1967). Excavations at the Longest
site (34Jf-1) in Oklahoma documented a fortified enclosure and circular grass-covered lodges.
Artifactual material recovered from these Wichita sites demonstrates a mixture of artifacts of
Native American manufacture and French or Spanish trade materials. Artifacts of Native
American manufacture include triangular arrow points (i.e., Fresno, Harrell, and Washita), thick
end scrapers on flakes, diamond-shaped beveled knives, T-shaped perforators, bifacial gun flints,
bison scapula hoes, pottery elbow pipes, and Womack Engraved pottery. Trade artifacts include
metal ornaments such as bells, finger rings, and bracelets; metal knives and knife handles; axes;
splitting wedges; kettle fragments; awls; chisels; scissors; buttons; flintlock gun parts; bullets and
shot; bridle parts; and numerous trade beads (Fox 1983:45).
20

The archeological remains of the Comanche and the Kiowa (and Kiowa-Apache) are less
identifiable than the other early historic-era Indian groups. Hays (1989:Table I-5) lists 41
selected Comanche, Kiowa, and Kiowa-Apache sites on the Southern Plains, at least 25 of which
are historic-era burials or cemeteries. To the far west of Dallas County, one probable Comanche
campsite of the late 1700s has been reported at MacKenzie Reservoir, in Briscoe County (Hughes
and Willey 1978), and numerous probable Comanche burials have been located along the edge of
the caprock. One of these, the Cogdell Burial, was found in a small niche or cave on the edge of
the caprock (Word and Fox 1975). Artifacts recovered from the grave included a cotton shirt;
beaded leggings and other beaded garments; a pair of moccasins; fragments of wool blankets and
a buffalo robe; brass bracelets; hair ornaments; a gold-plated finger ring; silver conchas;
fragments of a weasel pelt; a small, rectangular hand mirror; trade beads; a fragment of a silver
buckle; elk teeth and Pacific abalone shell pendants; and an iron hoe. Other materials included
wooden and leather saddle parts, iron saddle hardware, fiber cordage, portions of what may have
been a Spanish bridle, the wooden poles and fasteners of a travois, and buffalo or cow bones that
may have been the remains of a food offering (Fox 1983:47–48).

HISTORIC PERIOD BACKGROUND
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542, when the
remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered modern-day
Texas during an effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the
expedition crossed Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the
route much farther to the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson
1986; Schambach 1989; Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not
occur until the early 1700s, when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the
Red River. The Spanish considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New
Spain, and they responded by redoubling efforts to counterbalance French influence with Native
Americans in East and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France
ceded Louisiana to Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the
security of New Spain and resulted in a reduction in Spanish investment in eastern and northern
Texas. It has been argued that the severe military defeat inflicted on the Spanish by Wichita and
allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758 put an end to Spanish military and
missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964, 1965).
The first Americans to settle in the region were primarily from Arkansas Territory. The first
permanent settlement in the Dallas area was Bird’s Fort in present-day Tarrant County,
established in 1840. Also in 1840, John Neely Bryan reconnoitered the Dallas area to determine
its suitability for a trading post. By the time Bryan returned in 1842, troops of the Republic of
Texas had removed the Native American groups with whom he had intended to trade. As a
result, Bryan was determined to found a settlement in the same area where downtown Dallas is
today. To further this goal, Bryan invited the residents of Bird’s Fort to join him in his new
settlement. Five individuals (John and James Beeman, Captain Mabel Gilbert, Tom Keenan, and
Isaac B. Webb) and their families decided to answer Bryan’s call. Prior to this, in 1841, the
Republic of Texas had contracted with the Texan Emigration Land Company to settle 600
families on a land grant encompassing portions of modern Dallas, Denton, Cooke, Collin,
Grayson, Ellis, and Wise counties. This land grant became known as the Peter’s Colony. The
majority of the Peter’s Colony settlers held property north of Dallas. The Peter’s Colony
continued until 1852, when disputes about land title between the Texan Emigration Land
21

Company and the settlers came to a head and some of the settlers rose up in arms to defend their
title to the land they had settled. Dallas County was organized from Robertson County in 1846,
with Dallas serving as the county seat (Works Progress Administration [WPA] 1992:38–50).
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and some Dallas area residents joined the
American army facing the Mexicans. The California gold rush in 1849 affected Dallas in two
ways. First, Dallas was near a major trail for the “49ers” that utilized a ford across the Trinity
River about seven miles to the north. Second, many Dallas area residents were struck with gold
fever. Some, including John Neely Bryan, trekked to California, while others explored the nearby
Wichita Mountains in southwestern Oklahoma for gold (WPA 1992:46–47).
In 1855, another major colonizing venture was begun in the Dallas area when 200 French,
Belgian, and Swiss immigrants arrived to found the utopian settlement of La Reunion, about three
miles west of Dallas along the West Fork of the Trinity River. La Reunion was well funded, with
initial capital of $600,000, but the residents did not adapt well to frontier conditions and the
colony never really prospered. Gradually the members of the colony drifted away, with many
becoming residents of Dallas. The colony officially dissolved in 1867 (WPA 1992:286–290).
Although present, slavery did not loom as large in the economy of the Dallas area as it did farther
to the east. In 1846, there were 45 slaves in Dallas County, a number that grew to 207 by 1850
(Prince 1993:10). In the 1860 census, Dallas County had a total population of 8,655 people, of
whom 1,074 were slaves (Prince 1993:16). Most of the white residents of the county were
southerners by birth and supported the pro-slavery side of the abolition question. As passions
grew during the election of 1860, a fire swept through the Dallas business district, destroying all
but one building. This was immediately assumed to be an abolitionist plot, resulting in the
hanging of three African-Americans, the flogging of the remaining African-Americans in the
county, and the whipping and banishment of two white preachers from Iowa (WPA 1992:53–54).
Following the presidential election of 1860, Texas, in common with the rest of the South, began
to consider secession. In a February 23, 1861, referendum on the issue, Dallas County voted 741
to 237 in favor of secession. Many county residents joined Confederate military units, and after a
516-to-3 vote on the issue, Dallas County donated $5,000 in gold to the Confederate cause. The
Dallas area provided foodstuffs to the Confederate army, and in 1862 a small arms and
ammunition factory opened in Lancaster, south of Dallas. Although the fighting never reached
Northcentral Texas, the region was gradually impoverished by the war. Many of the commodities
that were imported to the region became difficult to obtain and expensive, while the price of food
rose between two and four times its 1861 levels by September 1863. The Dallas Herald was
forced to cease publication between September 30, 1863, and July 2, 1864, due to a lack of
newsprint. Following Lee’s surrender, the Union army occupied Texas and announced the
emancipation of Texas slaves on June 19, 1865 (WPA 1992:55–58).
Although the Dallas area suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War, it was not as
badly affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was
fueled in part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a
fresh start in the as yet unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included Dallas’s location
near one of the cattle trails to Kansas and its role as a center of the buffalo hide market. In 1872,
the Dallas economy received a major boost when the Houston & Texas Central Railroad reached
the city from the south, and in 1873, the Texas & Pacific Railway provided important access to
points east. After the arrival of the railroads, Dallas began to acquire many of the trappings of a
22

major city, including the beginning of a water distribution system in 1873, gas lighting in 1874, a
private telegraph company in 1875, telephones in 1880, and electricity in 1882 (WPA 1992: 60–
70).
An early dream of the Dallas business community was to gain water transport along the Trinity
River. The problems associated with this effort included the seasonal fluctuations in the level of
the Trinity River, as well as the many snags and rafts that had to be removed. The first effort in
this respect occurred in 1866, when the state legislature chartered the Trinity Slack Water
Navigation Company to provide the improvements required for navigation from Galveston to
Dallas. Under the terms of the charter, the company was to receive 5,000 acres of public land for
every lock and dam completed. Unfortunately, the company never started work on the project.
In 1867, Captain J. M. McGarvey agreed to bring his Job Boat No. 1 from Galveston to Dallas.
The journey required seven months, with much of the time being spent removing obstructions
from the river channel. Although Captain McGarvey claimed that the upper Trinity River was
superior to both the upper Red River and the upper Mississippi River, his proposal to provide
regular service to Dallas did not prove practical. Following his arrival, construction began in
Dallas on the steamer Sallie Haynes, which made three trips downriver before being sunk. No
records exist, however, of the Sallie Haynes ever making the voyage all the way to Galveston.
After the railroads arrived in Dallas, interest in river navigation began to wane, although several
small steamers continued to ply the Trinity, some of which are thought to have made the trip from
Galveston to Dallas. In 1881, the state government was asked for $75,000 to remove obstructions
from the river. During the 1890s interest in Trinity River navigation revived, and the Trinity
River Navigation Company was formed in 1891. The company built two steamers, Dallas and
The Dallas, and purchased the H.A. Harvey, Jr., in New Orleans. The Harvey made its way up
the river in 1893, arriving in Dallas on May 13. A dam was built at McCommas Bluff to provide
sufficient water for the steamer, and it spent the next few years carrying cargo between Dallas
and the dam. In 1898, the Harvey and the remains of Dallas were sold to a Galveston firm, and
the Harvey made a four-month voyage downriver to Galveston. In 1899, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) submitted a plan to construct 37 locks and dams between Dallas and the
Gulf of Mexico, permitting navigation of the Trinity River for eight months of each year. The
plan suggested that if a series of artesian wells were to be dug along the river channel, adding to
the water flow, year-round navigation would be possible. In 1902, Congress appropriated
$750,000 to improve the Trinity River, with another $500,000 being appropriated in 1904–1905.
In addition, the citizens of Dallas contributed $66,000 for the construction of a dam at Parson’s
Slough, 26 miles below the city. Nine locks were built before the beginning of World War I. In
1916 the project was reevaluated, with a new estimate of another $13 million and 15 years being
required to complete the project. Finally, in 1921, the USACE recommended that any efforts to
make the Trinity navigable above Liberty were impractical and should be abandoned.
In 1930, renewed interest in river navigation led to the creation of the Trinity River Canal
Association, which in turn sponsored the creation of the Trinity Watershed Soil Conservation and
Flood Control Association in 1936. These two organizations later merged to become the Trinity
Improvement Authority (TIA). In 1955, the State of Texas created the Trinity River Authority
(TRA). Lobbying on the part of the TIA and TRA led to passage of the Trinity River Basin Bill
in 1963; but the bill merely authorized the project and contained no funding. Due to the huge
backlog of river and harbor improvement projects approved by Congress, no funding was ever
appropriated for the project. The dream of a navigable Trinity River once again died in 1979,
when the USACE again determined that navigation of the Trinity River upstream of Liberty was
not economically feasible (Jadrosich 1996; McElhaney 1995; Saunders 1991).
23

The history of Dallas is punctuated with several severe floods, with the floods of 1844, 1858,
1866, 1871, 1890, 1908, and 1913 being particularly memorable. Following the 1908 flood, the
City of Dallas determined to try to reduce the impact of Trinity River flooding. This led to the
construction of the Houston Street Viaduct, a 5,106-foot-long concrete bridge constructed to
ensure communication between Dallas and Oak Cliff even in the event of a major flood. A series
of severe floods in the early 1920s led to renewed interest in flood control projects on the part of
the local government. In 1926, the Dallas County Commissioners created the City and County of
Dallas Levee Improvement District, which formulated the Ulrickson Plan for flood control. This
plan called for the construction of levees, straightening and moving the river channel, additional
viaducts, storm water drainage, and other improvements. The Levee Improvement District, the
City and County of Dallas, and affected utilities and railroads provided funds in excess of
$15,000,000 dollars for the project. Among these improvements were the Cadiz Street Viaduct
(completed in 1932), the Corinth Street Viaduct (completed in 1933), and the Lamar-McKinney
Viaduct (completed in 1934) (Skinner, Whorton, and Trask 1996:18; WPA 1992:85, 94–96, 154–
156).
By 1900, Dallas had become a major commercial and manufacturing center and, with a
population of 42,638, was the third largest city in Texas. In 1908, a devastating flood occurred
along the Trinity River, with the river cresting at 51.3 feet. The flood caused tremendous
property loss, estimated at $2,500,000, and left 4,000 people homeless. The flood shut down the
Dallas and Oak Cliff water systems and caused the collapse of the Texas and Pacific Railroad
trestle across the Trinity, and threatened several other bridges. During World War I, Dallas
served as a training base for aviators, with Love Field and Camp Dick (at the State Fairground)
being used for training. During the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan became a factor in local politics,
achieving particular importance between 1921 and 1924. Dallas’s first radio station, WRR, was
established in 1921, originally as a means of broadcasting emergency messages to the fire
department. By 1927, WRR had become a commercial station. Beginning in 1930, Dallas began
to be severely impacted by the Great Depression (WPA 1992:80–97, 266–267).
The economy of Dallas, and of the nation as a whole, did not begin to recover from the
Depression until the mobilization for World War II began. After the war, the Dallas economy
continued to grow along with the rest of the nation. Dallas’s image was shattered by the Kennedy
assassination on November 22, 1963, and it took many years to recover from this blow. A major
economic downturn occurred in the late 1980s, when a drop in oil prices and the collapse of the
real estate market dealt a severe blow to the Texas economy. This forced the Dallas region to
diversify economically, investing heavily in the modern high-tech industries.

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

The cultural resources survey documented in this report was designed to identify and inventory
archeological sites in addition to other important cultural resources contained within the SH 190
Preliminary Corridor Alternatives. This cultural resources survey was conducted within the
vicinity of the southwestern shore of Lake Ray Hubbard and the western bank of the East Fork of
the Trinity River in Dallas County. The work was undertaken with two primary management
goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas;
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation.
The first of these goals was accomplished through the employment of multiple analytical
strategies consisting of the use of a detailed background review, intensive pedestrian survey,
shovel testing, and reconnaissance survey. As a result, this cultural resources survey identified
and documented eight new archeological sites and one nonsite locality. In addition, the
background research indicated that two previously documented sites exist in the project area. The
remaining portion of this chapter presents the methodological background for the current
investigations, the general survey methods used in the field, and a discussion of the artifact
analysis.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The project area consists of three proposed alterative highway corridors subdivided into five
segments stretching for 11 miles, totaling 355 acres. Prior to beginning fieldwork, background
information concerning the project area was collected and reviewed. The Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas, an online electronic site records data base supported by the Texas Historical
Commission, was consulted in addition to internal review of regionally related reports and an
extensive investigation of regional library holdings. These efforts combined to identify 22
previously recorded sites occurring within 1 mile or 1,600 m of the project corridor, and two of
those sites (41DL112 and 41DL260) were documented within the boundary of the project area
(Figures 3–5).
25

Examinations of topographical maps, aerial photographs, and soil survey data, as well as basic
knowledge of Northcentral Texas archeological site distribution patterns, were used to determine
the survey technique for each property where ROE was secured. These predetermined survey
techniques were subject to review dependent on the field conditions at the time of survey. For
example, the determination to use a pedestrian survey or walkover survey in two separate areas
was predicated on the fact that ground surface visibility at the time of survey was 100 percent
because these areas were recently plowed. Unfortunately, the project area was highly segmented
at the time fieldwork was conducted due to ROE restrictions, which only allowed survey of less
than 25 percent of the entire project area (Table 3).

Walkover survey was conducted by GMI archeologists spaced at 30-m intervals, who then
walked the area, scanning the ground surface for exposed artifacts. When artifacts were observed
on the surface, these artifacts were marked by pin flags and the spacing interval was reduced to
10 m to delineate the surficial extent of the artifact scatter. The process was repeated as often as
necessary until the margins of the surficial scatter of artifacts were identified and the entire area
had been visually inspected. Then, a sketch map of the distribution of the surficial material was
created in conjunction with the collection of global positioning system (GPS) points and a
representative sample of the surficial artifacts. The final step in the evaluation of the surface
scatters involved the excavation of judgmental shovel tests to determine the stratigraphic integrity
of the scatter.

29

A shovel-testing regimen was used to test those properties where ROE had been granted but the
property lacked sufficient ground surface visibility to justify a walkover survey. The first step in
identifying areas for shovel testing was to formulate a probability model based on the background
research for the entire corridor using topographic maps and aerial photographs. As a result, each
property within the entire SH 190 East Branch project area was assigned a probability level of
high, medium, or low, predicated on the likelihood to produce useful archeological information.
Then the properties where ROE had been granted were designated as “areas” and shovel-tested.
It should be noted that not all areas where ROE was secured were shovel-tested, because some of
those properties are situated within the flood plain of the East Fork of the Trinity River and will
require a deep-testing strategy to fully assess. This deep-testing strategy is fully discussed in the
recommendations for future survey in Chapter 6 (see Figures 3–5).
The areas of highest probability tend to be situated near streams, stream crossings, flood plains,
flood plain rises, relatively level areas adjacent to stream confluences, and knolls next to streams.
The designation of high probability areas was further based on the observation that areas must
exhibit the appropriate geologic depositional contexts to contain archeological deposits with
sufficient integrity to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or that merit designation as SALs.
The majority of those locations designated as high probability areas along the proposed highway
corridor alternatives are situated in areas where ROE was not granted or require deep-testing
strategies for accurate assessment. The high probability area surveyed during this effort occurred
within Segment III/Alternative 1 and accounts for 7.1 acres. A total of 14 shovel tests was
excavated in this area, and all failed to reach subsoil due to a thick overburden of modern alluvial
deposits. Based on these results, a deep-testing strategy will be required to assess fully this area.
During the survey of this area, a newly exposed cutbank was investigated and revealed the
presence of a buried soil and a prehistoric site (41DL457).
The majority of the area surveyed has a medium probability for containing cultural materials and
was mostly situated on upland margins, valley walls, and ridges. These medium probability
areas, like the high probability areas, exhibit the appropriate geologic depositional contexts to
contain archeological deposits with sufficient integrity to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or
that merit designation as SALs. Approximately 187.7 acres were surveyed through excavation of
285 shovel tests. As a result, seven newly documented sites (41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452,
41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455, and 41DL456) and one locality (Locality #1) were identified.
Low probability areas include but are not limited to upland drainage divides distant from streams
and those places that exhibit erosion, sediment deflation, and extensive residential or commercial
development. These areas typically have naturally shallow, mixed, disturbed, or eroded deposits.
Thus, the designation of low probability areas was based on the realization that the property likely
does not retain the appropriate geologic context to contain archeological sites with the necessary
integrity and research potential to meet NRHP or SAL eligibility criteria. Approximately 5.6
acres of the project corridor available for survey were classified as occurring in low probability or
disturbed contexts. These areas were not shovel-tested due to obvious impacts.
The proposed segments and alternatives were marked on enlarged digitized project maps derived
from 7.5′ USGS quadrangles, aerial photographs, and property boundary maps, which were
ultimately used as reference tools in the field. A crew ranging from two to five GMI
archeologists conducted the shovel testing by walking three transects spaced at 30–35 m within
the proposed highway corridor in properties where ROE has been granted. The crewmembers,
dependent upon the number of individuals, either proceeded along a single transect or doubled up
30

on one transect and excavated shovel tests in leapfrog fashion. The majority of the shovel testing
during this survey was conducted in a systematic fashion using preset intervals contingent upon
the probability level assigned to the survey area. In high and medium probability areas, intensive
shovel testing was systematically conducted at approximately 30–60-m intervals, and low
probability areas were judgmentally shovel-tested where previous experience suggested the
potential for archeological materials. Judgmental, positive, and delineation shovel tests were
recorded individually on the maps, and GPS points were collected, which were later transferred to
the master set of digital project maps. All exposed surface areas, such as road cuts, animal
burrows, and plowed fields, observed during the survey on properties with secured ROE were
closely inspected for cultural material. This strategy accounted for a total of 299 shovel tests over
the course of the entire project area.
In all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter and were excavated either to
the top of the subsoil (Bt-horizon) or to 80 cm below ground surface. The soil from each shovel
test was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth. When a cultural artifact was
located in a shovel test, a series of no fewer than two additional delineation shovel tests was
excavated nearby to determine whether the find represented a site or locality. In most cases,
delineation shovel tests were excavated in a modified cruciform pattern, spaced 10 m apart,
involving at least four additional shovel tests (one in each cardinal direction). If no further
cultural remains were located, the original artifact was recorded as an isolated locality and the
survey continued. If, on the other hand, additional material was located in any of the additional
shovel tests, the find was recorded as a site, and a total of at least seven shovel tests was
excavated to delineate fully the site extent within the proposed construction corridor. The actual
extent of a cultural resources site beyond the limits of the proposed ROW was not evaluated due
to land access restrictions. The additional delineation shovel tests were also used to obtain
estimates of the site depth and to gather a larger sample of representative artifacts and preliminary
information regarding the stratigraphic integrity of the site. All artifacts recovered from shovel
tests were collected and transported to the GMI laboratory for analysis. Wherever possible,
limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally diagnostic artifacts were also made
to expand the sample of materials for use in evaluating the cultural affiliation, age, and other
research potential issues concerning the site.
Each recorded site was identified with a permanent datum marker consisting of a ⅝-inch-diameter
metal rebar stake placed on the site. This marker was topped with an aluminum cap bearing the
site’s temporary GMI field number. After the site datum was set, its location was recorded using
GPS. Then a scaled pace-and-compass map was prepared for each site, in reference to the site
datum, and generalized contour intervals and vegetation boundaries were sketched onto the field
map. These methods provided a detailed plot of the size, configuration, and elevation variations
across each site. The locations of all shovel tests were mapped, as were all outstanding cultural
and topographic features. Each site was photographed from several viewpoints with a five­
megapixel camera, and images depicted any damage evident to the cultural resources from
vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances of any kind. These photographs were recorded in a
photo log. A State of Texas site recording form was separately prepared for each site, noting
locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated period of occupation, and
both surface and subsurface artifactual material. Finally, the location of the site was plotted on
the appropriate project maps.

31

Site designations were applied only to clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than 10 artifacts),
clusters of subsurface artifacts (two or more positive shovel tests), or significant architectural
properties that were deemed of appropriate age (i.e., greater than 50 years old). Isolated finds or
unique cultural features less than 50 years in age were designated as “localities” and subsequently
recorded in field notes and plotted on topographic maps. The artifactual material observed on a
locality was not collected in the field; rather, the material was described, photographed, and
recorded in the Project Archeologist’s field notes.
There are two exceptions within this survey to the systematic assignment of site classification as
described above. Sites 41DL454 and 41DL455 were originally identified as localities based on
field observations that indicated these two initially defined localities were scatters of modern
trash obviously impacted by bulldozing activities. Limited shovel testing at each failed to recover
subsurface materials. GPS data were collected on each and then cross-referenced against Sam
Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920).
When these data were compared, it became obvious the GPS data overlapped well with the
reported locations of structures. Therefore, these localities were reclassified as archeological
sites, but because they were originally identified as localities, no artifactual materials were
collected. It should be noted, however, that the accuracy of these maps has been called into
question, because PBS&J recently completed digitizing and georeferencing these maps and
reports that both maps reflect a 90 percent confidence level that the reported points fall within
370–400 m of their actual location (Foster et al. 2006). Therefore, these maps should be used
judiciously and treated as primarily referential rather than being used as an accurate
representation of previous historic landscapes.
In addition to the pedestrian survey and shovel-testing program, a reconnaissance survey was
conducted in those areas where ROE was not granted. The reconnaissance survey simultaneously
documents the present condition of the remaining landforms in the project area and strengthens
the assignment of these areas in relation to their probability for producing archeological sites,
which will help guide the future investigation of these areas when ROE is granted. The
reconnaissance survey also serves as a means of clarifying those locations where future
systematic deep testing will need to be employed once full ROE has been granted. This
reconnaissance in combination with the formerly described review of the project area soils
documented several locations with the appropriate context for containing moderately to deeply
buried intact deposits that could conceivably contain archeological remains.
The Project Archeologist maintained field notes concerning sites and localities that documented
survey conditions, vegetation cover, and area covered daily, as well as initial interpretations of
the cultural properties. Additional documentation kept by the Project Archeologist included
artifact provenience catalogs and daily laboratory logs. All documents, artifacts, and other
materials related to this work will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon completion of the project.

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS METHODS
All cultural materials collected during the survey and site recording were returned to the GMI
laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, where all artifacts were washed, catalogued, and labeled in
compliance with TARL standards. Following this, GMI personnel conducted various types of
artifact analyses.
32

The artifact collection recovered from the eight archeological sites and one nonsite locality
investigated during the present survey consists of 43 ecofacts and 161 historic-era artifacts.
Details of the observations collected on each class are summarized below and discussed more
fully in Appendices B and C.

Ecofact Analysis
A total of 43 artifacts representing three ecofact classes was recovered during the survey of the
SH 190 project area. This material includes pieces of baked clay, mussel shell, and faunal
material. It is assumed these artifacts represent evidence of human activity, but these artifacts
could also reflect natural patterns. All the artifacts were recovered from surficial context and lack
appropriate contextual association to clarify the point of origin; therefore, these artifacts are being
treated as ecofacts. All of these artifacts were analyzed by GMI archeologists as to identification,
weight, and quantity (see Appendix B).

Historic Artifact Analysis
One hundred and sixty-one historic-era artifacts were collected during the course of the current
project. These artifacts were examined by laboratory staff for particular attributes and diagnostic
traits, using morphological and/or functional classification systems developed by South (1977).
Recovered artifacts were assigned to four primary categories—Activities, Architectural,
Domestic, and Personal (see Appendix C). The Activities category includes any nonhousehold
items, transportation items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms; five artifacts from the
project were assigned to this category. The Architectural category includes all items related to
buildings, such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items; 35
Architectural artifacts are among the assemblage. The Domestic category designation is used for
items related to food service (tableware) and food storage (including food preparation and tin
cans); Domestic artifacts, totaling 113, dominate the assemblage. Furnishings, a subcategory of
Domestic, encompasses household items such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass and is
represented by five artifacts. The Personal category contains items of individual use such as
clothing, buttons, shoes, dolls, and smoking pipes; three Personal artifacts were recovered during
this survey. Unidentifiable metal fragments and questionable ceramics and glass (i.e., artifacts
that are unidentifiable as to Domestic tableware or storage, Architectural, Personal, or Activities)
are simply identified as Indeterminate; eight artifacts are classified as Indeterminate.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS DATA BASE
Various observations for each artifact, based on classifications mentioned above, were recorded
and entered into an ACCESS data base format on an IBM network system. In addition, computer
printouts of all data were compiled and archived with the permanent project files (Appendix D).
The results of the analyses of this collection are presented along with the descriptions for each
site in the following chapters, and the raw data are presented in Appendices B and C.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

As a result of the current cultural resources survey of the proposed SH 190, eight newly
discovered sites (41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455, 41DL456 and
41DL457) and one locality (Locality #1) were documented. In addition, two previously
documented sites (41DL112 and 41DL260) situated on properties within the project area with
ROE restrictions are discussed (Table 4). Thus, there are a total of 10 archeological sites and one
nonsite locality presently known to occur within the proposed SH 190 East Branch preliminary
corridor alternatives. Those sites and nonsite localities for which evidence was recovered in the
field are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
Eight newly documented archeological sites were identified during this survey. Seven are
historic-era sites dating to the first half of the twentieth century (see Table 5, see Figures 3–5).
Sites 41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL454, and 41DL455 are surface scatters of historic-era
artifacts with no subsurface integrity; 41DL453 and 41DL456 are partly defined on the basis of a
low density of subsurface artifacts. The remaining site (41DL457) is a prehistoric site of
unknown age situated within a deeply buried paleosol along Duck Creek. Those sites that could
not be located, but are identified as being within the project area (41DL112 and 41DL260), are
discussed in this section based on what is currently known. Once ROE is granted, those sites will
need to be investigated further. The one historic-era nonsite locality (Locality #1) is also
discussed in this chapter.

Site 41DL450 (GMI Temp # HS-1)
Site 41DL450 is the northernmost of three separate historic occupations documented during a
walkover survey in a plowed field east of Mesquite Airport. This low-density surficial scatter of
artifacts was identified, recorded, and collected from a recently plowed field with 100 percent
visibility in an area just west of the proposed highway corridor at the northern end of Segment V
Alternative 1 (see Figure 5). The site size, based on the observed surficial distribution of
materials, is estimated to be 0.9 acres. The soils mapped in this area are classified as Branyon

the profiles of the shovel tests excavated on site. Continual plowing and erosion of this
agricultural field contributed to the deflation (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Site 41DL450 in the distance beyond the backpack, and site 41DL451 in the foreground.

During survey, GPS data were collected for both the collected surficial artifacts and locations of
shovel tests. These data were superimposed on digitized versions of Sam Street’s Map of Dallas
County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920) to discover if a
correlation exists between the historic artifact scatter and a former historic structure. The data
correlate well with a building reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900), but when
compared to the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920), the structure is no longer
present.

37

Twenty-five surficial artifacts were identified, flagged, and collected during the walkover survey.
Based on these results, two judgmental shovel tests were excavated to assess the stratigraphic
integrity of the site (Figure 7). Both shovel tests were sterile and shovel test profiles indicated a
plowzone overlying subsoil, meaning the site has been adversely impacted by agricultural
activity. In total, 23 historic-era artifacts and two ecofacts were recovered from the site. The
historic-era material attributable to a specific timeframe (n=13) includes 12 fragments of clear
glass (post-1880) and one fragment of a machine-made brick (post-1903). The remainder of the
historic materials (n=10) are nondescript: six aqua glass fragments, two amber/brown glass
fragment, one piece of possible aluminum, and one iron machine part. The ecofacts are two
fragments of animal teeth that are likely from domesticated cattle. Given their fragmentary
nature and because these artifacts lack provenience, they are cautiously being treated as possible
natural inclusions rather than directly attributable to the site.
Site 41DL450 likely represents evidence from an outbuilding associated with the structure
reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) based on the low density and types of
artifacts recovered. The site is a sparse scatter that lacks features or stratigraphic integrity and is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for SAL designation.

Site 41DL451 (GMI Temp # HS-2)
Site 41DL451 is the central of three separate historic-era artifact scatters documented during a
walkover survey in a plowed field east of Mesquite Airport. The site is characterized by a lowdensity surficial scatter of historic-era artifacts documented in a recently plowed field with 100
percent visibility in the northern end of Segment V/Alternative 1 (see Figure 5). The site size,
based on the observed surficial distribution of materials, is estimated to be 6 acres. The soils
mapped in this area are classified as Branyon clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes. The site area is deflated
according to both surficial observations and the profile of the shovel tests conducted on site.
Continual plowing and erosion of this agricultural field contributed to the deflation (see Figure 6).
GPS data were collected for both the collected surficial artifacts and locations of shovel tests.
These data were superimposed on digitized versions of Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County
(1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920) to discover if a correlation exists
between the historic-era artifact scatter and a former structure. The site data potentially correlate
with a building reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) owned by L. Parker, but
coompared to the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920), the structure is no longer
present. The datable artifacts can tentatively be assigned to the early 1900s.
Forty surficial artifacts were identified, flagged, and collected during the walkover survey. Based
on these results, three judgmental shovel tests were excavated to assess the stratigraphic integrity
of the site (Figure 8). All three shovel tests were sterile and the shovel test profiles indicated a
plowzone directly overlying subsoil, meaning the site has been adversely impacted by agricultural
activity. The collected historic-era material attributable to a specific timeframe (n=30) includes
two amber/brown glass rim fragments (post-1920), one amber/brown bottle base with Owens ring
(post-1910), 11 clear glass fragments (post-1880), one clear glass bottle base with an OwensIllinois trademark (1929–1954), one emerald green glass fragment (post-1930), 12
manganese/solarized glass fragments (1880–1920), one fragment of handmade brick (pre-1903),
and one fragment of machine-made brick (post-1903).

38

The remainder of the historic-era materials (n=9) are nondescript: a piece of concrete, three
amber/brown glass body fragments, one clear window glass fragment, one piece of alloy, two
pieces of aluminum, anda piece of iron. The single ecofact is the umbo and hinge of an
unidentifiable mussel shell. The mussel shell was likely brought onto the site by a human, but
given its fragmentary nature and lack of provenience, it is cautiously being treated as a possible
natural inclusion.
Site 41DL451 likely represents evidence of an outbuilding larger than site 41DL450, potentially
associated with the structure reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) based on the
low density and types of artifacts recovered. The site is a sparse scatter of historic-era artifacts
lacking associated features or stratigraphic integrity and is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for SAL designation.

Site 41DL452 (GMI Temp # HS-3)
Site 41DL451 is the southernmost of three separate historic-era occupations documented during a
walkover survey in a plowed field east of Mesquite Airport (see Figure 5). The site is
characterized by a high-density surficial scatter of historic-era artifacts documented in a recently
plowed field with 100 percent visibility in the northern portion of Segment V/Alternative 1. The
site size, based on the observed surficial distribution of materials, is estimated to be 7.6 acres.
The soils mapped in this area are classified as Branyon clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes. The site area
is deflated according to both surficial observations and the shovel test profiles. Continual
plowing and erosion of this agricultural field contributed to the deflation (Figure 9).

GPS data were collected during survey for both the collected surficial artifacts and locations of
shovel tests. These data were superimposed on digitized versions of Sam Street’s Map of Dallas
County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920) to discover if a
correlation exists between the historic-era artifact scatter and a former structure. The data
potentially correlate with a tenant building reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900)
and a structure reported on the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920). The recovered
artifacts support the presence of a domestic structure circa 1900.
A total of 131 surficial artifacts was identified, flagged, and collected during the walkover survey.
Based on these results six judgmental shovel tests were excavated to assess the stratigraphic
integrity of the site (Figure 10). One of the six shovel tests was positive, but the others were
sterile. The one positive shovel test produced a fragment of machine-made brick that was
recovered in the upper 5 cm of the plowzone. A total of 91 historic-era artifacts and 40 ecofacts
was recovered from the site. The historic-era material recovered from the site attributable to a
specific timeframe (n=65) includes the following: 19 machine-made brick fragments (post­
1903), three fragments of Bristol interior/Bristol exterior (post-1915), two natural clay slipped
interior/natural clay slipped exterior fragments (1875–1900), one light blue tinted whiteware
fragment (1880–1920), nine fragments of pure white whiteware (post-1890), one fragment of ash
tint bottle glass (post-1915), 18 fragments of clear glass (post-1880), one fragment of emerald
glass (post-1930), one fragment of light green bottle glass (post-1910), eight manganese/solarized
fragments dating between 1880–1920, and two fragments of milk glass from the inset lid of a
fruit jar dating between 1870–1950.
The remaining historic-era materials (n=26) are nondescript: two fragments of concrete, two
fragments of dressed stone, a fragment of off-white glazed porcelain, a body fragment of
amber/brown glass, four fragments of aqua glass, a fragment of cobalt blue glass, two fragments
of light green glass, two fragments of milk glass, four window glass fragments, six pieces of iron
including a mule shoe, and a two-holed shell button.
The 40 ecofacts fall into two categories: 37 fragments of burned clay and three faunal remains
(one unidentifiable mussel shell fragment and two animal bone fragments). The baked clay is
unidentifiable to source because it could be the result of a natural fire or the by-product of human
activity. The faunal remains may have been brought onto the site by a human, but given the
fragmentary nature and lack of provenience they are cautiously being treated as possible natural
inclusions.
Site 41DL452 likely represents a domestic structure based the correlation of the site data with
Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA
1920). The materials from the site indicate a turn-of-the-nineteenth century through early
twentieth-century occupation. Although the artifact density is high and only a representative
sample of the artifacts present was collected, the site lacks stratigraphic integrity, and no features
were observed. Site 41DL452 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL.

42

Site 41DL453 (GMI Temp # HS-4)
Site 41DL453 was first identified during shovel testing near the intersection of Lawson Road and
the access road to the City of Mesquite Sewer Disposal within Segment V/Alternative 2 (see
Figure 5). The site is represented by a low-density, subsurface artifact scatter that covers 0.7
acres. The shovel test profiles indicated that 10–20 cm of intact deposits exist at the site, and the
deposits thin to the south and west. The area is overgrown with small- to medium-sized trees and
may have been plowed at one time (Figure 11). The soil for the site is classified as Ferris-Heiden
complex, 5 to 12 percent slopes, and is heavily eroded closer to the drainage in this area.
Figure

Figure 11. Site 41DL453, looking south from the northern property fence.

GPS data were not collected during survey, but because the site was located at such a prominent
intersection, it was easily plotted. The location of this site was superimposed on Sam Street’s
Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920) to
discover if a correlation exists between the site and a former historic-era structure. The data
correlate well with a tenant building reported on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900), but
compared to the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920), the only structure in this
vicinity is on the opposite side of the road. The recovered artifacts support occupation at the site
from 1900–1950, which is at odds with the information gathered from the historical maps.
Thirteen artifacts were recovered from seven of the 15 shovel tests excavated onsite (Figure 12).
All artifacts are historic-era, and seven are attributable to specific timeframes: two fragments of a
machine-made brick (post-1903), four fragments of pure white whiteware (post-1890), and one
44

piece of a two-holed Bakelite button dating from 1907–1940. The remainder of the historic-era
materials (n=6) are nondescript: one fragment of off-white glazed porcelain, one fragment of
amber/brown glass, two fragments of clear window glass, one brass/copper disk, and one piece of
iron.
Based on the correlation of the site data with Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900), site
41DL453 may represent a structure, but contrasting evidence exists on the 1920 Soil Survey of
Dallas County (USDA 1920). The site does possess 10–20 cm of intact deposits, but the artifact
density is low, and no features were encountered. Therefore, the site 41DL453 is recommended
as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

Site 41DL454 (GMI Temp # HS-5)
Site 41DL454 was first identified as a locality within Segment II/Alternative 1 just to the north of
a two-track road (see Figure 3). Observed material included an unknown concrete form, a rusty
metal drum, and construction debris of stacked concrete post footings, corrugated metal siding,
machine-made brick fragments bearing the word “Ferris,” and several rotting boards (Figures 13
and 14). Vegetation at the time of survey was dense briar that obscured the surface material, but
the site is estimated to cover 0.1 acre. A small driveway or access road may possibly run along
the eastern edge of this area, based on differential vegetation, but this remains unconfirmed. The
soils for this area are reported as Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes.
GPS data were collected at the site and then superimposed onto digital versions of the Sam
Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920).
The results indicated the two-track access road and the site correlate well with a reported tenant
structure. The Dallas soil survey map of 1920 indicates a structure slightly to the east of the site,
but the Sam Street map from 1900 shows a structure to the west. Therefore, it is possible that
some of the materials present at this locality are older than first thought or that the concrete form
is tangential to a larger nearby structure that lies just outside the project area. Consequently, this
locality was reclassified as a site, despite lacking subsurface integrity.
Because the site was originally classified as a locality, none of the artifactual materials were
collected. However, shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of these historic materials (Figure
15). All shovel tests were sterile.
Site 41DL454 likely represents an outbuilding to a larger structure reported on both Sam Street’s
Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920). The
surficial evidence is likely from the first half of the 1900s, but the site lacks stratigraphic and
cultural integrity; therefore, it is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL.

Site 41DL455 (GMI Temp # HS-6)
Site 41DL455 was first identified as a locality within Segment II/Alternative 1 just to the north of
a two-track road (see Figure 3). The initial observations at this locality indicated a large expanse
of modern debris (material dating to the mid-1900s mixed with modern trash) scattered across the
surface (Figure 16). The area is covered in a scrub juniper forest and appears to have been

bulldozed flat at some point in the past. The area is unnaturally flat and the artifacts appear as
smears across the ground surface. The soils for this area are reported as Heiden clay, 2 to 5
percent slopes.
GPS data were collected and superimposed on digital versions of Sam Street’s Map of Dallas
County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920). The results of this
research indicated the nearby north-south trending two-track access road, and the location of the
site correlated well with information presented in the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA
1920) and with a structure just to the north of the site, which is likely the source of some of the
observed artifactual material. The Sam Street map indicates the structure was owned by S.
Myers.
Because the site was originally classified as a locality, none of the artifactual materials were
collected, but nine shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of these historic materials. All
shovel tests were sterile (Figure 17); two units indicated disturbed subsoil. Materials noted on the
surface include clear bottle glass, aqua bottle glass, fragments of whiteware, pieces of plastic, a
modern jacket, and fragments of terra cotta.
49

Site 41DL455 is likely the surficial remains of the historic-era building reported on both Sam
Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920),
with accumulated modern debris. There is no integrity left to the deposits in this area; therefore,
the site is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

Site 41DL456 (GMI Temp # HS-7)
Site 41DL456 was first identified through a shovel test on a slope overlooking the flood plain of
North Mesquite Creek located to the west of the intersection of Lawson Road and Clay Mathis
Road (see Figure 5). The site covers an area of roughly 1.9 acres. At the time of survey,
obviously recent bulldozing activity had impacted the entire proposed highway corridor and the
hill where the site is located, because debris pushpiles were interspersed across the property (Figure
18). Trees and some modern construction debris, including machine-made brick fragments, were
observed in the pushpile on top of the rise near the positive shovel test. Many locations along the
slope of the hill were noted where the ground has clearly been recently scraped. A search of the
area identified a standing brick-lined well to the southwest of the positive shovel test, where the
toe slope meets the North Mesquite Creek flood plain (Figure 19). The bricks were all machinemade, stamped with the word “Ferris,” and mortared together. No other artifacts were observed
around the well. The soils for this area are reported as Lewisville silty clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes.

GPS data were not collected during survey because the site location near such a prominent
intersection made it easy to plot. The location of this site was superimposed on digital versions of
Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA
1920) to discover if a correlation exists between the site and any former historic-era structures.
The data correlate well with a possible tenant building on Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County
(1900) and with an unknown structure to the northwest on the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County
(USDA 1920).
Eleven shovel tests were excavated on and near the margin of the toe slope, but only one
produced subsurface artifacts (Figure 20). The ground surface was inspected, but because of
bulldozing activity, the majority of the upper portion of the area was disturbed and piled amongst
the debris. The three artifacts recovered from the initial shovel test include two whiteware
fragments (post-1890) and one fragment of aqua glass.
Site 41DL456 is likely the remnants of the historic-era tenant building on Sam Street’s Map of
Dallas County (1900) and an unidentified structure on the 1920 Soil Survey of Dallas County
(USDA 1920), but the site has been adversely impacted by recent bulldozing activities. There is
little integrity left to the deposits in this site; therefore, the site is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

52

Site 41DL457 (GMI Temp # PS-1)
Site 41DL457 is the only newly identified prehistoric site associated with the SH 190 survey.
Because of access limitations, the site was discovered during shovel testing of a small area on the
north bank of Duck Creek near a power line corridor in Segment III/Alternative 1 (see Figure 4).
A newly exposed, 200-ft-long cutbank observed during survey exhibited an expanse of deeply
buried soil (Figure 21). The cutbank was profiled and inspected for cultural materials (Figure
22). Further investigations of the cutbank resulted in the identification and documentation of a
prehistoric hearth (site 41DL457). The soils in this area are mapped as Frio silty clay, frequently
flooded.

Figure 21. Newly exposed Duck Creek cutbank exhibiting a 200-ft expanse of deeply buried paleosol that contains
hearth site 41DL457

The hearth measures 25-x-5 cm and is 3–3.5 m below the modern ground surface (Figure 23).
The cutbank profile indicates an overburden of 2–2.5 m of modern alluvial deposits overlying a
buried soil. The hearth is 0.9–1 m below the surface of the buried soil. The profile of the hearth
indicates it is a convex-shaped hearth with associated charcoal, burned limestone, fire-cracked
rock (FCR), and burned earth. No other artifacts were associated with this burning, but because it
represents a discrete episode, it is assumed to be cultural. The cultural affiliation or age of the
hearth is unknown, but given the depth of this feature within the buried intact soil, it could
potentially be Archaic in age. These conclusions are tentative at present and need to be
corroborated through additional investigations. At this time, the site is of unknown eligibility for
NRHP inclusion or for designation as an SAL.

Site 41DL112 (Previously Documented)
Site 41DL112 was originally documented in 1940 as a potential aceramic Caddo (Late
Prehistoric) open habitation site by Forrest Kirkland (1940). The site was defined on the basis of
observed mussel shells, lithic debitage, and arrowheads. There is no documentation showing that
the site has been revisited since it was initially recorded. It is located on a piece of property that
presently has not granted ROE within Segment V/Alternative 2, but site 41DL112 should be
investigated when ROE for this area has been obtained (see Figure 5).

Site 41DL260 (Previously Documented)
The site was originally documented in 1985 by Mark Etheridge on behalf of Nathan D. Maier
Consulting Engineers of Dallas, Texas (see Figure 5). The site form describes the site as having
two discrete historic artifact concentrations, a well, and three foundation posts. The artifacts

collected from the site appear to represent two time periods—one circa the 1920s and the other
spanning the 1950s. The site was reported as having been impacted by bulldozing activities and
massive burning, as witnessed through melted glass and burned posts (Etheridge 1985; Nathan D.
Maier 1985).
The site was revisted in 1999 by GMI archaeologist during investigations for the Falcon’s Lair
Development for the City of Mesquite (Hunt et al. 1999). These investigations reported that
additional bulldozing had impacted the site, resulting in the expansion of the areal extent of the
site. Investigations recovered 19 surface and nine subsurface artifacts, and documented four
cultural features. These features included confirmation of the presence of the brick-lined well,
the remains of a burned foundation post, and two new features—a concentration of gravel
representing a potential driveway, and a second scatter of brick representing a possible fireplace.
Archival research reported in the two previously discussed reports indicate the site correlates well
with a structure on the Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920) that does not appear on Sam
Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900). Regardless of the correlation, the artifactual material
recovered during this 1999 survey confirmed the presence of both a 1920s and a 1950s
occupation. The site had suffered adverse impacts from multiple bulldozing episodes, however,
and was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as an SAL and no
additional work was recommended.

LOCALITY 1
A locality is considered to represent an ephemeral use area and, lacking substantial cultural
remains, fails to meet the criteria for a site. Localities are not assessed for NRHP inclusion or for
designation as an SAL, but are documented in reports.
Locality 1 was assigned to a modern concrete slab found within Segment II/Alternative 2 on the
west side of a pre-existing two-track road within the Texas Utilities Electric Company property to
the north of Barnes Bridge Road (see Figure 3). The locality was documented through the
examination of the ground surface, excavation of two sterile shovel tests, and digital photographs.
The location of Locality 1 was compared to both the Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1920)
and Sam Street’s Map of Dallas County (1900) and both maps show structures within 300 m, but
given the modern appearance of the slab (Figure 24) and because no artifacts were recovered, it is
assumed to be modern.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF RECONNAISSANCE SURVEY
An estimated 75 percent of the SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives was inaccessible due to
ROE restrictions at the time of fieldwork (see Table 1). However, those areas without ROE were
subjected to a reconnaissance evaluation to confirm the background research collected for the
project area in an effort to determine a future course of action for additional investigations.

57

Observations in the field confirmed the background research expectation of discovering three
extensive disturbance areas. One of the disturbance areas accounts for the majority of Segment
III/Alternative 2B. This segment is mostly situated in the uplands near the southwestern shore of
Lake Ray Hubbard and has long been used as pasture for cattle. These uplands are interspersed
with local stock ponds and erosional gullies (Figure 25). Therefore, once ROE is granted, a
closer inspection of this alternative should confirm these observed disturbances.
Figure

25.

Upland stock pond and associated erosion in Segment III/Alternative 2B

Figure 25. Upland stock pond and associated erosion in Segment III/Alternative 2B.

A second area extensively impacted is located to the north of the proposed intersection of SH 190
with U.S. 80 within Segment IV/Alterative 1. The area has been extensively impacted by
localized gravel operations, road construction, and terracing (Figure 26). Mounds of dirt reflect
the gravel operations, and obvious terraces are present to the east of the gravel spoils.
The final area of extensive disturbance occurs at the southern end of Segment V/Alternative 2
southeast of the Mesquite Sewer Treatment Facility, where construction of a new water pipeline
is crosscutting the proposed highway corridor. It is unknown who is responsible for this
construction, and no data were available concerning a previous survey. This new pipeline is
closely parallels the northern shore of an obviously channeled portion of the South Mesquite
Creek. The topographic maps for this area show the creek running in a straight line, which is
highly unnatural, to the southeast from the sewer treatment facility. Observations made in the
area confirm channelization of this creek (Figure 27), but also suggest the presence of a buried
soil (Figure 28).

Northern cutbank of South Mesquite Creek

Figure 28. Northern cutbank of South Mesquite Creek.

The cutbank of the South Mesquite Creek, in an accessible area, was profiled and investigated for
an intact paleosol. Even though the sloping bank presented difficulties, the profile revealed that a
potential buried soil might be present at a depth of nearly 2 m below the modern ground surface.
Thus, despite the fact that the majority of the area surrounding South Mesquite Creek has been
impacted, the possibility exists for an intact paleosol. The GMI survey for the Falcon’s Lair
project (Hunt et al. 1999) was designed to include geoarcheological investigations of this area,
but because of adverse conditions, investigations were abandoned. Consequently, initiation of a
systematic deep-testing process, through excavation of a series of cores, followed by backhoe
trenching in areas exhibiting the appropriate setting for preserved archeological contexts, is
prudent as a precautionary measure to test the hypothesis that the South Mesquite Creek has been
channelized.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The intensive pedestrian survey of the SH 190 East Branch Preliminary Corridor Alternatives was
designed to investigate properties within the project area for which ROE has been granted to
document previously unknown cultural resources, reassess previously recorded archeological
sites, and collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. A discussion and assessment of the NRHP eligibility
of each of the eight sites and the one nonsite locality recorded or revisited during the present survey
were presented with the description of each site in Chapter 5. This chapter presents a more detailed
discussion of the NRHP and SAL criteria and provides a summary of the assessments of the
identified archeological sites in relation to their potential for fulfilling these criteria. In addition,
recommendations for the future treatment of these resources are summarized.

ELIGIBILITY FOR INCLUSION IN THE NRHP
The archeological properties discussed in this report were evaluated according to criteria based on
federal regulations for determining the significance of cultural resources for inclusion in the
NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR § 60.4].

61

Usually, Criterion “D” is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important
information is generally recognized to refer to scientific importance. However, scientific
importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the time and in part by the state of
available information regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. The
purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum drawers with relics, but rather to
fill informational gaps relating to specific research domains. As research progresses within a
region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some of those research domains. Through
time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though
complementary data are often needed from different periods, seasons, settings, and site types to
fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to address specific questions
approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of that kind of repetitive
information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification criteria of important
historic properties are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain. Archeological sites with
integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

ELIGIBILITY FOR INCLUSION IN THE SAL PROGRAM
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private land that has been specifically designated as an SAL . . .
and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

The East Branch of the SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives is ultimately administered by
TxDOT, whose existence is through the State of Texas enabling legislation, and is for the benefit
of several communities whose charter is recognized by the State of Texas. Thus, the conditions
as entities of the State of Texas mean that the first condition of SAL designation is met. The five
criteria of the second condition are very generalized, occasionally ambiguous, and might apply to
virtually any archeological site. For example, the first criterion of sufficient preservation of
materials to “allow application of standard archeological techniques to advantage” is vague as to
the meaning of the use of “techniques to advantage.” Clearly, some kinds of surface recording
techniques could be applied to preserved chipped stone remains in a highly disturbed and shallow
archeological site for the advantage of illustrating methods in a classroom teaching exercise.
Nevertheless, we would argue that without some degree of context, such sites are neither worthy
62

of nor warrant SAL designation simply because they contain archeological remains. We tend to
place greater emphasis on the SAL criteria for sites with integrity (criterion B), addition of new
information (criterion C), and/or unique or rare attributes (criterion D), over the criteria for the
preservation sufficient to apply archeological techniques (criterion A) or the mere opportunity to
test techniques, theories, and methods (criterion E). In so doing, SAL criteria strongly resemble
the NRHP criteria involving the criteria of site integrity and potential to contain information
significant to prehistory. Based on survey results derived from surface inspection and placement
of a few shovel tests, we are able to identify some sites that do not contain important information.
However, for some sites, additional data collection using formal test excavations is needed to
formally resolve the importance of the site. As such, they are regarded as having an “unknown
eligibility” status.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The present survey for the SH 190 East Branch Preliminary Corridor Alternatives resulted in the
identification and documentation of nine new cultural properties: eight archeological sites
(41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455, 41DL456 and 41DL457) and
one nonsite locality (Locality 1). In addition, two previously recorded archeological sites
(41DL112 and 41DL260) were identified as occurring within the project area and are discussed,
despite the lack of ROE presently restricting their investigation on the ground.
Current conditions and National Register recommendations for the eight historic-era and two
prehistoric archeological sites directly investigated in the field or reviewed by way of site forms are
presented in Table 7. Nonsite Locality 1 fails to meet the criterion for designation as a site and is
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for SAL designation. All the historic sites (41DL260,
41DL450, 41DL451, 41DL452, 41DL453, 41DL454, 41DL455 and 41DL456) are recommended
as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, because these sites have all been impacted by various
agricultural or landscaping activities and either lack subsurface materials or have an extremely low
density of materials that offers little chance of providing additional scientific knowledge.
Based on the results of this study and the previous Hunt et al. (1999) investigations, the two
prehistoric sites (41DL112 and 41DL457) attributable to unknown prehistoric periods are currently
of unknown eligibility and require further investigation (see Table 7). It is recommended that both
sites be more thoroughly investigated once ROE is obtained before a final decision is made
concerning their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
The results of limited geoarcheological investigation conducted along the Duck Creek cutbank
indicate large expanses of intact buried paleosols in this drainage; therefore, additional survey needs
to be conducted within this drainage and in all other areas where Frio or Trinity clays are found (see
Figures 3–5). The expenditure of efforts to conduct deep testing can be reduced or avoided if the
potential number of segment alternatives is reduced from the present number and proposed
trajectories.
Finally, as a result of the reconnaissance survey and the confirmation of deeply buried soil near
and including prehistoric site 41DL457 as well as the potentially buried soil at South Mesquite
Creek, it is recommended that all locations where Frio clays and Trinity clays are present within
the project area be investigated using a deep-testing strategy to assess accurately the potential for

archeological sites. An example of a cost effective deep-testing procedure would involve coring
the project area to determine if the depositional environment contains a buried paleosol. These
initial cores would then dictate the location of further investigations carried out through backhoe
trenches designed to test the underlying deposits for potential archeological materials. For
example, the observations made in the Duck Creek drainage indicate 2–3 m of overburden over
intact paleosols, which is a much deeper depth than originally anticipated (see Figures 21–23). It
is assumed the overlying modern alluvial deposits will increase in relative depth closer to the
confluence of Duck Creek and the East Fork of the Trinity River. Thus, a systematic deep-testing
strategy with the ability to reach depths of at least 4 m will likely be required for an accurate
assessment of these areas.
At the conclusion of these investigations, materials related to this project will be curated at the
Texas Archeology Research Laboratory in Austin.

APPENDIX A
SUMMARY SOIL DESCRIPTIONS
SH 190 PRELIMINARY CORRIDOR ALTERNATIVES

Soil Series Morphology
The proposed SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives project stretches for 11 miles and covers
nearly 355 acres. These proposed highway alternatives cross many different soil units according
to the Soil Survey of Dallas County (USDA 1980). These soil units are brief discussed in Chapter
2 along with their associated probability for providing archeological information. The purpose of
this appendix is to provide a more detailed background for each of the soil units discussed in
Chapter 2, which ultimately supports the probability designation of each soil unit for providing
additional archeological information and justification for the recommended future deep-testing
strategy.
Altoga - consists of deep, well drained, clayey soils that are formed in old alluvium on ridges and
side slopes. 5 to 12 percent slopes.
The upper solum is 35 to 65 inches thick. The soil is moderately alkaline throughout. The
calcic horizon is at a depth of 25 to 45 inches. The A horizon is 3 to 12 inches thick. It is
grayish brown, pale brown, or light yellowish brown. The B horizon is silty clay, silty clay
loam, or clay loam that is 38 to 50 percent clay. It is very pale brown, yellowish brown, light
yellowish brown, pale yellow, or light brownish gray. The B horizon might have mottles in
shades of gray brown, or yellow.
Branyon - consists of deep, moderately well drained, nearly level clayey soils. They formed in
clayey alluvial sediment on old stream terraces. 0-1 percent slopes.
The solum is 60+ inches thick. Intersecting slickensides are common below about 16 inches
and extend to a depth of 80+ inches. Siliceous and limestone pebbles make up 0-10 percent
of some pedon(s) - the smallest volumes that can be called “a soil.” A pedon is three
dimensional and large enough to permit study of all horizons. Its area ranges from about 10­
100 square feet (1square meter to 10 square meters), depending on the variability of the soil.
In 85 percent or more of each pedon, subhorizons having matrix colors or mottles of chroma
more than 1.5 are at a depth of 50 to about 80 inches.
Burleson - made up of deep, moderately well drained, clayey soils. They are formed on clayey
alluvial sediment on old stream terraces. 0-3 percent slopes.
The solum is 40 to 70 inches thick. In areas of virgin rangeland and in areas of former
cropland that have been idle for as much as 10 years, a Gilgai microrelief is well defined. In
most pedons, intersecting slickensides are common at a depth of about 2 feet. The texture is
clay throughout the profile. Dry soils will have a hard surface with a ¼ to ½ inch thick crust
with a light gray color.
Normally, the A horizon will be noncalcareous and 25 inches thick on microknolls and ranges
to 50+ in microdepressions. When dry, horizons within are very dark gray- gray. The AC
horizon is grayish brown, dark grayish brown, gray, light brownish gray, light olive gray, or
pale olive. It has common brown, yellow, or olive mottles. The C horizon is grayish brown,
olive gray, gray, or dark gray and has brownish or olive mottles. In some pedons, the AC and
C horizons may have calcium carbonate concretions.
Ferris - consists of deep, well, drained, sloping and strongly sloping clayey soils that were
formed in clayey marine sediment on uplands. 5-12 percent slopes.
The solum is 30-60 inches thick. Soils generally have open cracks 20+ inches deep during the
summer. The soil is calcareous throughout.
A-3

The A horizon, when dry, is grayish brown, brown, light yellowish brown, light olive brown,
olive brown, olive gray, or olive. Where the color value is less than 3.5 when the soil is dry,
the horizon is less than 12inches thick or makes up less than ½ of the pedon. The AC horizon
is olive, olive gray, light olive brown, or light grayish brown. Some models may be observed
in shades of brown, gray, yellow, or olive. The C horizon is weathered shally clay or shale.
The gray colors are derived from the shale. In most pedons, the C horizon has concretions of
soft masses of calcium carbonate. Pedons may have gypsum crystals in the AC and C
horizons.
Frio - consists of deep, well drained, clayey soils. They formed in recent alluvium on flood
plains. 0-2 percent slopes.
The depth to sand, gravel or limestone is 6+ feet. When dry, the soil is dark grayish brown,
very dark grayish brown, very dark brown, or dark brown. In some areas the soil may be 5­
10 percent limestone or siliceous pebbles.
Heiden - consists of deep, well drained, clayey soils. They were formed in clayey marine
sediments on uplands. 1-12 percent slopes.
The A and AC horizons combined are 40-65+ inches thick. Cracks form to a depth of 20+
inches more than once per year. Slickensides are common between depths of 20-40 inches.
The soil is moderalty alkaline clay throughout. There are few places were the soil is not
calcareous. When dry, the A horizon is dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown, dark
brown, dark gray, or very dark gray. The chroma, a quality of color combining hue and
saturation, is less than 1.5. The surface layer is –12 inches thick in more than half of the
pedon. Some pedons may contain crystals in the AC-C horizons. The C horizon ranges from
strongly weathered shaly clay to slightly weathered shale that is noncalcareoius in some
areas.
Houston Black - consists of deep, moderately well drained, clayey soils that formed in clayey
marine sediment on uplands. 0-4 percent slopes.
The solum is 60+ inches thick. Cracks are 1-10 cm wide may reach a depth of 20+ inches
more than once a year. Intersecting slickensides are common at a depth of 16-40 inches.
Some areas may have few hard siliceous pebbles throughout. In areas where the soil rests
upon chalk, there may be few thin chalky fragments on the surface of the soil.
Houston soils that are found throughout native pastures have a Gilgai relief of microknolls
and microdepreesion 10-15 across. In sloping areas, the surface ranges from thick on the
microknolls and ridges to very thick in the microdepressions and valleys. There is also a
deep tonguing of the individual A horizons. In cultivated areas, the Gilgai relief has been
smoothed out.
When the soil is dry, the A horizon in microdepressions is dark gray, very dark gray, or black.
The A horizons below the Ap horizon are dark grayish brown, brown, olive brown, olive, or
olive gray. The soil is mildly to moderately alkaline. The AC horizon is at a depth of 6-18
inches on the microknolls and at a depth of 20+ inches in the microdepressions. The brownish
colored AC horizon has chroma of more than 1.5. In some pedons, the AC horizon has gray,
brown, and yellow mottles. The soil is moderately alkaline.

A-4

Lewisville - consists of deep, well-drained, clayey soils that formed in old alluvium on stream
terraces. 0-8 percent slopes.
The solum is 30-60 inches thick, and is usually of silty clay. In some pedons it is silty clay
loam. The mollic epipedon is 10-20 inches thick. The soil is calcareous throughout, and
generally there are threads and films of calcium carbonate in all horizons below the mollic
epipedon.
When dry, the A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or dark brown.
The B horizon is brown, light brown, grayish brown, dark yellowish brown, yellowish brown,
or light yellowish brown. In most pedons, concretions and soft lumps of calcium carbonate
are in the B and C horizons; they generally make up less than 5 percent, by volume, of the
soil within a depth of 40 inches.
Stephen - consists of shallow, well drained, clayey soils on uplands that are formed in material
derived from soft limestones of the Austin Chalk formations. 1-5 percent slopes.
The solum ranges from 10-20 inches in thickness. The content of calcium carbonate ranges
from 5- about 35 percent. Chalk or chalky limestone fragments range from none to many. In
most areas where it is near soils of the Eddy series, fragments of chalk are on the surface.
When dry, the A horizon is dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or dark grayish brown.
The A1 horizon, if present, is mainly silty clay that is 40-50 percent clay. The underlying
chalky limestone is soft to strongly cemented.
Sunev - consists of well-drained, deep, loamy soils that formed in highly calcareous loamy
sediment on uplands and colluvial footslopes. 1-8 percent slopes.
The clay content is 25-35 percent. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40-65
percent in the control section. At times, gravel beds are below a depth of 40 inches.
In some pedons, the A horizon is noncalcareous. It is 10-20 inches thick. When dry, the A
horizon is dark grayish brown, or very dark grayish brown. When dry, the B horizon is
brown, pale brown, very pale brown, yellowish brown, or light yellowish brown clay loam,
loam, or silty clay loam. Films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate range from
few-10 percent of the mass. The C horizon, if present, is light yellowish brown or pale
brown. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 35-70 percent.
Trinity - consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in recent alluvium on flood
plains. Less than 1 percent slopes.
Soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout. Cracks present may reach a depth
of 30+ inches, and as much as 2cm wide at a depth of 20 inches. Intersecting slickensides are
between depths of 10-40 inches.
When dry, the A horizon is dark grey, very dark grey, or black. The Ap horizon, if present, is
very dark grayish brown. In some pedons, the subsurface layer is faintly mottled in shades of
olive and olive yellow. Soils in some pedons have chroma of 2 or more below a depth of 24
inches; these areas are mainly on flood plains of streams, such as Mesquite Creek, that drain
into the East Fork and Elm Fork of the Trinity River. There may be calcium carbonate
concretions and black concretions (likely from iron and manganese) throughout.

APPENDIX B
ECOFACTS ANALYSIS DATA

ECOFACT ANALYSIS
The ecofacts recovered during this survey of the SH 190 Preliminary Corridor Alternatives
consist of surficial faunal material and fragments of unimpressed baked clay and mussel shell.
The ultimate goal in collecting these materials was to document their association with the
surficial evidence observed during the walkover survey that ultimately led to the documentation
of sites 41DL450, 41DL451, and 41DL452. These materials are likely associated with the
historic-era occupation of these sites, but because they lack provenience, their association is not
confirmed. Therefore, these artifacts are considered to be supporting evidence of these
occupations that needs to be considered carefully.
The preliminary analysis of these materials included the tabulation of basic metrics such as
weight and count. The results of the analysis are presented in the following table.

APPENDIX C
HISTORIC-ERA ARTIFACT ANALYSIS DATA

FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND ENUMERATION OF
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS COLLECTED DURING THE PROJECT

Introduction
The analysis of the historical material makes use of four major analytical categories or classes of
artifacts, consisting of:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Domestic;
Architectural;
Personal; and
Activities.

Unidentified metal fragments and ceramic or glass sherds that are unclassifiable as to category are
placed in a separate, indeterminate category. Although the use of these artifact categories may
perpetuate ideas about functional classifications, it is felt that at the survey level of research, such
an analytical framework is the most efficient way to handle the artifactual data.
Major artifact categories are sorted into various subcategories, including tableware, food storage,
and furnishings. These are then sorted into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the
type of subcategory and material type. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are
associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible. The general nature of each of the
major artifact categories is discussed below.

DOMESTIC ARTIFACTS
The domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumes some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares include stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items are identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g.,
nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and are assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items or storagewares are also subdivided as to whether they were ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items are further subdivided into types and subtypes
using technological and decorative attributes, such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., gray bodied, bristol, cobalt, slipped, Albany slip, natural
slip) and interior treatment (e.g., blue gray, Bristol, slipped, Albany slip, unglazed). These
attributes form the basis for assigning production dates to individual specimens.
Glass storageware is subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); and either decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base),
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded), or sometimes function
(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). Individual items are given
C-3

artifact-specific dates based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination. Metal storageware pieces may consist of storage cans or pots, but are most often
represented by metal canning jar lids.
The furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service or food storage-related household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historical artifact assemblage from rural sites and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass.
Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the domestic category.
In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the architectural or activities categories.

ARCHITECTURAL ARTIFACTS
The architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of architectural items include such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails are further subdivided as to
whether they are wrought, cut, or wire; and the brick is distinguished as to whether it is
handmade, machine-made, or high-fired.

PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
The personal item category includes items of individual use, such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historical archeological sites.

ACTIVITIES ARTIFACTS
The final analytical category of historical artifacts relates to what have been called activities
items. This category includes all nonhousehold items, such as those associated with
transportation activities and farm-related equipment. As with personal items, this category often
makes up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts
from a site. Activity category items include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples,
fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for activities
items include tools, harness and equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons,
and coal.
