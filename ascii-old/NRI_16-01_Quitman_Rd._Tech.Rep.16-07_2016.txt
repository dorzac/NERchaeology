ABSTRACT
Client: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Border Patrol
Land Status: Private, Texas State Land
Project Title: A Cultural Resources Survey of the Quitman Repeater Tower Road near Sierra
Blanca, Hudspeth County, Texas

Permit: Texas Historical Commission Permit No. 7542
Project Description: At the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Northland
Research, Inc. (Northland) conducted a cultural resource survey of 3.9 miles of the Quitman
Repeater Tower Road, in Hudspeth County, Texas. The project area includes 2.7 miles (43 acres)
of private land and 1.2 miles (18.6 acres) of Texas State Land. A 40-m wide area centered on the
existing road was surveyed. Northland completed the fieldwork to address the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Directive (D) 023-01 and CBP requirements that ensure CBP
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and guidelines
established by the State of Texas.
Project Location: The project area, labeled the Quitman Repeater Tower Road, includes portions
of Skunk Canyon Road, Love Road, and an unnamed road segment from Love Road to the repeater
tower location on the Quitman Mountains. The area of investigation is located roughly eight miles
west of Sierra Blanca, Texas, south of Interstate 10.
Number of Acres: 61.6 acres, including 43 acres of private land and 18.6 acres of Texas State
Land
Previously Recorded Sites: None
Newly Recorded Sites: Two, 41HZ799 (Bonanza Mine), 41HZ800
Comments: Northland has completed a Phase I cultural resources survey of the Quitman Repeater
Tower Road located in Hudspeth County, Texas. A pedestrian survey of the project area was
completed on 9–10 February 2016. The project was conducted at the request of U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP)—Task Order HSBP1015F00483, Work Order 07—to identify and assess
the significance of cultural resources along the 3.9 mile (6.3 km) road segments that comprise the
project area prior to proposed maintenance of existing roads.
As a result of the survey, two new archaeological sites were recorded. The first site—
41HZ799—is the historical Bonanza Mine. Operation of the mine between the 1880s and 2013 is
documented. During the survey, Northland recorded 41 features associated with the mine including
shafts, adits, structure foundations, trash dumps, and more. The site is recommended National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligible under Criterion A (broad patterns of history) and
Criterion D (information potential). The mine may also be eligible under Criterion B (significant
persons) for its association with the Love family and their role in regional history. The existing
road passes through the northern portion of the site. One feature, considered a non-contributing
i

element, has already been impacted by the road. It is recommended that the site be avoided during
future road maintenance. Alternatively, appropriate mitigation or archaeological monitoring
should be undertaken.
The second site—41HZ800—is a small prehistoric artifact scatter. It consists of sherds and
lithics and is associated with the Jornada Mogollon during the ceramic period. The site is
recommended eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under criterion D (information potential). It is
recommended that the site be avoided during future road maintenance activities. Given that the
site is not currently impacted by the road and is located only to the west of the road, avoidance
should be feasible. If not, then appropriate mitigation is recommended.
It is important to note that if previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered
during future road maintenance activities, the contractor should stop all ground disturbing
activities in the vicinity of the discovery until officials from Customs and Border Protection and
the Texas Historical Commission are notified and the nature and significance of the find can be
evaluated. If human remains are encountered during construction activity, construction should stop
and the Texas Historical Commission must be also be notified per the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), and the Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title
9, Chapter 191, and appropriate tribal organizations must be consulted.

INTRODUCTION
Northland Research, Inc. (Northland) has completed a cultural resources survey of the
Quitman Repeater Tower Road, located in Hudspeth County Texas (Figure 1). The project was
conducted at the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—Task Order
HSBP1015F00483, Work Order 07—to identify and assess the significance of cultural resources
along the 3.9 mile (6.3 km) road segments. A 40-m wide area centered on the road was examined.
The proposed undertaking includes maintenance of existing roads. Potential maintenance-related
activities include grading, re-establishing the road crown for proper drainage, and compaction of
caliche or other flexible road base as needed. The road is currently maintained by Texas
Department of Transportation (Texas DOT) in an agreement with the property owners (Mr. Tom
Neely, personal communication 9 February 2016). Vegetation control along the road is also
possible, to establish a 3-ft buffer and a 15-ft canopy height clearance using large bush hogs, or
side deck mowers. The proposed actions to be cleared do not, at this time, entail any excavation.
As per the work order, if areas require installation of low water crossings, clearance of flooded
areas, or other excavation other than minor blading, a separate clearance for that area and the
specific action will be performed.
Northland was contracted by CBP to complete the fieldwork to address the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) Directive (D) 023-01 and CBP requirements that ensure CBP
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and guidelines
established by the State of Texas. The survey included private and Texas State Land segments.
Work on Texas State Land was conducted under Texas Historical Commission Permit No. 7542.
To accomplish the project goals, Northland conducted a background check and a fullcoverage archaeological survey of the Quitman Repeater Tower Road. Fieldwork for the project
was conducted by Northland archaeologists John Marshall (Project Director) and Eric Cox
(Principal Investigator) on 9–10 February 2016. Northland recorded two new archaeological sites
and 12 isolated occurrences. Site 41HZ799 is the historical Bonanza Mine. It is recommended as
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion A (broad
patterns of history) and Criterion D (information potential). The site may also be eligible under
Criterion B (significant persons). Site 41HZ800 is a prehistoric artifact scatter associated with the
ceramic period Jornada Mogollon. It is considered NRHP eligible under Criterion D (information
potential). Both sites should be avoided, or appropriate mitigation or archaeological monitoring
should be undertaken. The following report provides background for the project, describes survey
methodology, and presents the results of the project.
PROJECT SETTING
The project area is located roughly eight miles (12.9 km) east of Sierra Blanca, Texas,
south of Interstate 10, in Hudspeth County, Texas. The area of investigation includes three road
segments that CBP labeled the Quitman Repeater Tower Road for this project. The road segments
include the Skunk Canyon Road south of Interstate 10 to roughly Skunk Canyon, Love Road south
of Skunk Canyon Road and south of Skunk Canyon, and an unnamed road segment that summits
the Quitman Mountains to the Quitman Repeater Tower location. The break between Skunk
Canyon and Love roads in unclear. The road segments total 3.9 miles (6.3 km) in length. A 40-m
area centered on the road was covered, resulting in a total of 61.6 acres surveyed.

The northern portions of the road—consisting of Skunk Canyon and Love roads—are welltraveled and well-maintained (Figure 2). This road is maintained by Texas DOT in an agreement
with the landowner (Mr. Tom Neely, personal communication 9 February 2016). Skunk Canyon
Road is roughly 7 m wide, but narrows at points in Skunk Canyon. Love Road has similar
dimensions. The road from Love Road up the slope of the Quitman Mountains, ending at the
Quitman Repeater Tower site, is in poorer condition than Skunk Canyon and Love roads. The road
is barely wider than a single lane. For most of its course, the road is less than 4 m wide. Previous
efforts to stabilize and maintain the road are apparent. Steeper portions of the road have been paved
with asphalt (Figure 3). This asphalt cap is deteriorating in several locations. Portions of the road
that are not as steep are simply bladed, with no added stabilizing materials.
The survey area lies within the Trans-Pecos region of Texas, an area west of the Pecos
River that is bounded by the Rio Grande River to the south and the New Mexico state line. The
Trans-Pecos is a region of strongly diverse habitats and vegetation, varying from desert valleys
and plateaus to wooded mountain slopes with elevations ranging from 2,500 feet to more than
8,500 feet. The northern Quitman Mountains are within the Sierra Madre Occidental structural
province. The mountains are a pluton (igneous intrusion) of Tertiary age (McAnulty et al. 1971).
The area is primarily composed of quartz monzonite, but also contains granite, granodiorite,
syenite, and diabase, as well as rhyolitic formations. Soils in the area are created by erosion of
these formations. Soils are generally alkaline and have poor drainage.

Vegetation in the project area is typical of the Semidesert Grassland biotic community
(Brown 1994). The dominant plant type in the project area is creosotebush. Other observed species
include saltbush, prickly pear, catclaw acacia, Spanish Dagger (yucca), mesquite, and ocotillo.
Sparse juniper and jojoba were also noted at higher elevations in the Quitman Mountains. Ground
surface visibility was generally excellent (90 percent, or better) across the survey area. Grasses
and annuals were relatively sparse.
CULTURAL HISTORY OVERVIEW
Archaeology of the Trans-Pecos region is very similar to the regions of central and south
Texas. In addition, given the similarities in regional topography and resources north and south of
the Rio Grande River, cultural adaptations in south Texas may share similarities to those in
northern Mexico (Hester 1980; Higgins et al. 2005). The prehistory of Texas is divided into three
major periods (Black 1989:48-57; Suhm et al. 1954): 1) Paleoindian (9200–6000 B.C.); 2) Archaic,
subdivided into Early Archaic (ca. 6000–2500 B.C.), Middle Archaic (ca. 2500–400 B.C.), Late
Archaic (ca. 400 B.C.–A.D. 800); and 3) Formative/Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800–1600). These
periods are distinguished by general social and cultural patterns based on environment, technology,
and subsistence strategies. Diagnostic projectile points define the periods (Higgins et al. 2005).
This section is an introductory overview of the prehistory of Texas and is not meant to be
comprehensive. Detailed information about specific aspects of Texas prehistory (see Pertulla
2004) and specifically the Trans-Pecos Region of West Texas (see Miller 2005, Miller and

4

Kenmotsu 2004) can be found in a variety of detailed archaeological and ethnographic reports and
are available on the Texas State Historical Association’s website (Miller 2010; Hester and Turner
2012).
Paleoindian Period (10,000 to 6000 B.C.)
Paleoindian culture is characterized by big game hunters but this may be a reflection of the
greater visibility of kill sites. During the Paleoindian Period, people were probably organized into
small bands of less than 20 individuals who traveled great distances throughout the year in order
to obtain different food sources (Black 1989:48). Diagnostic Paleoindian artifacts include Clovis
(Meltzer 1986), Folsom (Largent et al. 1991), Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points, and
flaked end scrapers and bifacially worked Clear Fork tools (Black 1989:48–49).
Although arguments have been made for a pre-Clovis occupation (ca. 35,000 to 10,000
B.C.) of Pendejo Cave near El Paso (see Chrisman et al 1996; MacNeish et al 1998: MacNeish
and Libbey 2004) this is still a heavily contested hypothesis. Though under represented in the
Trans-Pecos Region, the earliest known culture in Texas was the Clovis Complex, dating to around
9200 B.C. The distinctive Clovis fluted point is widespread and was used, at least in some cases,
for mammoth hunting (Hester and Turner 2012). Investigations at Baker Cave showed that fish,
snakes, and rodents were also exploited during the Paleoindian period (Hester 1983). The
successor to Clovis was the Folsom Complex, dating around 8800–8200 B.C. and characterized
by the distinct fluted Folsom points. Folsom points have been recorded at several bison kill sites
and campsites throughout Texas. Although fluting ceases to be an important trait of Paleoindian
points after Clovis and Folsom, later Paleoindian points maintain an overall lanceolate, parallelsided form, often with careful parallel flaking and with the basal edges dulled to facilitate hafting
(Hester and Turner 2012).
Most of the evidence for Paleoindian occupations in Trans-Pecos Texas has been
accomplished through cross-dating lanceolate points that have been found primarily in the
floodplain of the Rio Grande Valley (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Examples of Paleoindian shelter
sites in the Trans-Pecos such as Fresnal Shelter (Carmichael 1982; Jones 1990; Tagg 1996), Burnet
Cave (Roney 1995) and Pendejo Cave (Chrisman et al. 1996) have yielded chronometric dates that
suggest late Paleoindian occupations.
Archaic Period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200)
The Archaic period in Texas lasted for several millennia. In general, the Archaic is
characterized by mobile bands of hunter-gatherers with atlatl projectile point types, which are
distinct from the projectile points of the Paleolithic. In addition, ground stone tools and ornaments
are introduced during the Archaic. Although the Archaic sequence varies from region to region
within the state, generally it can be divided into Early, Middle, Late, and Transitional eras. Each
period reflects changes in cultural patterns, artifact forms, hunting patterns, types of site utilized,
and other elements. In some regions the Archaic is subdivided into “phases” or “intervals.”

5

Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic is poorly understood, although specific point and tool types are
associated with it. The beginning of the Early Archaic period coincides with the beginning of the
modern Holocene era and a shift from cooler temperatures. In Trans-Pecos Texas, evidence for the
Early Archaic is known from surface finds of projectile points, deposits in rock shelters and a few
radiocarbon dates (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Intensive surveys have yielded an abundance of
points, but very few features or settlements; there is no clear evidence for an increase in population
or restriction of territory similar to other regions of Texas during this period. In general, the Early
Archaic is represented by a few scattered settlements and small, mobile populations. Relationships
among several regions are indicated by the widespread occurrence of distinctive points.
Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)
The Middle Archaic in Texas is a time of significant population increase, an increase in the
number of sites, and an abundance of artifacts, especially a variety of projectile points. The Middle
Archaic appears to represent increased regional specialization, based on the regional point types,
and regionally-specific site types. Cemeteries with large numbers of interments appear late in the
period, and stone and shell trade connections are established, particularly with the Arkansas area
(Hester and Turner 2012).
In Trans-Pecos Texas, the dramatic increase in the number of sites associated with the
Middle Archaic indicates a sustained growth in population (Black 1989:51). The patterned
occurrences of particular projectile point types within certain areas of South Texas may indicate
that territoriality among Middle Archaic groups increased while mobility decreased. There may
have been a shift to a greater reliance on vegetal foods during the Middle Archaic (Hall et al. 1982;
Black 1989). In the Delaware Mountains south of Guadalupe Peak, a small number of deeply
buried burned-rock accumulations dating to the Middle Archaic have been recorded (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). These features are similar to burned-rock middens found in Central Texas, and
were probably used to process acorns and mesquite beans for food (Black 1989:49–51).
Middle Archaic projectile point collections are typified by extensive blade reworking. The
most common point types located in the Trans-Pecos tend to consist of contracting stems with flat,
rounded, or pointed bases and expanding stems with concave bases. However distribution of these
point types seems to be regional; the expanding stems are associated with the Oshara Tradition
and Cochise Sequences in the west while in the eastern Trans-Pecos the contracting stems are more
prevalent with the central Texas and Coahuila traditions (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). During this
period, ground stone tools, including tabular grinding stones and manos, appear for the first time
(Black 1989:49).
Late Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200/900)
The Late Archaic is characterized by the continuation of hunting and gathering in most of
Texas, with distinct projectile points and stone tools. In Trans-Pecos Texas, settlement patterns
and technological adaptations begin to mirror those of the Formative period (Miller and Kenmotsu

6

2004). It is during the late archaic that the first conclusive use of cultigens appears in Trans-Pecos
Texas (Upham et al. 1987; Tagg 1996).
In general, throughout Texas, the Late Archaic period saw an increase in seasonal resource
procurement and the use of different ecological niches (Higgins et al. 2005). Inland sites reflect a
subsistence base dependent on vegetal resources supplemented with hunting of small game (Black
1989:51).
The transition from the Archaic Period to the Formative Period is essentially a continuation
of the Late Archaic, but with distinctive point styles, such as Ensor, Darl, Frio, and Fairland. Central
and lower Pecos Texas have important agricultural village sites from this time period, but the
Transitional Archaic Period in the rest of the state is not well-documented (Hester and Turner 2012).
Formative Period/Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 200 to 1450)
The Formative period is well-represented in the Trans-Pecos. It is a time of rapid change
from the Archaic that ends with in the Puebloan occupations in A.D. 1300 to 1450. Changes in
architecture, settlement structure, subsistence and technology occurred along with a more
sedentary life and a greater reliance on agriculture and specialization (Miller 2010; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:236-237). It is at this time that the well documented Puebloan occupations of the
Jornada Mogollon and La Junta occurred, though in the eastern portion of the Trans-Pecos the
Formative Period is generally less defined (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Originally divided into
three phases (Lehmer 1948), the Formative period sequence has recently been revised and now
includes four subperiods: the Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000), the early Doña Ana phase
(A.D. 1000 to 1150), the late Doña Ana phase (A.D. 1150 to 1300), and the El Paso phase (A.D.
1300 to 1450) (Miller 2005).
Mesilla Phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000)
The Mesilla phase is typified by the El Paso brownware ceramic tradition with Alma plain
as a rare intrusive ware (Miller 2010; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Other intrusive ceramics
including Mimbres white wares and other Mogollon wares appeared in the region after A.D. 600,
and El Paso Bichrome made its first appearance late in this phase (Miller 2005). The pit house was
the most common form of domestic architecture during this period and was similar to the earlier
Archaic huts (Lehmer 1948; Hard 1983). After A.D. 600, domestic architecture becomes more
formal and sites become larger, and more abundant. In addition to the larger sites, more artifacts
are also found than at sites from the earlier Archaic period.
Mesilla phase sites for all environmental zones show an association between sites and playas
in the central basin (Miller 2010). Mauldin et al. (1998) suggest that Mesilla phase peoples may be
characterized as residential foragers. The central basin and alluvial fans are thought to have been
components in a residential foraging strategy in which groups lived throughout the region as huntergatherers (Miller 2010). After A.D. 600 changes in settlement and subsistence practices led to a less
intensive, logistical use of the central basin (Mauldin et al 1998). In general, during the Mesilla phase
settlement was likely seasonal, with huts utilized in the summer and pit houses used as winter
residences. The hunting of rabbits and small game coupled with the foraging of wild plant resources

7

provided the bulk of the subsistence of early Mesilla phase people. Agriculture was likely a more
opportunistic subsistence strategy, though evidence shows a greater reliance in cultigens toward the
end of the phase. This move toward a more sedentary lifestyle and a reliance on cultigens later in the
Mesilla phase was a strategy used to offset environmental variability (Miller 2010; Wills 1988).
Early and Late Doña Ana Phases (A.D. 1000 to 1150 [Early] and A.D. 1150 to 1300 [Late])
Originally defined by Lehmer (1948) and refined by Carmichael (1986), Doña Ana phase
sites are typified by the presence of El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome pottery associated
with adobe surface construction (Miller 2010). Early Doña Ana phase occupations have informal
pit houses and burned-rock activity areas, while the later Doña Ana phase sites tend to have deep,
square-shaped formal pit houses and discrete trash middens, suggesting a more sedentary lifestyle
than the earlier time periods. Corn, squash, and beans are the predominate cultigens in a diet
supplemented with small game animals (Miller 2010). Research shows that this period is
characterized by increasing population levels and a shift of settlement areas to runoff zones located
on lower alluvial fans of the Franklin, Hueco, and Organ mountains (Whalen 1977, 1978, 1981).
This shift from a general use of all areas within the region to concentrated use of specific
environmental zones is an example of a shift to a more sedentary way of life reliant upon
agriculture. In general, the changes that occurred during the Doña Ana phase include the
introduction of polychrome pottery, rapid population increase, artifact changes that included larger
manos and metates, decreased projectile point sizes with larger forms still in use, and changes in
intrusive ceramic types from Mimbres to Chupadero and Chihuahuan wares (Miller 2010; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004). The formal pit structures of the late Doña Ana phase gave rise to Puebloan
architecture that would later characterize the El Paso phase.
El Paso Phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450)
The prehistoric occupation of Trans-Pecos Texas was most intensive during the El Paso
phase (Miller 2010). The El Paso phase (or the Puebloan phase) is most notable for an increase in
the number of large and small residential sites, increased artifact densities, and a clustered
settlement pattern (Carmichael 1986; Whalen 1977, 1978), as well as the introduction of small
triangular projectile point forms. During the El Paso phase there was great variability in settlement
size which ranged from large pueblos with 100-plus rooms (Bentley 1993; Brook 1970; Lowry
2005) to the more common smaller individual surface room structures (Batcho et al. 1985;
Browning et al. 1992; Dering et al. 2001). Miller (2010) characterizes the El Paso phase as peak
population levels, diverse artifact assemblages, use of pit structures, individual surface rooms,
above-ground pueblos, and dependence on agriculture, but not to the exclusion of hunting and
foraging. Researchers characterize population movement during the El Paso phase as a
combination of permanent habitations at sites during wet years coupled with seasonal movement
during periods of dryness. A seasonal sedentary lifestyle alternating between the desert floor,
alluvial fan, and riverine habitation would have been the norm for the El Paso phase (Miller 2010).
The Precontact Period (A.D. 1450 to 1581)
In the Trans-Pecos, the Precontact period is a brief period that occurs after abandonment
of the region by Puebloan groups and the first encounter between Native Americans and Spanish

8

explorers (Miller 2010). Beckett and Corbett (1992) list the Chinarra, Concho, Jano, Jocome,
Manso, Suma, Piro, and Tarahumara as distinct native groups that inhabited the Trans-Pecos
region during this period. Unfortunately, the Precontact period is poorly represented in the
archaeological record and artifactual evidence for these groups has either not been found or at least
has not been recognized (Miller 2010).
The Protohistoric Period (A.D. 1581 to 1659)
Although there is some overlap, in general, the Protohistoric period is the span between the
first European/Native American contact and the Historic period. During this period, drastic
changes to the aboriginal way of life occurred due to the contact between Native Americans and
Europeans. The introduction of metals revolutionized subsistence activities, and settlement
patterns were altered in favor of smaller more mobile “camps.” The Mescalero Apache represent
the only documented aboriginal Protohistoric inhabitants of the region (Miller 2010).
Historic Period (Post A.D. 1520)
In Texas, the Historic period is divided into three main time periods: Spanish Exploration
and Colonial (ca. 1520–1821); Mexican (1821–1836); and Texas-American (1836–present). The
Historic period began with the arrival of Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca around A.D. 1534 (Hester
1999). Although de Vaca and other European explorers passed through Texas over the next 80 years,
there was little apparent change in Native American culture until the eighteenth century when
Spanish settlements and missions were created (Newcomb 1993). Spanish Colonial settlements were
established in northeastern Mexico by around A.D. 1590 and slowly spread northward during the
following two centuries as the Spanish attempted to conquer the native inhabitants and colonize the
region (Campbell and Campbell 1985). In the 1720s, the native populations were mobile hunters and
gatherers still using traditional native stone tools (Hard et al. 1995:2; Hester 1977; Turner and Hester
1993:210). However, metal arrow points and glass trade goods associated with Native Americans
from this time period indicate contact with outside groups. In addition, cattle, sheep, and other
domesticated animals were brought into the region by the Spanish, and likely existed at most mission
sites by A.D. 1718 (Higgins et al. 2005). In an arroyo just outside the west wall of the Mission San
Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) and dating from A.D. 1748 to about A.D. 1800, remains of both
domestic cattle and bison were present (Meissner 1999).
The Historic Period witnessed drastic changes in Native American culture in Texas. The
Spanish and French, and later other outside Native American raiders, wreaked havoc on the
existing Native culture. Historical Native American sites are discerned archaeologically by the
presence of ceramics and projectile points, and historical rock art sites incorporate historical motifs
(e.g., Christian symbols, horses, and Spaniards). By the late eighteenth century most Native
American cultural material had been extensively replaced, or in some cases, completely eradicated,
by Euroamerican culture (Hester and Turner 2012).
Hudspeth County History
Spanish exploration of the Hudspeth County area began in the 1580s, with the RodriguezSanchez and Antonio de Espejo expeditions. Spanish presence in the region, however, was

9

concentrated more to the west. El Paso del Norte (the present day Ciudad Juárez), was founded on
the south bank of the Río Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande) in 1659 by Spanish conquistadors. In 1680
the small village of El Paso became the base for Spanish governance of the territory of New
Mexico, remaining the largest settlement in New Mexico until its cession to the United States in
1848 (Texas State Historical Association 2013).
As American exploration and settlement of the western United States intensified,
particularly after the 1849 Gold Rush, the area became a travel corridor. The Butterfield Trail and
San-Antonio-El Paso mail routes both crossed the area in the 1850s. Some mining activity occurred
as disillusioned Forty Niners returned from California. In 1858, Fort Quitman was established to
provide security for travellers. Later, in 1881, the Southern Pacific and Texas and Pacific railroads
crossed the area, a few miles south of Sierra Blanca Mountain, completing the second
transontinental railroad in the United States. The towns of Sierra Blanca and Allamoore were
important towns associated with the railroad. Overall, however, the region remained sparsely
populated.
Originally, Hudpseth County was part of El Paso County, which was established in March
1850, with San Elizario as the first county seat. This was changed to El Paso in 1883. In February
1917, Hudspeth County was split from El Paso County and Sierra Blanca was named the county
seat. While growth accelerated in the City of El Paso, Hudspeth County did not experience much
growth. Agricultural activity increased in the area in the early 1900s, but overall the county
remained thinly populated. This same general trend continued throughout the 20th century and
into the 21st century. As of 2014, the poplation is estimated to be just over 3,200.
History of the Bonanza Mine
The Bonanza Mine, in the northern Quitman Mountains, represents an important part of
the history of Hudspeth County. The mine is located within the current project area and was
recorded during the survey (see below). Preliminary archival investigation and information from
the current landowner (Mr. Tom Neely, personal communication 9 February 2016) provides an
outline of the history of the Bonanza Mine. Additional archival work is warranted, but at this point
is beyond the scope of the current project. A summary of the history of the Bonanza Mine is
presented below.
The Bonanza mine is located in the northern portion of the Quitman Mountains, roughly
seven miles west of Sierra Blanca, Texas (Figure 4). Geologically, the mine is located on a
northeast-striking vein that cuts the Quitman pluton (Albritton and Smith 1965:117–118). On the
surface, this vein is six inches to two feet wide. It contains galena and sphalerite intergrown with
quartz and carbonate minerals. The Bonanza mine is the largest of three mines—Alice Ray and
Queen Anne on the west side of the mountains being the other two—that have exploited this vein.
As reported in 1980, the Bonanza mine had four levels: 32 m, 50 m, 69 m, and 85 m (Murry
1980). These are connected to a main shaft and an exploration shaft (Figure 5). The main shaft is
badly caved and others are filled with debris. Flooding of the lower portion of the mine has also
been reported (Albritton and Smith 1965).

Figure 5. Cross-section of the Bonanza Mine (from McAnulty et al. 1971:Figure 3).

The initial operation of the Bonanza Mine began in the 1880s. The Love brothers started
the mine. A large amount of silver was initially mined. Estimates of 50,000 to 75,000 ounces of
silver were removed from the Bonanza Mine in the 1880s (von Streeruwitz 1889). Large tonnages
of silver-lead and zinc sulphide ores were reported as late as the 1910s (Davis 1918). Operation of
the mine appears to have ceased in 1915 or 1916 when the mill burned down (Davis 1918; El Paso
Evening Post 1928). Based on informant information (Mr. Tom Neely, personal communication 9
February 2016), the initial silver vein played out and the Loves went bankrupt after spending the
proceeds.
Renewed interest in the mine was noted in 1928 (El Paso Evening Post 1928). As of 1934,
recorded ore produced from the mine included 1,488,479 pounds of zinc (Sellards and Baker
1934). By 1946, operation of the mine was again reported (Gustavson 1948). The mill was
described as a 300-ton gravity-concentration mill, treating about 4,350 tons of ore during 78 days
of operation by the Clark Mining Co. The mill included a crushing plant with a jaw crusher, two
trommels, and two sets of rolls, and a concentrating plant consisting of eight Clark-type jigs (three
42- by 42-inch and five 24- by 24-inch). Power for both the mill and the mine was provided by
gasoline engines. Small quantities of zinc concentrates from operations in the mid-1940s were
reported as the first from Texas since 1917 (Gustavson 1948). Recovered ores from the mid-1940s
included 15 tons of lead concentrates (containing one ounce of gold, 791 ounces of silver, and
19,283 pounds of lead) and 112 tons of zinc concentrates (containing 4,524 pounds of lead and
100,156 pounds of zinc). Zinc mining was again noted in 1955 (Withers 1955). By 1965, the mine
was reported to be mostly flooded and not accessible (Albritton and Smith 1965).
Major operation of the Bonanza Mine resumed in 1977, when the price of silver increased.
Precious Metal Processors of Dallas, Texas started an operation that sank a decline to the first level
of the mine and drove a drift 213 m westward into the mountain (Murry 1980). According to Murry
(1980), no ore was encountered. Based on the current archaeological survey, substantial structures
were constructed during 1977 to process ore.
Most recently, the mine was acquired by IDH Gold of New York in 2012 (Arrowhead
Business and Investment Decisions 2013). IDH conducted surface and underground sampling in
2013 (idhus.com, accessed February 16, 2016). The mine is currently inactive.
RESEARCH DESIGN
Historic contexts are the research and management framework around which the historic
preservation process is structured. The intent is to provide a basis for identifying and evaluating
the significance of property types with respect to their place in prehistoric and historic contexts.
From a broad perspective, the cultural resources in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas represent
a long history of human occupation of the region. Property types identified during the current
archaeological survey—a prehistoric artifact scatter and a historical mine—however, reflect a
more limited range of human activity. In the following section, we present a set of general research
themes that framed our investigation of the project area and the evaluation of the recorded sites.
These themes are necessarily limited in scope because of the nature of the investigation (e.g.,
limited information from surface inspection, limited range of artifact and sample recovery) and the
types of sites encountered.

13

Prehistoric Sites
Research related to prehistoric sites is concerned with the dynamics of human population
size, distribution, and composition. Specific research questions pertaining to prehistoric sites include
the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

What was the scale of prehistoric occupation in the project area?
Are prehistoric habitation sites present?
Is there potential for human remains?
How old are prehistoric sites in the survey area?
How did the occupational intensity of sites in the project area vary over time? Is there
evidence for large-scale population movement at any point in time?
Are prehistoric sites occupied seasonally or year-round?
Is there evidence for differentiation in land use between sites in different environmental settings?
What kinds of resources were exploited in the project area? Are differences apparent in the
resources exploited by groups in different parts of the project area? Or, were subsistence
practices fairly uniform within the project area?
Is there evidence of agriculture?

Data requirements for addressing these questions are varied. Defining the nature and extent
of occupation is an important step in resolving scalar issues. Secondarily, establishing temporal
control through artifactual data is necessary. Decorated ceramics and/or diagnostic projectile
points are the most likely means of dating sites based on survey data.
The nature of sites can be assessed through presence/absence of architectural features, other
surface features (e.g., trash middens, rock piles), the nature of artifact assemblages, and the
quantity and density of artifacts. It is important to recognize the limitations of surface
investigations, however. For example, evidence of sub-surface features are typically not apparent
from surface inspection alone. It is also difficult, at the survey level of investigation, to determine
if sites were occupied seasonally. Some possible evidence of seasonality can be examined through
presence or absence of architectural and artifactual data.
Assessment of subsistence-related research topics includes understanding basic
environmental data, such as soil types, geomorphic conditions, botanical remains, faunal bone, and
the availability of nearby natural resources. The study of possible agricultural fields and related
features (e.g., check dams), resource processing features (e.g., roasting pits, hornos), and
specialized tools (e.g., metates, manos) can inform on subsistence-related tasks.
Historical Sites
Investigation of historical sites involves questions similar to those that pertain to prehistoric
sites. Questions are aimed at understanding the nature and extent of historical use of the area and
the age of historical sites. Specific questions include:
•
•

What was the scale of historical use of the project area?
How old are historical sites?
14

•
•
•

What activities are represented?
Are historical structures or other built features present?
With which historical cultures are the sites affiliated?

Data requirements for addressing these questions are similar to those outlined above for
prehistoric sites. First, analysis of historical sites begins with defining the types of features, if any,
present at the sites. Second, analysis of artifacts provides temporal control for the sites. In addition,
artifacts and the presence/absence of built features are used to assess the nature of historical sites.
Examination of the types of historical sites and their spatial distribution across the project area
provide the means to establish the scale of historical use of the area.
RECORDS CHECK
Northland staff conducted a records search and literature review of the project area and a
one-half mile radius around it. Records from the Texas Historical Commission database were
checked. Additional resources that were consulted include the National Register of Historic Places
and the Texas State Historical Association. The purpose of the records check was to determine
whether any part of the project area had been surveyed and whether cultural resources sites have
been recorded within or near the current area of investigation.
The records check indicated that the project area had not been previously surveyed. In
addition, there are no records of archaeological surveys conducted within one-half mile of the
project area. Two cultural resources properties are located in proximity to the current area of
investigation (Figure 6). The first property is a historical marker located in a roadside park north
of westbound Interstate 10. The marker, erected in 1969, commemorates Claude Hudspeth (1877–
1941), the namesake of the county. Among other accomplishments, Hudspeth was a state Senator
and member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The second previously recorded property near the survey area is the archaeological site
41HZ100. This site is listed as, “Site is a petroglyph of occupation site, shaman, fish, animals.
Two mortar holes-extensive on granite boulders.” (THC Site card for 41HZ100). Additionally,
the site card mentions the presence of, “…burned rock, bifaces, unifaces, ash, basalt, flakes, El
Paso Brown sherds, opaline, shell beads, flint flakes, mano, polychrome sherds.” As shown on
THC maps, the site is possibly located within the current right-of-way. During the survey, a
thorough attempt was made to relocate this site, including the investigation of numerous boulder
outcrops in the area. Nothing remotely resembling the site description was found. Northland did
record several prehistoric isolated occurrences in the general area (see below), but did not
relocate the site. This suggests that the THC map plot of the site, recorded in 1978, is possibly
inaccurate.

FIELD METHODS
Northland archaeologists conducted a full coverage (100 percent) pedestrian survey of
the Quitman Repeater Tower Road. During the survey, guidelines issued by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), as well as federal guidelines for conducting archaeological surveys, were
followed. A transect was walked on either side of the road, paralleling the road alignment.
Spacing from the road shoulder varied based on obstructions such as vegetation, but transects
were typically spaced 5–10 m from the road shoulder. The ground along and between transects
was inspected for cultural remains and/or modifications. A Trimble GeoXT hand-held global
positioning system (GPS) unit with sub-meter accuracy was used for navigation and to record
the location of findings.
When cultural resources were encountered in the field, general procedure is to examine the
area to determine the nature and extent of the finding. Artifacts are pin-flagged to establish extent,
quantity, and density. Based on the size and density of the finding, it is determined if the cultural
resources consist of an isolated occurrence (IO) or an archaeological site. IOs typically include
occurrences with few artifacts, or very low artifact density. Regardless, the location of each IO
was recorded with the GPS. For each IO, artifact class and type were recorded. Photographs were
taken when appropriate (e.g., diagnostic tools).
Site 41HZ800, the prehistoric artifact scatter, was recorded by establishing the extent of
the site, recording artifacts, photographing the site, and mapping the extent with the GPS. A site
datum was placed within the site using a 10-inch nail with an attached aluminum tag. The tag was
marked with the Northland field site number (FS NRI-1). The location of the site tag/datum was
recorded with a GPS. Artifact analysis was done in-field. This consisted of classifying lithics by
raw material type, technological class (core, tool, debitage), and type (e.g., secondary debitage
flake). In-field analysis of ceramics was done by “snapping” a sample of sherds and examining the
paste and temper visible in the fresh break using a hand lens.
Recordation of the Bonanza Mine, site 41HZ799, was, by necessity, performed in a more
expedient manner. The entire site was examined for surface features. The location of features was
recorded using the GPS and photographs were taken of every feature (see Appendix A). A sample
of artifacts was recorded from across the site, as well as within features. Given the sheer number
of artifacts present, it was not feasible to record every artifact at the site. A sample was considered
adequate for characterizing the age of the site and types of activities represented in the trash at the
site.
Historical artifacts were generally identified in the field using field guides. Additional
references were consulted after completion of fieldwork. General references used for historical
artifact identification include Simonis (1997) for milk cans, Toulouse (1971) for glass bottle
manufacturers, and Lehner (1988) for historical ceramics. Other references were consulted as
needed. For terminological purposes, matchstick filler-hole cans (milk cans) are uniformly called
MFH cans in the site descriptions. White hard-paste earthenware ceramics are referred to as
WHPE.

17

As noted above, ground surface visibility in the project area and surrounding area is
generally excellent. It was estimated to be 90 percent or better. Because of the excellent ground
surface visibility, shovel-testing was deemed unnecessary for the current project. Both sites
encountered during the project could be delineated without ground disturbance. No shovel testing
was conducted during the survey. In addition, two other factors were considered. First, the nature
of the historic Bonanza Mine—41HZ799—made subsurface testing unnecessary. Second, shallow
soil and exposed bedrock were noted at the prehistoric artifact scatter (41HZ800). Combined with
the excellent ground surface visibility, this made shovel tests unnecessary.
RESULTS
During survey of the Quitman Repeater Tower Road, Northland recorded two
archaeological sites and 12 isolated occurrences (Figure 7). 41HZ799 is the historical Bonanza
Mine. 41HZ800 is a prehistoric artifact scatter associated with the Jornada Mogollon. Descriptions
of the sites are presented below. Additional descriptions of features at the Bonanza Mine are
presented in Appendix A. Recommendations for management of the sites are also presented within
the site descriptions.

Description: Site 41HZ799 is the historical Bonanza Mine (Figures 8 and 9). An overview of the
history of the mine is presented above in the culture history section of this report. This site is
located on the southwest side of Skunk Canyon. It is located mostly to the south of the Quitman
Repeater Road, but the road does pass through the northeastern portion of the site. The mine is
located on the eastern slope of the northern portion of the Quitman Mountains. The site includes
approximately 38 acres, as well as a network of subsurface shafts and tunnels. During the survey,
Northland recorded 41 surface features, including mine shafts, structure foundations, trash dumps,
and more. A summary of feature types is shown in (Table 1). A list of all features is presented in
Table 2. Detailed descriptions of features are presented in Appendix A. Notable features at the
mine include a headframe (Feature 20), mill foundations (Features 26 and 37), possible habitations
(Features 2, 17 and 41), as well as numerous test pits, trash dumps, and other man-made miningrelated features.
Based on preliminary archival investigation, informant information, and artifactual data,
the site is firmly dated between the 1880s and the late 1970s. There is also evidence of work at the
mine as recently as 2013.
There are varying levels of disturbances to the site. Erosion has affected several features,
as well as causing the dispersion of artifacts. Structures have been dismantled and removed from
the mine. There is evidence of modern use of the mine including surface excavations. The recent
work at the mine has also created some disturbance. Evidence of bottle collecting was also noted
at the site. Overall, however, the site retains good integrity.

Artifacts. A large number of artifacts are present at the Bonanza Mine. The shear number of artifacts
and the scope of the current project precluded intensive recording. There are varying densities of
artifacts across the site from the main mine shafts on the west, to the eastern edge of the site. Many
of the artifacts have likely been washed downhill over time, but it is also likely that artifacts were
dumped in the drainages resulting in secondary deposition over time. Because of the large number
of artifacts and pragmatic concerns, a sample of diagnostic artifacts was recorded. Additionally,
more complete recording of artifacts in trash dumps and artifacts directly associated with other
features was conducted.
At this time, given our incomplete sample, it is impossible to estimate the number of
artifacts present at the site. Conservatively, the number is easily in the tens of thousands. As noted
above, density is variable.
Date ranges of artifacts are consistent with the known operation of the mine. Dates from
manufacturers’ marks range from the late 1800s to the 1970s, or later. A small sample of diagnostic
artifacts from the general site area in the eastern part of the site is shown in Table 3.

Discussion. 41HZ799 is the historical Bonanza Mine. Based on preliminary archival and informant
information, the mine was used sporadically between the 1880s and the 1970s. Silver, lead, and zinc
were the primary products. The mine includes significant built features including processing plants
and structures that represent more than one stage of operation of the mine. No standing architecture
is present, but several foundations remain. These foundations are primarily from mills or stamp
plants, but other structural foundations are also present. There are a number of shafts, adits, and
prospect pits located across the site. Large tailings piles are present. These have been worked in
recent years (Mr. Tom Neely, personal communication 9 February 2016). In addition, there are trash
dumps and scattered artifacts associated with the multiple episodes of mine usage.
24

NRHP Eligibility and Management Recommendation. 41HZ799, the Bonanza Mine, is
recommended NRHP eligible under Criterion A (broad patterns of history) and Criterion D
(information potential). The site may also be eligible under Criterion B (significant persons)
because of its association with the Love family and their importance to the history of the region.
The site is representative of historical mining in West Texas. It was sporadically operated between
the 1880s and 1970s. Although aspects of the integrity of the site are compromised by more recent
operations, the site retains sufficient integrity to make it a significant property. It is recommended
that the site be avoided by road maintenance activities. The majority of the site is located outside
the right-of-way. Only one feature, a prospectors pit (Feature 8), has been directly impacted by the
road. This feature is considered a non-contributing element given its nature and the negligible
research potential it contains. If avoidance is not feasible, it is recommended that appropriate
mitigation be undertaken. Alternatively, archaeological monitoring within the site area is another
possibility, given the low probability of the proposed road work disturbing intact features within
the site.

Description. 41HZ800 is a small prehistoric artifact scatter. It is located on private land on the west
side of Skunk Canyon Road, roughly 1.4 km (0.85 mile) south of Interstate 10. The site covers roughly
323 square meters (Figure 10). It is located on the lower, west-facing, slopes of the northern part of
the Quitman Mountains, immediately to the east. There are patches of bedrock exposed on the edges
of the small ridge, as well as in the road just east of the site. Soil consists of silty decomposed granite
with pea gravels. The potential for subsurface depth is limited. Based on the exposure of bedrock, it
is estimated that 10–20 cm of soil is present. Ground surface visibility was excellent at the site. A
variety of plant types are present, dominated by creosote, but few grasses and annuals are also present.
It was estimated that ground surface visibility was 90 percent, or better, across the site. No surface
features are present.

Disturbances to the site include natural erosion and likely impacts from past cattle grazing.
The site does not appear to have been impacted by the Skunk Canyon Road; it does not extend to
the east of the road. No historic/modern trash was noted, but was observed nearby along the road.
Artifacts. All artifacts at 41HZ800 were recorded. Table 4 lists the artifacts tallied within the site
area. Artifacts comprise a low density scatter across the site. No concentrations, or areas of notably
higher density, were observed.
In total, 49 artifacts were recorded at the site. Four lithic raw material types were noted,
but limestone and basalt predominate, comprising over 90 percent of the lithics. Artifact density
was relatively low. It was calculated to be roughly 0.15 artifacts per square meter. Temporally
diagnostic artifacts were not found. El Paso Brown provides a broad general time range (A.D. 200–
1450), but further refinement is not possible based on the observed artifacts.

Discussion. 41HZ800 is a small prehistoric artifact scatter probably associated with the Jornada
Mogollon culture. It represents a limited activity site, likely focused on resource
procurement/processing. Given the small assemblage, the site was not extensively used and may
represent a single episode use of the area. Based on the limited soil depth, there is negligible
potential for a significant habitation component (e.g., pit house). A short-term occupation (e.g., a
camp site) is a possibility, but no surface features that would support this idea were noted.
The artifact assemblage includes four lithic raw material types and technological variety
(cores, debitage flakes, and tools). On-site lithic reduction and production of informal tools is
possible. The importation of raw materials is also a possibility, although most of the raw material
was probably locally procured. The El Paso Brown ware sherds may represent a single pot break,
but were scattered widely enough that this may not be the case. Only a single rim sherd, a jar rim,
was observed.

27

The age of the site is unclear, given the absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts. The
presence of El Paso Brown indicates a ceramic period date, but the wide range of potential dates
for the type (A.D. 200–1450) does not provide any means to narrow the age of the site. Use of the
site may be related to a previously recorded site (41HZ100) previously plotted less than 300 m to
the north. As noted above, however, 41HZ100 was not relocated during the current survey.
NRHP Eligibility and Management Recommendation. 41HZ800 is recommended as eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D (information potential). The site is located in a region
that is not well known archaeologically. It is near the southeast margin of the Jornada Mogollon
cultural group. The site contains information potential that can help expand our knowledge and
understanding of the prehistory of the region. It is recommended that the site be avoided during
road maintenance activities. The road does not currently impact the site, but the site is within the
right-of-way of the existing road (Figure 11). If avoidance of the site is not feasible, then
appropriate mitigation is recommended.

Isolated Occurrences
Northland recorded 12 isolated occurrences (IO) during the current survey. Table 5 lists
descriptions of the IOs (see Figure 7). These range from single artifacts to small scatters that
do not meet the current site criteria standards and are unlikely to contain subsurface
components. The IOs are not considered significant and no additional archaeological
investigation of them is recommended.

ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH ISSUES
A set of research questions pertaining to prehistoric and historical use of the project area
was outlined in a previous section. These questions are largely descriptive in nature, and pertain
to the nature and extent of use of the project area, as well as the age of sites. As noted above,
survey data are inherently limited in nature. The research questions and our ability to answer them
are restricted by the imperfect nature of data observed and recorded during survey.
Northland identified and recorded two sites during the current investigation. This includes
a prehistoric artifact scatter and a historical mine. In the following section, to the extent possible,
we address the research questions based on the results of the survey.
41HZ799 – Bonanza Mine
One historical site, the Bonanza Mine (41HZ799) was encountered and documented during
the current investigation. The site includes a range of features associated with the operation of the
mine between the 1880s and modern times. Archival information indicates the mine operated
intermittently extracting silver, lead, and other materials. Features at the mine also include likely
habitations, extensive trash dumps, and other features that reflect the lives lead by the miners. A
sample of artifacts recorded at the site reflect the occupation dates of the operation of the mine, as
well as the range of activities at the mine. 41HZ799 is recommended eligible for inclusion in the
29

NRHP for the role it played in regional history (Criterion A) and the information potential
(Criterion D) it retains. The site may also be eligible under Criterion B because of its association
with the Love family and their importance to the history of the region.
The Bonanza Mine is one example of mining in Hudspeth County and the Quitman
Mountains. It represents an important aspect of the economic history and development of the
region and the lives of early Anglo settlers. Additional archival investigation can further provide
further details about the history of the mine and its relationship to the region.
41HZ800 - Prehistoric Artifact Scatter
The prehistoric artifact scatter (41HZ800) recorded during the survey represents a limited
activity site. There does not appear to be much soil depth at the site location and buried features
appear unlikely to be present. A habitation component, or the presence of human remains, is also
unlikely. The artifact assemblage includes lithics and ceramics, but is relatively limited in diversity
and is small in size (49 artifacts). The site likely represents a short-term use area related to resource
procurement/processing. 41HZ800 may be related to 41HZ100, which is plotted roughly 300 m to
the north. Although no evidence of 41HZ100 was found during the current survey, the site is
reported to have an extensive occupation. 41HZ800 may be a satellite of that site. Despite its small
size and limited artifact assemblage, 41HZ800 is recommended as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP eligible under Criterion D (information potential) because relatively little is known about
prehistoric use of this region.
Based on the results of the current survey, the prehistoric use of the project area and the
immediate area appears to be relatively limited. This is a very tentative conclusion, however, given
the restrictions inherent in a linear survey. In particular, the extent of the project area may affect
the presence/absence and/or nature of sites encountered. In that regard, it is unclear if the results
of the survey accurately reflect the intensity of prehistoric use of the area, or are more a reflection
of the specific setting of the survey area.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Northland has completed a Phase I cultural resources survey of the Quitman Repeater
Tower Road located in Hudspeth County, Texas. A pedestrian survey of the project area was
completed on 9–10 February 2016. The project was conducted at the request of U.S. Customs and
Border Protection—Task Order HSBP1015F00483, Work Order 07—to identify and assess the
significance of cultural resources along the 3.9 mile (6.3 km) road segment that comprises the
survey area prior to proposed maintenance of existing roads.
As a result of the survey, two new archaeological sites were recorded. The first site—
41HZ799—is the historical Bonanza Mine. Operation of the mine between the 1880s and 2013 is
documented. During the survey, Northland recorded 41 features associated with the mine,
including shafts, adits, structural foundations, trash dumps, and more. The site is recommended as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A (broad patterns of history) and Criterion D
(information potential). The site is also potentially eligible under Criterion B (significant persons).
The existing road, surveyed for this project, passes through the northern portion of the site. One
feature, evaluated as a non-contributing element, is impacted by the road. It is recommended that
30

the site be avoided during future road maintenance. Alternatively, appropriate mitigation or
archaeological monitoring should be undertaken. The second site—41HZ800—is a small
prehistoric artifact scatter. It consists of sherds and lithics and is associated with the Jornada
Mogollon during the ceramic period. The site is recommended as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under criterion D (information potential). It is recommended that the site be avoided during
future road maintenance activities. Given that the site is not currently impacted by the road and is
located only to the west of the road, avoidance should be feasible. If not, then appropriate
mitigation or archaeological monitoring is recommended.
It is important to note that if previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered
during future road maintenance activities, the contractor should stop all ground disturbing
activities in the vicinity of the discovery until officials from Customs and Border Protection and
the Texas Historical Commission are notified and the nature and significance of the find can be
evaluated. If human remains are encountered during construction activity, construction should stop
and the Texas Historical Commission must be also be notified per the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), and the Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title
9, Chapter 191, and appropriate tribal organizations must be consulted.

Appendix A
Feature Descriptions
The Bonanza Mine (41HZ799)

32

Northland recorded 41 archaeological features associated with the Bonanza Mine
(41HZ799). Table A.1 lists the features at the site. In this appendix, descriptions of all the features
is presented. A selection of feature photographs are also provided. Although all features were
photographed, in some cases a photograph adds little to the feature description. For example, a
shallow prospect pit overgrown with vegetation is unremarkable and virtually indistinguishable
from a random shot of vegetation in the area. For this reason, some photographs are omitted.

Feature 1 is a prospect pit located in the eastern portion of the site. It is roughly 5 m in diameter,
and roughly 1 m deep. Spoil is piled around the central depression. A small amount of
miscellaneous historical trash was noted, but no diagnostic artifacts were observed in direct
association with the feature.
Feature 2 is a structure foundation located in the northeast portion of the site (Figure A.1). It
consists of a large in situ concrete slab that has been broken. Three medium-sized fragments and
15–20 small chunks are scattered around the in situ portion. The intact foundation is approximately
3.9 by 2.7 m. The slab is laid on top of a boulder foundation. A 6- by 8-inch post is set under the
northwest corner. A low density scatter of miscellaneous artifacts is also present, but no diagnostic
artifacts were noted. The nearby trash dump (Feature 3) may be associated with this feature. Dates
from the dump, if related, may indicate Feature 2 was used in the late 1920s or 1930s. Feature 2
likely represents the remains of a structure. However, no superstructure is present.

34

Feature 3 is a small trash dump located roughly 8 m northeast of Feature 2. It is roughly 5 m in
diameter. Artifacts recorded in the dump include glass, metal, and historical ceramics (see Table
A.1). At least 229 artifacts are present. Date ranges on diagnostic artifacts suggest the dump
probably dates to the late 1920s or 1930s. SCA glass is present, but basemarks on other artifacts
are consistent with a later date than is associated with SCA. Artifacts in Feature 3 appear to
represent domestic trash.

Feature 4 is a small prospect pit excavated on a small ridge in the eastern portion of the site. The
pit and associated spoil pile is roughly 3 m in diameter. It is approximately 50 cm deep. The spoil
is primarily piled to the northeast side of the pit. A short strand of barbed wire is partially buried
in the central portion of the pit. Otherwise, no associated artifacts were noted. The age of the
feature is indeterminate.
Feature 5 is a small prospect pit in the eastern portion of the site. It is excavated in alluvium along
the braided wash draining the mine area. The pit and spoils are roughly 4 m in diameter. The pit is
about 1 m deep. Rocks line part of the pit, which may be spoil from the base of the excavation. No
associated artifacts were noted.

35

Feature 6 is a small shaft or prospect pit (Figure A.2). Spoils surround the roughly 1- by 1-m shaft
excavated into rhyolite bedrock. The shaft is approximately 1.5 m deep. No associated artifacts are
present. The age of the feature is indeterminate.

Figure A.2. Photograph of Feature 6, a shaft or prospect pit.

Feature 7 is a small prospect pit excavated into a small hill south of the braided wash. Spoils
surround the central pit in a roughly 4-m diameter area. The pit is about 50 cm deep. No associated
artifacts were present. The age of the pit is indeterminate.
Feature 8 is a small prospect pit located on a ridge in the northeast-central portion of the site. The
pit is roughly 50 cm deep and spoils surround it in a 3-m diameter area. The spoil pile on the south
side of the pit has been impacted by Quitman Road (Figure A.3). Disturbance is minor, however.
No associated artifacts were noted. The age of the feature is unknown.
Feature 9 is a small rock pile (Figure A.4). It consists of 10- to 20-cm diameter rocks clustered in
a 3- by 1.5-m area. No pit is associated with the rock pile, but the rocks may represent spoil. No
artifacts are associated. The age of Feature 9 is indeterminate.

Feature 10 is an artifact concentration located in the south-central portion of the site. Artifacts
within the feature were inventoried and are listed in Table A.2. Only one diagnostic glass base
mark was noted—an SCA bottle, probably Chas. Boldt Glass Co. (ca.1910–1919). However, a
relatively large quantity of SCA suggests the feature roughly dates to the 1910s, or earlier. Holein-cap cans, a “KC Baking Powder” can, and a .44 caliber Winchester cartridge also support an
early 1900s date range. An MFH can that postdates 1930 may be from a later use of the area.
Artifacts in Feature 10 are mostly domestic trash, but some other miscellaneous uses (industrial,
hardware) are also represented.

Feature 11 is a likely fire pit located immediately northwest of Feature 10. The feature consists of
a 1.5-m diameter area of ashy soil with charcoal and an associated low-density artifact scatter. The
western edge of the feature may be disturbed by an ephemeral wash. Artifacts associated with the
feature include glass, metal, and historical ceramics. Glass fragments include eight SCA, one aqua,
and three clear. No diagnostic marks were noted. Metal artifacts include two crushed sanitary cans,
20 miscellaneous fragments, five nails, and a shell cartridge (probably .45 caliber). Historical
ceramics include three WHPE and one porcelain fragment. Feature 11 appears to represent the
location of a campfire. The trash near the feature may be related to nearby Feature 10, or other

38

random trash disposal. The age of the feature is unclear. However, if use of the fire pit is related
to Feature 10, it likely dates to the early 1900s.
Feature 12 is a spoil pile located in the central portion of the site (Figure A.5). It is situated on the
edge of the braided ephemeral wash in the middle of the site. The western portion of the feature is
partially eroded. The spoil pile consists of soil and rock. It is roughly 10 m long, five m wide, and
two m tall. No artifacts are associated with the feature. Feature 12 appears to represent a dump
spot from dirt from a shaft or adit, or from processed rock.

Figure A.5. Photograph of Feature 12, a spoil pile.

Feature 13 is a rock pile or cairn (Figure A.6). It is located on a small ridge in the south-central
part of the site. The rock pile is roughly 1.5 m in diameter. It consists of approximately 40 rocks,
which range in size from 10–25 cm diameter. The feature appears to be surficial. No artifacts are
associated with the feature.
Feature 14 is a trench excavated by a dozer or front-end loader (Figure A.7). It is roughly four m
wide and 20 m long. The feature is excavated into an alluvial ridge and likely represents an
exploratory trench. No artifacts are associated with the feature.

39

40

Feature 15 is a rock pile located on the edge of Feature 14 (Figure A.8). It appears to pre-date the
excavation of the trench. The pile is a surficial cluster of roughly 10–20-cm sized basalt cobbles.
The feature is approximately 1.5 m diameter. No artifacts are associated with Feature 15.
Feature 16 is a small hole excavated into a ridge in the south-central portion of the site (Figure
A.9). The hole is roughly 25 cm diameter. It has been capped with two large cobbles/boulders. The
area is fenced off with chicken wire. The fence appears to be a more modern addition, installed for
safety reasons. The fenced area is 2.4 by 2.6 m. No artifacts are associated with Feature 16. The
purpose of the feature is unclear. It might be an auger hole, or a vent shaft for underground mine
features. This may be a drill hole from recent (2013) work at the site.
Feature 17 is a rock structure located in the southwest portion of the site (Figure A.10). It consists
of dry-laid cobbles/boulders and large in situ boulders that comprise the lower walls of a probable
structure. The feature is roughly 3.5 by 3.5 m, and is square. The in situ boulders are located on
the south side, with walls built on the east, west, and north sides. A possible entrance is located on
the northwest corner of the feature. A sheet of corrugated tin is present inside the feature. This may
represent former roofing material, or simply be displaced from elsewhere. No artifacts were
associated with the structure. Very little historical trash was located in proximity to the feature,
and no trash dumps were nearby. This might indicate the structure was not a habitation, but served
a utilitarian function. Alternatively, if it was used as a habitation, its occupation may have been
brief, or people simply disposed of trash elsewhere. The age of the feature is unknown.
Feature 18 is a large mine shaft on the western edge of the complex. It is situated on the slope
above the main features of the mine. It is excavated roughly 10 meters into bedrock. The shaft is
roughly 2 by 2 m. Spoils from the shaft extend away from it in a roughly 10-m arc. No artifacts
are associated with the shaft. Its age is indeterminate.
Feature 19 is the remnant of a processing building (Figure A.11). It is located in the northwest
portion of the site. The feature consists of a concrete foundation—roughly 11 by 7.5 m—with
internal concrete pillars. These pillars have lag bolts and likely supported machinery for ore
processing. Partial wall frames that have collapsed are still present. The west wall has collapsed
inward and the south wall has collapsed outward. Other wall remnants are scattered in and around
the feature. Sheets of corrugated tin are also present. These were probably siding or roofing
material. Silt and gravel has covered some of the foundation, particularly on the south and west
(upslope) sides. The feature probably represents an ore-processing stamp plant or mill. The age of
the feature was determined from an etching in the concrete “FEB 24 1965.”

43

Feature 20 is a metal headframe and associated shaft (Figure A.12). The headframe consists of metal
tubing forming an offset “A”-frame, with a pulley wheel mounted on top. The frame is over a
concrete-lined shaft that measures 1.8 by 1.5 m. It is estimated that this shaft is at least 30 m deep,
or more. This headframe is probably associated with the more recent operation of the mine. Feature
19 to the northwest dates to 1965 and processing features to the northeast (Feature 26) date to 1977.
Feature 21 is a large adit excavated into the ridge on the west side of the site (Figure A.13). The
adit is roughly 3 by 3 m. The roof has collapsed at the entry of the adit, forming a rubble pile
partially blocking it. The adit extends approximately 20 m, or more, into the mountain.
Feature 22 is a large iron water tank (Figure A.14). It is 2.5 m diameter and 10 m long. The tank
is currently in use, storing water from the mountain above, and pumping water downslope to the
modern occupants located to the southeast. It is unknown if this feature is related to use of the
mine, or a modern feature placed within the mine site.
Feature 23 is a linear rubble pile with a wooden rigging at the end (Figure A.15). The feature
appears to be the remnant of a mine cart track, with the track removed. The feature extends
southeast away from Feature 21, a large adit. It appears likely that it was used to dump rock and
waste. The age of the feature is unknown.
Feature 24 is an ore funnel consisting of welded steel angle-iron frame and wood (Figure A.16).
A concrete foundation is set into the slope at the base of the funnel. Feature 26 (a processing plant)
is immediately east of the base of Feature 24. The ore funnel is on the edge of a terrace where
Features 19–21 are located. It drops down to a lower terrace where additional processing plants
were situated. At the top, the funnel is 3.45 by 6.35 m. The age of the feature is unknown, but it is
likely associated with the more recent operation of the mine (i.e., 1960s or 1970s) given the
proximity of features from that time period and its general condition.
Feature 25 is a mine shaft with two concrete and cobble pillar foundations (Figure A.17). The shaft
is roughly 2 by 2 m and around 20 m deep. A 10-m diameter spoil pile surrounds the shaft. The
concrete and cobble foundations probably anchored a headframe above the shaft. The foundations
have been undercut by erosion. Another small concrete foundation is located outside the pit on the
southeast. This foundation is 1 m long and 70 cm wide and has four lag bolts. Modern trash is
present in the southeast corner of the pit surrounding the shaft. The age of Feature 25 is uncertain.
The construction technique of the pillars and the erosion of the pillars suggests it is associated with
an earlier operation of the mine, but at this point this is speculative.
Feature 26 is a stamp plant or mill (see Figure A.16). Concrete foundations (poured in place) are
all that remain. If a superstructure housed associated equipment, there is no remaining trace. The
feature consists of a concrete pad located northeast of the ore funnel (Feature 24) and several
irregular-shaped concrete foundations with lag bolts. The pad appears to be lain over an older
concrete pad. A series of inscriptions are present on the various concrete features, representing
names of miners and dates of construction. These include “CHINDO,” “CHINDO SANCHEZ,”
“FINSTAD 1977,” “CR MILLER,” “MILEY ESTRADA,” ‘MILEY 11-29-77,” “PATRICK L.
BOND 77,” and “GARY/BROOKS/WASHORN/FRANCO/1977.” An example of the
inscriptions are shown in Figure A.18. Clearly, this feature and this portion of the mine dates to
1977.

Feature 27 is a series of five contiguous concrete storage/separation bins (Figure A.19). The
concrete is poured in place construction. These bins are located to the northeast of Feature 26 on
a lower terrace. Overall, the feature is 14.6 m long and 4 m wide, with a 1-m wide pad in front
(northeast) of the bins. The individual bins are roughly 2.9 m wide with 15-cm wide walls
separating the cells. Walls are 1.75 m tall, roughly equaling the drop between the terraces. A
wooden wing wall is located on the northwest side of the bins, serving as a retaining wall for the
terrace. The wing wall consists of three 8- by 8-in posts and five 3- by 12-in boards. The wall
extends 1.9 m northwest of the concrete structure. Feature 27 likely was used to store ore or
processed ore prior to additional processing, dumping, or removal from the site. The feature
likely dates to 1977 or thereabouts given its proximity to Feature 26. There is modern trash
present.
Feature 28 is a concrete pad located north of Feature 27. The pad is 11.9 m long and 2.5 m wide.
A small irregularly poured patch of concrete, in a semi-circular shape, is located at the southwest
corner of the foundation. This small slab is 2.9 by 1.3 m. It likely represents the location of a
doorway or entrance. A wooden power pole (inactive) with ceramic insulators is located on the
east side of the pad. Feature 28 appears to have been a building, but no superstructure remains.
The age of the feature is uncertain. A roughly 5- by 3-m pile of drill cores is dumped in the
middle of the foundation (Figure A.20). This may indicate the foundation originates with an
earlier use of the mine and the cores are from the 1960s or 1970s.

Feature 29 is a pile of drill cores (Figure A.21). It is roughly 5 m long and 2.5 m wide, extending
northeast-southwest. A “wheatback” penny (1944D) was located nearby, but this may or may not
be related. The age of the feature is unknown, although it may be related to the drill cores dumped
at Feature 28. If so, these cores may also be from the 1960s or 1970s. Nearby trash dumps are also
from this general time period.

Feature 30 is a small artifact dump located in the northwest portion of the site (Figure A.22).
Artifacts associated with the feature are listed in Table A.3. In total, 110 artifacts were recorded in
the dump. These were dominated by sanitary cans and clear glass fragments. It was estimated that
the clear glass fragments comprise at least 10 bottles. Based on the artifacts, it appears that Feature
30 dates to the 1960s or 1970s and is associated with the more recent use of the mine.

Feature 31 is a circular concrete pad located in the central portion of the site (Figure A.23). The
feature is built on a slope. The base of the pad is composed of various sized boulders. On the
upslope (west) side, a single course is laid. One the eastern, downslope, side of the pad, there are
roughly three courses of cobbles and boulders. The pad is 15 cm tall on the west and 60 cm tall on
the east. The diameter of the pad is 4.1 m. A boulder on the east side is etched with “consists of
“NO.16DE(?)/1929/F.M.” (Figure A.24). The purpose of the feature is unknown. The etching
dates the feature to 1929. No artifacts are associated with Feature 31.

Figure A.24. Photograph of inscription on Feature 31.

Feature 32 is a large pit and trash dump (Figure A.25). The pit is roughly 10 m long and 1.5 m
deep. It contains a large number of cans and bottles from a wide range of time periods. A sample
of diagnostic artifacts was recorded (Table A.4); an estimate was made of the total number present.
Roughly 400 cans were estimated, including sanitary, aluminum-topped beverage, aerosol,
aluminum (modern), oil, and more. Around 200 bottles were estimated. Glass colors include clear,
brown, and green. Notably, no SCA or aqua glass was observed suggesting the trash is not from
the earlier use of the mine in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In general, it appeared that artifacts
on the west side of the feature were deposited more recently than those on the east. Feature 32
represents a test pit that was re-used for trash disposal. Dates from diagnostic artifacts suggests a
wide potential range, from the 1930s to the 1970s. Some modern trash, including Diet Coke
aluminum cans, were also noted.

Feature 33 is a mine shaft located in the central portion of the site (Figure A.26). It is roughly 2 by
2 m, with a 5-m diameter spoil pile around the shaft. It is estimated that the shaft is at least 20 m
deep. The shaft is reinforced with timbers. No artifacts are associated with the feature. The age of
the shaft is indeterminate.
Feature 34 is a large mine shaft located in the central portion of the site (Figure A.27). The shaft
is roughly 3 by 3 m, with a 10-m diameter spoil pile surrounding it. Timber framing is visible in
the shaft. The depth of the shaft is at least 20 m. A secondary framed shaft is located on the south
side of the shaft. This secondary shaft appears to be an access or elevator shaft. A ladder is present
in this secondary shaft. No artifacts are associated with the feature. The age of Feature 34 is
indeterminate.
Feature 35 is a concrete-lined tank (Figure A.28). It is trapezoidal, being wider on the west than
on the east end. The tank is roughly oriented east-west. It measures approximately 12 m long. It is
6.5 m wide on the west and 4.5 m wide on the east end. It is estimated to be roughly 1 m deep. A
2.2-m wide concrete pad is located along the northern edge of the tank. No artifacts are associated
with the tank. The age of the feature is unknown, but speculatively, it may be associated with the
earlier phases of the mine’s operation, given its proximity to other early features.
Feature 36 is the remnants of a corrugated tin cistern (Figure A.29). The feature is located
immediately northeast of Feature 35, on the slope of the terrace below the tank. Feature 36 is
roughly 3 m diameter. It consists of twisted corrugated tin and light tan silt that probably represents
processed ore. No artifacts are associated with the feature. The age of Feature 36 is uncertain, but
it is likely associated with nearby features that are likely from the early operation of the mine.
Feature 37 is a mill or stamp plant complex (Figure A.30). The feature consists of concrete
foundations and walls located on three artificially-created terrace levels. Feature 37 is located east
(downslope) of Feature 35 (tank). There are several episodes of construction apparent in the
complex, including rock masonry walls, local-aggregate concrete, and probable imported concrete.
No superstructure, or remnants of a superstructure, are present. The complexity of the feature and
the project-imposed time constraints precluded detailed mapping. The feature was documented
photographically. The planview layout of the feature is clearly visible on aerial photos of the area.
The feature complex represents an ore processing stamp plant or mill. Minimal artifacts are
associated with the feature. Its age is indeterminate, but it appears likely that it is associated with
an early phase of the mines operation (i.e., early 1900s).
Feature 38 is a shaft located in the north-central portion of the site (Figure A.31). The shaft is
roughly 2 by 2 m, with a 5-m diameter spoil pile around it. The shaft is covered with boards,
chicken wire, and perforated sheet metal. The shaft appears to be shored with timbers, but the view
of the shaft was obscured. No artifacts are associated with the feature. The age of Feature 38 is
uncertain. Based on archival information, Feature 38 may be a well. A historical map (Figure A.32)
shows two wells near the Bonanza shafts (McAnulty et al. 1971: Figure 4). The location of Features
38 and 39 roughly correlate with the wells.

Feature 39 is a shaft located in the north-central part of the site (Figure A.33). It is located less
than 10 m north of Feature 38. It is similarly covered with boards and chicken wire, but some of
the boards have been misplaced. Spoils are dispersed around the shaft. No artifacts are associated
with Feature 39. Its age is unknown. Based on archival information, and as mentioned above in
the description of Feature 38, it is possible that Feature 39 is a well (see Figure A.32).
Feature 40 is a trench located in the north-central part of the site. It is immediately east of Feature
39. The trench is roughly 3 m wide and 25 m long. No artifacts are associate with the feature. The
age of the trench is uncertain, but may be the result of recent work at the site in 2012.

Figure A.33. Photograph of Feature 39, a shaft or possible well.

60

Feature 41 is a possible dugout (structure) located in the north-central portion of the site (Figure
A.34). It is located on a north-facing slope above a fork of the ephemeral drainage in the northern
part of the site. The feature is excavated into the slope of the alluvial ridge. It is roughly 4.5 by 4.5
m. It is open to the north, and around 50 cm deep on the south side. A partial dry-laid cobble
masonry wall is located on the west side of the dugout. This wall is six courses high at the highest
point. A juniper post is set in the southwest corner, with a corrugated tin sheet to the north and east
of it that presumably serves to retain soil on the west and south sides. A portion of a wood stove
is located near the south wall. Miscellaneous artifacts in/near the feature include a knife-opened
hole-in-cap can, one tobacco tin, one fragment of aqua glass, one green glass bottle heal, one brown
glass fragment, and five SCA fragments. No diagnostic marks were noted. The age of the feature
is indeterminate, but nearby artifacts suggest it may date to the late 1800s or early 1900s. The
dugout may have been the location of a structure, possibly used for habitation.
