Archaeological Survey of the Parmer Lane Extension Project,
SH 29 to FM 3405, Williamson County, Texas

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG) conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed extension of Parmer Lane between State Highway
(SH) 29 and Farm-to-Market (FM) 3405 in Williamson County, Texas, from November
30, 2001 to April 11, 2003 and excavated backhoe trenches on April 04, 05, and 06,
2003. The project area consists of the 5.2-mile-long, 200-ft-wide, County-controlled
Right-of-Way (ROW) of the proposed extension of Parmer Lane between SH 29 and FM
3405 (Figures 1 and 2). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is of the 200-ft-wide, 5.2mile-long ROW of the proposed Parmer Lane extension. Funding for this project comes
solely from the Williamson County Road Bonds Program. Because this permit was
issued before the revised Texas Archeological Survey Standards were adopted, this
project does not incorporate the revised standards.
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
in order to locate any previously recorded historic and prehistoric cultural resources in
the project area. With the benefit of this research a 100% pedestrian survey of the entire
project area was performed. Shovel testing was performed in areas where the soil depth
appeared to exceed 10 cm. Backhoe trenching was used as a supplement to shovel testing
in the deeper sediments of the flood plains.
There are nine previously recorded archaeological sites located near the ROW. They are
41WM173, 41WM174, 41WM175, 41WM176, 41WM182, 41WM183, 41WM203,
41WM214, and 41WM215. No previously recorded sites are located within the ROW.
Three new archaeological sites were recorded within the ROW. Two of these sites are
historic farmstead/homestead sites. The third site is a buried prehistoric site located in
the floodplain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. Site 41WM1079 is an early to
middle twentieth century farmstead located approximately 15 m (49 ft) northwest of CR
258. The site includes four outbuildings, a limestone wall, and the remains of a house
(limestone chimney and foundation stones). According to the present property owner, the
house was likely constructed in the 1920s. The construction date is based on the use of
1920s newspapers as wallpaper in the house. Shovel Tests executed within the ROW
tested negative for artifacts, and bedrock was exposed in all of the shovel tests conducted
at the site. Due to the lack of diagnostics and ambiguous historical affiliations, the site is
not potentially eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). The extant buildings are twentieth century
constructions that do not possess unique

architectural characteristics or sufficient integrity to warrant potential eligibility to be
listed on the NRHP.
Site 41WM1080 is a historic house site located on a bluff overlooking the southern flood
plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. All that remains of the house is a
heavily disturbed chimney fall, foundation stones, and an artifact scatter. No extant
buildings are present at the site. Shovel tests executed within the ROW tested positive
for historic artifacts (glass and unidentified metal fragments). However, no clear
diagnostic artifacts were observed. Bedrock was exposed in three of the shovel tests
executed at the site. Due to the lack of clear diagnostics, poor site integrity, and
ambiguous historical affiliations, the historical component of site 41WM080 is not
potentially eligible for nomination to the NRHP or as a SAL.
Site 41WM1080 also contains a prehistoric component. The component consists of a
sparse, surficial scatter of chert debitage that has been thoroughly disturbed by plowing.
One chert flake fragment was discovered in a shovel test and several flake fragments
were observed on the surface. Due to the surficial context and highly disturbed nature of
the component and the corresponding lack of diagnostic artifacts, the prehistoric
component has negligible research value and is not potentially eligible for nomination to
the NRHP or as a SAL.
Site 41WM1084 is a buried prehistoric site located in the southern flood plain of the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River. The site is located at the base of steep bluff
overlooking the floodplain. Shovel Test 34, which was conducted at the base of the bluff,
tested positive for cultural materials. Chert debitage and one Nolan projectile point was
located at 10 to 70 cmbs. Five additional shovel tests and two backhoe trench tests were
executed to delimit the site boundaries. All additional subsurface tests tested negative for
cultural materials. Due to the questionable context of the cultural deposits and scant
artifacts present, site 41WM1084 is not potentially eligible for nomination to the NRHP
or as a SAL.
A total of 61 shovel tests were executed in the Parmer Lane ROW. Four shovel tests
tested positive for cultural materials. Three of these (STâs 31, 32, and 33) were executed
at site 41WM1080, a historic homestead. The fourth shovel test (ST 34) was executed at
site 41WM1084, a buried prehistoric site located in the flood plain of the North Fork of
the San Gabriel River.
A total of 19 backhoe trenches were excavated in the northern and southern flood plains
of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. All backhoe trenches tested negative for
archaeological deposits. The pedestrian survey and shovel test results revealed poor
depositional environments at Sowes Branch, the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River,
and the minor tributaries of Sowes Branch and the North Fork of the San Gabriel River.
Backhoe trenching was not performed at these locations during the archaeological survey
due to the shallow deposits.

7

No cultural materials, other than a Nolan projectile point that will be returned to the land
owner, were collected during any part of the survey.
No further work is warranted. It is ACSGâs recommendation that the construction of the
Parmer Lane Extension between SH 29 and FM 3405 be allowed to begin without delay
at this time. ACSG seeks concurrence for the following in regard to the project:
1) No historic properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places will be impacted by the proposed project
2) No archaeological deposits designated or eligible for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark will be impacted by the proposed project
3) No further archaeological work is required
4) No further consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer is required.
5) The project may proceed to construction in the project area.
This report follows the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines, and it is
designed to satisfy State and Federal laws and regulations. The findings of the cultural
resource survey and records search are summarized and assessments and
recommendations concerning cultural resources are presented. A brief environmental
background is provided.
INTRODUCTION
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group conducted an intensive archaeological
survey of the proposed extension of Parmer Lane between SH 29 and FM 3405 in
Williamson County, Texas, from November 30, 2001 to April 11, 2003 and excavated
backhoe trenches on April 04, 05, and 06, 2003. The proposed road extension is
approximately 5.2 miles long and is located in western Williamson County, Texas
(Figures 1 and 2).
The Parmer Lane Extension Project involves extending the existing Parmer Lane from its
northern terminus at FM 1431 to the Williamson/Bell County Line. Eventually, Parmer
Lane will connect with Interstate Highway (IH) 35 north of Georgetown. An intensive
archaeological survey of the first two phases of the project (Parmer Lane Extension from
FM 1431 to FM 2243 and Parmer Lane Extension from FM 2243 to SH 29) has been
completed by ACSG. The third phase of the project is an approximately 9.1-mile-long
extension of Parmer Lane between SH 29 to FM 2338.
This report covers a 5.2-mile-long section of the third phase between SH 29 and FM
3405. The remainder of the third phase (i.e., FM 3405 to FM 2338) will be addressed in
a separate report that will be submitted to the THC at a later date. The scope of work for
the project and the Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC include both portions of
the third phase.

Funding for this project comes solely from the Williamson County Roads Bond Program.
As a State entity, Williamson County is obligated to comply with the Texas Antiquities
Act and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Act. These rules
are interpreted and enforced primarily by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). After
a visit to the project location, an initial scope of work was formulated to comply with the
Texas Antiquities code. The stated goal of the Antiquities Code of Texas is, âto locate,
protect, and preserve all sites, objects, buildingsâ¦, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest, including but not limited to prehistoric
and historical American Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites,
archeological sites of every characterâ¦within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas.â The
THC approved this initial scope of work before the revised Texas Archeology Survey
Standards were adopted, and Texas Antiquities Permit #2752 was issued to Sean R. Nash
as principal investigator for ACSG.

AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT
The APE for this project consists of the 200-ft-wide, 5.1-mile-long ROW of the proposed
extension. The total APE is approximately 126 acres.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
The road construction will impact all surface areas within the APE. In upland areas,
impact to bedrock is anticipated. In the deeper sediments of the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River and its tributaries, only bridge supports and abutments will impact
sediments deeper than 1.5 m.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Physiography
Williamson County is divided into two physiographic regions by the Balcones
Escarpment, which bisects the county along its north-south axis. On the western side of
the escarpment, the landform is characterized by rolling limestone uplands with an
average elevation of 850 ft above mean sea level (AMSL). The vegetation within the
region consists of live oak, mesquite, Ashe juniper, prickly pear cactus, and tall and mid
grasses. The land is used primarily for livestock, but some agriculture takes place along
the eastern edge of the region. The mineral resources within the region are important
assets for the county economy. Limestone quarrying and the production of quick lime
have been significant industries in western Williamson County since the 1850s. On the
eastern side of the escarpment, the physiographic province is characterized by nearly
level to gently rolling blackland prairies with an average elevation of 600 ft AMSL. This
region has been extensively cultivated. However, areas along the rivers, creeks, and
9

drainages contain riparian forests of hackberry, cottonwood, elm, walnut, and pecan.
Approximately 30 percent of the land is prime farmland (Odintz 2002).
The property is located at the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Barnes 1974). A
rich ecotone, where three physiographic provinces intersect, encompasses the area of the
project. The property is within the upper reaches of the Brazos River drainage system
(Collins 1998:6). This landform is characterized in the area of the project by rolling
limestone uplands dissected by broad, shallow valleys. Karst features are common in the
region. A fault line bisects the project area at a point approximately 2.2 km south of the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River and strikes northeast to southwest. The western side
of the fault is the upthrown side. Sowes Branch, a tributary of the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River, flows through the fault valley.
The proposed extension will cross the North Fork and Middle Fork of the San Gabriel
River and Sowes Branch, a tributary of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. The
ROW will also cross three minor tributaries of Sowes Branch and one minor tributary of
the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. Only the North Fork of the San Gabriel has
significant alluvial deposits. The North Fork of the San Gabriel River converges with the
Middle Fork immediately west of the City of Georgetown and the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River immediately east of the City of Georgetown. The San Gabriel River
converges with the Little River, which is a tributary of the Brazos River.
Flora and Fauna
Upland soils are thin to non-existent and support a live oak savanna. Ashe juniper, live
oak, pecan, agarita, and prickly pear cactus are common. Blairâs (1950) Texan and
Balconian biotic provinces meet in the area of the property and the flora and fauna of
both provinces can be found. During the survey, deer, jackrabbits, a skunk, and various
birds were observed within the project area.
Geology and Soils
The project area is bisected by a fault line that strikes northeast to southwest. On the
eastern side of the fault line (the downthrown side), the underlying geologic formations
within the project area consist of Lower Cretaceous Edwards Limestone (Ked), Keys
Valley Marl (Kkv), and Pleistocene stream terraces (Qt). On the western side of the fault
line (the upthrown side), the underlying geologic formations are comprised of Glen Rose
Formation (Kgr [u]), Bee Cave Marl (Kbc), and Cedar Park Limestone (Kcp). Recent
flood plain deposits (Qal) and Pleistocene stream terraces (Qt) are the primary geologic
formations within the flood plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River (Barnes
1974)
Soils that encompass the project area include Denton-Eckrant-Doss and EckrantGeorgetown association soils. East of the fault line, Eckrant-Georgetown association
soils are the predominant soil types. These soils are described as âvery shallow to
moderately deep, calcareous and noncalcareous, stony, cobbly, and loamy soils formed in
indurated limestone; on uplandsâ (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
10

Service [USDA, SCS] 1983). West of the fault line, Denton-Ekrant-Doss association
soils are the predominant soil types. These are described as âmoderately deep, shallow
and very shallow, calcareous, clayey, cobbly and stony soils formed in indurated
fractured limestone or limy earths; on uplandsâ (USDA, SCS 1983).
The flood plains of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River and Sowes Branch, a
tributary of the river, contain Sunev silty clay loam on 1 to 3 percent slopes (SuB) and
channeled Oakalla soils (Oc). The Oakalla-Sunev association soils are described as
âdeep, calcareous, loamy soils formed in alluvium; on bottomlands and stream terracesâ
(USDA, SCS 1983). The headwaters of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River cross
the ROW in the southern section of the APE. The Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River
contains very little alluvium. Four small ephemeral tributaries of Sowes Branch and the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River cross the ROW in the central and northern section of
the APE. These tributaries contain negligible amounts of alluvium.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
The property falls within the Central Texas archaeological region (Collins 1995).
Prehistoric archaeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation
starting around 11,500 years ago. Throughout its occupation, hunting and gathering is
believed to be the exclusive resource procurement strategy of prehistoric Central Texans.
Sites have been interpreted to represent relatively short-term occupations. Deeper sites
with large amounts of cultural materials are thought to be camps that were returned to
through the years possibly on a regular basis.
Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a recent synthesis of Central Texas archaeology. The
cultural history summarized here is based in large part on his synthesis. Collins divides
the prehistory of Central Texas into three periods: (1) the Paleo-Indian, (2) the Archaic,
and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these has further been divided into subperiods, such
as early and late. Smaller units of time referred to as âstyle intervalsâ are used to
coincide with the interval of use of a particular point style or group of point styles. These
style intervals can overlap or extend over more than one subperiod. Most, however, can
be used to subdivide the subperiods. Information pertaining to burned rock middens, if
found, is based primarily on Blackâs (1997) research.
Paleo-Indian (Before 8800 B.P.)
The evidence (e.g., Meltzer 1993) no longer supports the long held belief that North
American Paleo-Indians could be characterized as nomadic bands of big game hunters.
Big game hunting is indicated, particularly in association with Folsom. However, a more
generalized hunting and gathering subsistence is now evidenced at Paleo-Indian sites
across Texas and the rest of North America (e.g., Burger Bluff (41GD30) and Baker
Cave). The relatively mesic conditions that prevailed from about 11,500 allowed for a
high biomass in central Texas and the surrounding regions (Collins 1995).

11

Clovis and Folsom style intervals divide Collinsâ early Paleo-Indian period (11,20010,000 B.P.). Clovis is the earliest recognized cultural horizon in central Texas. Clovis
is securely dated to between 11,200 and 10,900 B.P. in radiocarbon years. The WilsonLeonard, Gault, and Pavo Real sites have recently added new data to the study of these
early peoples of what is now Texas. Kincaid Rockshelter and Horn Shelter sites also
have documented Clovis components. Clovis artifacts include prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bola stones and the unique Clovis point (Collins 1995). Clovis points are usually
lanceolate, fluted projectile or lance points (Collins 1998).
The Folsom style interval is not as securely dated, and appears to overlap with Clovis.
The finely retouched and fluted Folsom points are one of the most easily recognized
points made in the Americas. In Folsom times, more than at any other interval, people
were specialized hunters. Bison kills with associated Folsom points remain the typical
Folsom site type. The postulated style intervals following Folsom, known as Plainview
and Dalton-San Patrice, are not well known or clearly defined. However, evidence from
sites containing components related to them, such as Horn Shelter 2, indicate an Archaiclike hunter-gatherer lifeway (Redder 1985).
Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall style intervals make up Collinsâ (1995)
late Paleo-Indian subperiod. This subperiod is characterized as intermediate or
transitional between Paleo-Indian and Archaic (Collins 1998:63-4). Burned rock features
have been found associated with all three style intervals of this subperiod, but they are
substantially smaller and less frequent than in the Archaic (Collins 1995).
Archaic (8800-1300 B.P.)
The mesic conditions of the Paleo-Indian period come to an end during the early
subperiod of the Archaic. With the exception of the Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval of
the middle Archaic subperiod, this was a more xeric time for Central Texas and the
surrounding regions. A jump in the number of ground stone tools, specifically manos and
metates suggests an increased reliance on plant resources (Collins 1995). Central Texas
Archaic sites are characterized by accumulations of heat-altered rock, including those
known as burned rock middens.
Three subperiods have been defined for the Central Texas Archaic: (1) early, (2) middle,
and (3) late (Johnson and Goode 1994, Collins 1995). Early Archaic sites (8800-6000
B.P.) are recognized by the presence of Angostura, Early Split Stem, and MartindaleUvalde points. Unifacial Clear Fork tools and Guadalupe bifaces are found in early
Archaic sites along with ground stone tools and other bifacial and unifacial implements.
Early Archaic earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock are found primarily on the
better-watered portions of the Edwardâs plateau, in Live Oak savanna habitats. These
earth ovens and accumulations of burned rock have been considered the technological
antecedents of the classic burned rock middens (Collins 1995). However, at Ft. Hood
seven burned rock middens were carefully dated using AMS. The features spanned from
5500 BC (early Archaic) to 1400 AD (Quigg and Ellis 1994). Two others burned rock
middens in Kerr County have been dated to the early Archaic (Luke 1980). It is possible
12

that these reported early burned rock ovens and accumulations may represent the same
phenomenon in a different form or stage of development (e.g., incipient)
During the first interval (6000-5000 B.P.) of the middle Archaic subperiod the climate is
somewhat more mesic. Bison populations soared. The technically impressive BellAndice-Calf Creek points were likely made primarily for killing these Bison (Johnson
and Goode 1994). By 5000 B.P., the Bison had dwindled and the climate had become
more xeric again. Burned rock middens were likely used to cook sotol and other
xerophytes that thrived during these dry years (Johnson and Goode 1994:26). The last
thousand years of the middle Archaic (5000-4000 B.P.) are divided into two style
intervals, Taylor and Nolan-Travis.
The late Archaic (4000-1300 B.P.) began during the driest time central Texans had ever
experienced. There was, however, a steady increase in effective moisture until it peaked
in the later part of the late Archaic (Collins 1995). With the increase in effective
moisture came the return of Bison. Six style intervals are recognized for the late Archaic:
(1) Bulverde, (2) Pedernales-Kinney, (3) Lange-Marshall-Williams, (4) Marcos-MontellCastroville, (5) Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and (6) Darl.
Late Prehistoric (1300 - ca. 500 B.P., or contact)
The beginning of the late Prehistoric period is defined primarily by the introduction of the
bow and arrow. Pottery was also introduced during this time, but unlike many areas in
Texas and the rest of the New World, hunting and gathering resource procurement
strategies prevailed (Collins 1995). Many documented instances of arrow wounds are
recorded during this period (Prewitt 1974).
The late Prehistoric is divided into early and late subperiods (Jelks 1962). Each
subperiod has a single style interval. The early subperiod is represented by the Austin
style interval and the late subperiod by the Toyah interval (Collins 1995). Scallorn and
Edwards points are diagnostic of the early subperiod and Perdiz is representative of the
Toyah archaeological manifestation.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Historic exploration and settlement of the Williamson County area began in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth century when Spanish explorers traveled through the
region searching for better routes to the missions in East Texas. Captain Alonso De LeÃ³n
followed the Camino Real from San Antonio to Bastrop several times during the 1680s,
and, at least once, he traveled on the Camino de Arriba, which crossed Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. In 1716, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, a French explorer, and
Captain Domingo Ramon, a Spanish explorer, led an expedition through the area and
camped on the banks of Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River. They named them
Arroyo do las BendÃ­tas Ãnimas and Rio de San Xavier, respectively. In 1721, Marques
de Aguayo led a large group of soldiers, livestock, and provisions through present-day
13

Williamson County to replenish supplies at the eastern missions (The City of Round
Rock 1998). In the mid-eighteenth century, the San Xavier missions were established
along the San Gabriel River, just east of the Williamson/Milam County line. By 1753,
drought and disease made the missions uninhabitable and Spanish influence in the area
declined (Odintz 2002).
Anglo-American influence in the area began with a series of land grants from the
Mexican government in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In 1835,
continual attacks by local Indians prompted Captain John J. Tumlinson and his company
of Texas Rangers to construct a fort and Indian lookout near the headwaters of Brushy
Creek, in southwestern Williamson County (Thompson 2002). Tumlinson Fort, as it was
called, was abandoned in 1836 when General Santa Ana invaded Texas (Odintz 2002).
Following the defeat of General Santa Ana at the Battle of San Jacinto, several veterans
of the battle settled in Williamson County. In 1838, Dr. Thomas Kenney and his family
built a fort on Brushy Creek, in what is now eastern Williamson County. Kenneyâs Fort
became the first civilian settlement in Williamson County. By the 1840s, several
settlements existed along Brushy Creek. However, Indian attacks were a frequent
problem, and numerous settlers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians. By 1846, the
Indian threat had waned and settlement in the region increased. In 1848, the Texas
legislature established Williamson County, naming it after Robert Williamson, a Milam
County Judge and state senator (Odintz 2002).
By 1850, the county had a population of 1,379 whites and 155 slaves. Most of the
population was located in the eastern part of the county on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel (Odintz 2002), but a few families were living in the western half.
During the 1850âs and 1860âs, towns, lumber mills, and tanneries sprang up around the
county. Communities like Seward Junction and Rock House, which are located near the
project area, developed during this period as significant agricultural centers in western
Williamson County. Although urbanization and industrialization increased somewhat,
the bulk of the county remained rural and agricultural. The majority of the families lived
on subsistence farms in log houses and raised corn. During the 1850s and early 1860s,
the slave population increased and the agricultural patterns within the county became
more diverse. Wheat and corn were the predominant crops in the blackland prairies, and
cattle and sheep ranching was widespread throughout the county, but particularly
widespread in the hilly regions west of the Balcones Escarpment (Nash et al. 2002).
Cotton was introduced in 1850s, but it was not a significant cash crop.
The economy of Williamson County slumped during the Civil War, but picked up again
in the 1870s with the growth of the cattle and sheep industry and the expansion of cotton
farming. The cattle industry was sustained by tributaries of the Chisolm trail, which were
established in 1864 and passed close to Round Rock. Many cattle drives passed through
or originated in Williamson County. The 1870s and 1880s was also marked by the
arrival of railroads to Williamson and Travis County (Odintz 2002).
14

By the early-twentieth century, cotton farming had surpassed the cattle industry. With
the dramatic growth in cotton farming, a shift in farm tenancy developed. As late as
1880, 77 percent of the farms were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43 percent of
the farms were worked by owners. By 1930, only 29 percent of the farms were worked
by owners. The tenancy rates continued to drop during the Great Depression (Odintz
2002).
The cotton industry suffered economically during the 1920s from the effects of soil
depletion, falling prices brought on by overproduction, and the boll weevil infestation.
The Great Depression of the 1930s worsened the economic situation and encouraged
farmers to shift away from cotton to livestock. Cotton production was reduced by nearly
half, while sorghum and wheat became important crops. Along with cattle and sheep,
poultry farming intensified (Odintz 2002).
Significant population and economic changes occurred in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
The construction and expansion of roads throughout the undeveloped areas of
Williamson County meant urban populations now had easier access to the Hill Country.
The consolidation of rural schools also meant children could now attend schools outside
of their rural communities. For example, during the 1910s and 1920s, Rock House
School was one of the largest schools in Williamson County. In 1903, the school boasted
a population of 96 students and 2 teachers. The school was consolidated with Liberty
Hill School in 1947, and by the 1990s, Rock House had become a dispersed agricultural
community (Scarbrough 1973).
Suburbanization of the portions of the county bordering Austin caused the population of
Williamson County to boom in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, the population of
Williamson County was 37,305. By 1982, the population had grown to over 85,700
(Odintz 2002). A pattern of absentee ownership and of non-agricultural use of the land
also intensified following World War II. The communities of Rock House and Seward
Junction dwindled when residents moved to nearby Austin, Georgetown, and Liberty
Hill. By 1990, only a few dozen people remained in the communities of Rock House and
Seward Junction. Today, much of the property within the project area is now being held
for investment purposes.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
No previously recorded sites are located within the ROW. There are, however, nine
previously recorded archaeological sites located near the ROW. These are 41WM173,
41WM174, 41WM175, 41WM176, 41WM182, 41WM183, 41WM203, 41WM214, and
41WM215 (Figure 3).
Site 41WM173 is a lithic scatter located approximately 2.6 km south of the North Fork
of the San Gabriel River. The site, which was first investigated in 1970 during an
archaeological survey of the North Fork Reservoir Project, consists of a sparse scatter of
chert flakes, chert cores, and possible scraping tools that are located along an actively
15

eroding draw on the A. G. Braun Ranch. Many chert cobbles and a few artifacts were
observed on the surface. Due to the sparse nature of the artifacts, the recorder concluded
that the site was probably a short-term knapping area. No further investigation was
recommended by the recorder.
Site 41WM174 is a lithic scatter located approximately 2.6 km south of the North Fork
of the San Gabriel River, on the A. G. Braun Ranch. The site was discovered during the
same archaeological survey that discovered site 41WM173. The site is located along a
dry tributary of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River, approximately 300 m south of
Sowes Branch. The site contains a sparse, surficial lithic scatter that measures
approximately 61 m x 122 m. The site is very similar to nearby site 41WM173.
However, site 41WM174 contains more surficial flakes and no chert cobbles. The
artifacts at the site consist primarily of chert flakes. However, two unidentified projectile
point fragments were collected by the recorder. The recorder did not recommend further
investigation of the site.
Site 41WM175 is located approximately 2.7 km south of the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River and immediately west of site 41WM174 on the A. G. Braun Ranch. It was
first investigated in 1970 during the same archaeological survey that recorded sites
41WM173 and 41WM174. The site is located in a cultivated field on a stream terrace
east of Sowes Branch. The site contains a surficial scatter of chert flakes measuring
approximately 92 m x 183 m. The site has been heavily disturbed by plowing, but due to
its location on a stream terrace, the site may have intact, buried cultural deposits. The
recorder suggested that shovel testing should be conducted at the site, but made no
recommendations for further work.
Site 41WM176 is located on the same stream terrace that contains site 41WM175. The
site, which measures approximately 37 m x 55 m, consists of a surficial scatter of chert
flakes located on the northern end of a cultivated field. The site is located approximately
137 m north of site 41WM175, which is located at the southern end of the cultivated
field. Because of the close proximity of the sites, the sites are most likely associated.
The recorder recommended further testing to establish the relationship between the sites.
Site 41WM182 is located approximately 1.1 km south of the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River, along a tributary of Sowes Branch on the A. G. Braun Ranch. The site is a
rock shelter and lithic scatter located on the east bank of the tributary. The site was first
investigated in 1972 during an archaeological survey for the proposed North Fork
Reservoir. The site, which measures approximately 30.5 m x 46 m, contains a surficial
scatter of burned rocks and chert flakes. Because of the siteâs undisturbed nature, the
recorded recommended further testing.
Site 41WM183 is located approximately 274 m east of site 41WM182, on a tributary of
Sowes Branch. The site, which measures approximately 183 m x 182 m, contains a
surficial scatter of chert flakes and cobbles. No indicators of long-term occupation (e.g.,
burned rock or burned rock features) were observed. Due to the strictly surficial nature
of the site, the recorder did not recommend further work.
16

Site 41WM203 is a prehistoric mound site located on the south bank of the North Fork of
the San Gabriel River. The site is located in a cultivated field bisected by an intermittent
drainage. The site is located in the eastern portion of the cultivated field. The site
contains a slight mound and a surface scatter of chert flakes, burned rocks, and freshwater
bivalve shells. The area of occupation and depth of fill is unknown. The recorder
recommended testing of the site.
Site 41WM214 is a buried terrace site located on the south bank of the North Fork of the
San Gabriel River. The site was recorded by William Sorrow of the University of Texas
at Austin in 1970 during an archaeological survey of the North Fork Reservoir. Various
strata of cultural materials were observed in the face of a cliff along the river. No
surficial cultural materials were observed. The site extends approximately 11 m along
the face of the cliff, and the depth of fill is <3 m. A 1.2-m x 2.5-m test unit and one
backhoe trench test were excavated at the site. In addition, four C14 samples were
collected from the site. However, the C14 tests were abandoned due to an indefinite
association between the diagnostics collected and the C14 samples. Several biface
fragments, uniface fragments, scrapers, engravers, and Late Archaic projectile points
were collected from the test units. The recorder recommended further, extensive testing
of the site.
Site 41WM215 is a burned rock midden located on the south bank of the North Fork of
the San Gabriel River, approximately 69 m downstream from site 41WM214. The site
was recorded in 1970 during an archaeological survey of the North Fork Reservoir
Project. The area of occupation and the depth of cultural deposits are unknown.
However, the site is located on a river terrace that is older and higher that the terrace
containing sites 41WM203 and 41WM214. A backhoe trench was excavated through the
middle of the midden, and the excavated material was examined for cultural materials.
Various projectile points, including several Nolans, a Martindale, two Tortugas, and a
Bulverde, were collected from the backhoe test trench. A granite mano was also
collected from the surface of the site. The recorder recommended further testing at the
site.

METHODS
Pedestrian Survey
A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted for Williamson County to âidentify obvious or
well known propertiesâ and âareas where certain kinds of properties are likely to occurâ
[36 CFR Â§ 64] (Derry et. al. 1985, King et. al. 1977). These include both historic and
prehistoric aged properties. A thorough record search was completed in order to
determine: (1) if there were any recorded sites within the project area; and (2) the nature
of the recorded sites in the general area. Based on this data, a strategy for an intensive
archaeological survey of the project area was devised. The survey strategy included a
100% pedestrian survey and shovel testing.

sites (in red), and general environment.
18

For the pedestrian survey and subsequent shovel testing, the APE was divided into four
sections based on geographical characteristics (Figure 4). The segments are as follows:
Section 1 begins at CR 268, immediately south of SH 29, and terminates at the Middle
Fork of the San Gabriel River. This section is approximately 1.9 miles (3.0 km) long and
crosses routinely plowed fields and pastures in the uplands south of the Middle Fork of
the San Gabriel River.
Section 2 begins at the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River and terminates at Sowes
Branch, a tributary of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. This section is
approximately 1.8 miles (2.9 km long). The topography in this section is remarkably
varied with flat uplands in the southernmost portion, rugged canyons and steep bluffs in
the central portion, and an expansive valley floor in the northern portion. The average
elevation drops from 1043 ft AMSL in the southern uplands to 892 ft AMSL in the
Sowes Branch Valley. Much of this section contains exposed bedrock and very thin soil
over degrading bedrock.
Section 3 begins at Sowes Branch and terminates at the North Fork of the San Gabriel
River. This section is approximately .9 miles (1.4 km) long and is comprised of the
uplands between Sowes Branch and the North Fork of the San Gabriel River and the
southern flood plain of the river. The APE had been heavily plowed immediately north
of Sowes Branch and in the uplands between CR 258 and the North Fork floodplain. A
large limestone bluff overlooks the flood plain of the river, which contains deep alluvial
deposits. The elevation drops from 900 ft AMSL at the summit of the bluff to 840 ft
AMSL in the flood plain of the river. The flood plain has been routinely plowed in the
past, but it now lays fallow.
Section 4 begins at the North Fork of the San Gabriel River and terminates at FM 3405.
This section is approximately .5 miles (.85 km) and ascends from the flood plain of the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River to the uplands north of the river. The elevation at
the river is approximately 819 ft AMSL, and it rises to approximately 887 ft AMSL at
FM 3405. The northern flood plain has been routinely plowed and is currently a cattle
pasture.
A strategy of using closely spaced transects was determined to be the best way to
discover any sites in the APE. Ten-meter transects were walked across the entire APE.
Overall good ground visibility in the project area allowed for a confident appraisal of the
open upland areas. Wooded areas had only fair to poor ground visibility. Areas of better
visibility within the poor visibility areas received additional attention. If an artifact were
found, the surrounding area would be cleared and carefully searched. Notes were taken
describing conditions, environmental factors, and any other factors affecting the survey.
Furthermore, photographs were taken of environmental settings, cultural artifacts, and
features encountered during the survey. All naturally exposed profiles were examined.

Sites as defined by Hester et al. (1997:42) are âany discrete bounded location where
humans lived, worked, or carried out a task - and where evidence of their behavior can be
recovered by the archaeologist.â For practical purposes, any area where three or more
artifacts were found within a 10-m diameter was recorded. Isolated artifacts would be
plotted on a USGS 7.5â topographic map.
Shovel and Backhoe Testing
The THC approved this scope of work under the old minimum survey standards, which
required at least one shovel test per three acres in a 100 to 200-acre project. The APE for
this project is 126 acres, and a minimum of 42 shovel tests is required.
Based on the background research, a scope of work was formulated to account for the
lack of deep soils and sediments within the uplands of the APE and the heavily disturbed
agricultural fields within the APE. The subsequent pedestrian survey results confirmed
that the majority of the project area is located in an upland setting with heavily degraded
surfaces and exposed limestone bedrock. The pedestrian survey also confirmed that the
ROW crosses several routinely plowed fields. With this in mind, shovel tests were
conducted at the Principal Investigatorâs discretion.
Shovel tests were placed in areas where the soils and sediments appeared to exceed 10
cm in depth and were relatively undisturbed. In order to confirm shallow depths, some
shovel tests were also placed in areas that contain thin soils. Areas where soil profiles
were naturally exposed through erosion were also examined. Shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm in diameter and dug to bedrock or sterile clay. Shovel test locations
were mapped by GPS. Notes were taken describing the depth, soils, stratigraphy, and any
artifacts found. Whenever a site was located during the pedestrian survey, additional
subsurface testing was conducted to evaluate the depth and nature of cultural deposits.
The minimum survey standards for Texas require at least six shovel tests to define site
boundaries, unless the site has more than 30 percent surface visibility.
The intermittent drainages within the APE typically exhibit erosion rather than deposition
and do not present a favorable environment for the preservation of archaeological sites.
Shovel tests executed near the drainages revealed degrading limestone bedrock near the
surface. Limestone bedrock is also exposed in the cutbanks of two tributaries of Sowes
Branch. Because the intermittent tributaries of Sowes Branch and the North Fork of the
San Gabriel River lack substantial alluvial deposits, no backhoe test trenches were
conducted at these locations during the archaeological survey.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Pedestrian Survey Results (See Figure 15)
Section 1

21

The majority of Section 1 crosses routinely plowed fields and pastures. Ground visibility
is often good to excellent due to the overall lack of vegetation. However, a small portion
of the APE between CR 268 and SH 29 is located in a fallow field overgrown with tall
grasses, Ashe juniper, and mesquite. The field appears to have been routinely plowed in
the past, but now lays uncultivated. A small, abandoned gravel pit is located immediately
south of SH 29. The areas adjacent to the gravel pit have been heavily disturbed by
quarrying activities.
North of SH 29, the APE crosses an intensely cultivated cornfield (Figure 5). Ground
visibility in this portion of the APE is excellent due to the overall lack of vegetation. The
surface of the cornfield is covered with many chert cobbles, many of which exhibit fire
and plow damage. Two possible chert cores were located in the cornfield. However, due
to the proliferation of chert cobbles on the surface, it is possible that the cores are actually
cobbles with fire and/or plow damage. These dubious cores were not collected.
North of the cornfield, the ROW crosses a large pasture that gradually slopes to the
Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River. Surface visibility in this portion of the APE is fair
to good due to negligible vegetation. The ROW crosses the headwaters of the Middle
Fork of the San Gabriel River at the northern boundary of Section 1 (Figure 5). At this
point, the fork is an intermittent stream. The fork has been dammed just east of the APE
to form a large stock tank. The banks of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River are
heavily wooded with elm, oak, and scattered Ashe juniper. Subangular to subrounded
limestone cobbles are common on the surface. A large biface was found on the surface in
the pasture immediately south of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River. The biface is
an isolated artifact and is not located within the APE. It was not collected. A twentieth
century farm complex is also located in the pasture, east of the APE. The complex
includes two extant barns, two ashlar limestone troughs, and a large refuse pile
containing what appears to be the remains of an early to middle twentieth century house.
The property owner informed ACSG personnel that the house was razed before the
property was acquired and that the house was probably the living quarters of a previous
ranch foreman.
Section 2
North of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River, the APE crosses a large pasture
overgrown with small mesquite and live oak trees (Figure 6). Ground visibility is fair to
good due to the negligible vegetation. A buried gas line bisects the APE approximately
450 m north of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River. No cultural materials or
features were observed in this area.
Approximately 840 m north of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River, the ROW
crosses a canyon formed by the confluence of three, deeply entrenched, spring-fed
tributaries of Sowes Branch (Figures 6 and 7). The elevation drops from 1043 ft AMSL
at the upland summit to 984 ft AMSL at the canyon floor. The vegetation consists
primarily of Ashe juniper and scattered oaks. A thin mantle of degrading limestone
fragments covers the gently sloping surfaces, and limestone bedrock is exposed in the
22

San Gabriel River (background).
23

steep canyon walls and in the cutbanks of the three tributaries (Figure 7). Surface
visibility is good to excellent within the canyon due to the lack of leaf litter and grasses.
A twentieth century farm complex is located on the northeastern rim of the canyon. The
complex includes two extant barns, a cattle corral, and the collapsed remains of a third
barn. A 1962 USGS topographic map shows a house at the site. However, the house was
not evident during the survey. Site 41WM173 (a sparse lithic scatter) is reported to be
located within the complex. ACSG personnel conducted a rapid surface inspection of the
complex, but did not locate any artifacts associated with site 41WM173. The site is not
located within the ROW, and further investigation was prohibited. The farm complex
and site 41WM173 are located well outside the APE and will not be impacted by road
construction.
Immediately north of the farm complex and canyon, the APE descends into the Sowes
Branch valley. The elevation drops from 1,008 ft AMSL at the canyon rim to 910 ft
AMSL at the valley floor. The gently sloping valley floor is wooded with pecan, live
oak, elm, and scattered mesquite trees and is currently used for pasturage and hunting.
The valley walls have been disturbed by erosion and quarrying (Figure 8). A small field
immediately south of Sowes Branch appears to have been routinely plowed in the past.
The field now lays fallow and is overgrown with small mesquite trees. Surface visibility
in this portion of the APE is fair to poor due to scattered pockets of heavy vegetation.
During the survey, Sowes Branch was flowing rapidly and several springs were observed
along the periphery of the creek (Figure 8). Limestone bedrock is exposed in the
cutbanks and bed of the creek, and the banks of the creek are heavily wooded with elm,
oak, pecan, and scattered Ash juniper. Ground visibility along the creek is fair to poor
due to the heavy vegetation and leaf litter.
Section 3
The APE crosses a large, routinely plowed field north of Sowes Branch (Figure 9).
Ground visibility in the field is good due to negligible vegetation. The surface of the
field is covered with thousands of chert nodules and limestone cobbles, many of which
exhibit fire and plow damage. A large biface (Figure 9) and a modified flake were found
in the field, within the ROW. However, these artifacts are isolated finds and were not
collected. No other artifacts were located in or near the ROW. An early to middle
twentieth century house site is located at the eastern edge of the field, approximately 163
ft from the eastern edge of the ROW. The site includes a limestone chimney fall, an
artifact scatter, and two large depressions. The site could have a nineteenth century
component, but it was not evident upon surface inspection. Since the site is located
outside the APE, further investigation was prohibited.
The APE crosses a heavily wooded area north of the plowed field. The vegetation
consists primarily of Ashe juniper with scattered live oaks and tall grasses. A spring-fed
tributary of Sowes Branch bisects the APE approximately 75 m south of CR 258.

Limestone bedrock is exposed in the cutbanks of the tributary and on the surface between
the tributary and site 41WM1079 (Figures 10 and 11). Ground visibility in this portion of
the APE is poor due to heavy vegetation. Immediately north of CR 258, the ROW
crosses site 41WM1079 an early to middle twentieth century farmstead (see Recorded
Sites below).
The APE crosses a large, routinely plowed field north of site 41WM1079 (Figure 12).
The southern half of the field has poor ground visibility due to profuse grasses, but the
northern half of the field has very little ground cover. The surface visibility in this
portion of the field is approximately 45 to 50 percent. The northern half of the field also
contains several artificial terraces that follow the natural contours of the field. The soil
between the terraces is exceptionally thin, with a thin mantle of limestone pebbles and
cobbles on the surface. Occasionally, degrading bedrock outcrops on the surface. The
APE crosses site 41WM1080, a historic homestead site with a prehistoric component, at
the northern edge of the field (see Recorded Sites below).
Approximately 94 m north of site 41WM1080, the APE descends a steep bluff
overlooking the southern flood plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River (Figure
12). Many large limestone bedrock fragments are exposed along the face of the bluff,
which is heavily wooded with Ashe juniper and live oak. The elevation drops from 900
ft AMSL at the summit of the bluff to 840 ft AMSL at the valley floor. Site 41WM1084
is located at the base of the bluff (see Recorded Sites below).
The flood plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River is a large, open field with few
trees (Figure 13). At the southern edge of the flood plain, the APE crosses a small,
spring-fed tributary of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. The tributary, which
bisects the flood plain, has been dammed at its confluence with the river to form a small
stock tank. The portion of the tributary that flows through the flood plain is an
intermittent stream. Although there are few trees in the flood plain, surface visibility is
poor due to an abundance of tall grasses. The APE crosses the North Fork of the San
Gabriel River at the northwestern edge of the flood plain. The banks of the river contain
oak, elm, pecan, and hackberry. Bedrock and high-energy alluvial deposits are exposed
in the cutbanks of the river (Figure 13). Evidence of recent flooding (modern litter in the
river banks) was also observed along the river channel.
Section 4
The APE crosses a heavily wooded area on the left (northern) bank of the river. The area
contains large pecans, elm, hackberry, oaks, and scattered Ashe juniper. Ground
visibility is poor due to heavy vegetation. Approximately 120 m north of the river, the
APE crosses a large cattle pasture that is located within the flood plain of the river
(Figure 14). At the northern boundary of the pasture, the APE ascends an eroding slope
(Figure 14). The elevation within the floodplain is approximately 845 ft AMSL and rises
to 887 ft at the summit of the slope (at FM 3405). The soil along the slope is thin to nonÂ­
existent, and there are copious amounts of degrading bedrock fragments that range from
small pebble to boulder size covering the surface of the slope. Degrading limestone

Ash juniper and scattered live oaks. Ground visibility is good due to exposed bedrock
and lack of soil cover. The slope gradually levels out at FM 3405.
Newly Recorded Sites
Site 41WM1079
Description:
Site 41WM1079 is located in a wooded area adjacent to CR 258. The site is located on
gently sloping upland surface that ascends from a spring-fed tributary of Sowes Branch to
a limestone bluff overlooking the North Fork of the San Gabriel River Valley. Local
vegetation consists of large live oaks and scattered Ashe junipers. The soil at the site is
very thin with numerous, fractured bedrock outcrops. Many, subangular to angular,
limestone cobbles and stones litter the surface, and limestone boulders are concentrated
around many of the trees. Ground visibility is approximately 45 percent.
The site is approximately 4.7 acres and is comprised of four extant outbuildings, an
extant limestone chimney, and a limestone wall (Figure 16).
Feature 1
The nucleus of the site is an ashlar limestone chimney and a rectangular scatter of
foundation stones and wood debris (Figure 17). The chimney is constructed of cutlimestone blocks and a Portland cement-type mortar. The chimney hearth is lined with
fire bricks and cement. The scatter of foundation stones forms a square measuring
approximately 30 ft x 30 ft. Several tree stumps are located along the northern edge of
the scatter. The house appears to have been oriented northeast-southwest with the
chimney on the northeastern side of the building. The house scatter is located
approximately 28 ft east of the ROW.
Feature 2
Feature 2 is a small pole shed located approximately 5 ft from the western corner of the
house scatter, at the eastern edge of the ROW (Figure 17). The shed is constructed of
cedar log uprights with dimensional 2 x 4 framing and corrugated sheet metal siding and
roofing. Wire nails were used throughout. The outbuilding measures roughly 12 ft x 25
ft and is oriented northeast-southwest. The shed is currently used for farm equipment
storage.
Feature 3
Feature 3 is a similar but much larger pole shed located approximately 363 ft west of the
house remains (Figure 18). Feature 3 is approximately 10 ft x 68 ft and is oriented
northeast-southwest. The building is constructed of cedar log uprights with dimensional
2 x 4 framing and corrugated sheet metal sheathing. Wire nails were used throughout.

The eastern portion of the building has partially collapsed. The shed is currently used for
hay storage. The building is located approximately 35 ft west of the ROW, which passes
between Feature 2 and the Feature 3.
Feature 4
Feature 4 is a pole shed located south of CR 258 (Figure 18). The building is identical in
construction to the other outbuildings, except the building is sheathed with recycled
materials. The building measures approximately 13 ft x 47 ft and is oriented northeastsouthwest with an attached corral and livestock chute on the southeastern side. The
outbuilding is currently used for hay storage. The building is located approximately 53 ft
from the eastern edge of the ROW.
Feature 5
Feature 5 is an outbuilding located approximately 218 ft east of the ROW (Figure 19).
The building is a large pole barn with board-and-batten siding and corrugated sheet metal
roofing. Dimensional lumber and wire nails were used throughout. It is currently used
for hay and farm equipment storage.
Feature 6
Feature 6 is an ashlar limestone and mortar wall that measures approximately 113 ft long
x y 5.5 ft tall and is located roughly 63 ft from the eastern edge of the ROW (Figure 19).
The thickness of the wall tapers from 22 inches at the top to 35 inches at the bottom. A
linear pile of loose stones and a double row of rebar stakes parallel the extant wall,
approximately 15 ft south of the wall. The rebar stakes form the outline of what may be a
second wall that was never completed. The loose stones appear to be building materials.
The function of the extant wall is unknown, but it appears to be farm-related.
Cultural Materials Observed/Collected:
Surficial artifacts consist of clear and brown glass fragments, complete glass bottles (all
machine-made), canning jar fragments (all machine-made), milk glass fragments, molded
glass fragments (depression-era patterns), and tin cans. All artifacts observed are
twentieth century cultural materials. Four shovel tests (STâs 22-25) were executed within
the ROW at the site, and all tested negative for cultural materials. No cultural materials
were collected from the surface.
Assessment:
Site 41WM1079 appears to be an early to middle twentieth century farmstead. Nothing
that would indicate an earlier occupation was observed at the site. In fact, the majority of
the artifacts and the extant buildings imply that the site is specifically a middle twentieth
century (1930s-1950s) farmstead. The property owner, who recalls the house before it

was razed, informed ACSG personnel that the house was probably constructed in the
1920s. This construction date is based on the use of 1920s newspapers as wallpaper in
the house. The bulk of the site, including the house scatter and outbuildings, is located
outside the ROW, and shovel testing was prohibited in and around the house scatter and
outbuildings. All shovel tests conducted within the ROW tested negative for cultural
materials. The extant buildings are twentieth century constructions that lack significant
architectural characteristics or historical affiliations that would make the site potentially
eligible for nomination to the National Register or as a SAL.
Site 41WM1080
Description:
Site 41WM1080 is located in the northern portion of a routinely plowed field,
approximately 2,019 ft (615 m) north of site 41WM1079 (Figure 20). The site is defined
by a low mound that contains several very large live oak trees and a sizeable prickly pear
cactus patch. The nucleus of the site is located at the center of the mound, between a
large, sprawling live oak tree to the east and a row of very large live oak trees to the west
(Figure 21). The row of live oak trees appears to be an old fence row (barbed wire is
embedded in the trees). Scattered limestone boulders along the tree row may be the
remnants of a rock fence. The mound covers approximately one acre.
The site includes a historic and a prehistoric component. The historic component is
marked by a heavily disturbed chimney fall located at the center of the site. The fall is
marked by a low rectangular mound measuring approximately 5 ft x 5 ft (Figure 22). The
mound contains several partially buried, rectangular limestone blocks. A widely
dispersed scatter of irregular-shaped limestone blocks fans out to the southeast (Figure
22). The scatter measures approximately 20 ft (northeast-southwest) x 32 ft (northwestÂ­
southeast). All stones appear to be uncut or roughly hewn, and no mortar was evident
(Figure 23). A small pile of limestone blocks was observed approximately 30 ft north of
the chimney fall (Figure 23). Due to the pileâs close proximity to the row of live oak
trees, the feature may be the remnants of a livestock pen or fence. A cylindrical
depression containing a large, upright tree trunk is located approximately 38 ft south of
the chimney fall. The nature of the depression could not be determined due to its location
outside the ROW.
The prehistoric component consists of a sparse, surficial scatter of chert flake fragments.
The scatter measures approximately 25 m x 25 m and is located at the southern edge of
the site.
Cultural Materials Observed/Collected:
Cultural materials observed at site 41WM1080 include unidentified metal artifacts, sheet
metal fragments, three crushed galvanized wash tubs, a horse shoe, and a cooking pot
with a white enamel finish. These items were observed in an around the stone scatter.

Three shovel tests executed at the site tested positive for historic artifacts. Shovel Test 31
contained one fragment of wire, one fencing staple, and one brown glass fragment.
Shovel Test 32 contained four unidentified metal fragments, one brown glass fragment,
and one chert flake fragment. Shovel Test 33 contained two clear glass fragments and
one brown glass fragment. All artifacts were recovered at approximately 0-7 cmbs. A
sparse, surficial lithic scatter was observed at the southern boundary of the site. Shovel
Test 30, which was executed at the nucleus of the scatter, tested negative for cultural
materials. Due to the lack of diagnostic artifacts, no artifacts were collected from the
surface or subsurface.
Assessment:
Site 41WM1080 is a historic homestead with a possible nineteenth and twentieth century
occupations. The surficial artifacts suggest an early twentieth century occupation, but no
clear diagnostics were found to confirm this. The chimney fall, which has been heavily
disturbed, may be the remains of nineteenth century chimney. Jim Van Artsdalen, father
of the current property owner, showed ACSG personnel two extant limestone chimneys
elsewhere on the property (Figure 24). One is located east of the APE on a bluff
overlooking the North Fork flood plain. The second chimney is located in the flood plain
of the North Fork. Mr. Van Artsdalen suggested that the two chimneys are probably
nineteenth century features and that they are most likely associated with a stone wall that
bisects the property east-west along the limestone bluff (Figure 25). Mr. Van Artsdalenâs
wife added that their property realtor informed them that the wall was likely constructed
by two slave women. Mr. Van Artsdalen also informed ACSG personnel that the
property had at one time been referred to as âThree Chimney Ranch.â However, he was
unaware of the location of the third chimney. It is possible that the chimney fall at site
41WM1080 marks the location of the third chimney. A 1962 USGS topographic map
and a 1940 county road map of the area do not show a building at the location. This
suggests that the building was likely removed prior to 1940. Shovel tests conducted
within the APE confirmed that sparse archaeological deposits extend into the ROW.
However, the bulk of the site, i.e., chimney fall and artifact scatter, is located west of the
ROW. The site is not potentially eligible for nomination to the National Register or as a
SAL due to poor site integrity, a vague historical context, and lack of significant cultural
deposits within the ROW.
Site 41WM1084
Description:
Site 41WM1084 is a subsurface prehistoric site located at the southern edge of the North
Fork flood plain. A spring-fed tributary of the river is located approximately 100 m east
of the site, which is located in a narrow strip of trees at the base of a steep limestone
bluff. A barbed wire fence separates the wooded strip and a large open field in the flood
plain (Figure 26). Several old fence posts were observed near the toe of the bluff. This
abandoned fence row appears to have at one time marked the southern boundary of the
open field. The alignment of the original fence row would have placed the site north of
47

Figure 24. Top and Bottom-Two additional chimneys on the Van Artsdalen tract.
48

Figure 25. Top and Bottom-Rock fence north of site 41WM1080
49

the fence, in the open field. This suggests that the site has probably been disturbed by
plowing. One shovel test (ST 34) conducted at the base of the bluff tested positive for
cultural materials. Five additional shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were executed
to delimit the site boundaries. All additional subsurface tests tested negative for cultural
materials
Cultural Materials Observed/Collected:
Five pieces of chert debitage were located at 10 to 60 cmbs in ST 34, and an Early
Archaic Nolan projectile point was found in situ at 70 cmbs (Figure 26). No surficial
artifacts were collected or observed. The debitage was not collected, and the Nolan
projectile point will be returned to the property owner, as per request of the property
owner.
Assessment:
The cultural materials at site 41WM1084 appear to be colluvial remnants of a site at the
summit of the bluff. Shovel Test 34 contains no distinct anthropomorphic horizons or
stratigraphic boundaries, and the artifacts are well-dispersed throughout. The matrix
consists primarily of colluvium with common angular and subangular limestone pebbles
throughout.
To determine the site boundaries, five additional shovel tests were executed at the base of
the bluff, and two backhoe test trenches were excavated immediately north of the extant
fence. All subsurface tests tested negative for cultural materials. The likely explanation
for the presence of artifacts at the base of the bluff is that artifacts from the summit of the
bluff were redeposited with slope wash in a relic depression or drainage channel, which
was subsequently filled by colluvium from the bluff.
The face and summit of the bluff were carefully examined for artifacts and features.
None were found. Mr. Van Artsdalen informed ACSG personnel that there is a
prehistoric campsite located west of the APE, at the headwaters of a spring-fed tributary
that bisects the flood plain of the river. The site is located well outside the APE and will
not be affected by the project, but it is possible that artifacts from the site were reÂ­
deposited by erosion at the base of the bluff. In addition to the aforementioned
prehistoric campsite, site 41WM1080, which has a prehistoric component, is located at
the summit of the bluff, immediately south of the site. The artifacts may be associated
with this site. Site 41WM1084 has little research value due to the questionable context of
the artifacts recovered and the scant amount of artifacts present. No further investigation
of the site is recommended.
Historical Research Results
Sites 41WM1079 and 41WM1080 are located within the Bartholomew Manlove Survey
(Figure 27). Manlove was granted a 1st class Headright and received a patent from the
Republic of Texas government in 1845 for 4,428.40 acres in Williamson County (then
50

Figure 26. Top-Site 41WM1084 looking north across river flood plain. Bottom-Nolan
projectile point from ST 34.
51

Milam County) (Texas General Land Office 1845). Bartholomew Manlove was a
resident of Bastrop County and served as mayor of Bastrop in 1838, 1842, and 1845
(Adams 2002). No evidence could be found in the Williamson County archives
indicating Manlove or a Manlove family member ever resided on the Manlove Survey.
In 1853, Bartholomew Manlove sold 3,257 acres of the survey to Francis K. Hunt of
Lexington, Kentucky. The tract sold is described as ââ¦situated in Milam County on a
stream called the North San Gabriel River being part the land known as a headrightâ
(Deed Record 4:211). Francis K. Hunt (1817-1879) was a prominent lawyer in
Lexington and is probably best known for Loudoun, his residence in Lexington.
Loudoun is one of only five remaining castellated Gothic Revival villas left in the United
States by the architect, A. J. Davis, who was regarded as one of the premier designers of
Gothic Revival country homes in America. Francis Hunt and his wife Julia Hunt lived in
Loundoun from 1852 until his death in 1879. The house, which is listed on the National
Register, is currently the headquarters of the Lexington Art League (Lexington Art
League 2004). No record of Francis or Julia Hunt residing on the Manlove survey or in
Williamson County was found in the Williamson County archives.
There are several Hunts who lived on and near the Manlove Survey during the nineteenth
century. Two prominent features near the project area are Hunt Cemetery, which is
located on the south bank of the river, east of the APE, Hunt Crossing, and Hunt Hollow,
both of which are located east of the cemetery. According to Clara Stearns Scarbrough
(1973:431), Hunt Crossing was named for Hayden Hunt and several of his brothers, who
settled in the area in the 1850s. Mart Hunt, one of Haydenâs brothers, operated a gin and
cotton mill on the north bluff of the river. The Unites States Army Corps of Engineers
reports that the ruins of the Hunt cabin are still visible on a hill overlooking the river near
the cemetery (USACE 2004). W. V. Hunt, G. F. Hunt, and G. F. Huntâs wife, Effie Hunt,
owned 208 acres of the Manlove Survey in the 1890s (see below). It is unclear whether
these Hunts are related to F. K. Hunt.
Upon Francis Huntâs death in 1879, his wife Julia, their daughter, and son-in-law
inherited his estate (Deed Record 27:228). In 1882, Julia Hunt sold 1,250 acres of the B.
Manlove Survey to G. G. Anderson, who declared a homestead on 200 acres of the
property in 1885 (Deed Record 37:460). His homestead is most likely north of the river,
near Anderson Cemetery and Anderson Branch.
J. A. Montgomery and J. L. Rucker, known as the Firm of Rucker and Montomery,
purchased Andersonâs promissory notes and subsequently declared them due. When
Anderson failed to pay them, Rucker and Montgomery foreclosed on his property in 1885
(Deed Record 38:162). The foreclosed property includes three tracts on and near the
North Fork of the San Gabriel River. Two of the tracts, a 750-acre tract and a 3,000-acre
tract, are located on the B. Manlove Survey. The third tract, totaling 1,885 acres, is
located on the Dyches Survey, adjacent to the B. Manlove Survey.

52

location of ROW.
53

Rucker and Montgomery proceeded to sell portions of the foreclosed property. In 1886
and 1887, John P. Singleton bought a 442-acre tract (Deed Record 41:319) and a 110.8acre tract (Deed Record 44:255) on the B. Manlove Survey. E. J. Duckett bought 135
acres on the B. Manlove Survey from Rucker and Montgomery in 1889 (Deed Record
51:125). John P. Singleton, who was married to Mallie J. Hunt, is buried in Hunt
Cemetery. According to Scarbrough (1973:431), Singleton was an early settler in the
area along with G. G. Anderson and the Hunt family.
When Singleton failed to pay his promissory notes, 332 acres of his property was reconveyed to Rucker and Montgomery in 1889 (Deed Record 51:21). In 1890, D. S.
Chesser, a business associate of Rucker and Montgomery, bought the 332-acre, Singleton
tract (Deed Record 56:54).
In 1892, W. J. Montgomery, who may be associated with Rucker and Montgomery, sold
88 acres of the Manlove Survey to T. L. Dycus (Deed Record 71:36) and 121 acres to E.
J. Duckett (Deed Record 61:383). Later in 1893, W. J. Montgomery bought âall of the B.
Manlove Surveyâ from Rucker and Montgomery (Deed Record 62:483). This purchase
included 1,800 acres, save and except for 182 acres that belonged to Henry Hunt, 157.5
acres that belonged to A. H. Watts, 110.8 acres that belonged to John P. Singleton, 633
acres that belonged to M. A. Hunt, and 332 acres that D. S. Chesser purchased in 1890
(Deed Record 56:54). According to the deed records, Rucker and Montgomery sold the
1,800 acres to pay a portion of a $4,624 note that was owed.
In 1893, T. L. Dycus bought 350 acres from W. J. Montgomery (Deed Record 71:483).
T. L. Dycus is buried in Anderson Cemetery, which is located north of the river, at the
mouth of Anderson Branch. A creek that is south of the river and west of the project area
bares the name Dycus Branch.
W. V. Hunt bought 117 acres from E. J. Duckett in 1895 (Deed Record 69:413). In that
same year, a mechanics lien was placed on the property by Leavell and Sharpe
Lumberyard of Georgetown for the cost of materials that were purchased for the
construction of a residence by Hunt (Mechanics Lien Record 2:521). This may be one of
the three, nineteenth century house sites located on the Van Artsdalen property.
However, due to the lack of diagnostics recovered from site 41WM1080 and the location
of the other sites outside the ROW, no chronological link could be found.
In 1897, W. J. Montgomery bought 88 acres from T. L. Dycus (Deed Record 86:328).
The following year (1898), W. J. Montgomery sold 90 acres to G. F. Hunt, a relative of
W. V. Hunt (Deed Record 87:214). The tract that is involved in the two transactions may
be the same.
In 1905, C. Campbell of Bell County released Effie Hunt, the wife of G. F. Hunt, from
the mechanics lien on the 117-acre tract, and in 1906, A. N. W. Smith bought 208 acres
(117-acre tract + 90-acre tract) from G. F. Hunt (Deed Record 121:191). The following
year (1907), A. N. W. Smith sold the 208-acre tract to A. S. Maness (Deed Record
127:72). Maness then sold the property to George W. McDaniel in 1909 (Deed Record
54

134:244). McDaniel sold the 208-acre tract to M. H. Barrington in 1914 (Deed Record
172:126).
In 1920, W. E. Creel bought the 208-acre tract from Barrington (Deed Record 198:367).
Creel owned the tract until 1957, when he sold a portion of it to Roscoe H. Canon (Deed
Record 419:667). By this time, Creelâs property was composed of a 90-acre tract that
was the east and lower part of the 208-acre tract and a 30 ft. x 990 ft. tract that was also
part of the 208-acre tract. Sometime between 1920 and 1950, Creel sold 121 acres of the
208-acre tract to Carl C. Hardin. However no record of the transaction was found. Site
41WM1079 may be the location of Creelâs house. According to James Van Artsdalen
(personal communication 2003) the house at site 41WM1079 is contemporaneous with
Creelâs ownership (i.e., post-1920).
In 1951, Roscoe Canon bought three tracts on the B. Manlove Survey from Carl C.
Hardin Jr. (Deed Record 371:196). The three tracts include a 121-acre tract that is the
western part of the 208-acre tract discussed above, a 135-acre tract that was described in
an early deed from J. M. Perry to John P. Singleton dated November 10, 1906 (Deed
Record 121:235), and a 110-acre tract that was described in a deed from Rucker and
Montgomery to John P. Singleton dated June 23, 1887 (Deed Record 81:273).
In 1957, Roscoe Canon bought the remaining portion of Creelâs 208-acre tract (Deed
Record 419:667). This includes a 90-acre tract that is the east and lower portion of the
208-acre tract and the 30 ft. x 990 ft. tract that is also part of the original 208-acre tract.
James B. Casey and David Perkins bought Roscoe Canonâs property, which included the
two Creel tracts and the three Hardin tracts, in 1966 (Deed Record 484:171). In 1967,
Spinks Edwards bought the property from Casey and Perkins (Deed Record 504:432),
and in 1983, Spinks Edwardsâ widow, Olga, sold 338.62 acres of the property to J. Tim
Brown (Deed Record 952:464). Brown sold the property to the current land owner,
James Van Artsdalen in 1999 (deed available electronically).
The historical research suggests that the site 41WM1079 may be associated with W. E.
Creel or Carl J. Hardin, who both owned portions of Van Artsdalenâs property between
1920 and the early 1950s. According to James Van Artsdalen, the house at site
41WM1079 was constructed in the 1920s, making the site contemporaneous with Creel
and Hardinâs ownership. The house is present on a 1940 County road map (Figure 28).
The nineteenth century site, 41WM1080, could be associated with John P. Singleton, G.
F. Hunt, or an as yet unidentified owner or tenant. The lack of diagnostics within the
ROW hampered attempts to establish a site chronology, and due to budget and time
constraints, archival research was limited. Two nineteenth century house sites located
near the ROW further complicate efforts to identify the occupant(s) of the site. The two
extant chimneys on the Van Artsdalen property (not in the ROW) are nearly identical and
appear to be contemporaneous. Identifying the occupant of each site is unlikely without
sufficient diagnostic artifacts and more intensive archival research.

Shovel Testing and Backhoe Trenching Results
Shovel Test Results (See Appendix 1)
Because the majority of the APE contains exposed bedrock, thin soils, and routinely
plowed fields, shovel tests were conducted at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.
In this case, shovel tests were executed wherever the soils or sediments appeared to
exceed 10 cm in depth and were relatively undisturbed (Figure 29).
Since the archaeological survey was first initiated in November 2002, some sections of
the proposed road alignment have been changed. Consequently, the altered portions were
resurveyed and additional shovel tests were conducted. The most significant alignment
change took place in Section 1, immediately north of SH 29. Both the original alignment
and revised alignment are located within a field heavily disturbed by agricultural
activities. Because of the heavily disturbed nature of the field, no additional shovel tests
were conducted. A second, significant alignment change occurred between the deep
canyon in Section 2 (south of Sowes Branch) and CR 258 in Section 3. This alignment
change was of great concern because several previously recorded archaeological sites are
located near the APE. The new alignment was resurveyed and additional shovel tests
were conducted to confirm that the APE did not encroach upon the previously recorded
sites and that no new sites were located in the ROW. The change in alignment is
reflected in Figure 29, which shows shovel tests located outside the defined APE. These
outlying shovel tests are included in this report and in Appendix 1.
Shovel test results confirmed that the southern portion of the project area (i.e., area south
of the North Fork flood plain) contains Eckrant-Georgetown association soils, which are
described as âvery shallow to moderately deep, calcareous and noncalcareous, stony,
cobbly, and loamy soils formed in indurated fractured limestone; on uplandsâ (USDA,
SCS 1983). The northern portion of the project area (i.e., area north of the North Fork
flood plain) contains Denton-Ekrant-Doss association soils, which are described as
âmoderately deep, shallow and very shallow, calcareous, clayey and stony soils formed in
indurated fractured limestone; on uplandsâ (USDA, SCS 1983). Shovel test and backhoe
trench test results confirmed the presence of Oakalla-Sunev association soils in the flood
plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. These soils are described as âdeep,
calcareous, loamy soils formed in alluvium; on bottom lands and stream terracesâ
(USDA, SCS 1983).
The soils within the majority of the APE are generally stable to erosional and are not
conducive to preserving archaeological sites. Sites within the APE are likely to be
surficial, and components would be compressed within a few centimeters of the surface
or mixed and resting on the surface. Only structured sites, like prehistoric burned rock
middens, surficial lithic scatters, or historic homesteads, would likely be encountered in
these settings. Any sites of this nature would have been most likely disturbed by contour
plowing, grazing, or brush fires.

57

Figure 29. USGS Topographic map showing ROW and shovel test locations.

Whenever an archaeological site was located, a single shovel test was executed to
characterize the subsurface deposits. The number of shovel tests conducted at each site
was limited due to the surficial nature of the sites and the good surface visibility at each
site (>30 percent), which aided the identification of the sites and the delineation of the
site boundaries.
Section 1
Shovel Tests 2-9, 18, 21, and 55-56 are located in Section 1 of the APE. Shovel Tests 8
and 21 are located in a fallow field south of SH 29, between SH 29 and CR 268. Shovel
Test 8 contains dark brownish-black clay with many subangular limestone pebbles at 0Â­
43 cmbs. Shovel Test 21 is located south of ST 8, near CR 268. The shovel test contains
dark brownish-black silty clay with many subangular limestone and chert cobbles at 0-30
cmbs. The matrix becomes redder at 30 cmbs. Shovel Tests 2-7 were executed in a
large, intensely plowed corn field, north of SH 29. The shovel tests contain a
homogenous zone of dark brown to brownish-black clay with subangular to angular,
pebble to cobble-size, limestone and chert fragments. The upper 15-30 cm is a plow
zone. The maximum depth of the shovel tests is 50-60 cmbs. Shovel Test 9 is located
immediately north of SH 29, between SH 29 and the plowed corn field. The shovel test
profile is identical to STâs 2-7. Shovel Test 18 (Figure 30) is located on the south bank
of the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River. The shovel test contains dark brownishblack silty clay at 0-30 cmbs overlying reddish-brown cobbly clay at 30-38 cmbs. The
matrix at 30-38 cmbs is approximately 90 percent subangular limestone cobbles. Shovel
Tests 55 and 56 (Figure 30) were conducted between the large plowed corn field and the
Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River. They contain dark brownish-black cobbly clay at
0-18 cmbs overlying grayish brown clay at 18-43 cmbs. The lower level contains
reddish-brown mottling and the upper 14-18 cmbs is a plow zone. All shovel tests in
Section 1 tested negative for archaeological deposits.
Section 2
Shovel Tests 1, 10-12, 16-17, 19-20, and 35-41 were excavated in Section 2 of the APE.
Shovel Tests 1, 16-17, 39 (Figure 31), and 40 were conducted at the base of an eroding
slope that descends into the Sowes Branch valley. The shovel tests contain dark brown
pebbly clay loam underlain by light brown sandy clay. The matrix contains subangular
pebbles and cobbles throughout. Hard bedrock was exposed at approximately 25 cmbs in
ST 1. Shovel Tests 10 and 12 were executed within the Sowes Branch valley, east of the
APE (within the old alignment). Shovel Test 10 contains highly humic, dark brown
sandy clay loam overlying hard bedrock at 26 cmbs. Shovel Test 12 was executed on the
south bank of Sowes Branch. The shovel test contains dark brown sandy clay that
becomes lighter brown with depth and common subangular limestone fragments. The
maximum depth of ST 12 is 50 cmbs. Shovel Test 41 (Figure 31) was conducted in the
southern flood plain of Sowes Branch. The shovel tests contains a plow zone of dark
brown silty clay at 0-18 cmbs underlain by mottled dark brown and olive clay with few
angular pebbles. At 38-49 cmbs, the matrix is dark olive with some brown mottling, and

Shovel Tests 11, 19-20, 35 (Figure 32), 36, and 37 were conducted in the uplands
between the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River and a deep canyon on the southern rim
of the Sowes Branch valley. This portion of Section 2 consists of fallow fields
overgrown with mesquite and young live oak trees. The area is currently used for
pasturage. The shovel tests generally contain dark brown silty clay loam with many
subangular to subrounded, pebble to cobble-size, chert nodules and isolated limestone
fragments. The matrix becomes darker and more clayey and contains fewer chert nodules
with depth. In some instances, the matrix is grayish-brown. The maximum depth of
these shovel tests is approximately 40-50 cmbs. The upper 15 cm appears to be a plow
zone. Shovel Test 38 (Figure 32) was executed in the floor of the deep canyon formed by
the confluence of three tributaries of Sowes Branch. The shovel test contains dark
grayish brown silty clay loam to a depth of 15 cmbs, at which point degrading bedrock
was exposed.
Section 3
Shovel Tests 13-15, 22-34, and 42-47 were executed in Section 3 of the APE. Shovel
Tests 13-15 were conducted at the eastern border of a routinely plowed field that is
located north of Sowes Branch. Shovel Tests 43 and 44 (Figure 33) were conducted in
the center of the same plowed field. The shovel tests contain brown silty clay and
mottled red and brown silty clay with chert and limestone cobbles increasing in number
with depth. The upper 18-20 cm in each shovel test is a plow zone. Two isolated
prehistoric artifacts (a large biface and a worked flake) were found near STâs 43 and 44;
however, no artifacts were found in the shovel tests. Shovel Test 42 (Figure 33) was
executed on the northern bank of Sowes Branch. The shovel test contains reddish-brown,
extremely cobbly clay with degrading bedrock at 20 cmbs.
Shovel Tests 45-47 were conducted in a wooded zone between the plowed field and CR
258. Shovel Test 45 was excavated immediately north of the plowed field. The shovel
test contains brown silty clay, which becomes siltier and redder in color with depth.
Degrading bedrock was exposed at 30 cmbs. Shovel Test 46 (Figure 34) was conducted
on the southern bank of an ephemeral tributary of Sowes Branch. The shovel test
contains dark brown silty clay grading to dark olive with depth. Angular limestone
pebbles and limestone flecks were observed at 50 cmbs. Shovel Test 47 (Figure 34) was
conducted immediately south of CR 258. The shovel test contains dark brown silty clay
to a depth of 12 cmbs, at which point fractured bedrock was exposed. Charcoal was
observed at 10 cmbs. However, burned wood on the surface suggests that the charcoal is
the byproduct of past brushfires. No artifacts were found in or near ST 47.
Shovel Tests 22 (Figure 35), 24 (Figure 35), 25, and 26 were executed at site
41WM1079. The shovel tests contain a thin layer of brown to reddish brown silty clay
and subangular to subrounded chert nodules underlain by degrading, chalky bedrock. All
shovel test results were negative for artifacts.
Shovel Test 23 was conducted in the flood plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel
River. The shovel test contains reddish-brown, silty-sandy clay loam (all alluvium) to a

depth of 95 cmbs. Common rounded limestone pebbles were observed in the lower
portion of the shovel test.
Shovel Tests 27-29 were excavated in a plowed field between sites 41WM1079 and
41WM1080. Shovel Test 27 contains mottled red and brown clay to a depth of 50 cmbs.
The upper 23 cm is a plow zone. Shovel Tests 28 and 29 (Figure 36) contain light
reddish brown and light brown silty clay loam with many limestone flecks and angular
limestone fragments throughout. Degrading, chalky limestone bedrock exposed between
10 and 19 cmbs.
Shovel Tests 30-33 were executed at site 41WM1080. Shovel Test 30 (Figure 37) was
conducted at the southern boundary of the site, within a lithic scatter that marks a
prehistoric component of the site. The shovel test contains dark brown clay at 0-22 cmbs
underlain by mottled dark brown and reddish-brown clay. At 40-50 cmbs, the shovel test
contains many limestone flecks and few subangular limestone pebbles. No artifacts were
found in ST 30. Shovel Tests 31-33 were conducted along the western edge of the ROW
on the mound containing the historic component of site 41WM1080. The shovel test
profiles revealed dark brown silty clay at approximately 0-8 cmbs. Degrading limestone
bedrock was encountered at approximately 8-20 cmbs. Shovel Test 31 contained one
metal wire fragment, one fencing staple, and one amber glass fragment at 0-7 cmbs.
Shovel Test 32 (Figure 37) contained four unidentified metal fragments, one chert flake
fragment, and one heavily patinated amber glass fragment at 0-6 cmbs. Shovel Test 33
contained two clear glass fragments and one amber glass fragment at 0-8 cmbs. None of
the artifacts were collected.
Shovel Tests 34 and 57-61 were executed at site 41WM1084, which is located at the base
of the limestone bluff overlooking the North Fork flood plain. Shovel Test 34 (Figure
38) contains homogenous brown silty clay loam and few angular limestone pebbles.
Roots and Rabdotus snail shells were observed throughout. At 70-80 cmbs, the matrix
contains common, angular to subangular, limestone pebbles and few cobbles (colluvium).
This shovel test tested positive for prehistoric artifacts. Five pieces of chert debitage
were found at 10-60 cmbs and a nearly complete Nolan projectile point was found at 70
cmbs. No artifacts were found at 70-80 cmbs. Because of poor surface visibility, five
additional shovel tests and two backhoe trench tests were executed within the ROW at
this location to delimit site boundaries and characterize the deposits. However, all shovel
test and backhoe trench tests results (See below: Backhoe Trench Test Results) were
negative for cultural materials. Shovel Tests 57 and 59-61 contain grayish-brown silty
clay loam grading to brown silty-sandy clay loam. The shovel tests also contain common
angular limestone pebbles throughout. Shovel Test 58, which was executed close to the
bluff, contains many, pebble to boulder-size, angular limestone fragments (colluvium) in
a grayish brown silty-sandy matrix. The maximum depth of ST 58 is approximately 30
cmbs.

Section 4
Shovel Tests 48-54 were executed in Section 4, the section between the North Fork and
FM 3405. Shovel Tests 48-50 were executed in wooded zone between the river and a
large cattle pasture north of the river. The Shovel Tests 48 (Figure 38) and 50 contain
grayish brown silty clay loam that grades to brown silty loam. Both shovel tests contain
few to common stream-rolled pebbles. Shovel Test 49 was executed in a clearing at the
western edge of the ROW. This shovel test contains a highly disturbed layer of brown
silty clay loam with few stream-rolled pebbles and much ash and charcoal. At 30 cmbs,
the shovel test contains many stream-rolled pebbles (approximately 90-95 percent
pebbles) in a light brown/reddish-brown sandy matrix.
Shovel Test 51 (Figure 39) was conducted at the northern edge of the cattle pasture and
flood plain, at the toe of an eroding slope. The shovel test contains a plow zone in the
upper 18 cm. Below the plow zone, the shovel test contains brown silty clay loam that
becomes lighter brown and siltier with depth. The number of angular limestone pebbles
also increases with depth. The maximum depth of ST 51 is approximately 51 cmbs.
Shovel Tests 52 (Figure 39), 53, and 54 were executed in the upland area between the
North Fork flood plain and FM 3405. The shovel tests contain reddish-brown cobbly
clay and brown silty clay overlying degrading bedrock. The maximum depth of the
shovel tests is approximately 32 cmbs to bedrock.
Backhoe Trench Test Results (See Appendix 2)
Shovel test results confirmed the presence of deep alluvial deposits (>1 m deep) within
the flood plain of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. A total of nineteen backhoe
trenches were excavated in the northern and southern flood plains of the river. The
backhoe trench profiles revealed Sunev silty clay loam on 1 to 3 percent slopes (SuB).
The USDA, SCS (1983) describes a typical SuB soil profile as having an A horizon of
dark grayish brown silty clay loam about 18 inches thick, a B horizon of light yellowish
brown silty clay loam about 52 inches thick, and a Cca horizon of reddish yellow silty
clay loam that extends to 60 inches. The Cca horizon has many soft masses and calcium
carbonate concretions and is underlain by mixed sand and gravel. The USDA, SCS
profile is representative of the backhoe trench test profiles (Figures 40-44). All backhoe
trenches tested negative for archaeological deposits, and the results are included in
Appendix 2: Summary Results of Formal Backhoe Trench Tests.
The pedestrian survey and shovel test results revealed poor depositional environments at
Sowes Branch, the Middle Fork of the San Gabriel River, and the minor tributaries of
Sowes Branch and the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. Stream terrace development
and the preservation of archaeological deposits at these locations were impeded by
erosion. No alluvial deposits deeper than 1 m were found. Backhoe trenching was not
performed at these locations during the archaeological survey due to the shallow deposits.

CONCLUSIONS
Within the APE, a thorough intensive survey has been completed. Results of a careful
100% pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trench testing indicate that there is
no significant cultural resource within the ROW of the proposed Parmer Lane Extension
between SH 29 to FM 3405. Because the majority of the APE contains exposed bedrock,
thin, degrading soils, and routinely plowed fields, shovel tests were conducted at the
discretion of the Principal Investigator. In this case, shovel tests were executed wherever
the soils or sediments appeared to exceed 10 cm in depth or were relatively undisturbed.
A total of 61 shovel tests were conducted within the APE. Four of the shovel tests tested
positive for cultural materials. Three of the shovel tests (STâs 31, 32, and 33)
wereexcavated at site 41WM1080, and one (ST 34) was excavated at site 41WM1084.
Nineteen backhoe trench tests were excavated in the northern and southern flood plains
of the North Fork of the San Gabriel River. All tested negative for cultural materials. No
backhoe trench tests were excavated near Sowes Branch, the Middle Fork of the San
Gabriel River, or the ephemeral tributaries of Sowes Branch and the North Fork of the
San Gabriel River due to the lack of significant alluvial deposits (all <1 m).
Only one artifact was collected during the survey. The artifact is a Nolan projectile point
that was found in ST 34 at site 41WM084. The land owner requested that the artifact be
returned to his possession following the survey and the preparation of the final report.
Three sites were found to exist within the APE: 41WM1079 (an early to middle twentieth
century farmstead), 41WM1080 (a historic homestead of unknown occupancy), and
41WM1084 (a buried prehistoric lithic scatter).
A single shovel test conducted at sites 41WM1079 and 41WM1080 confirmed that the
sites are located on stable to erosional soils, which are not conducive to preserving
archaeological sites. The sites are surficial, and components are compressed within a few
centimeters of the surface or mixed and resting on the surface. Good ground visibility
(>30 percent) aided the identification of the sites and the delineation of the site
boundaries.
Site 41WM1079 is an early to middle twentieth century homestead site. The site consists
of four outbuildings, a limestone chimney, and a sparse artifact scatter. Four shovel tests
were executed in the ROW, and all tested negative for cultural materials Due to the
siteâs twentieth century affiliations, poor structural integrity, and lack of significant
cultural materials within the ROW, site 41WM1079 is not eligible for nomination to the
National Register or as a SAL and is not a significant archaeological site.
Site 41WM1080 is a historic homestead of unknown occupancy and a prehistoric lithic
scatter. It consists of a chimney fall and artifact scatter located at the northern edge of a
plowed field. Shovel Tests 30-33 were executed in the ROW at the site. All but shovel
test 30 tested positive for cultural materials. The artifacts uncovered in the shovel tests
78

include glass fragments, unidentified metal fragments, and a single fencing staple. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed or collected. Because the nucleus of the site (the
artifact scatter and chimney fall) is located outside of the ROW, shovel testing in this area
was prohibited.
Because of the historic componentâs poor integrity, lack of clear diagnostic artifacts, and
ambiguous historical affiliations, site 41WM1080 is not potentially eligible for
nomination to the NRHP or as a SAL.
The prehistoric component of site 41WM1080 is a sparse, surficial lithic scatter that has
been heavily disturbed by plowing. Shovel Test 31 was executed at the center of the
scatter, but tested negative for cultural materials. Shovel Test 32, which was executed in
the historic component, contained a chert flake fragment. The flake fragment was
uncovered at 0-7 cmbs, along with a glass fragment and four unidentified metal
fragments. Due to the heavily disturbed nature of the component and the lack of
diagnostic artifacts, the prehistoric component has very little research value.
Shovel Test 34 was conducted at site 41WM1084 and confirmed that cultural deposits are
located at 10-70 cmbs. The deposits appear to be the colluvial remnants of a site that
may have existed or exists at the summit of the bluff. One Early Archaic Nolan projectile
point was located at 70 cmbs. No other diagnostic artifacts were uncovered. Two
backhoe trench tests were excavated Â±20 m north of ST 34. The trenches tested negative
for cultural materials. Because of the possibility of damaging trees, the property owner
prohibited further backhoe trench testing near ST 34. Five additional shovel tests (STâs
59-61) were executed at the base of the bluff to delimit site boundaries. All tested
negative for cultural materials. The Nolan projectile point that was collected from ST 34
will be returned to the property owner. No other artifacts were collected.
Due to the questionable context of the artifacts recovered and the lack of significant
cultural deposits, site 41WM1084 is not potentially eligible for nomination to the NRHP
or as a SAL and does not warrant further investigation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No further work is warranted. It is ACSGâs recommendation that the construction of the
Parmer Lane Extension between SH 29 and FM 3405 be allowed to begin without delay
at this time. ACSG seeks concurrence for the following in regard to the project:
6) No historic properties listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places will be impacted by the proposed project
7) No archaeological deposits designated or eligible for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark will be impacted by the proposed project
8) No further archaeological work is required
9) No further consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer is required.
10) The project may proceed to construction in the project area.
79

If any cultural remains are encountered during construction, all work should cease, and
an ACSG professional archaeologist should be called to assess the site. If the site is
assessed to be significant, further consultation with the THC should be pursued.
