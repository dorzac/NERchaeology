Corbis. The producer, Dave Carter made the
video and is promoting it to entities such as
the History Channel, Discovery Channel,
Travel Channel and Spike.
Also on the agenda will be discussions and planning for the November field
trip to the Guadalupe Mountains National

What I’ve Learned From
Flint Knapping
By Tom Ashmore

It should actually be called chert
knapping, but flint knapping is the accepted term. I decided to try my hand at it
some months ago to see just how difficult
it was and hopefully get some insight into
the what, how, and why when I examine
various points and tools. So I am by no
means an expert, but I thought my insights
might be interesting to those who have not
tried this hobby but see pieces regularly
and wonder about the process of making
them. What I learned was that the Indians
must have always had aching hands – their
equivalent of carpal tunnel. Knapping out
these points is really hard on your hands!
After working for a few days I need to
take time off to let the muscles recover
from the stress.
I decided to work only with primitive tools. So I only use limestone and
deer antler. It is truly amazing how these
two abundant resources work so well on
chert. For the hammer stones you need
both softcontinued on page 2

…….. limestone and harder stones for various
kinds of work. The hard stones can actually be
chert with the outer limestone cortex left in
place. Each will attack the stone differently.
You also need a variety of stone shapes. Some
are large and round for the initial breaking
through the stone cortex and getting to the inner chert and some are more elongated billets
to strike the edges. The deer antler is used after your get the stone worked down to a thin
piece and need to start creating the final shape
and edges. It’s called pressure flaking and
that’s the part that is hard on the hands. You
need to press down on the edge with quite a bit
of force to pop the chert flakes from opposite
side of the stone. After working an edge it
needs to be flipped over to work the other side
to get even edges in both sides.
One thing I believe may be the case is
that the different designs of points may have as
much to do with the type of chert used from the
local area as anything else. There are actually
hundreds of types of chert and all have different qualities. Most are not even named; they
are usually referenced by their coloration (i.e.
brown mottled, blue or black). The most valued chert is the kind found in this area – Edwards Plateau Chert. That is because it is one
of the only kinds of chert that can be knapped
without first being heat treated, although heat
treating makes it even better. It is found in an
area that is bounded in a kind of egg shape that
reaches from Abilene to San Antonio and it is
usually a flat gray color. Each type of →

→chert has different knapping qualities.
Some break off flakes that are naturally
very thin and easy to work but some are
harder to thin out. Each time I make a point
I don’t know what it will be when I start because I’m working different types of chert
and the starting pieces are obviously different shapes to start with. The starting size,
shapes, thickness, etc. dictate just how it is
going to turn out. This may not be the case
for the experts, but it certainly dictates it for
me at this point. I found that the base
should be worked as much as possible early
on. The thickness of the base will determine whether or not you can have a long
traditional stem or not and the types of
barbs you will have. Sometimes rather than
a stem you must make a basal concave
shape and come in from the sides to make
indentations to be used for the wrapping of
the sinew to attach to the shaft. Making the
sharp, pointed end is the easy part. Making
a good base to attach to the shaft to is the
hard part.
And the great benefit of all this will
be the kids because all the pieces I’ve been
practicing on will go to the October CVAS
Archeology Fair. They will be in the dirt
for the kids to find in the sifting booth.

An Invitation to the 2008 TAS
Annual Meeting
The Texas Archeological Society’s
79th Annual Meeting will be held in
Lubbock, Texas, October 24–26,
2008. All TAS members are invited
to attend the meetings, and, for the
second year, non-TAS members can
attend the sessions and/or the banquet at a slightly higher fee than
members. In a sense, having the
meetings in Lubbock is a sort of
homecoming for the TAS; many of
the pioneers in Texas archeology and
early members of the TAS worked in
the Panhandle.
The theme of
“pioneers of Texas archeology and
Panhandle archeology” will be carried
into the public forum, banquet, session, and excursions. We’ve got a
fun and busy weekend planned, so
start making your plans to attend early.

The conference hotel is the Holiday Inn Park Plaza, conveniently located
on Loop 289 on the south side of
town. Some of you will remember this
as the site of the 1994 TAS and Plains
conference. Just this year, the hotel
completed an extensive renovation, so
you may not recognize the place. We
recommend that you contact the hotel
early to reserve a room (single or double) at the conference rate of $89.00,
plus tax. There is a small block of student rooms at the same rate for up to
four people per room.
Registration fee is $50 for members, and $70 for non members. Studentfees are $25 and $35. These fees will increase $10 after October 3. For more information the about the Annual Meeting
and a registration form, contact the
Texas Archeological Society.

Annual Picnic Great Success
Sue Meacham
We had a great Picnic this year and it was
attended very well. The food was great and all
who brought food thank you very much for your
help in making the picnic a success! Thanks to
all the folks who set up the tables as well as
took them down. Brownie Roberts, Arnetta
Cooper, and Christine Buckstead’s program on
Alabates Flint Quarry was wonderful. Thanks
for all those who brought gifts for door prizes,
especially Felton Cochran of Cactus Books.
Thanks for staying late for the entertainment.
Music provided by the Riemenschneiders.
Voices provide by all of you. That was some
kinda of FUN!

The Concho Valley Archeological Society is a non
profit organization. Meetings are held on the fourth
Thursday of every month except July, November and
December. We meet in the commissary building located at Ft. Concho, at 7 PM. Refreshments are offered. Dues are $15 for singles, and $20 for families.
