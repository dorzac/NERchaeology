The Archeo!ogy of Southeast Texas
Leland W. Patterson

ABSTRACT
The archeology of Southeast Texas is becoming increasingly better known with a rapid accumulation of data
in the last 20 years. Evidence for human habitation of this region covers an interval of about 11,000 to 12,000
years. A broad-based hunting and gathering lifeway was practiced up to approximately A.D. 1800. Archeological data from Southeast Texas are especially valuable for the study of hunter-gatherer adaptations to a variety
of ecological settings. While the partial nature of the archeological record precludes complete reconstruction of
prehistoric lifeways, regional syntheses can still be made with significant detail.

INTRODUCTION
Much of the nature of the archeological record
in Southeast Texas has been determined by the
region being an interface between the Southern
Plains and Southeast Woodlands. Technological
characteristics in Southeast Texas archeological assemblages seem to have been influenced by traditions from adjacent regions. The effects of
migrations of peoples and diffusion of technology
must be considered here, as well as local innovation. There are also occasional examples of longdistance trade, especially during the Late Archaic
period. Throughout this paper, distinctions are made
between the inland and coastal margin subregions
of Southeast Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland subregion
has a much longer ctu-onological record. Aten (1983)
has detailed many of the aspects of the archeology
of the coastal margin subregion. Story (1990) has
included Southeast Texas in her detailed overview
of the archeology of the Gulf coastal plain, from
the coastline to Arkansas and eastern Texas.
Archeological data of Southeast Texas are now
well-organized. There is a continuing bibliographic
series (Patterson 1992a), and there are computerized data bases for published sites of the inland and
coastal margins subregions (Patterson 1989a,
1989b). A quantitative summary of the inland subregion data base has been published (Patterson
1993a). A detailed synthesis of Southeast Texas for
all geographic areas and time periods is being developed by the author. Southeast Texas has a large

number of published site surface collections and
excavated sites.
This paper considers the usual research topics
that are applied to hunter-gatherers with a nomadic
lifeway, such as subsistence patterns, mobilitysettlement patterns, social organization, and technologica! traditions. The basic pattern of lifeways
of conservative hunter-gatherers is characterized by
generally slow change in artifact styles, only a few
changes in basic technologies, and long continuities of subsistence and mobility-settlement patterns.
GEOGRAPHIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL
SETTING
For this paper, Southeast Texas is defined as a
21 county area (Table 1). This regional definition
includes data for an area from the Colorado River
on the west to the Sabine River on the east, for
about 200 km inland from the Gulf coastline. Previous studies have shown that it is especially important to consider together the archeology of Fort
Bend and Austin counties, with the eastern part of
Wharton County, as it seems to be an area where
much mixing of technologies occurred, and it has a
distinctive Late Archaic mortuary tradition.
The coastal margin of Southeast Texas is a
zone about 25 km inland from the coast. It covers
the area of influence of Gulf tidal flows on the
salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. There is considerable variation in the ecology of this subregion,
including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier islands off the

coastline. The inland subregion of Southeast Texas
also has significant ecological variation, including
mixed woodlands, coastal prairies and dense piney
woods. Even the piney woods habitat is not uniform, being dissected by oak-pine zones along major rivers (Figure 1). Dense piney woods occur in
the northeastern part of this region. This band of
piney woods extends over most of the eastern Gulf
Coastal Plain (Larsen 1980:35) as a distinct ecological zone with a low productivity of food resources. The western part of Southeast Texas is
well-known for nut trees, such as pecan. This part
of the region seems to have had a high productivity

of food resources. Principal vegetation zones of
Southeast Texas are shown in Figure 1.
There are distinct adaptive and cultural patterns
for the inland and coastal margin subregions, as
characterized by differences in subsistence patterns,
settlement patterns, and artifact types. Most coastal
margin sites are brackish water Rangia cuneata
shell middens, with some oyster shell middens found
on the coastline in a saltwater marine environment.
The general Galveston Bay area is especially wellknown for Rangia shell middens. Most inland sites
are sandy middens located near water sources, with
some freshwater mussel shell middens found mainly
in the western part of the region.
There are few data available concerning
paleoclimates in Southeast Texas. Although periodic variations in average rainfall and temperature
have occurred throughout the Holocene period, after 11,000 years B.P., there is little evidence for
significant changes in floral and faunal communities during this time period. Faunal remains indicate
that subsistence patterns appear to have been similar
throughout the Holocene period. Some dry periods
may be indicated by caliche (carbonate) deposits
(Aten 1983:134). However, the presence of caliche
at stratified sites is difficult to relate to climatic
conditions because caliche occurs at different time
periods at different sites in Southeast Texas, and
many archeological sites in the region have no caliche at any time period. Pollen which would provide
data on climatic change is generally not preserved at
sites in this region.
While there seems to be much changing of
river channels near the coast (Aten 1983:Chapter 8),
channels of smaller inland streams appear to have
been subject to less change. Many sites along inland
streams have long periods of use that imply stability
of stream channel locations. Thoms (1993:51) has
noted that over most of the West Gulf coastal plain a
sandy mantle, that typically contains most of the
material evidence of past cultures, caps clay-rich
soil horizons. For about 130 km inland, a sandy
mantle typically caps the clay-rich Beaumont formation. It is common to find archeological sites
with artifacts dating from 11,000-10,000 years ago
on the surface of Beaumont clay, which is not thought
to date later than 30,000 years ago (Aronow 1971:51).
At many locations, about 20,000 years of geological
deposits seem to be missing, possibly due to severe
erosional events caused by extended heavy rainfall
between 25,000 and 9000 B.P. (Aten 1983:133).

Therefore, Southeast Texas is a poor area to look for
archeological sites predating 12,000 B.P.
After the Pleistocene period, sea level on the
Gulf of Mexico continued to rise. By 4500 years
ago, sea level was probably within 4.6 m of its
present level (Paine and Morton 1986:9). Sea level
stabilized at its present level about 3500 years ago
(Gagliano 1977:1). Coastal margin archeological
sites older than 3500 B.P. would generally now be
underwater. Therefore, a full chronological sequence for human occupation is only available for
the inland portion of this region. There are some
sites on the present coastal margin where rising sea
level changed the site environment from freshwater to brackish water, with a corresponding change
in human subsistence pattern, such as on upper San
Jacinto Bay (Patterson and Marshall 1989).

files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), but only about 14 percent of these sites have
been published. Unpublished site records seldom
describe the nature of each site in much detail.
Therefore, two computerized data bases for inland
and coastal margin subregions have been developed
(Patterson 1989a, 1989b) which are limited to
published site reports. Quantitative summaries of the
original 1989 data base fbr the inland subregion has
been published (Patterson 1993a). As of early 1994,
the current inland data base has 283 sites (101
excavated and 182 surface collections), and the coastal
margin database has 203 sites (56 excavated and 147
surface collections). As may be seen in Table 1,
coverage of various counties is far from uniform. A
typical prehistoric site excavation by the Houston
Archeological Society is shown in Figure 2.

Time periods are based more on artifact types
than on any differences in lifestyles. A nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle was practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods in this region. Time intervals used for Southeast Texas may
be different than for adjacent regions, even though
the same period names are used. For example, the
time intervals used for the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods are different in Central and Southeast
Texas, and there is no Early Ceramic period in
Central Texas.
The Early Paleoindian period is based on the
dating of Clovis and Folsom points in other parts of
Texas (see Meltzer and Bever, this volume). It is
now known that several varieties of side-notched
points also occur in Southeast Texas during the
same time period as Folsom. The Late Paleoindian
period represents the presence in Southeast Texas
of Plains types of lanceolate points, even though
several non-lanceolate point types were also used
during this time period. The Late Paleoindian period
in Texas corresponds to the Early Archaic period in
the eastern U.S. In Southeast Texas, the Late
Paleoindian period closes with the start of
dominance of stemmed point types. The Archaic
period in this region starts at the end of the Late
Paleoindian period and ends at about A.D. 100 (Aten
1983:297). The Early Ceramic period begins with
the adoption of pottery and ends with the
approximate start of bifacial arrow points (Aten
1983:306) at A.D. 600, the onset of the Late
Prehistoric period. More varied ceramics and other
material culture items characterize the Late
Prehistoric period, while the Protohistoric period
dates from after inital contact between the Native
Americans of Southeast Texas and European
explorers, colonists and settlers, and archeological

243

sites as early as the seventeenth century contain
European trade goods (e.g., Ricklis 1994). The
Historic Indian period ends between about 18001810 and 1840 with the more permanent European
and Anglo-American settlement of the region, and
the removal of the Native American groups.

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
AND CONTINUITY
The conservative hunter-gatherer lifeway in
Southeast Texas is characterized by slow change in
projectile point styles, and only a few major technological changes. Introduction of the bow and arrow and pottery were significant technological
changes, but they do not appear to have had a major
impact on lifestyle of Indians in the inland subregion. The use of pottery was more important on the
coastal margin, judged by the large quantities of
pottery at shell midden sites. The slow diffusion of
pottery into Southeast Texas is an indication that
conservative hunter-gatherers are not quick to adopt
new technology. It is probably characteristic of the
hunter-gatherer lifeway that a technological change
is accepted only when it makes a significant contribution to efficiency and group survival. Some sophisticated traits of complex cultures would be of
little value to the basic hunter-gatherer lifeway.
Some examples of this technological continuity in
the region are the use of the Gary-Kent dart point
series for thousands of years, the long use of fired
clayballs, and the gradual smooth trends in flake
size distributions toward higher percentages of
smaller size flakes in later time; the latter follows a
gradual trend toward smaller-sized dart points.

SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS
Because of poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known mainly through the study of faunal remains.
Preservation of faunal remains is best at shell
middens, both inland (McClure 1987), and on the
coastal margin (Dillehay 1975). There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct
megafauna, as was done by Paleoindians in some
parts of North America. It appears that a broadbased subsistence pattern was practiced during all
prehistoric time periods, even during the Paleoindian
period (Patterson et al. 1987).

Texas Archeological Society

Tabulations of faunal remains for the inland
(Patterson 1989a, 1990a) and coastal margin
(Patterson 1989b) subregions show that Indians
were practically omnivorous, utilizing a range of
fauna from small animals, such as rat and rabbit, to
large animals, such as deer and bison. The types of
terrestrial fauna used by inland and coastal margin
Indians are similar, but there are differences in
aquatic species used in the two subregions because
of local availablity. Deer and land turtle were important food resources throughout the region. Fish
were a minor food resource in the inland subregion,
and a major food resource on the coastal margin.
The use of fish at coastal margin sites is underestimated by conventional screening at excavations.
At 41CH161 on the coastal margin (Kindall and
Patterson 1993), fine screening has yielded over
100,000 bone specimens, mainly of fish. Table 2
gives a summary of both terrestrial and aquatic
faunal remains found at sites in inland and coastal
margin subregions of Southeast Texas.
Aquatic faunal resources used in this region
include shellfish, alligator, fish and water turtle.
Freshwater shell middens are found in the western
part of inland Southeast Texas, such as 41FB37
(Patterson and Hudgins 1987), but are not of the
extensive nature of Rangia brackish water shell
middens on the coastal margin (see also Ricklis,
this volume). A few oyster shell middens occur on
the coastline in marine saltwater environment.
Rangia cuneata shell middens on the coastal margin can be quite large, some over 300 m in length
(Duke 1981). The importance of Rangia shellfish
in the diet should not be overestimated, as Rangia
meat is not a rich food material. A consumption of
hundreds of shellfish would be required to obtain
daily minimum calorie and protein requirements
(Dering and Ayers 1977:59). Judged by the low
proportion of damaged shell at shell middens, meat
was probably extracted by use of heat, rather than
by mechanical opening of shell (Patterson, Ebersole,
and Kindall 1991).
Nuts and acorns were widely available in parts
of ths region, and were probably utilized when available. Quantities of nuts vary widely from year-toyear as mast conditions change.
Bison were present in Southeast Texas, but
probably not continuously in prehistoric times. Bison had a limited geographic distribution and were
not present in large herds (Patterson 1992c). They
occupied the more open coastal prairie areas, but

did not penetrate the Big Thicket or dense piney
woods. There is some indication in the archeological record for an increased use of bison during the
Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1992c).
Agriculture was not practiced in Southeast
Texas by aboriginal groups, even though the Caddo
Indians practiced agriculture in adjacent Northeast
Texas during the Late Prehistoric period. Agriculture may not have been a viable subsistence option
for much of the region (OâBrien and Spencer
1976). Soils of the Gulf Coastal Plain are not wellsuited for agriculture without use of modern farming methods.

MOBILITY-SETTLEMENT
PATTERNS
Mobility-settlement patterns are considered here
separately for the inland and coastal margin subregions. As Story (1990:260) notes, it is difficult to
determine seasonality and duration of stay at inland
campsites. Some aspects of mobility-settlement patterns for the inland subregion can be considered,
however (Patterson 1991d). Inland sites are: (1)
usually found near a water source (Patterson 1979),
(2) the majority are multi-component (Patterson
1983) with much reuse, (3) they have well-defined
intra-site areas, (4) there is little evidence of satellite
activity sites and separate base camps, and (5) even
at shell midden sites other kinds of subsistence activities are evident (McClure 1987).
Mobility-settlement patterns in inland Southeast Texas can be compared to two models proposed
by Binford (1980), which represent extremes of the
spectrum of mobility-settlement strategies. In one
model, highly mobile hunter-gathers are called "foragers," with residential bases that are frequently
moved and with other poorly defined subsistence
activity locations. In the other model, less mobile
hunter-gatherers are called "collectors," with welldefined residential bases and satellite locations that
tend to be reused. Collectors are characterized by
logistically organized subsistence activities, using
special task groups. The characteristics of sites of
inland Southeast Texas seem to fall within the two
extremes of Binfordâs models. The lack of visible
satellite activity fits the forager model, but the high
reuse of sites fits the collector model. In Southeast
Texas, there appears to have been a genera! foraging
strategy, but on a highly scheduled basis. Thus, a

245

single model of mobility-settlement should be used
with caution. As Story (1990:269) notes, "Much of
the success of hunters and gatherers surely rested in
their ability to implement a number of different
economic responses, to be able to adjust to the good
as well as the bad times."
The reuse of sites in the inland subregion is
indicated by large amounts of artifacts at many
sites, and the high proportion (about 90 percent) of
multi-component sites. The high reuse of sites demonstrates scheduling and restricted mobility even
during the Paleoindian period, which is considered
to have had a more mobile lifestyle. There are somewhat higher proportions of inland single component sites in the Early Ceramic and Late Prehistoric
periods, showing a tendency for more dispersion
and mobility. There is archeological evidence that
inland Indians were more mobile in the Late Prehistoric (Patterson 1976:185), with less use of pottery and smaller sites.
The high proportion of multi-component shell
midden sites on the coastal margin indicates scheduling of subsistence activities in this subregion,
similar to the inland subregion. Indians of the coastal
margin seem to have utilized a zone about 25-30
km wide along the upper Texas Coast (Patterson
1990c, 1993d). There are certain traits that can be
used to distinguish the general boundary between
inland and coastal margin sites (Patterson 1993d).
Coastal margin type sites in the Galveston Bay area
are usually Rangia middens with few lithics, with
oyster shell tools, large quantities of pottery, and
many bone tools. Rangia shell middens can be found
up to 25 km inland from the coastline on streams
with tidal flow, which causes increased salinity.
Inland type sites are characterized by modest
amounts of pottery, fired clayballs at some sites,
much lithic material, but no shell tools; and in the
Late Prehistoric, limited amounts of San Jacinto
grog-tempered pottery, no Baytown Plain grog-tempered pottery, and concurrent use of the bow and
arrow and spear. The large size of many coastal
margin shell middens and the use of large quantities of pottery may indicate that coastal margin
Indians were less mobile than their inland counterparts; coastal margin Indians may have had more
plentifu! food resources.
Aten (1981) has developed a correlation for
the seasonality of Rangia collecting based on shell
growth ring patterns. His correlation generally
shows that Rangia collecting was a regularly

inland (Patterson 1987, 1991d, 1993a) and coastal
margin (Patterson 1987) subregions.
The population growth rate of the inland
subregion was low from the Late Paleoindian period
to the early part of the Late Archaic. During the
Late Archaic, the population growth rate accelerated
rapidly, with rapid growth continuing in the Early
Ceramic period. Population levels then decline in
the Late Prehistoric period (see Figure 3). There
seems to have been a decline in population level in
Central Texas at about the same time (Prewitt
1985:Figure 6).
Factors that might be considered for the high
population growth rate in the Late Archaic and
Early Ceramic periods include: (1) a wetter and

more productive climate, (2) increased hunting efAvailable data are not suitable for determining
ficiency with early use of the bow and arrow, (3)
absolute population levels or short-term population
adaptation to a greater range of food resources, and
changes. It is possible, however, to estimate the
(4) migration of people into the region. The sharp
relative population levels in Southeast Texas for
increase in population in Southeast Texas occurred

or food shortage cannot be assessed, but long-term

population trends can be studied. The relative popupopulation decrease in the inland subregion during
lation level is estimated by calculating a relative

sponse to over-population, perhaps aggravated by
the average number of sites per year for each time

scheduled warm weather activity that began in late
spring and ended in mid-summer (Story !990:260).
This seasonality model is now under question,
however. The actual dates for live Rangia samples
from Trinity Bay do not give a good match with
dates calculated by Atenâs correlation (Patterson
and Gardner 1993), and it has been noted that Atenâs
correlation is not suitable for mixed samples of
Rangia collected during different months (Patterson,
Ebersole, and Kindall 1991). The seasonality of
subsistence activities on the coastal margin remains
a subject for future research.

Patterson ~ The Archeology of Southeast Texas

(Hedrick and Riley 1974:40), coastal margin Indians
were less hungry than inland Indians.
There are few Rangia she!! middens on the
coastal margin dated before 500 B.C., even though
the sea level stabilized about 1500 B.C. (Aten
1983:158). Perhaps Rangia shellfish resources were
not well-established until some time after sea level
stabilization. Another possibility is that the coastal
margin of Southeast Texas may have been fully
occupied only after migration of people from Louisiana who were already fully using marine food
resources. The low occupation of the coastal margin from 1500 to 500 B.C. implies that the coastal
margin may not have had much use by earlier Indians at earlier coastline positions.

MORTUARY PRACTICES
Isolated burials without grave goods are common throughout Southeast Texas. There are two
time periods in specific areas of the region, however, where organized burial practices occurred. In
the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late
Archaic mortuary tradition is found in the lower
Brazos and Colorado River valleys and in the intermediate area. This tradition has been best described
by Hall (1981) for the Aliens Creek sites near the
Brazos River. Organized burial practices actually
started during the Middle Archaic at this site complex, but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods. Types of
exotic grave goods included: boatstones,
bannerstones, stone gorgets, corner-tang knives,
stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads
and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, position
of body, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as long-bone implements and
bone pins. Many of the long-bone implements have
incised patterns. Most burials are in extended supine position, with some extended prone and bundle
burials also present. Burial direction is usually consistent at any one site, but varies from site to site.
There are now 11 sites identified as related to this
distinctive Late Archaic mortuary tradition in Austin (4), Fort Bend (4), and Wharton (3) counties
(Patterson et al. 1993b:Table 11).
Exotic grave goods are evidence of long-distance trade in the Late Archaic. Large corner-tang
knives are from the Edwards Plateau, marine shell

247

ornaments are from still unidentified coastal areas,
and ground stone items (beads, boatstones,
bannerstones, gorgers) are made of materials from
Arkansas. Widespread trade is known to have occurred in the Late Archaic, such as the Poverty
Point exchange system (Webb 1982; Gibson 1995).
Social status might be indicated by individuals buried with exotic grave goods, but a high degree of
social organization in not indicated for these egalitarian hunter-gatherers. Higher social status is likely
to have been given to shamans and "big men."
There is evidence of violence at several sites
of the Late Archaic mortuary tradition. Evidence of
violent death from projectile points has been noted
at 41AU36 (Hall 1981), 41FB42 (Patterson et al.
1993a), 41WH14 (Hudgins and Kindal! 1984), and
41WH39 (Vernon 1989). Hall (1981:308, 1988b)
has proposed that violence was from inter-group
conflict, and Patterson (1988b) has noted that intragroup conflict should also be considered. Another
organized mortuary tradition is found on the coastal
margin in the Galveston Bay area in the Late Prehistoric (Aten et al. 1976), Protohistoric, and Historic (Ricklis 1993, 1994) periods. Many of the
burials were flexed or semi-flexed, with a variety
of burial directions. At 41HR80 (Aten et al. 1976),
grave goods included marine shell beads and pendants, bird bone flutes, bone dice, bone awls, fishhooks, projectile points, and a possible rattle. Red
ochre was used with some burials. The Late Prehistoric mortuary tradition of the Galveston Bay area
had a degree of organization similar to the inland
Late Archaic mortuary tradition, except that not
much long-distance trade was involved in the coastal
margin tradition.
Ricklis (1993, 1994) describes four burial
groups at 41GV66 on Galveston Island, with two
groups containing Late Prehistoric burials, and two
containing burials of the Late Prehistoric,
Protohistoric, and early Historic Indian period.
Grave goods of the Late Prehistoric group are typical
of the mortuary tradition of the Galveston Bay area,
including bone and shell beads, bird bone flutes,
and perhaps a rattle. The Protohistoric and early
Historic Indian burials are significant for
understanding changes in Southeast Texas mortuary
practices in that there are differences in body
position (the bodies were extended in the grave
pits), and some graves had structural enclosures
placed around them. A wide variety of European
trade goods were found with these latter burial

groups, including glass trade beads, a hawk-bell,
spike fragments, iron tools, hand-wrought square
nails, and flat clear glass mirror fragments (Ricklis
1994:461-462). By contrast, most burials at inland
sites after the Late Archaic contain no grave goods.

and minimized the survival value of higher social
complexity. Brown and Price (1985:438) have observed that "decreased mobility retards flexible response to stress and engages more institutional
structures as essential solutions."

SOCIAL COMPLEXITY

BIOARCHEOLOGY

A high degree of social complexity is shown
by some of the mortuary traditions described above,
particularly the large organized cemeteries at Late
Archaic sites such as Allens Creek (Hall 1981), and
then as a reemerging pattern in the Protohistoric
and early Historic burial groups at Mitchell Ridge
where there was a differential disposal of grave
goods in cemeteries (Ricklis 1994). Increased social complexity has been associated with a more
sedentary lifestyle resulting from high population
level and sometimes from abundant food resources
(Brown and Price 1985). During the Late Archaic,
there was a rapidly rising population level in all
parts of Southeast Texas, which should have led to
decreased mobility, but the available archeological
evidence suggests that the highest social complexity is evident only in the western zone. Perhaps the
western zone had more abundant food resources
that permitted a more sedentary lifestyle, which in
turn may have created appropriate conditions for
more complex social practices to develop.
It should be noted from artifact styles that there
probably was more contact between different social
groups in the western zone, than in the central and
eastern parts of this region, which may have encouraged a higher degree of social organization.
The Late Archaic mortuary tradition of western
Southeast Texas has several traits usually associated with more complex organization and a sedentary lifestyle, including: high population density,
energy invested in grave preparation, differences in
burial due to grave wealth, long-distance trade, and
evidence of violence (e.g., Brown and Price
1985:437).
The Late Archaic mortuary tradition ended during a period of rapid population increase, and perhaps also a deteriorating climate, but research
attention in the region should also consider the relationship between changes in mortuary practices
at this time and changing demographic, subsistence,
and settlement patterns. Resulting higher mobility
of lifestyle possibly disrupted long-distance trade,

Data on bioarcheology for the central and western parts of Southeast Texas have been summarized by Reinhard et al. (1990). Burnett (1990) notes
the general paucity of data for the eastern part of
this region. Pathological conditions mentioned include classes of degenerative disease, metabolic
disease, infectious disease, and dental disease. Most
studies for this region simply itemize pathological
conditions found on skeletal remains. Only Powell
(1988) has integrated data to reach overall conclusions on Late Prehistoric adaptive success. Powell
(1988:262) states that groups of the coastal plain
had moderate success in buffering stress, although
stress may have been experienced at random or
seasonal intervals. Examples of average life
expectency during the Late Archaic are 24 years at
the Crestmont site and 32 years at Witte Group 2
(Vernon 1989:37). Examples of average life expectancy during the Late Prehistoric are 29 years at
the Boysâ School Cemetery and 39 years at Jamaica Beach (Aten et al. 1976:Table 13). Some
individuals in the Late Archaic lived over 50 years
(Black et al. 1992). Skeletons from the Late Archaic at 41FB3 (Patterson et al. 1993b) showed a
generally good state of health at time of death.

HISTORIC INDIAN USE OF
SOUTHEAST TEXAS
With a few exceptions, historic Indian sites in
Southeast Texas are not well-connected with the
ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). It is even
more difficult to relate the ethnographic record to
prehistoric Indian groups in this region, especially
because of Late Prehistoric and historic movements
of social groups. Aten (1983:Figure 3.1) shows reconstructed territories of native groups in the early
eighteenth century, including Coco (Karankawa?),
Tonkawa, Bidai, Akokisa, and Atakapa. However,
the presence of the Tonkawa in Southeast Texas
may be due to a rapid expansion from Central Texas

Patterson ~ The Archeology of Southeast Texas

in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
(Newcomb 1993:27). Karankawa Indians of the Coco
tribe are thought to have occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and
the corresponding mainland (Aten 1983:Figure 3.1).
Judged by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites
east of the San Bernard River, the ethnic identity of
the Coco, as being firmly affiliated with the
Karankawa, may be in doubt, although a reasonable
alternative is that the Coco lived farther down the
coast in prehistoric times. The presence of any
Karankawa in the western part of the coastal margin
of Southeast Texas may be a rather late movement
of some individuals of this ethnic group. The only
site on the upper Texas coastal margin with much
asphalt-coated pottery of the Rockport type is
41CH110 in Chambers County (Gilmore 1974:59),
where asphalt-coated pottery started after A.D. 1350,
but may actually be protohistoric in age.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian period sites
(A.D. 1500-1800) are probably under-identified in
this region, because few aboriginal artifact types
changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic
Indian period (Patterson 1993c). Only a few nonEuropean artifact types are useful in identifying
historic Indian sites. Arrow point types that seem to
be found in Historic Indian period sites in Southeast Texas include Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero
(Hudgins 1986) types, although Bulbar Stemmed
points from Mitchell Ridge were found in contexts
dating between ca. A.D. 1440-1640 (Ricklis 1994),
suggesting they also date to the Protohistoric period. Fresno and Cuney arrow points may date
mainly after A.D. 1500 in Southeast Texas (see
Hudgins 1986), but this is not clear. Loop handles
for pottery have been found at 41WH8 (Hudgins
1986:Figure 16) and at 41CH161 (Kindall and
Patterson 1993) which has a historic-era component. As of early 1994, the data bases for Southeast
Texas have 13 published historic Indian sites in the
inland subregion and 29 historic Indian sites in the
coastal margin subregion.
Historic Indian period sites are usually identified by the presence of glass and metal artifacts,
gunflints, and European types of pottery. In some
cases, radiocarbon dates indicate historic Indian
components when no trade goods are present, such
as at 41WIll9 (Patterson et al. 1987), with an uncorrected radiocarbon date on charcoal of A.D. 1585
+ 80 (SI-6455) from the excavated stratum nearest
the surface. At 41WH8 (Hudgins 1984), historic

249

artifacts included glass scrapers, a Spanish coin
with a date of 1738, loop handles for pottery, and a
projectile point made from an iron keyhole plate.
Glass beads have been found at a few Indian sites
in both the coastal margin and inland subregions,
including 41PK69 (Ensor and Carlson 1988);
41CH20, 41CH53 and 41CH103 (Ambler 1970:29);
41CH161 (Kindall and Patterson 1993); Mitchell
Ridge (41GV66) (Ricklis 1993, 1994); as well as
41CH110 and 41LB4 (Aten 1983:268). Most of the
Native American sites with glass beads are from
the Galveston Bay area. Ricklis (1993, 1994) has
found historic Indian burial groups at the Mitchell
Ridge site on Galveston Island, identified by European trade goods, including several thousand glass
beads, a brass bell, iron tool fragments, and flat
glass. Glass trade beads here are assignable to the
early to late-eighteenth century, perhaps ca. 17201770 (cf. Ricklis 1994:461). In the northern part of
Southeast Texas, a variety of Euro-American trade
goods can be found at early nineteenth century Alabama/Coushatta historic Indian sites (Perttula
1992:23, 1994).
Fullen (1978) has described the E10rcoquisac
Archeological District as follows: 41 CH57 includes
Joseph Blancpainâs trading post, Village de
Atakapas (1754), the first location of the Spanish
Presidio San Agustin de Ahumada (1756-1766),
and the first location of Mission Nuestra Senora de
La Luz (1756-1759). Site 41CH54 is the second
location of Mission de La Luz (1759-1771), and
41CH22 is the Orcoquisac Rancheria associated
with the mission. Site 41CH53 is the second location of the presidio. Many other Historic Indian,
Spanish, and French sites mentioned in the historical record have not yet been located. Newcomb
(1961) and Aten (1983) may be consulted for more
details on historic Indians in this region. The diary
of Cabeza de Vaca (Covey 1961; Hedrick and Riley
1974) provides the main ethnographic description
of the lifestyle of Indians in Southeast Texas.
European settlement of Southeast Texas did
not seriously disrupt the lifeway of Indians until
after 1700. The first half of the eighteenth century
was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt and stress the native culture and socia! systems (Aten 1983:322)
This is clearly seen in the archeological record at
the Mitchell Ridge site, where the burial data suggests population declines and group mergers

250

Texas Archeological Society

(Ricklis 1994), as well as the increasing importance of Native American participation in the fur
trade. By the time heavy settlement of Texas began
in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished. Alabama/Coushatta Indians in Southeast Texas are migrants, displaced from the east in the late eighteenth
to early nineteenth centuries (Newcomb 1961:25),
but they lived through the 1840s in several large
villages in the lower Trinity and Neches River basins.

PROJECTILE POINT CHRONOLOGIES
Chronologies of projectile points in Southeast
Texas are summarized in Table 3. Chronologies
previously given for arrow points (Patterson 1991a)
and dart points (Patterson 1991b) in Southeast
Texas are used here with some later refinements.
Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985, 1993) have given descriptions of most point
types found in Texas. Principal prehistoric
projectile point types used in Southeast Texas are
shown in Figures 4 and 5.

EARLY PALEOINDIAN PROJECTILE
POINTS (12,000-10,000 B.P.)
Although there are no radiocarbon dates for
Clovis in Southeast Texas, it is presumed that this
is the earliest point type found in this region. Haynes
et al. (1984) date Clovis between 12,000-11,000
B.P. in the western U.S., extending to as late as
10,500 B.P. at some sites in the eastern U.S. The
context of Clovis points is not well-defined in Southeast Texas, but there are some sites where Clovis is
found in multi-component contexts: 41HR343
(Patterson et al. 1993c), 41HR731 (Patterson et al.
1993d), Doering (Wheat 1953), and 41HR571
(Patterson 1986). Clovis points have been found
over a stretch of several km along McFaddin Beach
near Beaumont (Long 1977), and a recent meeting
of collectors revealed over 60 Clovis points from
this location (Banks 1992; see also Turner and Tanner 1994). Huebner (1988) reported on a Clovis
point found on the beach of Bolivar Penninsula in
Galveston County, west of McFaddin Beach (see
also Meltzer and Bever, this volume).
Prehistoric occupations in Southeast Texas become more apparent between 11,000-10,000 B.P.

Texas Archeological Society

The Plains tradition is represented in Southeast
Texas at this time by a few Folsom and Midland
points. Folsom is dated to 11,000-10,000 B.P.
(Largent et al. 1991). The rarity of Folsom and
Midland points in the region may be due to the
limited availability of bison in this region during
this time period (cf. Munson (1990:Figure 3).
Single Folsom points have been found at
41WIll9 (Patterson et al. 1987), 41HR624
(Patterson, Marriott, and Marriott 1990), 41HR343
(Patterson et al. 1993c), and McFaddin Beach
(Banks 1992). Three Midland points were found at
41HR571 (Patterson 1986:Figure 2), although they
were originally classified as Plainview-like because
no Midland point had previously been reported in
this region. A few Midland points at other sites
(Patterson et al. 1993c, 1993d) does not change the
view that they are rare in the region. A Folsom
point was found in the same excavation level as an
Early Side-Notched point at 41WH19 (Patterson et
al. 1987), with an associated uncorrected radiocarbon date on charcoal of 9920 +_ 530 B.P. (AA-298).
Several other projectile point types were also
present in Southeast Texas during the same time
period as Folsom. These include Dalton, and sidenotched San Patrice, Big Sandy, and Early SideNotched types. Big Sandy and Dalton points are not
common, although Dalton points are frequent north
of Southeast Texas (Story 1990:Figure 27), and date
from as early as 10,500 B.P. (Goodyear 1982) to
9500 B.P. (Morse and Morse 1983:71). Big Sandy
points are common in the Southeast Woodlands,
with a date as early as 10,500 B.P. in northern
Alabama (Boyd 1992). They continued in use until
about 8000 B.P. (Justice 1987:61). Dalton points
have been found in Southeast Texas at McFaddin
Beach (Long 1977), and a few other places (Patterson
et al. 1993c, 1993d) in Harris County. Big Sandy
points have been found in this region at three sites in
Harris County (Patterson et al. 1987, 1993c, 1993d).
San Patrice and Early Side-Notched point types are
both common in Southeast Texas (Patterson 1989a,
1990a). Story (1990:202) provisionally dates the
San Patrice point to 10,300-9300 B.P. As noted
above, there is a radiocarbon date of 9920 + 530
B.P. from a level with Early Side-Notched points at
41WIll9 (Patterson et al. 1987).
San Patrice and Early Side-Notched points often occur together (Webb et al. 1971; Patterson et
al. 1987). One variant of the Early Side-Notched
point has been classified as Keithville (Turner and

Hester 1993:134), but this variant does not even
apply to all side-notched points at the type site
(Webb et al. 1971). There are considerable data to
indicate that San Patrice and Early Side-Notched
were the principal point types used in Southeast
Texas during the Early Paleoindian period.

LATE PALEOINDIAN PROJECTILE
POINTS (10,000-7000 B.P.)
This period is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points. Big Sandy, San Patrice, and Early
Side-Notched points continued into the early part of
this period, but these side-notched point types were
generally replaced by corner-notched points. A small
proportion of Early Stemmed points were also
present. Most specimens were ground on basal edges,
similar to points from the Early Paleoindian period.
Late Paleoindian point types of the Southern
Plains tradition found in Southeast Texas include
Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura.
Plainview points have been found in Late
Paleoindian contexts at 41WIll9 (Patterson et al.
1987) and 41HR315 (Patterson 1980). Scottsbluff
points are not common in Southeast Texas, but are
found frequently farther north (Story 1990:210).
Most Scottsbluff points found in this region are
from surface collections (Hudgins and Patterson
t983; Patterson and Hudgins 1991), but there is an
excavated specimen from 41HR5 in Harris County
(Wheat 1953).There are excavated Angostura points
in possible Late Paleoindian contexts at 41FB42
(Patterson et al. !993a) and 41FB223 (Patterson et
al. 1994).
A few Early Stemmed points occur at 41WIll9
(Patterson et al. 1987) and 41HR3!5 (Patterson
1980). Perhaps these represent the start of development of stemmed point styles. The change from
side-notched to corner-notched point types occurred
throughout the Southeast Woodlands during Late
Paleoindian times (Fagan 1991:310). Site 41PK69
also has early notched points (Ensor and Carlson
1988:Tables 18 and 19).

EARLY ARCHAIC PROJECTILE
POINTS (7000-5000 B.P.)
Projectile points of the Early Archaic period in
Southeast Texas include Bell, Carrollton, Morrill,

Patterson ~ The Archeology of Southeast Texas

Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed
varieties. The Bell point is the only type in this
period closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Bell points are occasionally found in the western
and central parts of Southeast Texas, generally made
of exotic Edwards chert types. Most specimens of
other points types during this period are made of
local chert types.
Use of lanceolate and notched point styles
ended at the start of the Early Archaic in Southeast
Texas, with the dominance of stemmed point forms.
Bell (Prewitt 1981) and Morrill (Turner and Hester
1985:129) points are placed in this period using
Central and Northeast Texas chronologies. The only
excavated examples of Trinity points in Southeast
Texas are from 41HR315 (Patterson 1980:Table 3),
although Turner and Hester (1985:154) place this
point type in the Middle Archaic. Carrollton and
Wells point types are most common in the Early
Archaic period in this region, but seem to extend
into the early part of the Middle Archaic (Patterson
1980). There is an uncorrected radiocarbon date on
freshwater mussel shell of 6490 + 120 B.P. (I15333) in an excavation level with a Carrollton
point at 41FB37 (Patterson 1988).
A variety of Early Stemmed point types, all
with ground stem edges, from the Early Archaic
occur at 41WH19 (Patterson et al. 1987) and
41FB223 (Patterson et al. 1994). The practice of
stem grinding was commonly used in Southeast
Texas until the early part of the Middle Archaic,
although a few point specimens with ground stem
edges have also been found in this region as late as
the Late Archaic period (Patterson et al. 1987).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC PROJECTILE
POINTS (5000-3500 B.P.)
As noted above, Wells, Carrollton, Morrill,
and perhaps Trinity point types continue into the
early part of the Middle Archaic in this region.
Other projectile points found in Southeast Texas
during the Middle Archaic include: Bulverde,
Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably
the Gary-Kent series. Bulverde points have been
found in Middle Archaic context at 41HR315
(Patterson 1980) and 41FB42 (Patterson et al.
1993a).
The Pedernales point is found in both Middle
and Late Archaic deposits. Examples from Middle

253

Archaic contexts have been recovered at 41AU37
(Hall 1981), 41AU1 (Duke 1982:Figure 2), and
41FB34 (Patterson 1989d), which has an tmcorrected radiocarbon date of 5210 + 110 B.P. (I15510) on freshwater mussel shell in excavated
context. The Pedernales point has been found in
Late Archaic components at 41FB3 (Patterson et
al. 1993b), 41FB42 (Patterson et al. 1993a), and
41AU1 (Duke 1982:Figure 2).
The Gary-Kent series of straight and
contracting stem points seems to start in the Middle
Archaic in this region at sites such as 41AU37
(Hall 1981)and 41HR315 (Patterson 1980). These
point types continue through the Late Archaic,
Early Ceramic, and Late Prehistoric periods, but
tend to be smaller in the Early Ceramic and Late
Prehistoric periods (Ensor and Carlson 1991;
Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980). Gary and
Kent points are grouped as a series because of
morphological overlaps and frequent co-ocurrence
at the same sites.
LATE ARCHAIC AND EARLY
CERAMIC DART POINTS
(3500-1400 B.P.)

Dart point types of the Late Archaic and Early
Ceramic have been grouped together because several types occur in both periods (Patterson 1989d).
These include: Gary, Kent, Dad, Yarbrough, Ensor,
Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos. The
Ponchartrain point is a minor type from Louisiana
that is found in Southeast Texas during the Late
Archaic. As noted above, the Pedernales point may
continue into the early part of the Late Archaic in
this region. The chronologies of Marcos and
Fairland points are not well-established in Southeast Texas. Gary and Kent are the dominant point
types in this region during these time periods.
Gary, Kent, Dad, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, and
Palmillas dart points often occur together (Patterson
1990a). Story (1990:256) thinks that Yarbrough,
Darl, and Godley points types may be variations of
a general style. My opinion is that Yarbrough, Darl,
and Palmillas point types may be variants that developed from the Gary-Kent series. The Godley
point has been classified as a Yarbrough variant in
my data bases. The use of bone dart points was
fairly common during the Early Ceramic period on
the coastal margin (Aten 1983:262), and reflects
the lack of lithic materials in this subregion.

254

Texas Archeological Society

LATE PREHISTORIC DART POINTS
(1400-500 B.P.)
On the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use
of the spear was generally discontinued during the
Late Prehistoric (Aten 1983:306), in favor of use of
the bow and arrow. The spear and spearthrower
(atlatl) continued to be used during the Late Prehistoric in the inland subregion along with the bow
and arrow, however (Aten 1967; Keller and Weir
1979; Ensor and Carlson 1991; Patterson 1980;
Patterson et al. 1987; Wheat 1953). Small Gary and
Kent dart points are the principal types found in the
Late Prehistoric in inland Southeast Texas, as well
as a few Ensor and Ellis specimens. Further east,
Indians of the central and eastern part of the Gulf
coastal plain are also known to have used both the
spear-spearthrower and bow and arrow weapon systems (see Hudson 1976).

UNIFACIAL ARROW POINT
CHRONOLOGY
(est. 4000.500 B.P.)
Introduction of the bow and arrow is generally
viewed as started about A.D. 600 in Central (Prewitt
1981) and Southeast (Aten 1983:306) Texas, using
bifacial arrow points. With this model, however, no
explanations are given on how this introduction
occurred, or why no initial time period is apparent
that allows for a lengthy local adoption of this new
technology. I have proposed (Patterson 1982,
1992b) that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas at about the end of the Middle
Archaic, using unifacial arrow points that were
mainly marginally retouched flakes. Odell (1988)
has reached a similar conclusion for the start of the
bow and arrow in the Central U.S. The bow and
arrow seems to have diffused from Northeast Asia
into the North American arctic, and then diffused
progressively south through the New World
(Patterson 1973, 1982, 1992b). In Southeast Texas,
unifacial arrow points are estimated to start at about
4000 B.P. and continue through the Late Prehistoric (Patterson 1992b:Table 1), based on estimated
chronologies at several sites with excavated data,
or from surface collections in apparent single component contexts. Unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology (Patterson 1973). I have further proposed that
the start of bifacial arrow points in Southeast Texas

at about A.D. 600 represents the common use of
these types of tools, rather than the adoption of the
bow and arrow.

BIFACIAL ARROW POINT
CHRONOLOGIES
(A.D. 600-1500+)
Four major arrow point types were in use in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric, including Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. No
serial sequence for these point types is apparent in
this region (Patterson 1991a), although there is a
definite Scallorn-Perdiz temporal sequence in adjacent Central Texas (Prewitt !981), and Perdiz occurs in post A.D. 1250/1300 contexts in Central
Texas (Johnson 1994), South Texas, North Central
Texas and Northeast Texas. The lack of a chronological sequence for major arrow point types in
Southeast Texas is best understood by the geographic distribution of these point types (Patterson
1991a, 1993a). The Scallorn arrow point appears to
have been introduced into Southeast Texas from
Central Texas, and Alba and Catahoula points are
thought to have been introduced into Southeast
Texas from Louisiana. These suppositions are based
on the east-west distribution frequencies of these
point types in Southeast Texas (Patterson 1993a).
I have also argued that Perdiz may have been
introduced in Southeast Texas about this time
(Patterson 1991a). The lack of a chronological sequence for major arrow point types in Southeast
Texas is the result of a mix of diffusion and local
innovation of point types. Use of Perdiz points continued in Southeast Texas until after A.D. 1500
(Patterson et al. 1987).

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF
PROJECTILE POINT TYPES
Quantitative distributions of projectile point
types within western, central, and eastern parts of
Southeast Texas have been published for the inland
subregion (Patterson 1993a). Southeast Texas shares
projectile point types also found in several adjacent
regions. There are technological influences from
the Southern Plains (Central Texas), and the Southeast Woodlands (Louisiana and farther east) during
all time periods (Table 4). Projectile point types in
Southeast Texas that are related to those found in

adjacent regions do not necessarily reflect any influences of specific socia! groups. Justice (1987)
shows wide geographic distributions of many projectile point types that far exceeds social territories.

LITHIC PROCUREMENT

Lithic procurement patterns in Southeast Texas
are tied to the proximity of lithic source locations.
Chert sources are concentrated in the western part
of the region, and petrified wood sources are concentrated in the eastern part of the region. Large
chert cobbles (up to 15 cm in length) can be found
in the Colorado River drainage system, generally
north of Eagle Lake, just outside of the western
edge of the region. Smaller chert cobbles (generally less than 5 cm in length) and some petrified
wood can be found in the Brazos River valley.
Some small chert cobbles occur in streams in eastern Wharton County. Small pieces of chert, petrified wood, and fine-grained quartzite are present
north of Houston. Petrified wood occurs in the Trinity River drainage system. Types of lithic materials
at archeological sites generally reflect the geographic locations of various lithic sources. In western and central parts of Southeast Texas, sites
contain mainly chert artifacts, with limited use of
petrified wood. In the east, there is a predominant
use of petrified wood, as shown by the large Kyle
collection (Kindall and Patterson 1986).
In general, lithic procurement in Southeast
Texas does not appear to be "embedded" in seasonal subsistence rounds (cf. Binford 1979). At sites
remote from lithic sources, there are few indications of heavy use of stone tools or limited amounts
of debitage that would indicate that lithic procurement was an activity within seasonal subsistence
rounds, or perhaps by trade. On the contrary, there
are many large sites that are 40 to 80 km from lithic
sources that have large amounts of finished lithic
artifacts and debitage, and only light use of most
utilized flakes; examples are 41HR182 (Patterson
1985) and 41HR315 (Patterson 1980). Lithic procurement seems to have been by planned trips outside of seasonal subsistence movements.
Coastal margin sites contain only small
amounts of lithic materials, with shell and bone
tools often used instead of stone tools. This indicates either restricted access of coastal margin Indians to inland lithic sources, or cultural choices that
minimized lithic procurement.

Exotic lithic materials from the Edwards
Plateau are found in small quantities at sites in
Southeast Texas. This may indicate limited downthe-line trading in raw materials and projectile points
from Central Texas, or some inter-band movements
of a few individuals. In the Late Prehistoric, there
may have been some scavenging at earlier sites for
reworkable lithic materials, such as suggested by
Ricklis and Cox (!993:457) for sites on the central
Texas Gulf coastal plain. Good quality heat-treated
flakes from dart point manufacture suitable for
arrowpoint manufacture would have been available
at earlier sites.
There is a trend toward higher percentages of
smaller size flakes (Patterson 1980:Figure 19;
Patterson et al. !987:Figure 20) and smaller dart
points in later time periods. While there may be a
technological trend toward smaller size dart points,
it is possible that higher population levels in later
time periods restricted access to lithic sources, resuiting in use of more lithic sources with smaller
size pieces of raw material.

LITHIC MANUFACTURING
Most inland sites in this region have significant quantities of debitage from lithic manufacturing, but a low quantity of cores. Primary reduction
of raw materials was done mainly at lithic source
locations, with flake blanks and early stage preforms taken to campsites for projectile point manufacture. Arrow and dart point preforms in various
stages of completion or failure also show that biracial projectile points were manufactured at campsites, rather than at lithic sources. Use of flake
blanks to manufacture dart points at campsites allowed good material to be selected at the source,
and reduced transportation weight and volume.
Heat-treatment of chert to improve knapping quality was extensively used in all time periods, but it is
not clear whether heat-treatment was generally done
near lithic sources or at campsites. Heat treatment
near lithic sources would have been efficient, with
only successfully heat-treated materials being transported to campsites.
Quartzite hammerstones are often found at
campsites, and limestone hammerstones for soft
percussion are found occasionally, imported from
the Edwards Plateau. Antler billets and antler
pressure flaking tools are rarely preserved, but
were probably a significant part of the toolkit for

Patterson ~ The Archeology of Southeast Texas

projectile point production. There was usually a
low level of manufacture of formal unifacial tool
types at campsites.

LITHIC TOOL TYPES
AND FUNCTIONS
Other than projectile points, the dominant type
of stone tool in Southeast Texas was the utilized
flake, usually selected casually from bifacial reduction debitage. There is evidence that formal
unifacial tools (Figure 6) were used in the
Paleoindian period, in the form of the Albany
scraper (Patterson 1991 c), large scrapers, combination scraper-gravers, and miscellaneous large bifacia! tools (Patterson et al. 1987). During all time
periods, however, the utilized flake was the dominant tool type. After the Paleoindian period, formal types of unifacial tools occur only in small
quantities at most sites, usually made from thin
bifacial thinning flakes. These include scrapers,
denticulates, notched tools, perforators, and gravers. A few bifacial perforators (drills) are sometimes found at sites in this region.

Figure 6. Paleoindian lithic unifacial tools.

Examples of edge wear patterns from scraping, cutting, and planing functions can be found on
utilized flakes, consistent with edge wear patterns
illustrated by Tringham et al. (1974). Some types
of stone tool use do not give much edge wear,
especially when working soft materials such as rneat
(Patterson 1984). There is little evidence from stone
tool types to indicate that any sites were being used
as specialized activity locations.

CERAMIC TYPES, CHRONOLOGIES,
AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS
The use of pottery did not start uniformly
throughout Southeast Texas. It diffused into this
region from adjacent regions, especially from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) states
that pottery was present at the Texas-Louisiana border on the coastal margin by about 70 B.C., in the
Galveston Bay area by about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin of this region by
about A.D. 300, and in the Conroe-Livingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The use of pottery in
the inland subregion of Southeast Texas appears to
have diffused from the coastal margin. The chronologies of various pottery types in Southeast Texas
are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983:Figure t4.1) has established a detailed
chronological sequence. Aten (1983:206-245) has
given a detailed description of each pottery type
found in Southeast Texas.
Pottery was introduced at the start of the Early
Ceramic period, when there was a high regional
population level. The high population may have
resulted in restricted mobility, and a more sedentary lifestyle with longer stays at campsites. Since
pottery is not easily transported, the use of pottery
may have been more advantageous with a more
sedentary lifestyle. As noted below, the use of pottery decreased in the Late Prehistoric period in the
inland subregion when there was a higher degree
of mobility.
Goose Creek sandy paste pottery was used
throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat farther
north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and
early part of the Historic Indian periods (see Perttula
et al., this volume). A minor variety, Goose Creek
Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period
(Aten 1983:Figure 14.1). Winchell and Ellis (1991)
have considered the possibility of a more detailed
chronological sequence for Goose Creek pottery,
based on types of surface finish, but no definite
regional chronological sequence has been established based on the frequency of this attribute.
On the basis of geographic distribution of sandy
paste pottery, Story (1990:256) has proposed a
Mossy Grove cultural tradition. This designation is
problematical, because it is based mainly on a single
technological trait, while Southeast Texas is rather
heterogeneous with regard to other technological
traits. There is a smaller amount of Goose Creek
pottery in the western zone than in the central and

258

Texas Archeological Society

eastern parts of this region, which is consistent
with Atenâs (1971:Figure 10) model of slow diffusion of pottery down the Texas coast from Louisiana to Corpus Christi Bay.
Grog (crushed sherd)-tempered pottery was
used in the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods. The varieties of grog-tempered pottery are San
Jacinto Plain, and Baytown Plain, variety Phoenix
Lake. San Jacinto pottery has relatively low amounts
of small size temper, while Baytown Plain has large
amounts of sherd pieces as temper, often visible on
surfaces, and a clayey or silty paste (see Weinstein
1991). Both Goose Creek and San Jacinto wares
have small percentages of incised varieties, but studies have shown only a limited temporal signifiÂ¯ cance for incised design motifs. Grog-tempered
pottery is more common on the coastal margin than
in inland Southeast Texas (Patterson 1990b). The
reported amounts of San Jacinto grog-tempered pottery in the inland subregion are probably over-stated
due to identification difficulties (Aten 1983:239).
Baytown Plain grog-tempered pottery is found only
on the coastal margin (Aten 1983:241), but is often
classified together with San Jacinto Plain.
Aside for Goose Creek Stamped, three other
minor pottery types were used only during the Early
Ceramic period: Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped),
Mandeville, and OâNeal Plain, variety Conway
(Aten 1983:Figure 14.1). Mandeville and
Tchefuncte types are characterized by contorted
paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy
paste like Goose Creek, and Tchefuncte paste has
little sand. There is a question as to whether or not
Mandeville and Tchefuncte ceramics are separate
types or simply represent different clay sources.
Conway pottery is like Goose Creek except that
coarse-grained sand has been added as temper.
Bone-tempered pottery types are not common
in Southeast Texas, but occur sporadically in time
and space, in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric,
and Protohistoric periods (Patterson 1993b; Aten
1983:Figure 14.1). Bone-tempered pottery found in
the western part of this region during the Late Prehistoric (Patterson and Hudgins 1989) may be related to Leon Plain pottery of Central Texas (Suhm
and Jelks 1962). Bone-tempered pottery seems to
occur only in the inland subregion during the Early
Ceramic period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated
pottery are types from the Central Texas coast (see
Ricklis, this volume), found at only a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods.

The functional uses of pottery have not been
well-defined in this region, but possibilities include
cooking, food storage, and water storage. The common occurrence of sherds with drilled repair holes
implies that much of the pottery may have been
used for food storage, where a water-tight container was not required. A large proportion of pottery in the inland subregion was poorly fired, which
might indicate that cooking was not its major use
since a durable vessel would have been desired for
cooking. Pottery was better fired in the coastal margin subregion, and probably this attests to more
cooking use, such as boiling to process shellfish
and fish.

FIRED CLAYBALLS

Fired clayballs (Figure 7) are found at some
inland sites in this region. This artifact has a wide
geographic distribution, but the frequency of sites
with clayballs is low. There are 34 sites with
clayballs in the inland data base as of mid-1992.
Typically, clayballs vary from t5 to 76 mm in
diameter, with an average weight of 6 g. The number of clayballs at a site varies from a few to many
thousands (Patterson 1989e). At some sites clayballs
are mixed with pieces of caliche that appear to have
had the same function as clayballs.
The probable function of clayballs was for
roasting of food materials, although heat-treatment
of chert is another possibility. Hudgins (1993) has
conducted experiments for meat roasting with hot
clayballs with good results. Hot clayballs retain
heat longer than hot coals from a wood fire. The
relatively tow frequency of sites with clayballs

Figure 7. Fired clayballs from a site in Southeast Texas

Patterson ~ The Archeology of Southeast Texas
indicates that cooking with clayballs was not a
generally prefered method. Meat can be cooked
easily with an open fire, but some types of plant
materials are probably better processed by roasting
over clayballs. It has been proposed (Patterson
1989e) that sites with clayballs represent specialized
processing of plant foods on a seasonal basis. Poor
preservation of floral remains precludes identifying
the types of plant materials that were processed.
Fired clayballs occur from the Late Paleoindian
through the Late Prehistoric periods (Patterson et
al. 1987, Patterson et al. 1993a).

259

SHELL ARTIFACTS
Marine shell beads and pendants occur at inland Late Archaic (Hall 1981) and Late Prehistoric
coastal margin (Aten et al. 1976) burial sites. Oyster shell tools were used on the coastal margin as a
substitute for stone tools (Aten 1983:264; Patterson
1990c), for cutting and scraping. The distribution
of oyster shell tools is an indicator of the geographic settlement pattern of coastal margin Indians (Aten 1983:Figure 16.1).

SUMMARY COMMENTS
GROUNDSTONE ARTIFACTS
Mano-metate sets and grinding slabs of local
sandstone are occasionally found at sites in this
region. Possible uses of grinding tools include processing of plant materials and grinding of decorative pigments. At 41FB3 (Patterson et al. 1993b),
grinding slabs were used to produce powdered red
ochre to include with burials. Ground stone artifacts made of exotic materials include boatstones,
gorgets, bannerstones, and beads, often found as
grave goods in Late Archaic burials in the western
part of Southeast Texas (Hall 1981). Duke (1989)
has documented bannerstones found in this region.

BONE AND ANTLER
ARTIFACTS

Preservation of bone and antler is generally
not good in Southeast Texas, but artifacts made of
these materials are occasionally found. Bone tools
are most common at coastal margin sites, where
preservation is good in shell middens, and where
bone tools were often used instead of stone tools.
Bone tool types include awls, projectile points, fishhooks, pins, and needles. Long-bone implements
have been found at several sites. Hall (1988a) has
concluded that pointed long-bone implements were
used as awls, but that specimens with blunt ends
had other functions, such as use for hairpins, head
scratchers, or sweat scrapers. Bone beads are occasionally found, mainly as grave goods (Hall 1981).
Antler is not preserved as well as bone. A few
antler pressure flaking tools (Vernon 1989) and
projectile points (Aten et al. 1976:40) have been
found. Bone and antler tools were probably used
more than the archeological record indicates.

This paper has summarized the long period of
hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Southeast Texas, as reconstructed from current data. This lifestyle appears to have been a successful adaptation for a
period of about 11,000 years, characterized by a
continuity in settlement pattern type and slow technological change. Future research in this region
will result in more refined interpretations of various research topics and models. However, due to
the rapid destruction of archeological resources by
erosion and modern activities, the most important
research goal should be to obtain good representative samples of the archeology of all geographic
areas and time periods in Southeast Texas. Research on specific problems can be done as suitable
data become available. Much more research needs
to be done outside of the Cultural Resource Management regulatory process, to ensure better coverage of archeological resources on private lands.
