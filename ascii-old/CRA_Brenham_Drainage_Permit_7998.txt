MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Cultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel completed a records review and cultural resource survey
of 14 drainage rehabilitation areas within the municipal boundaries of the City of Brenham, Washington
County, Texas. The 14 drainage rehabilitation areas constituting the project area consisted of a total linear
distance of 1,800 m (5,906 ft), and project areas were confined to within approximately 8 m (25 ft) of the
existing drainages. The cultural resource survey was conducted at the request of O’Malley Strand
Associates, Inc., on behalf of the City of Brenham, Texas, in support of drainage rehabilitation projects that
are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The survey was
performed to assist the Federal Emergency Management Agency in fulfilling its responsibilities for a
National Environmental Policy Act review. Because the project areas are owned by the City of Brenham,
and municipalities are considered political subdivisions of the State of Texas, a Texas Antiquities Permit
was required for the completion of the work presented in this report (Permit # 7998). This management
summary outlines the results of the file search and fieldwork and also provides recommendations regarding
cultural resource management for the proposed project.
The Phase I cultural resources investigation completed for this project included a records review and
an intensive archaeological survey, the fieldwork for which occurred between April 19 and 21 of 2017. The
records review was conducted in two hours and the fieldwork took a total of 30.75 hours to complete.
Jeremy W. Pye, PhD, RPA, served as Principal Investigator, and Jason Kennedy, MA, RPA, conducted the
fieldwork. The purpose of the survey was to locate, describe, evaluate, and make appropriate
recommendations for the future treatment of any historic or prehistoric archeological properties that may
have been threatened by the proposed drainage repair and improvement activities.
The records review for the project utilized online files on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission, to identify cultural resources or cultural resource
investigations previously documented within the vicinity of the project area. In addition, historical
quadrangle and soil maps obtained from the United States Geological Survey as well as the United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, were reviewed for the presence of
structures within the project areas. The records review indicated that no previous archaeological surveys
overlap the current project areas. However, seven archaeological sites have been previously documented
within a 1.6 km (1.0 mi) radius of the project areas (41WT66, 41WT80, 41WT81, 41WT82, 41WT17,
41WT18, and 41WT84).
The field methodology consisted of intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by screened shovel tests.
The project areas all consisted of drainages that were modified by erosion during a heavy rainfall event in
the spring of 2016. Surface visibility along the drainage walls varied, and when sufficient was utilized for
surface inspection to detect any artifacts or cultural soil horizons that had become exposed. Shovel tests
were excavated (according to Texas Historical Commission specifications) in areas of low slope and that
also had limited surface visibility (< 30 %) due to vegetation or other ground cover. Areas of fair to high
ground surface visibility (>30%) were investigated via pedestrian survey only.
The fieldwork resulted in the identification of one previously undocumented historic archeological site,
41WT86. This is a low density, subsurface scatter of artifacts dating to the late nineteenth to early twentieth
century and a surface feature consisting of what appears to be an intact house pier. The distribution of
materials at the site suggests that it may have been heavily disturbed during earlier drainage-related
construction activities. Based on the findings of the fieldwork, this site is not recommended eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and it is recommended that the area be considered cleared
from an archaeological perspective. One previously documented standing structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, the Brenham Water Works, lies immediately adjacent to one of the project areas
and it is recommended that during construction special care be taken to avoid impacting the property. One
additional historic feature consisting of an intact course of bricks was observed just outside one of the
i

project areas and was therefore not evaluated. It is recommended that this also be avoided during
construction activities. Because these resources are outside the limits of the current project areas, a No
Historic Properties Affected determination is recommended for this project in support of a categorical
exclusion for the National Environmental Policy Act study.
This project was completed in less than one week, and therefore the report follows the short report
content prescribed in the Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management Reports published by the Council
of Texas Archeologists.

Purpose of Study

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this assessment was to locate,
describe, evaluate, and make appropriate
recommendations for the future treatment of any
historic or prehistoric archeological properties
that may be affected by the proposed activities.
The cultural resource survey was ordered in
support of drainage rehabilitation projects that are
subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, in fulfilling its
responsibilities for a National Environmental
Policy Act review. Because the project areas are
owned by the City of Brenham, and
municipalities
are
considered
political
subdivisions of the State of Texas, a Texas
Antiquities Permit was required for the
completion of the work presented in this report
(Permit# 7998). All work associated with this
investigation was conducted pursuant to
standards set forth by the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) to comply with the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended, and specifically the
regulations for implementing Section 106 of the
Act (36 CFR 800).

C

ultural Resource Analysts, Inc. (CRA),
personnel completed a records review and
cultural resource survey of 14 drainage
rehabilitation areas for the City of Brenham,
Washington County, Texas (Figure 1). This
cultural resource survey was conducted at the
request of O’Malley Strand Associates, Inc., on
behalf of the City of Brenham, Texas.

Project Description
The 14 drainage rehabilitation areas
consisted of drainages that were modified by
erosion during a heavy rainfall event in the spring
of 2016, and they constituted a total linear
distance of 1,800 m (5,906 ft), and all proposed
work will occur within approximately 8 m (25 ft)
in width of the existing drainages, for a total of
3.8 ha (9.5 acres). The project areas are depicted
on the Brenham and Chappell Hill, TX 7.5minute quadrangle maps. Additional details of
the project areas, including length, area, and
centroid location, are provided in Table 1, and the
project area locations are depicted in Figures 2
through 8.

Project Personnel
and Time Spent
Jeremy W. Pye, Ph.D., RPA, served as
principal investigator. The archeological file
search, using online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), was
conducted by Jason Kennedy, M.A., RPA, and
took approximately two hours to complete.
Fieldwork was conducted by Jason Kennedy and
required 30.75 person hours to complete. Jay W.
Gray, M.A., RPA, conducted artifact analysis,
and with the assistance of Jason Kennedy was coauthor of the cultural resource survey report. The
final report production was completed by the
CRA CAD and publications departments. All
field notes and artifacts collected during the
survey will be curated with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of
the University of Texas at Austin.

suggests that it may have been heavily disturbed
during earlier drainage-related construction
activities. Based on the findings of the fieldwork,
this site is not recommended eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
and it is recommended that the area be considered
cleared from an archaeological perspective. One
previously documented standing structure listed
on the NRHP, the Brenham Water Works, lies
immediately adjacent to one of the project areas
and it is recommended that during construction
special care be taken to avoid impacting the
property. One additional historic feature consisting
of an intact course of bricks was observed just
outside one of the project areas and was therefore
not evaluated. It is recommended that this also be
avoided during construction activities. Because
these resources are outside the limits of the current
project areas, a No Historic Properties Affected
determination is recommended for this project in
support of a categorical exclusion for the National
Environmental Policy Act study.

As part of the project, a records review was
conducted using online files available from the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by
THC to identify cultural resources or cultural
resource investigations previously documented
within the vicinity of the project area. A total of
seven previously documented archaeological sites
were located within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) records
review buffer. None of the sites are within or
immediately adjacent to any of the project areas
presented in this report. According to data
presented on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
no previous cultural resource projects have been
conducted within the project areas presented in this
report.
The field methodology consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey supplemented by screened
shovel tests. Surface visibility along the drainage
walls varied, and when sufficient was utilized for
surface inspection to detect any artifacts or cultural
soil horizons that had become exposed. Shovel
tests were excavated in areas of low slope and that
also had limited surface visibility (< 30%) due to
vegetation or other ground cover. Areas of fair to
high ground surface visibility (>30%) were
investigated via pedestrian survey only.

the results of the records review. Section 4
presents the analysis of recovered cultural
materials and Section 5 elaborates on the results
of the archeological investigation and includes
individual interpretations of the archeological
sites recorded during the survey as well as
management recommendations. Report summary
and recommendations regarding future work in
the project area are presented in Section 6.
Résumés for all key personnel and an artifact
inventory are included as appendices to this
report. A map depicting the locations of sites and
isolated finds documented during the current
project is also provided as an appendix.

Typically, site boundaries are determined by
the excavation of two negative shovel tests
beyond each positive shovel test and the extent of
the surface scatter of artifacts. However, because
investigation was largely confined to the project
area corridor, it was not possible to attain two
negative shovel tests in some directions. Sketch
maps of the sites were drawn during delineation.
These maps included the locations of positive and
negative shovel tests, the extent of surface
artifacts and cultural features, topographic and
environmental
information,
and
project
boundaries. A photograph of each site was taken
to illustrate the field conditions at the time of the
survey.

II. RESEARCH DESIGN
AND FIELD METHODS

T

his section describes the field research
methods used during the survey to achieve
project goals. The project area was systematically
investigated by pedestrian survey utilizing
surface visibility, supplemented with the
excavation of screened shovel tests. Within each
project corridor, both sides of the existing
drainage were traversed and attention was paid to
areas that provided surface visibility including
the banks of the existing drainages. Shovel testing
was performed in areas that offered limited
surface visibility, typically due to vegetation, and
in which their excavation was not inhibited by
man-made obstructions.

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
coordinates were recorded using ESRI ArcPad 11
software on a GeoExplorer 3000 Series GeoXT
handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit
manufactured by Trimble to verify locations
within the project area with greater than ± 5 m (16
ft) accuracy. Data was collected using the North
American Datum (NAD) 1983 projection. The
locations of all shovel tests, site datums, cultural
features, and site boundary shape files were
recorded in this manner. Site boundaries were
recorded as polygon files, while shovel test
locations, site datums, and aboveground features
were collected as point files.

Shovel tests were circular holes measuring
35.0 cm (13.8 in) in diameter excavated in most
cases to sterile subsoil. All fill removed from the
tests was screened through .64 cm (.25 in) mesh
hardware cloth, exposed profiles in each shovel
test were recorded on standardized recording
forms, and the sidewalls and bottoms of the
shovel tests were examined for artifacts, potential
cultural soil horizons, and features.

III. RECORDS REVIEW

T

he records review for this project consisted of
a search of the online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission to identify cultural
resources or cultural resource investigations
previously documented within the vicinity of the
project area.

Upon excavation of a transect shovel test
yielding cultural materials, this location was
arbitrarily assigned a field site/delineation
number, and the original positive shovel test was
designated as the site datum and assigned a grid
coordinate of N1000 E1000. Site boundary
recordation relied on a combination of visual

A total of seven previously documented
archaeological sites were located within the 1.6
km (1.0 mi) records review buffer (Table 2). All
of these sites contained nineteenth or twentieth

and a number of structures were present within
the area. The 1963 Brenham, TX 7.5-minute
quadrangle map shows that these roads and

prehistoric component. None of the sites are
within or immediately adjacent to any of the
project areas presented in this report (see
Appendix C, Figures C1 – C3).
According to data presented on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous cultural
resource projects have been conducted within the
project areas presented in this report.

IV. MATERIALS
RECOVERED

Available historic maps of Brenham were
also reviewed to supplement the records review.
These included the 1930 Brenham, TX Tactical
Quadrangle Map (prepared in 1919) and the 1963
Brenham, TX 7.5-minute quadrangle map. The
earlier of these maps is somewhat difficult to
overlay on modern mapping due to the scale of
the depicted roads and structures, and on
georeferenced versions it is clear that inaccuracy
and distortion have caused some misalignments.
However, because the project areas are all along
existing drainages, it was possible to get a
generally good sense of where historically
mapped roads and structures were in relation to
the project locations. The later map is
characterized by a much greater level of
accuracy. In most of the project locations it is
clear that no structures or other historic features
were depicted on these maps. The only deviation
is Location 10, which was within a developed
area of downtown Brenham when the earlier map
was produced (United States Geological Survey

ultural materials were recovered during the
current survey from one site (41WT86) which
contained only historic period artifacts. The
artifact assemblage is described below. An
inventory of materials recovered by provenience
is presented in Table 3, below. A summary of the
historic artifacts recovered during fieldwork
follows, as well as a discussion of the analysis
methods. Information on the age of artifacts as
described in the artifact analysis is derived from
a variety of sources cited in the discussion.
Beginning and end dates for some artifacts were
approximated. A complete inventory of all
recovered artifacts can be found in Appendix B.

and

groups were populated. The historic artifacts
recovered during this project are summarized in
Table 3.

Historic Materials
Analysis Methods
The historic assemblage includes artifacts
classified and grouped according to a scheme
originally developed by Stanley South (1977).
South believed that his classification scheme
would present patterns in historic site artifact
assemblages that would provide cultural insights.
Questions of historic site function, the cultural
background of a site’s occupants, and regional
behavior patterns were topics to be addressed
using this system.

Grouping artifacts into these specific
categories makes it more efficient to associate
artifact assemblages with historic activities or site
types. One primary change associated with the
refinement of these categories is reassigning
artifacts associated with the “Miscellaneous and
Activities” under South’s (1977) original system.
Considering the potential variety of historic
occupations and activities within the project area,
a refinement of the artifact groupings was
considered important to perhaps observe whether
the distribution of specific artifact groups would
produce interpretable patterns related to activity
areas or structure types. Each one of these groups
and associated artifacts is discussed in turn.

South’s system was widely accepted and
adopted by historical archeologists. However,
some have criticized South’s model on theoretical
and organizational grounds (Orser 1988; Wesler
1984). One criticism is that the organization of
artifacts is too simplistic. Swann (2002) observed
that South’s groups have the potential to be
insufficiently detailed. She suggested the use of
sub-groups to distinguish between, for example,
candleholders used for religious purposes and
those used for general lighting. Others, such as
Sprague (1981), have criticized South’s
classification scheme for its limited usefulness on
late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century sites,
sites which include an array of material culture—
such as automobile parts—not considered by
South. Despite its shortcomings, most
archeologists recognize the usefulness of South’s
classification system to present data.

Usually, an artifact has specific attributes that
represent a technological change, an invention in
the manufacturing process, or simple stylistic
changes in decoration. These attribute changes
usually have associated dates derived from
historical and archeological research. For
example, bottles may have seams that indicate a
specific manufacturing process patented in a
certain year. The bottle then can be assigned a
“beginning” date for the same year of the patent.
New technology may eliminate the need for the
same patent and the bottle would no longer be
produced. The “ending” date will be the
approximate time when the new technology took
hold and the older manufacturing processes were
no longer in use.

Stewart-Abernathy (1986), Orser (1988), and
Wagner and McCorvie (1992) have subsequently
revised this classification scheme. In this report,
artifacts were grouped into the following
categories:
architecture,
arms,
clothing,
communication and education, domestic,
biological
(faunal/floral),
furnishings,

Specific styles in ceramic decorations are also
known to have changed. Archeological and
archival researchers have defined time periods
when specific ceramic decorations were

are often buff or off-white and vary considerably
in color from freshly exposed paste (Majewski and
O’Brien 1987).

manufactured and subsequently went out of favor
(e.g., Lofstrom et al. 1982; Majewski and O’Brien
1987). South’s (1977) mean ceramic dating
technique uses this information. The dates
presented here should not be considered absolute
but are the best estimates of an artifact’s age
available at this time. A blank space indicates that
the artifact could not be dated or, alternately, that
the period of manufacture was so prolonged that
the artifact was being manufactured before
America was colonized. An open-ended terminal
date was assigned for artifacts that may be
acquired today. The rationale for presenting dates
for the artifacts recovered is to allow a more
precise estimate of the time span the site was
occupied, rather than the mean occupation date of
a site.

Most whiteware produced before 1840 had
some type of colored decoration. These
decorations are often used to designate ware
groups (i.e., edgeware, polychrome, and colored
transfer print). Most of the decorative types are
not, however, confined to whiteware. Therefore,
decoration alone is not a particularly accurate
temporal indicator or actual ware group designator
(Price 1981).

All artifacts included in the domestic group
consisted of ceramics (n = 2) and are discussed
below.

The most frequently used name for
undecorated whiteware is the generic “ironstone,”
which derives from “Ironstone China” patented by
Charles Mason in 1813 (Mankowitz and Haggar
1957). For purposes of clarification, ironstone will
not be used when referring to whiteware. Ironstone
is theoretically harder and denser than whiteware
produced prior to circa 1840. Manufacturer
variability is, however, considerable and precludes
using paste as a definite ironstone identifier or as a
temporal indicator. Consequently, without
independent temporal control, whiteware that is
not ironstone is difficult to identify, as is early vs.
later ironstone. For our analysis, the primary
determining factor in classification of a sherd as
whiteware was the hardness and porosity of the
ceramic paste.

Ceramics

Plain/Undecorated (n = 1)

The ceramics recovered were grouped into
two major ware types: whiteware (n = 1), and
stoneware (n = 1). Each of these ware groups is
reviewed below.

This decorative type includes vessels with no
decoration. While some researchers such as
Lofstrom et al. (1982:10) and Wetherbee (1980)
include molded designs with “plain” whiteware,
we agree with Majewski and O’Brien (1987:153)
that molded vessels should be grouped on their
own. Plain whiteware vessels became very popular
following the Civil War and continued in
popularity throughout the late nineteenth and early
twentieth
centuries
(Faulkner
2000).
Bacteriological research emerged after the Civil
War, and it was not long before it became widely
known in the medical community that there was a
link between bacteria and disease (Duffy
1978:395). Bacteria could not be seen with the
naked eye, however, and in spite of efforts by
health officials to educate the public with regard to

Historic Materials
Analysis Results
There were seven historic artifacts recovered
during the investigation. The following provides a
descriptive discussion of the types and ages of
artifacts recovered throughout the survey area by
functional group.

Domestic Group

Whiteware (n = 1)
As a ware type, whiteware includes all refined
earthenware that possesses a relatively nonvitreous, white to grayish-white clay body.
Undecorated areas on dishes exhibit a white finish
under clear glaze. This glaze is usually a variant
combination of feldspar, borax, sand, nitre, soda,
and china clay (Wetherbee 1980:32). Small
amounts of cobalt were added to some glazes,
particularly during the period of transition from
pearlware to whiteware and during early ironstone
manufacture. Some areas of thick glaze on

homogeneous texture. The paste may vary from
gray to brown, depending on the clay source, and
length and intensity of the firing.

the connection between illness and bacteria, most
people still held to the filth and miasmic theories
of disease (Rogers 1997:550). As the public
became more educated on the subject, these ideas
merged, and it became commonly thought that
plain, undecorated wares were best suited for
maintaining and serving bacteria-free food. That
is, the public equated the simple, “clean”
appearance of undecorated wares with the purity
(i.e., bacteria-free) and cleanliness of what they
were eating. The ceramic manufacturing industry
followed suit in this line of thinking and met
market demands, producing primarily plain wares
which resulted in increased competition between
whiteware and ironstone manufacturers.

Because this ware is fired at such high
temperatures, its body is nonporous and well
suited to liquid storage. Stoneware, as mentioned,
was not typically manufactured as a refined ware
(such as its cousin, ironstone, or eighteenthcentury refined white salt-glazed stoneware), and
hence, it was, for the most part, utilized for
utilitarian activities associated with jars, churns,
crocks, tubs, jugs, mugs, pans, and pots. These
vessels were typically glazed, with salt glazing and
slip glazing most common.

Purity crusades also indirectly helped increase
the popularity of plain, white vessels in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as social
reformers—many of whom were white and middle
class—focused on cleaning up city streets,
improving sanitation, and ridding cities of disease
epidemics. Part of this crusade was the public
promotion of purity at the dinner table.
Unfortunately, many of these white public health
reformers were also motivated by Social Darwinist
ideas, and sanitation problems and disease
epidemics were often blamed on African
Americans and East-European immigrants who
were stereotyped as being the harbingers of disease
and social decay (Friedman 1970:123).

Although refined salt glazing was practiced in
England during the eighteenth century, by 1780,
the production of English salt-glazed tableware
had been virtually supplanted by the manufacture
of cream colored earthenwares (Lewis 1950:29).
The salt-glazing technique continued to be utilized
for utilitarian vessels, however, and was
eventually introduced to the United States in the
early-nineteenth century. Salt glazing was
accomplished by introducing sodium chloride into
the kiln during the firing process, at which point
the salt quickly volatilized. The vapor reacted with
the clay to form a sodium aluminum silicate glaze
(see Billington 1962:210; Dodd 1964:239). The
surface of the glaze is typically pitted, having what
is commonly known as an “orange peel” effect.

One undecorated, plain whiteware sherd was
recovered during the current project. It is large
enough to appear to have been part of a plain
vessel without decoration, and was assigned a date
of 1860–1930 (Majewski and O’Brien 1987:119).
The vessel type could not be inferred.

The stoneware sherds recovered reflect the
glaze described above. As discussed above, the
recovered stoneware dates from around 1780
through the early to mid-twentieth century and is
therefore a poor temporal marker.

Stoneware (n = 1)

Architecture Group

Stoneware served as the “daily use” pottery of
America, particularly rural America, after its
introduction during the last decade of the
eighteenth century. By 1850, this ware generally
replaced coarse redware as the primary utilitarian
ware used in American households. Stoneware is
a semi-vitreous ware manufactured of a naturally
fine, but dense, clay. The pottery was fired longer
and to a higher temperature than earthenwares; a
kiln temperature of at least 1,200 to 1,250 degrees
Celsius had to be obtained (Cameron 1986:319;
Dodd 1964:274–275). As a result, stoneware

The architecture group is comprised of
artifacts directly related to buildings, as well as
those artifacts used to enhance the interior or
exterior of buildings. These artifacts consist of a
nail and construction materials in the current
assemblage. The architecture group items are
discussed below.

Nails
There are three stages recognized in the
technological chronology of nails: wrought nails,
14

made bricks manufactured at the construction site
continued to be popular as late as the 1880s
(Walters 1982:126–128).

cut nails, and wire-drawn nails. Each of these
technological changes is temporally diagnostic.
Wrought nails were handmade and were the
primary type of construction fastener in the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Their
use ended around 1810 with the widespread use of
square cut or machine cut nails (Nelson 1968:8).

The shift from hand-made bricks to machinemade bricks occurred circa 1880. Although
machine-made bricks were produced in factories
in most major cities in the United States by the
mid-nineteenth century, this process was not
standardized or popularized until the last two
decades of the nineteenth century (Holley
2009:97). The creation of the National Brick
Manufacturers Association in 1886 allowed for an
industry-wide discussion of standardization. This
push came mostly from architects and building
contractors who needed a better standard for
quantity and project cost estimations (Holley
2009:97). Machine-made bricks will often have
marks in the clay related to the machine
manufacturing process (Greene 1992; Gurcke
1987). This brick type is typically more uniform in
shape, and the paste is more consistent throughout.

The cut nail, introduced in approximately
1800, originally had a machine-cut body with a
hand-made head. Around 1815, crude machinemade heads replaced hand-made heads on cut
nails, and overall, cut nails replaced wrought nails
in the construction industry. Early fully machinecut nails exhibit a “rounded shank under the head,”
and therefore, often appear pinched below the head
of the nail (Nelson 1968:8). By the late 1830s,
these “early” fully machine-cut nails were
replaced with “late” fully, or modern, machine-cut
nails.
The first wire-drawn nails were introduced
into the United States from Europe by the midnineteenth century. These early wire nails were
primarily used for box construction and were not
well adapted for the building industry until the
1870s. Although the cut nail can still be purchased
today, the wire nail nearly universally replaced it
by the turn of the twentieth century (Nelson
1968:8).

The brick in the current assemblage consists of
two highly fragmentary pieces which are too small
and incomplete to assign to one of the categories
described above. The fragments therefore provide
little temporal data. The remaining material in this
class was identified as mortar. One mortar
fragment was recovered and was not assigned
specific dates.

Only one machine cut nail was recovered from
the project area. This nail was heavily corroded,
but was complete. It appears to be a fully machine
cut, late variant, which were in use from the 1830s
until the 1870s and can still be purchased today.

Faunal Group
One small bone cortical fragment was
recovered from the site. This appears to be a
cortical fragment from a large mammal. This
group of materials is typically associated with
subsistence, but given the limited quantity of bone
it is not clearly associated with the historic
component at the site as these materials also occur
in natural contexts. This artifact provides no
additional information.

Construction Materials
Construction materials refer to all elements of
building construction. For this project, the building
materials collected included brick and mortar.
The brickmaking industry was one of the most
localized of all nineteenth-century industries
(Walters 1982:125). It was far less expensive to
produce bricks on site than to pay to ship the bricks
from another location. In fact, a brickmaker could
transport everything needed to produce enough
bricks for a large building in two wagons.
Although brickmaking was present in the United
States by the late eighteenth century, this industry
did not become popular until circa 1800. Hand-

V. RESULTS

T

ne cultural resource survey was conducted
between April 19 and 21, 2017. Each of the 14
locations was subjected to the field methods
described in Section 3. The field conditions and
details of these methods at each location are
described under the following subheadings,

resources.

precluded the excavations of any shovel tests at
this location. No cultural strata were observed.

Project Area Field
Investigations

Location 14: This location (depicted in Figure 10)
is immediately adjacent to the Brenham
Waterworks Building, which has been listed on the
NRHP since 1990. The corridor for proposed
improvements to the drainage extended to within
approximately 8m (26 ft) of the building to the
north along the western end. Some brick and
mortar rubble that were too small to be retrieved in
the .25 inch screen were observed in one shovel
test, but nothing larger was found. The bank line
had been reinforced with concrete to the east and
there was a stone wall to the west closer to the
Waterworks Building. Soils along the concrete
banks showed evidence of being fill soils. On the
south bank at the edge of the project area a small
concrete and brick pad was observed. Based on its
location close to the nearby school yard, this pad
may have been a storage shed or outhouse. This
brick pad is on the edge of the proposed drainage
reconstruction project area and is recommended
for avoidance during construction activities.

The methods of investigation and the results of
the investigations at each of the 14 locations are
summarized under their respective headings,
below.
Location 10: This area (depicted in Figure 9) was
accessed through coordination with personnel at
the Waste Water Treatment Plant because the
location was behind a chain link fence. The fence
was missing a panel which allowed limited access
as the creek had eroded much of the southern bank
up to the fence along the majority of its length.
Concrete fill was observed on the northern bank
with water out flow pipes coming from the
treatment plant. No evidence of cultural strata was
observed from the south bank. On the north side
the banks were 4.6–6.1 m (15–20 ft) deep with
most slopes found to be near vertical drop offs and
vegetation was very dense. Evidence of recent
reinforcement to the bank line using large broken
concrete was observed, and this could be seen in
one shovel test. No evidence of cultural strata was
observed.

Locations 17 and 18: These locations are depicted
in Figure 10. The northern-most of these areas was
primarily landscaped, but the eastern end at one
time had a water control structure that was
damaged by erosion. Further to the west, what
appeared to have been an old channel had been
filled with clay which differed from the
surrounding soils. No evidence of cultural strata
was observed.

An examination of the 1930 Brenham, TX
Tactical Quadrangle Map (prepared in 1919)
shows that this location was within a developed
area of downtown Brenham (USGS 1930). While
accurate overlay of this map onto the project area
is difficult, it is clear that multiple roads and a
number of structures were present in its vicinity
and the concrete fill on the north bank is likely
related. The 1963 Brenham, TX 7.5-minute
quadrangle map shows that these roads and
structures had been demolished sometime around
or prior to the mid-twentieth century (USGS
1963).

The central of these areas showed evidence of
modern fill added to create a bank line, and the
banks were grass-covered. No evidence of cultural
strata observed.
At the southern-most of these areas, a
walking bridge had been added to cross the
stream for the walking trail. While the bank line
was vegetated, a feature consisting of an intact
course of brick was observed along the west bank.
A shovel test excavated in this area also contained
brick and mortar fragments and one large ceramic
fragment. The brick feature and positive shovel
test were designated as field site L17S001-1 (Site
41WT86) and delineated; the results of
delineations at this site are presented under the
heading corresponding to this site number, below.

Location 11: The vast majority of this location
(depicted in Figure 9) had eroded into creek
sometime prior to the field visit. The entire area
had a greater than 20 degree slope and was heavily
overgrown. It was observed that large quantities of
modern fill had been used to reinforce the bank
line. Slopes on both sides of the drainage

ground surface approximately 30 to 50 cm (1 to
1.5 ft) taller than surrounding land. An area of
standing water was observed to the northwest.
The structure has been significantly undercut by
the running water. Modern fill was observed in
the bank line and creek bottom and may have
been used for construction of the pad. One shovel
test was excavated in this location; no cultural
strata or artifacts were observed beyond modern
fill.

An examination of the 1930 Brenham, TX
Tactical Quadrangle Map (prepared in 1919) and
the 1963 Brenham, TX 7.5-minute quadrangle
maps do not depict any structures in the vicinity
of these locations during the early to midtwentieth century (USGS 1930, 1963). This
suggests that the archaeological remains in this
location were likely demolished prior to 1919.
Locations 19 and 20: These areas are depicted in
Figure 11. Soils in these locations showed signs
of modern fill added to construct the bank line,
and grass covered the banks. Concrete structures
that had been added to assist drainage were
observed in the creek and were in various
conditions. The area appeared to have been
heavily modified, and no artifacts or cultural
strata were observed.

Location 31: Erosion damage took up nearly the
entirety of the northern bank of Big Sandy Creek
at this location (Figure 15). Pipeline and water
line markers were observed where there was no
erosion. A shovel test was placed on the southern
bank in a small area that did not appear eroded,
but it was apparent that the entire location had
previously been impacted by the construction of
the bridge and the two pipelines. Erosion was
observed under bridge. No sign of cultural strata
or artifacts were observed at this location.

Location 22: This mapped location (depicted in
Figure 11) was being developed into part of a
subdivision at the time of the investigations, and
the stream bank was outside the project
boundaries. The mapped project location, and the
adjacent bank line and bridge were examined. No
artifacts or cultural strata were observed.

Identified Cultural Resources
One newly recorded archeological site
(41WT86) was found in Locations 17 and 18 as a
result of the current survey (see Appendix C for a
map showing the location of this resource). Based
on background research, field observations, and
artifact analysis, no additional archeological
work is recommended at this site because of its
lack of potential to provide archaeological
information. The following discussion provides
an overview of the investigations at the newly
recorded archeological site and resultant data
along with justification for the recommendations
for this resource.

Locations 23 and 24: Both Locations 23 and 24
(depicted in Figure 12) appeared to have been
built up to accommodate recent construction but
were heavily damaged during flooding. Shovel
tests were excavated in each area, but no artifacts
were observed, and soils showed no sign of
cultural strata.
Location 25: This area is depicted in Figure 13.
The area adjacent to the bridge had excellent
surface visibility and it could be observed that
modern fill had been used to reinforce the bridge
after a flood event. Large cobbles were observed
on the north side of the bridge so a shovel test was
placed in that area. No artifacts or cultural strata
were observed.

size with a house pier (Figure 17). No other
features were observed during the pedestrian
survey or shovel testing at the site. To the north
of the site were a walking trail and a bridge that
crossed the drainage canal.

Investigation Methods
Site 41WT86 was delineated through shovel
testing on a 10 m (33 ft) grid. Delineation of the
site was oriented on the site datum (Figure 18)
and all delineation shovel tests that were
subsequently excavated at the site were assigned
coordinates based on their position relative to this
shovel test.

Site Description
Site 41WT86 is located north of West
Mansfield Street in the Jackson Street Park. The
site is situated on a terrace on both sides of a
grass-lined drainage canal (Figure 16). It was
initially encountered through shovel testing and
consists of subsurface deposits and a surface
feature. The surface feature encountered during
the field investigations was an apparently intact
course of bricks and mortar that are consistent in

Delineation included a total of six shovel
tests, all of which were positive for cultural
material. When combined with the visual
observed surface scatter; this resulted in site
dimensions of 50 m northeast to southwest and 19
m east to west. Material was recovered from both
banks of the drainage canal.

the site but this was not collected. Additionally, a
brick feature was observed in the western bank of
the drainage canal and may be part of the original
structure at this location.

Profiles observed at Site 41WT86 were
generally similar to those of Cuero sandy clay
loam, which is mapped in the site’s vicinity. A
typical profile, taken from shovel testing at the
site, consisted of 0–40 cm very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) loamy clay; 40–50 cm very
dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy clay. This is
typical of the soil series. Shovel test profiles were
generally consistent throughout the site. Artifacts
were typically recovered from shovel testing to
depth of 20 cm below ground surface with a
maximum depth observed at the site of 40 cm
below ground surface.

Summary and National Register
Evaluation
Site 41WT86 is recommended not eligible
for listing in the NRHP because it is considered
to have a low potential and to be unlikely to add
to our understanding of the history of the area.
Based on the recovered materials and the
feature observed in the field, it is believed that the
site represents the remains of a late nineteenth to
early twentieth century structure of unknown
function. The occurrence of materials on both
banks of and in close proximity to the existing
drainage suggests that the site was heavily
disturbed during previous work associated with
the drainage. The historic activities that
contributed to the formation of this site are
unknown, and the current investigations indicate
that it has a low artifact density and is likely
heavily disturbed.

Artifacts
The Site 41WT86 assemblage suggests the
site includes a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century component of an unknown function.
Historic materials included: 3-construction
material, 2-historic ceramics, 1-metal (nails, etc.),
and 1-bone (see Table 3). A large quantity of
mortar and a moderate amount of pulverized
brick rubble was also observed in shovel tests at

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

The fieldwork resulted in the identification of
one
previously
undocumented
historic
archeological site, 41WT86, within the project
boundary in the southern-most portion of Areas
17 and 18. This is a low-density, subsurface
scatter of artifacts dating to the late nineteenth to
early twentieth century and a surface feature
consisting of what appears to be an intact house
pier. The distribution of materials at the site
suggests that it may have been heavily disturbed
during earlier drainage-related construction
activities. Based on the findings of the fieldwork,
this site is not recommended eligible for listing in
the NRHP, and it is recommended that the area be
considered cleared from an archaeological
perspective. One previously documented
standing structure listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, the Brenham Water Works,
lies immediately adjacent Location 10 and it is
recommended that during construction special
care be taken to avoid impacting the property.
One additional historic feature consisting of an
intact course of bricks was observed just outside
of Location 14 and was therefore not evaluated.
It is recommended that this also be avoided
during construction activities. Because these
resources are outside the limits of the current
project areas, a No Historic Properties Affected
determination is recommended for this project in
support of a categorical exclusion for the
National Environmental Policy Act study.

ultural Resource Analysts, Inc., personnel
completed a records review and cultural
resource survey of 14 drainage rehabilitation
areas within the municipal boundaries of the City
of Brenham, Washington County, Texas. The 14
drainage rehabilitation areas constituted of a total
linear distance of 1,800 m (5,906 ft), and
extended approximately 8 m (25 ft) from the
existing drainages. This cultural resource survey
was conducted at the request of O’Malley Strand
Associates, Inc., on behalf of the City of
Brenham, Texas, in support of drainage
rehabilitation projects that are subject to
regulatory oversight by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
As part of the project, a records review was
conducted utilizing online files on the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission to identify cultural
resources or cultural resource investigations
previously documented within the vicinity of the
project area. In addition, historic maps were
reviewed for the presence of structures within the
survey area. A total of seven previously
documented archaeological sites were located
within the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) records review buffer.
None of the sites are within or immediately
adjacent to any of the project areas presented in
this report. According to data presented on the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no previous
cultural resource projects have been conducted
within the project areas presented in this report.

If any previously unrecorded archeological
materials are encountered during construction
activity, the THC should be notified immediately.
If human skeletal material is discovered, the
construction activities should cease, THC and
local law enforcement should be contacted
immediately, and THC guidelines should be
followed.

The field methodology consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey supplemented by screened
shovel tests. Surface visibility along the drainage
walls varied, and when sufficient was utilized for
surface inspection to detect any artifacts or
cultural soil horizons that had become exposed.
Shovel tests were excavated in areas of low slope
and that also had limited surface visibility (<
30%) due to vegetation or other ground cover.
Areas of fair to high ground surface visibility
(>30%) were investigated via pedestrian survey
only.
