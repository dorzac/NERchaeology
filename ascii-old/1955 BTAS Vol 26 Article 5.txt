The society was organized and chartered in
pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking;
for the study of the history, pre-history and the
rna j or artifacts of man and the fossils representing the past floras and faunas of Texas; for the
encouragement of the proper collection and preservation of such artifacts and fossils in museums
and their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident
thereto.
The

BuLLETIN

is published annually for dis-

tribution to members of the society.

PECULIAR MANOS FROM LOWER
PEASE RIVER VALLEY
JOHN HENRY RAy

Manos are very numerous on surface sites in the Lower
Pease and Red River valleys in Wilbarger County. Many
of these have a shallow concave basin on one side, the
purpose of which is unknown. Krieger has illustrated one
in "Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas,"
p. 306 and Plate 13, A-A' (University of Texas Publication
4640, 1946)

The grinding stones in this area are both of the concave
basin type in which an oval mana was used with rotary
motion, and the flat metate on which a wedge-shaped mano
was used with back-and-forth motion. The peculiar depressions occur on manos which go with both types of grinding
stones, on both one-hand and two-hand manos, and on one of
three heavy pestles used in mortars. They thus appear to be
a common trait among the peoples of this area.
The shape of these depressions varies from circular to
oval with an average length of 31/2 inches and width of 2
inches, the size varying with the size of the mano itself.
The depth is seldom as much as lJ4 inch. Nearly uniform
depth is maintained in the direction of the long axis of
the depression, but this axis is sometimes at an angle with
the long axis of the mano. The surface finish within the
depression is the same as on the surrounding surface of
the same face. These are well-finished manos with both
sides showing use, but the side with the depression shows
less use than the other and may be termed the back side.
There can be little doubt that the depressions were intentionally made in the same way as the rest of the mano;
that is, by pecking and grinding.
One apparent uniformity which is noted is that in nearly
every case, the outer lip on one side of the depression extends downward toward the edge of the mana at its lowest
or thinnest edge. In Plate 17, A the white chalk lines on
20 manos outline the rim of the depression and show where

110

it opens out on one side. An experiment was made, placing
a small marble in the center of each depression; on each
of the 20 manos tested, the marble promptly rolled out
through the low gap.
Also shown (Plate 17, B) are three well-shaped manos,
each having a saucer-shaped depression about 21/z inches
across and 1/s inch deep, but no outlet along the rim. In these
cases, the marble comes to rest in the very center of the
depression.
All the manos so fashioned are sandstone except for three
which are red granite (not shown) .
