Management Summary

In June 2010, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under which LCRA is granted
permission under the Antiquities Code of Texas to conduct cultural resources assessments for LCRA
construction projects. The new MOU replaced a previous memorandum of understanding that the
agencies had entered into in May 2005. The new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology team to conduct
construction monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance and intensive cultural resource surveys on
new and existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines and substations 300 acres or less in size under
authorization of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Antiquities Permit issued for the
calendar year. Such projects are submitted to THC through interim reports that THC reviews and
comments on during a 30-day review process. These reports are then finalized and included in the Annual
Report.
There are now three notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is
for small (less than five acres in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results
of such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights of way (ROW) but may also include
fence repair and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such
projects receive at minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of
previously identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
If warranted, such projects will also undergo field surveys that will typically focus on high-probability
areas where ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance
avoidance areas are then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form and likewise compiled
in the Annual Report for after the fact THC review.
The third exception is for projects that occur in previously disturbed areas of existing LCRA-owned lands
and LCRA ROW easements, including (1) electrical substations, (2) power plants, (3) water and
wastewater treatment plants, (4) routine structural maintenance of existing electrical transmission poles
and (5) pipeline repair or replacement in existing trenches. Under the new MOU, such projects do not
require review by the THC. However, LCRA project managers must coordinate with LCRA
archaeologists early in the planning stage to ensure that no SALs or sites that are eligible (or potentially
eligible) for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are present in the new
construction areas and that the new construction areas have indeed been previously disturbed.
Other projects reviewed by LCRA archaeologists do not require an archaeological survey, typically
because they are in low-probability areas or have been previously evaluated. In such cases, letters are sent
to the THC reviewer explaining the rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports, THC

i

reviews and comments on these within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in the
Annual Report.
From January 1 through December 31, 2013, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted file
searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations and archaeological
monitoring for 54 projects under Antiquities Permit No. 6443. These were conducted in 14 counties,
primarily along the Colorado River and the central part of the Edwards Plateau, but also in south-central,
southeast and west Texas. A total of 1974 acres was assessed, and 1630 acres were actually surveyed.
That included about 1450 acres of a summary report of multiple years of investigations at LCRA-owned
land along portions of the shoreline of Lake Buchanan that were exposed by drought. Projects greater
than 300 acres in size or those that involved testing or mitigation through excavation were conducted
under separate permits either by LCRA staff or consultants and are reported upon separately.
One hundred nine previously unrecorded archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the projects
summarized within this annual report. In total there were 101 prehistoric components and 22 historic
components. An additional 36 previously recorded sites with 36 prehistoric components and 13 historic
components were assessed in regard to specific projects. Of all 145 assessed sites, 88 were considered to
be of undetermined eligibility for formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), one was
considered to be eligible, and two were listed. The listed sites are prehistoric sites 41LL2 and 41LL423,
both located on the southwest side of Lake Buchanan. Site 41LL504, representing the remains of the
second townsite of Bluffton in existence from 1883 to 1937, was assessed as eligible for formal SAL
designation. The 19 other historic sites at Lake Buchanan represent mostly nineteenth and early twentieth
century homesteads, but also include the former site of a cemetery and a small dumping area.
Seventy other prehistoric sites investigated during the Lake Buchanan shoreline survey are considered to
have undetermined SAL eligibility, that is, they are either potentially SAL eligible or of unknown SAL
eligibility. The majority of these sites represent prehistoric campsites, while the rest represent lithic
scatters and lithic procurement areas. While all but two are deflated by wave action and may have limited
research value, their SAL status is considered undetermined because of the lack of sufficient shovel
testing and the fact that many appeared to extend downslope under the waterâs edge at the time they were
recorded.
Collections of artifacts were made from Project 2.13 (Lake Buchanan Shoreline Survey), Project 5.13
(Pace Bend Park Tournament Point Boat Ramp), Project 6.13 (Westcave Preserve Trail and New Acreage
Survey) and Project 52.13 (Travis Countyâs 2013 Parks Improvements). These artifacts have all been
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).
The following is a list of sites that were assessed during the calendar year, and can also be found
associated with specific projects in Table 1. Following each trinomial is an âHâ and/or a âPâ designating
historic and prehistoric components. Sites with a single asterisk are considered to have an undetermined
eligibility for SAL status, two asterisks indicate the site is considered to be SAL eligible, and three
asterisks are for sites that are listed as SALs. Sites without asterisks are considered to be not eligible for
formal SAL status within the project ROW.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2013, LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches,
field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural resource investigations and archaeological
monitoring for 54 projects within LCRAâs traditional statutory district and service area (Figure 1)
reportable to the Texas Historical Commission. These cultural resource investigations were conducted by
LCRA Archaeology Services staff members Daniel J. Prikryl, Andrew F. Malof and Charles A. Hixson
with the aid of contracted archaeologists Charles A. Hixson, Patrick Hatten, Sean C. Zimmerman and
Casey J. Hanson, under the authorization of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6443. Mr. Prikryl, Mr.
Malof and Mr. Hixson were the principal investigators under this permit.

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and cultural
evolution along the river is a goal of LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant than in
others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background for the
Colorado River within the 10-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano Uplift
Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on the
ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Mississippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations that
range from 1,500 ft above mean sea level (ft msl) to 825 ft msl along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and quartzite
for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the Hill
Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the area
as â.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
3

Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther westâ. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country
From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography, and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene- and Miocene-A age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran
et al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
msl in the uplands to 350 ft msl along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop and
Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda counties are composed of
relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces. Relief
is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 feet ft msl in the uplands to 5-10 feet ft msl on the flats
near the river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to other
types of material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene Beaumont
clays predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains (e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon, bison,
sloth) has been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the Sabine
River (Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby beach
(Long 1977).

Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (the Kingsland site), some of the sandy granitic soils
have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope where the
soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination has left
alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on
erosional benches. Because these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archaeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9-ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbs (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9-to-30-ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.

6

In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
understory species such as agarito, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter
grass and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge
tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment, the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result, only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry and yaupon. Anomalous
to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the coastal prairies
in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse bunch grasses
and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered the vegetation
regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of LCRAâs 10-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down into
central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during prehistoric
times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop to Wharton, prehistoric remains
show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977).
At least one attempt to define an East Central Texas prehistoric culture area within the Post Oak
Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the fact that burned rock midden
sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological materials from the Paleoindian and
Archaic periods in East Central Texas and along the coastal portions of the Colorado River drainage are
generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For this reason, the prehistoric Culture
History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established Central Texas chronology. In the Late
Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast are discussed separately from those
inland, as a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident on the coast from the Bay City area
down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all,
the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et alâs (1995) argument that the traditional Central Texas
prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in archeological reports glosses over the wide
range of environmental diversity and the full range of hunter-gatherer adaptations and processes.

7

However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the full range of such prehistoric
adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.
Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two distinct
periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom and Plainview cultures present at
11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game: the Clovis
on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is suggesting
that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or advantageous, but
subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This early Paleoindian
period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of Prewittâs Early
Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt, has been placed
in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as edge grinding
and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382). This has been
termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broader-based pursuits of
the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7,500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers to
it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with Austin
Phase peoples around until about 800 BP, when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994), the
Toyah Phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,
and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but are
in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnsonâs reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons were having to adapt to the widespread extinction of the
large animals that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian Period. Although the big game hunting
nomadic lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations

relatively low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the
Early Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem and include the Gower type first defined at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
1995:Figure 35), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table 2). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table 2). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.âs (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too finegrained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage
coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits in
general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).
9

The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a continuation
of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this time. The
Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at least by
Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the northeast
and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in succeeding
Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted in this
major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time that
Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently bison
are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow-bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison, and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not clear
what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric Period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric Period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewittâs Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back toward a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table 2; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the arrival
of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.
10

In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about A.D. 1000 to about A.D. 1700. During that era, the material assemblage includes
pottery with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray
variations some with asphaltum decorations. During the Historic period and quite probably during the
later part of the Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archaeological data
suggest that the Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis
1996:101). Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the
early spring, and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along
the rivers and creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of
deer and bison were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendants of the Late Prehistoric in the vicinity
of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the cultural
evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas region.
For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated with the
Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The Tonkawa,
generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were immigrants
probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill Country, the
Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European settlement across
eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the native population
prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salleâs expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late seventeenth century, but it was not until the
early eighteenth century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river
(Baumgartner et al. 1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Aguirre
Expedition stopped along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present-day Austin and
Bastrop (Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It was not
until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of settlers
associated with Stephen F. Austinâs third grant that was also known as the âLittle Colony.â

11

Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the âOld Three Hundredâ families on the lower Brazos
and Colorado rivers was well under way. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange in Fayette County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beasonâs Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse Burnam,
who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beasonâs Crossing area in 1822 to march down to
the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378). Downstream in
present-day Wharton County, 25 of the âOld Three Hundredâ families received title to land in that county
in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called Preston, which was located
on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of Wharton (Webb 1952:890). By
the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into eastern Travis County with a chain of
small family forts located at Webberâs Prairie, Coleman Branch, and Fort Prairie (Webb 1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However, none
of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beasonâs Crossing figured prominently, though, in
the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe passage,
Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up to the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain,
plantation-style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers
were originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegelâs
Settlement area in Fayette County in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many
former plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to
other German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as
tenant farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn and sorghum were the
staple crops well into the mid-twentieth century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Smithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormonsâ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983). Settlement along the middle Colorado was well-established by
the mid-1850s (Malof 2008).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webbâs
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
12

Following Webbâs thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley
shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result, most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed LCRA in the late 1930s and early 1940s
dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along the Colorado River in western
Travis, Burnet and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has given way to the development
of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2013, the LCRAâs Archaeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for 54 projects reportable under TAC Permit 6443. Table 1 provides a listing of the project
names, project numbers, interim report numbers (if necessary), dates of investigations and THC
concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status of each project. This table also gives data on
archeological sites that were recorded or revisited during each project, the SAL status of each
archeological site, the amount of acreage involved in each project area, and the county in which each
project is situated.
All but one project completed during 2013 took place within LCRAâs statutory district and service area.
The work was conducted for projects related to development of parks and preserves, new electrical
transmission line and substation construction, upgrades and overhauls of existing electrical transmission
lines, and repairs and upgrades to LCRAâs irrigation system. One major project involved the shoreline
survey of areas exposed by recent droughts on Lake Buchanan.

Part I. Full Reports of Survey Investigations
During calendar year 2013 there were 13 projects that required immediate reporting to the THC. These
were for survey projects that were larger than 5 acres in size and/or contained cultural resource sites that
might be impacted by a particular project. The projects included survey investigations for new trails and
camping and boat ramp facilities in LCRA park lands, other maintenance activities in LCRA parks, three
new electrical substations, two new electrical transmission line projects, and three electrical transmission
line upgrade projects. All 14 of these projects were reviewed by the THC and in each case the
recommendations by LCRA staff were agreed to.

Project in Travis County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to construct a small camping area in the Turkey
Bend Resource Area, a park on the north shore of Lake Travis in Travis County (Figure 4). The proposed
camping area is located on a spur of the high Pleistocene terrace that projects southwards towards the
floodplain of the now inundated Colorado River channel. The area is currently undeveloped except for the
main park road that runs north to south along the middle of the spur. Construction will include a paved
3.65 m (12 ft) wide one-way driveway, parking spaces for 12 vehicles, and six concrete tent pads (Figure
5). Additional proposed improvements include picnic tables, grills, fire pits and lantern hangars. The
construction will take place within a 1.26 acre area.
This area was included in the 317 acre brush clearing project in 2011 that inadvertently caused minor to
moderate damage to 13 archeological sites. A letter was sent to the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
describing these impacts and measures that LCRA will take to prevent future mishaps (Prikryl 2011).
Evidence of this clearing could still be seen in the current project area in the form of shredded vegetation
and shallow ruts and scraps a few centimeters deep. There were also signs of more extensive ground
disturbances in the form of dirt piles, the largest being 8 m across and about 80 cm high (Figure 6).
However, these piles did not look recent and could date to the construction of the main park road or
earlier. A detailed contour map commissioned by the LCRA in 1936, shows the general area under
cultivation.
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted on January 18, 2013, resulting in the recording of
one new prehistoric site, 41TV2415. The site appears to cover the entire project area and probably
extends outside the project area westward on the opposite side of the existing park road. Shovel tests
indicate that various parts of the site contains low to moderately high amounts of debitage in the upper 32
cm of soil that has developed over the Pleistocene gravels. These artifacts have apparently become buried
through pedoturbation and are presumed temporally mixed. Although a small amount of burned rock was
encountered in one shovel test (1.15 kg), no intact features or evidence of organic preservation was found.
The portion of the site within the project area is assessed as having low research potential and this part of
the site is thus assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
It is recommended that the construction of the camping area be allowed to proceed.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual State Antiquities
Permit Number 6443. There is no Federal funding or permitting involved that requires a Section 106
review. The project had a âno collectionâ policy, so there are no artifacts that will require curation.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in the eastern part of the Edwards Plateau. The underlying geology is mapped
as belonging to the Sycamore sand (Barnes 1981). However, on-site inspection found that gravels,
presumably of Pleistocene age, are exposed on the surface or lie immediately beneath a thin layer of soil.
These gravels are most evident along the upper slope at the south end of the project area and were also
encountered in all but the northernmost shovel test (see below).
The project area occupies the eastern half of a narrow projection or spur of the upper terrace on the
interior (north side) of a meander of the Colorado River known as Turkey Bend. The river channel, which
is now inundated by the Lake Travis reservoir, lies about 400 meters to the southeast. A small seasonal
tributary runs 350 m to the west.
The soils on this landform have been mapped as Travis gravelly soils (Werchan et al. 1974). These soils
occur on stream terraces and derive from loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. A typical soil profile shows
gravelly sandy loam from ground surface to 45 cm (18 inches), gravelly sandy clay from 45 to 127 cm (18
to 50 inches), and gravelly sandy clay loam from 127 to 191 cm (50 to 75 inches) of gravelly sandy clay
loam. Shovel testing during the survey usually encountered a surface zone of gravelly loam of 30 to 42
cm (12 to 17 inches) thickness over a gravelly clay zone with abundant cobbles of quartz, chert, and
limestone.
A live oak woods covers most of the project area except for the northwest corner which is more open with
a few scattered cedar elm and hackberry trees (Figure 7). Cedar (juniper) is also present, as well as Texas
persimmon, whitebrush, yucca, and prickly pear. Much of the brush has been cleared leaving little
understory in most places. There are enough opens areas for a fairly thick covering of grasses and forbs.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Small cultural resource surveys for construction projects have been conducted within the Turkey Bend
Resource Area since 1977. These along with inventory surveys done by LCRA archeologists have
resulted in the recording of 78 archeological sites. A comprehensive draft report of all of these surveys
has recently been completed by Malof et al. (2012) and will be reported in the LCRAâs upcoming draft
Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar Year 2012. This report on Turkey Bendâs
cultural resources was partially completed in response to the previous mentioned damage to cultural
resource sites during a brush clearing project in 2011. Sites that are described in this survey report include
prehistoric campsites, burned rock middens, rockshelters, lithic scatters and chert procurement locales.
Most of the historic sites represent the remains of late nineteen and early twentieth century farmsteads. A
few historic trash scatters, some with stone features, have also been recorded.
Recorded sites near the project area include 41TV1855, located several hundred meters to the northwest.
It is described as a prehistoric procurement site containing cores and early stage bifaces. Site 41TV1860
is another procurement site located about 30 m to the east along the full pool elevation of the lake. While
in horizontal distance this site extends fairly close to the project area, in vertical distance it lies 20 ft
below the project area below the high terrace.

METHODOLOGY

An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted for the entire 1.26 acre project area. First the
project area was walked over and the ground surface inspected for cultural material. Ground visibility was
limited to small scattered areas where erosion had removed vegetation. Four shovel tests were judiciously
placed across the proposed construction area to assure even coverage (Figure 8). These shovel tests
exceed the THCâs minimum number of tests required of an intensive archeological survey of 1.26 acre.
These tests were placed in nearly level areas estimated to be 1 to 3 percent slopes. The terraces edges with
steeper slopes and surface cobbles were avoided during shovel testing. Each test consisted of a circular
hole 35 cm in diameter and dug in 20 cm levels to the Clay B horizon. One test (Shovel Test 2) was
stopped just above the clay because of a large tree root. Recovered artifacts were photographed, listed on
a shovel test form, and returned to the hole during refilling. No artifacts were collected for curation. A
soil profile was also recorded for each shovel test.
RESULTS
One new archeological site, 41TV2415, was recorded. This site extends across the entire project area and
probably beyond (see Figure 8). It contains a light surface scatter of debitage as well as buried cultural
material that appears to be concentrated in the central part of the project area. The artifact recovery from
the four shovel tests is shown in Table 1 and in Figure 9 through Figure 12. Debitage counts range for a
high of 23 pieces for Shovel Test 2, which was placed in the central area, and low of 3 pieces for Shovel
Test 3, placed at the north end of the site and farthest from the terrace edge.
According to the contour map (see Figure 8), this area of artifact concentration occurs at the highest
elevation in the survey area, although this is hard to discern in the field. Shovel Test 2 also recovered five
mussel shell umbos and nine burned rocks. Six of these burned rocks were recovered on the screen, but
three were recorded still in the southeast wall of the test hole. They rest at 32 cm below the surface on top
of or slightly within the cobbles that directly underlie the loamy top soil. The burned rocks range in size
between 5 to 8 cm and weigh a total of 1.15 kg. Seven of the rocks appear to be quartzite, along with one
quartz and one chert. The test was expanded slightly to the southeast to determine if the burned rocks
continued. No other burned rocks were encountered and it appears that they are not part of a larger feature
such as hearth. No charcoal or soil staining was observed in the fill or wall of this test.
Shovel Test 2 was stopped at 40 cm because of a large tree root. At this point, the test was well into the
cobbles, although no clay was yet encountered. The other three shovel tests placed in the site demonstrate
that the vast majority of cultural material lies within this loamy top soil, which averages about 32 cm in
thickness.
Besides debitage, mussel shell, and burned rock, the only other artifacts recovered in the shovel tests was
a small chert core and a graver. The latter artifact is the only tool recognized at the site. Two larger cores
were noted on the surface during the surface inspection.

SUMMARY

The field survey resulted in the recording of one new archeological site, 41TV2415. It is described as a
prehistoric campsite of undetermined age covering the entire 1.26 acre project area. It probably extends
westwards opposite the park road to include most of the narrow point of the high terrace. Shovel testing
suggests that cultural material rapidly diminishes in density to the north away from the terrace edge.
The upper loamy soil zone ranges from 30 to 42 cm in thickness; the shallower soils have perhaps been
truncated by previous land clearing as evidenced by the old dirt piles. The artifacts are dispersed within
this soil zone with no suggestion of vertically discrete components. Considering the age of the parent
material (Pleistocene terrace deposits), these artifacts have probably been buried by pedoturbation and not
by floodwater sediments. The burned rocks in Shovel Test 2 probably were displaced downwards and
37

until impeded by the cobble zone. The mussel shell, weighing less, stayed suspended in soil above.
Because of the shallow deposits and lack of discrete components, the site does not appear to have high
research value.

RECOMMENDATIONS

One site, 41TV2415, covers the entire project area. The portion of the site within the project area is
assessed as not eligible for SAL designation because of the shallow deposits and disturbances. Since the
construction of the camping area will not impact any SAL-eligible cultural resource sites, the proposed
project should be allowed to proceed without any restrictions. As always, standard emergency procedures
will be in place.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRAâs Transmission Services Corporation (LCRA TSC) proposes to construct a new substation
adjacent to existing transmission line T-518 near the city of Lockhart in central Caldwell County (Figure
13). The 3-acre substation will be built on 6.75 acres and will be owned and operated by LCRA TSC. The
substation will tie in to the existing transmission line by way of a new support structure located on the
opposite side of a road about 200 ft north of the substation boundary (Figure 14).
Since the property is near Boggy Creek, LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff and contracted personnel
conducted a cultural resources survey in February 2013, in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and LCRA.
The work followed minimum survey and reporting standards established by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and adopted by THC. There is no known or anticipated federal funding or permitting
involved with this project.
The investigation documented one previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological site, 41CW150. The
site consists of a small amount of dispersed fire-cracked rock, lithic debitage and a few cores. It has been
destroyed by historic land management activities and is not considered eligible for State Archeological
Landmark status.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project is within the northern Blackland Prairie region of central Texas and lies between the Balcones
Escarpment and a band of oak woodlands. The Blackland Prairie is characterized by a âcoincidence of the
soils, vegetation, land cover and geology patternsâ (Griffith et al. 2007:61). The distinctive black
Vertisols formed over Cretaceous-aged deposits and originally supported tall grass prairie between
riparian corridors. Most of the original prairie vegetation has been converted to cropland.
Geologically, the project area is mapped as within the Eocene-aged Midway Group and Pleistocene-aged
Leona Formation fluviatile terrace deposits (Barnes 1974). The Midway Group is comprised largely of
clay, silt and sand and can grade to mudstone of the Midway Group. The Leona Formation is a broad,
isolated terrace within the present Plum Creek arm of the Guadalupe River drainage system and consists
of sand, clay and gravel.
The substation site straddles a break between Branyon clay and Seawillow clay loam, part of the
Branyon-Lewisville association â deep calcareous, clayey soils over clay and clay loam (Lowther and
Werchan 1978). Branyon clay formed in clayey alluvium and is generally almost level. The soil profile
described in 1978 has been updated (SoilWeb) and is now described as a 12-inch, dark gray, clay A
horizon over a series of slickenside B horizons to a depth of more than 80 inches. Seawillow soils have a

dark brown, 6-inch Ap clay loam horizon over a series of Bk clay loam horizons before the final BCk
horizon.
The substation will be located on a west-trending lobe about 150 m east of and 20 to 30 ft above Boggy
Creek, about 800 m northeast of the junction of Boggy Creek and the Clear Fork of Plum Creek. The
Clear Fork runs some 16 km before joining Plum Creek, which in turn feeds the Guadalupe River.
Although the location fronts recently completed State Highway (SH) 130, aerial imagery shows the
project area within relatively undisturbed pasture (Figure 15).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is within the central Texas archaeological region. (A detailed cultural history will be

report will be included.)

According to Elizabeth Smyrl (2013), Caldwell County was originally part of Green DeWittâs colony,
with most early settlement along Plum Creek and the San Marcos River, occurring as early as the 1830s.
The Runaway Scrape caused a ripple in the settlement sequence as did trouble with Indians until the
Battle of Plum Creek in 1840.
The population increased to almost 4,500, with close to 35 percent slaves, following the designation as
Caldwell County in 1848. Fentress, Martindale and Lytton Springs became established towns and
Lockhart was named the county seat.
Caldwell County voted overwhelmingly in favor of secession and numerous residents entered the
Confederate Army. Racial hostilities appeared during Reconstruction and Caldwell County has remained
politically conservative.
Economic woes followed the Civil War, but by 1880 the county economy saw improvement with cattle,
the railroad and growing industries. By the 1890s cotton supplanted cattle as the economic mainstay and
sharecropping became common. Hispanics were part of the migrant labor pool and many stayed,
becoming roughly 40 percent of the total population during the latter part of the 20th century.

44

Oil was discovered in 1922, creating a fairly short-lived economic boom, which buffered some effects of
the Great Depression. The overall population fell throughout the middle part of the last century as smaller
farms gave way to larger operations. People began moving back to some of the population centers after
the 1960s.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

At present there are approximately 150 recorded archaeological sites listed in THCâs Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas. Around Lockhart, many of the sites are located along drainage systems. The nearest recorded
site to the project area is 41CW78, a historic house site/farmstead about 3.6 km to the north that was still
occupied at the time of construction of SH 130. Lithic scatter 41CW80 is located on a ridge about 1.2 km
to the southwest. In the same vicinity are 41CW6, a large procurement/lithic workshop located on
Lookout Mountain; small, prehistoric camp 41CW18; and larger campsite 41CW29, among others. The
sites to the south are mostly associated with various projects, improvements and oil exploration in
Lockhart State Park.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

Staff considered the locations of previously recorded sites, geology, soils and physiographic information
prior to beginning field work. Staff followed minimum survey standards, with a total of 16 shovel tests
placed within the 6.75-acre parcel and at the location of the new tap structure. Staff excavated tests to a
typical depth of 40 cm, considered adequate for the nonaggrading landform dominated by largely
homogenous clays. Staff assessed the newly recorded site for research potential beyond that available
through its verification (i.e., State Archeological Landmark status). Staff used aerial imagery, topographic
maps and 3 m-accuracy GPS for ground orientation and to record shovel test locations.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The project area was in pasture with moderately dense grass providing about 50 percent ground visibility.
Three archaeologists walked meandering transects flagging artifacts. Staff systematically shovel tested the
project area (15 shovel tests â see appendix for details). While the boundary between the Branyon and
Seawillow soils was not readily apparent, the tests did vary from grayish-brown clay/clay loam to
yellowish-brown clay and typically was over yellowish-brown to brown clay, with subsoils often apparent
around 30 cm. Most tests were excavated to between 40 and 50 cm deep and all recovered artifacts were
within the upper 20 cm.
One previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological site, 41CW150, was documented (Figure 16). The
site consists of a light scatter of fire-cracked rock, perhaps 20 pieces of lithic debitage and three or four
cores, one of which was bidirectional (a thick biface). Although most of the flakes were of hard hammer
production, there were a few soft hammer flakes, and one thin flake with edge damage was found in a
45

shovel test. The debitage was largely decorticate (secondary or tertiary). Combined with the fire-cracked
rock and almost total lack of cobbles, the site is not considered to be a procurement locale but rather a
short-term campsite. The large biface suggests portability rather than simple reduction.
The cultural material was spread over a 70 m-diameter area. Of the 16 total shovel tests, three were
positive for cultural material â a secondary flake and a chunk in ST4 (considered an outlier), the edgedamaged flake at ST7, and a patinated chunk at ST16 (the new tap structure, not considered part of the
site). While the site is presently within pasture, the landform was almost certainly under cultivation in the
past. The cultural material is distributed in a fairly constrained area, so there may have once been a hearth
with associated chipping debris. The site is now destroyed and no further work is considered to be
necessary.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA proposes to construct a new substation on 6.75 acres of land just west of Lockhart. The substation
will tie in to an existing transmission line by way of a new support structure. An intensive cultural
resources investigation resulted in the recording of previously undocumented archaeological site
41CW150, interpreted as a short-term campsite of undetermined age. The site has been destroyed by
historic land use and it is recommended that it not being eligible for formal listing as a State Antiquities
Landmark. No additional investigation or avoidance measures are considered necessary.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

In November, 2012, LCRA Cultural Resource Services submitted a draft report on investigations
conducted for LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposed Cushman to Highway 123
transmission line project (Prikryl et al. 2012). The report summarized investigations on 3.07 highprobability-area miles of the 6.5 mile-long transmission line corridor in which five previously unrecorded
cultural resource sites, 41GU142-41GU146 were documented. These sites consisted of two historic
components and four prehistoric components. Only one site, 41GU142, was recommended for any type of
avoidance, which was accomplished by slight transmission line design modifications and the use of
wooden mats and hand-clearing of vegetation within the sensitive portion of the site. There were no
recommendations for any other types of avoidance at the remainder of the sites. The Texas Historical
Commission concurred with all aspects of the recommendations (Denton 2012), with the understanding
that the SAL status of all five sites remained undetermined outside of the surveyed areas.
Due to access issues a short section of corridor (260 m) was not established and could not be accessed.
Additionally, various temporary construction easements had not yet been determined and there was a
minor route adjustment made along the southern portion of the alignment. Construction easements and
adjustments considered to be within high probability areas were surveyed with shovel testing, as was the
previously unavailable tract of land. The survey areas are designated Areas 1-4 in this report (Figure 17,
Figure 18).
As a result of these investigations, one new prehistoric site, 41GU152 was documented and sites
41GU142, 41GU144 and 41GU145 were slightly enlarged.
Because this report is an addendum to the previously reported investigations, the usual natural and
cultural background sections are not included here, as they can be referenced in the earlier report (Prikryl
et al. 2012) as well as in the annual report in which this draft report will be included. .
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIVE METHODS

The project was developed with survey-level research designed to identify archaeological sites and assess
them for potential eligibility as State Archeological Land marks pursuant to the Antiquities Code of Texas
and the Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA. All work was conducted under TAC
Annual Blanket Permit 6443. There is no known or anticipated federal funding or permitting for this
project.
Construction easements and alignment adjustments were examined in a GIS and compared with
previously determined high probability areas, previously recorded sites and potential new high probability
areas.

Field work was conducted by LCRA and contracted archaeologists during January and February, 2013,
following minimum survey standards and using standard subsurface testing methods appropriate for the
landforms in question. Topographic maps, aerial imagery and GPS were all used to maintain orientation
on the ground. Shovel test information was maintained on standardized log sheets.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

A total of 12.66 acres of land has been determined to be needed for temporary construction areas. This
acreage is made up of a number of small pulling easements, located at angles along the transmission line
where equipment will have to leave the permanent transmission line corridor in order properly tension the
conductor prior to energizing. Approximately 5.96 acres of these easements were within high probability
areas or adjacent to sites previously recorded within the ROW. A minor realignment resulted in the
corridor moving approximately 21.3 m (70 ft) eastward at the location of 41GU145. A previously
inaccessible 260-meter-long portion consisted 1.48 acres. Forty-three shovel tests were excavated within
the total 7.44 acres. Tests were excavated to the maximum depth of expected disturbance â 40 cm â
except at an adjusted structure (Test 33, 41GU145) which was excavated to clay subsoil.

Area 1 â 41GU142 and North Side of Guadalupe River
Eleven tests were excavated within 2.58 acres of construction easement on both sides of the Guadalupe
River crossing along SH 123 (Figure 19). On the north side of the river the pulling easement had been
partially tested in anticipation of a construction easement but the final configuration required additional
tests. Five tests (39-42) increased the total in the area from four to nine in addition to a backhoe trench
excavated near the angle structure at that location (Figure 20). No artifacts were recovered in any of the
tests and there are no concerns with construction in this area.

41GU142
Site 41GU142 was recorded as a potentially eligible site on the south side of the Guadalupe River just
east of where it is crossed by SH 123. Final structure placement was designed to avoid the more
significant portions of the site. Because there is a significant turn in the line at this location pulling
easements to the west and north were investigated. Both within TxDOT ROW, they total about 0.8 acres.
Six shovel tests (1, 2, 16, 17, 18, 25) were excavated within the ROW. Within the six tests were a total of
six pieces of chert debitage, 12 small apparent burned rocks, one mussel umbo and two pieces of modern
glass. Soils were consistently a brown loam to clay loam except for test 25 at the extreme edge of the
river terrace where a narrow band of probable road base was encountered about 23 cm below the ground
surface with dense charcoal, clearly modern, below it to a depth of 40 cm. There are no recommendations
for additional investigations within the TxDOT ROW, although the site boundaries were enlarged to
encompass that area.

Area 2 â Previously Unsurveyed Alignment and Construction Easements; 41GU152
Twelve shovel tests (5-8, 11, 13-15, 19-23) were employed to investigate approximately 420 linear m
(2.55 acres) of previously unsurveyed high probability area and construction easements (Figure 21). This
was primarily along an unnamed south bank tributary of the Guadalupe River that traversed a hackberry
wood and some open pasture at the north end. Soils along the creek were mostly heavy, dark clays and
grayish brown clay loam with no recovery, except at the location of newly recorded site 41GU152.
41GU152
Site 41GU152 was recorded on the previously inaccessible section (Figure 22). The site is about 50 m
north of an unnamed stream that joins the Guadalupe River about 750 m to the northeast. The soils are
mapped as Uhland fine sandy loam. It is within a private backyard (pasture) that has been partially cleared
and laps into the riparian corridor along the stream.
The site is primarily a very light mussel shell and lithic debitage scatter with a limited surface expression.
The site was defined by nine shovel tests, six of which were within the defined site boundary (Tests 3,4,9,
10, 12, 24) and four positive for cultural material (Figure 23). Test 4 contained a patinated flake and a
chert chunk at 20 cm. Test 9 two very small mussel fragments, a small tertiary flake and a large hardhammer flake along with three apparent burned pieces of sandstone between 55 and 70 cm. A weathered
bone on the ground surface at Test 10 was not considered to be prehistoric. Test 12 returned three 5-cm
pieces of apparent burned sandstone at about 60 cm. Test 24 had two mussel shell umbos and several
small fragments along with a single notching flake, also at about 60 cm. It also returned a complete,
patinated Clear Fork tool and a burned clay ball from the root zone of the upper 20 cm (Figure 24).

Figure 23. Shovel testing in vicinity of 41GU152.

Figure 24. Clay ball (left) and Clear Fork tool from 41GU152.

The Clear Fork tool was 72 mm in length, 41 mm wide at the bit end, and had a bit angle of about 65
degrees. The clay ball was 35 mm in diameter and was clearly blackened. It may simply be an incidental
occurrence, perhaps from a burned tree root. A single flake was also seen on the surface of the site.
The site seems to be contained within a small remnant soil; perhaps an old stream terrace that is clearly
different from soils that area immediately adjacent, in particular along the stream. Shovel tests along the
creek encountered very dark, heavy clay, rather than the mapped Uhland fine sandy loam. Soils to the
59

west are mapped as Sunev loam. Site 41GU152 could actually be in either of these two types.
Importantly, the soil at the structure location (Test 11) was markedly different (a grayish brown clay) with
no evidence of the soil horizons found within the siteâs boundaries.
Test 11 was placed at the location of a proposed transmission line structure about 6 m northeast of Test 4
within the site boundary. Test 4 was excavated to 80 cm primarily in brown silt loam. Test 11
encountered 50 cm of heavy grayish brown clay. Negative Test 22, about 8 m southeast of the site was
also excavated through clay loam into clay. Negative Test 8, about 8 m southwest of the site had 25 cm of
grayish brown clay loam over brown silty loam.
The site boundary within the project area is well defined and should not be impacted by structure
placement. Given the near-surface context of the Clear Fork tool and clay ball the only questionable area
is within the ROW extending northward for a distance of 10 m from the defined site prior to the ROW
entering previously tested cleared pasture. It is therefore recommended that clearing be accomplished by
way of a brush hog or similar equipment that will leave root systems intact.
Area 3 - North Side of Cottonwood Creek and 41GU145.
Seven additional tests (31-37) were placed in the 1.2-acre construction easement on the north side of
Cottonwood Creek making a total of 17 in this area, the majority of which are within 41GU145 (Figure
25). Importantly, there was a slight change in alignment that resulted in a new structure about 13 m east
of the previously proposed structure location. Test 33 was excavated here to a depth of 80 cm,
encountering reddish brown sandy clay at 70 cm. Only Test 31 was not within the new boundary of
41GU145 â the soils within the lower pasture are markedly different (more clay) than those at a slightly
higher elevation. Test 31 was also placed at the realistic end of the construction easement, as the land
drops quickly to the creek at this point.

41GU145
Site 41GU145 was expanded slightly to the east as a result of shovel testing. The recovered material from
the tests was consistent with the rest of the site and consisted of small fragments of burned chert and
sandstone and small chips and flakes, sometimes in moderate amounts. The sandy soils have clearly been
turbated and there is no evidence of discrete or intact cultural zones. A small gravel outcrop in the area
immediately around Test 34 may partially explain site placement, although the site is clearly not a lithic
procurement locale (Figure 26).
This site was previously assessed as ineligible for formal SAL status and the additional work has not
changed that assessment. There are no recommendations for any additional work or avoidance in this
area.

Area 4 â South Side of Cottonwood Creek; 41GU144
Six additional shovel tests (27-30, 38) were placed within the 1.3 acres of construction easement in this
area, adding to the 21 previously excavated in the adjacent alignment. The area is open pasture to the
south and low woods to the north. Soils were deep, soft sands except on north-facing slopes where they
were shallow gravelly sand over clay. All new tests were considered to be within 41GU144 (Figure 27).

41GU144
Site 41GU144 was previously recorded as a lithic scatter with burned rocks along with a historic trash
scatter that may have been associated with a structure, the location of which could never be positively
identified. The site was assessed as ineligible for formal SAL status. The new tests found similar
materials (chips and flakes, burned chert and sandstone, a small amount of historic glass and metal), and
as at 41GU144, in disturbed sandy matrix. At the south end of the construction easement feral pigs had
recently severely disturbed the pasture and very few artifacts were seen within the soil (Figure 28). An
intact Fairland point was found on the surface, one of the few identifiable projectile points found during
the entirety of the project (Figure 29). This point helps place land use to the Late Archaic period, here
typified by a high sandy ridge or lobe located 200 m or more from present stream channels. This is similar
to 41GU143 where two Early Triangular (possibly Tortugas) points were found and suggests settlement
patterning that could be explored further. Regardless, 41GU144 is not considered to be SAL-eligible
within the project area and no additional work or avoidance measures are felt to be necessary.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

64

Following completion and acceptance of recommendations of a report submitted to THC in late 2012, a
small amount of additional high probability area was surveyed by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff
in early 2013. This new acreage consisted of construction (pulling) easements and a short section of
alignment that had no previously been accessible due to landowner constraints. Forty-three shovel tests
were excavated within 7.44 acres. Sites 41GU142, 41GU144 and 41GU145 were slightly enlarged. Sites
41GU144 and 41GU145 were previously determined ineligible for formal SAL status. The new work did
not change these recommendations.
Site 41GU142 was determined to be potentially eligible for formal SAL status, but a slight route
adjustment avoided the more sensitive portions of the site, and along with hand clearing of vegetation
these portions of the site were avoided. The expansion of the site into TxDOT ROW will not impact any
known potentially significant deposits.
One previously unrecorded site, 41GU152, was documented. This site consists of a very sparse zone of
mussel shell fragments, debitage and possible burned sandstone about 60 cm below the ground surface.
Importantly, the structure in the vicinity of the site is considered to be outside the siteâs boundary. The
presence of a Clear Fork tool and probable burned clay ball in near-surface context indicates that minimal
avoidance measures are prudent. It is recommended that clearing of vegetation be done with shredding
equipment rather than bulldozers. This will leave root systems intact and minimize ground disturbance.
In sum, there are two sites with recommendations for avoidance/impact minimization. Previous
recommendations for structure placement, hand-clearing of vegetation and matt for heavy equipment
travel will be maintained at 41GU142. At 41GU152 a small portion of ROW is recommended for noninvasive clearing methods. Otherwise, standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.

in the Pace Bend Park in Travis County, Texas

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Travis County is proposing to build a new low water boat ramp near Tournament Point in the Pace Bend
Park located on the south shore of Lake Travis in Travis County (Figure 30). The county, which operates
the park, leases the Pace Bend tract from the Lower Colorado River Authority. Travis County acquired
funding for the project through the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and will use their own building
contractors to construct the ramp.
The project area lies entirely below the full pool elevation of 681 feet above mean seal level (msl) of the
lake (Figure 31). The proposed boat ramp is 107 m ( 350 ft) long and 6.1 m (20 ft) wide, descending from
the high river terrace at its north end at approximately 665 feet amsl, and traversing the lower terrace and
terrace slope to end at the present shoreline at 631 feet msl (Figure 32). The lower terrace slope is
currently being used as an informal boat ramp because of its low grade. Subsurface ground impacts will
be caused by ground leveling as well as by the installation of two concrete and rebar footings to help
stabilize the lower end of the ramp on the softer sediments. These 1 m (3 ft) deep footings will be 45 cm
(1.5 ft) wide and extend across the width of the boat ramp at elevations of 649 and 639 feet. Therefore,
they have the potential to impact buried archeological components.
Although the LCRA is not directly involved in the construction of the proposed boat ramp, as a courtesy
to Travis County, the LCRA agreed to have their Cultural Resources staff conduct a cultural resources
survey of the project area. A review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THCâs) Sites Atlas showed
that two previously recorded archeological sites intrude slightly into the 10 meter wide buffer zone
arbitrarily set by Cultural Resources staff (Figure 33). Site 41TV2180 lies mostly beyond the north end of
the project area, and is described as a massively eroded prehistoric campsite. The other site, 41TV2357, is
a twentieth century cattle dipping vat located immediately west of the project area.
The cultural resources survey, which was conducted on February 11, 2013, found that the project area
runs through a portion of a previously unrecorded prehistoric component of 41TV2357 that lies to the east
of the cattle dipping vat. Several burned rocks, about a dozen pieces of chert debitage, and one Scallorn
arrow point were seen on the surface. This new area of 41TV2357 has undergone severe erosion from
waves and further impacts by vehicular traffic. No subsurface cultural material was recovered during
shovel testing and it appears that all cultural deposits have eroded onto the present ground surface.
Further investigations outside the project area found that the prehistoric component covers most of the
southwestern corner of Tournament Point as it currently is exposed due to the draught. Over nearly all this
area, cultural material is sparse except in the area south and west of the dipping vat. There, burned rock
and debitage was seen eroding out of apparently intact sediments immediately above the present (631
foot) shoreline, beginning 15 m (49 ft) west of the western edge of the proposed boat ramp buffer zone
and extending 60 m (197 ft) westwards.
The only evidence of 41TV2180 within 30 m (98 ft) of the project area was a flake and a tested cobble,
and the main part of this site must lie some distance to the north. Construction crews will access the north
end of the project area using an existing truck path entering from the east, thereby avoiding the areas of
undetermined significance of 41TV2180 north of the survey area.

The LCRA recommends that the boat ramp project be allowed to proceed since it is located in portions of
41TV2357 and 41TV2180 that are not considered eligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. The LCRA will work with Travis County to assure that the potentially significant deposits of
41TV2357 west of the project area will not be impacted. In addition, the LCRA will place a temporary
orange mesh and T-bar fence between the buffer zone and these deposits. One positive benefit of this
project will come from boats being able to launch on a concrete ramp instead of using the unpaved terrace
slope, which in the recent past has led to more erosion and damage to the 41TV2357 deposits.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit Number 6443 issued to the LCRA under the terms of the Memorandum of
Understanding between the LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). There is no Federal
funding or permitting involved that requires a Section 106 review. Three artifacts collected during the
survey, all projectile points, will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. The LCRA
asks for your concurrence with our assessments and recommendations.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau about 30 miles west of the
Balcones Escarpment. The underlying geology of the Pace Bend tract consists of Cretaceous Cow Creek
limestone in the lower elevations along the valley edge bluffs, Hensell Sand at higher elevations covering

75

shown as black circles.
about half the tract, and at even higher elevations the Glen Rose formation covering most of the north end
of the tract. (Barnes 1981). Cow Creek limestone has a honeycomb appearance due to dissolved fossils.
76

The Colorado River has eroded deeply into this formation creating sheer bluffs along most of the eastern
edge of Pace Bend. Tournament Point is one of the few places where this natural barrier to the river has
been breached. Holocene, and perhaps Pleistocene alluvium have built up to create the point, hemmed in
by limestone outcrops to the east and west. Shovel testing during the current project found that the lower
area near the present shoreline is composed of about three feet of brown silty clay over smooth, flat
limestone. The upper end of the project consists of a high terrace composed of river gravels of chert and
quartz with frequent limestone outcrops. These outcrops are most prominent on the terrace slope between
the lower and higher terraces.
The soils in the project area have not been mapped in recent times because they lie below the full pool
elevation of the lake. In any case, erosion from waves has removed the upper zone over all the exposed
areas of Tournament Point (Figure 34 and Figure 35). In some places several feet of soil have washed
away, as demonstrated by the exposed parts of the dipping vat that were originally underground (Figure
7). Use of the area to put in boats from trailers has also led to erosion and gullying originating from tire
ruts (see Figure 6). Large areas of the lower terrace and lower terrace slope were devoid of ground cover
at the time of the survey. What little vegetation was present consisted of sparse Bermuda grass and
scattered rattlebush.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Preston Millican, an avocational archeologist and LCRA employee, recorded archeological sites in the
Lake Travis area during 1963 and 1964 (TARL files). Two of these sites, later given the trinomial
designations of 41TV132 and 41TV169, represent rockshelters located in Pace Bend. Site 41TV132
appears to be the more significant of the two in that it also has the only recorded burned rock midden at
Pace Bend above the full pool of Lake Travis. In 1985, Espey, Huston & Associates 1985 conducted a
survey of Pace Bend Park for Travis County, which operates the park, for planning land management
purposes (EH&A 1985). The survey resulted in the recording of 31 sites and 33 isolated finds in areas
above the conservation pool. The archeologists noted that all these sites have been impacted, principally
by erosion but also by vandalism in a few cases. Nearly all these sites are lithic scatters and lithic
procurement locales, with only four containing burned rock features. Two of these four sites, including
Millicanâs 41TV132, were recorded previous to EH&Aâs survey.
In 1988 an LCRA archeologist conducted a survey for a project named the Bergstrom Recreation Area
Survey Upgrade (TARL files). This area is located in the southern part of the Pace Bend tract. The exact
area covered by the survey is not known but it did result in the recording of a fifth prehistoric site,
41TV1375, containing burned rock. Most of the cultural material was seen in a dirt road that bisected the
site. A garbage dump with car parts was also noted. Although the archeologist had stated that the site had
been almost completely destroyed by bulldozing, he also recommended that care be taken in this area if
construction is planned, implying the possibility of intact cultural deposits.

LCRA archeologists conducted another survey within the former Recreation Area in 2008 for the Oak
Wilt Remediation and Containment Project (Kiker 2009). The survey resulted in the recording of one
new site, 41TV2286, a shallowly buried lithic scatter. Efforts were also made to relocate 41TV169 and
41TV966 which lies just outside the present project area, both apparently destroyed by road construction
and wave action, respectively. In 2012, LCRA archeologists surveyed the rest of the former Recreation
78

Area along with areas of the Pace Bend tract to the south for a brush clearing project (Hixson 2013). No
new sites were located during the survey but the boundaries of five of the previously recorded sites,
41TV968, 41TV971, 41TV972, 41TV1375, and 41TV2286 were expanded. Also, a previously
undetermined historic component of 41TV1375 was recorded. It represents a homestead apparently
abandoned before or during the last decade of the nineteenth century. No intact archeological deposits
relating to this historic component were found, but intact prehistoric deposits belonging to this site were
located and recommended for avoidance.
Six archeological sites have been recorded at Tournament Point below the full pool elevation of 681 feet
amsl. Five of these were recorded during 2005 and 2006 by Bob Wishoff, then an avocational
archeologist and member of the Travis County Archeological Society and the South Texas Archeological
Association. As currently plotted, one of Wishoffâs sites (41TV2180) extends slightly into the northern
buffer zone (see Figure 33). Wishoff described it as a prehistoric campsite and noted that it had undergone
massive erosion.
Another site at Tournament Point, 41TV2357, was recorded by LCRA archeologists in 2009 during an
inventory survey. The site contained the remains of a twentieth century concrete cattle dipping vat (Figure
36). Immediately to the south lies a concrete slab that was probably was once attached to the exit end of
the vat. No other cultural material was noted other than concrete and metal fragments belonging to the
vat. A light scatter of whiteware and aqua and purple bottle glass was noted about 200 meters northwest
of the dipping vat.

METHODOLOGY
An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted within the path of the proposed boat ramps as well
as within a 10 meter wide buffer zone (see Figure 33). The buffer zone was expanded at the north end of
the project area to include the southern half of 41TV2180, as it is currently plotted. The survey consisted
of surface inspection of this entire area along with shovel testing on the lower terrace and lower terrace
slope (see Figure 33). Shovel testing was not done on the upper terrace because subsurface impacts there
will be shallow and the finding in the field that the upper terrace is covered by cobbles with frequent rock
outcrops. A shovel test was placed at each of the two footing locations midway along their length. Shovel
Test 1, placed at the 639 foot footing was dug to a depth of 100 cm, four inches below the proposed depth
of the footing. Shovel Test 2 was placed at the 649 footing location, and reached a depth of 90 cm (3
feet). In addition, two other shovel tests (3 and 4) were placed in the buffer zone to the east and west the
proposed boat ramp where heavy machinery might operate during construction. The tests were dug to
only 40 cm because the only anticipated ground disturbances would be from vehicle rutting.

All diagnostic artifacts encountered during the project were collected for curation at the TARL. These
consisted of three projectiles collected from the surface.

RESULTS

The surface inspection located a light scatter of burned limestone rocks and chert debitage near the
shoreline within the path of the proposed boat ramp, and within the 10 meter wide buffer zone on either
side. A Scallorn arrow point was also found near the western edge of the proposed boat ramp (Figure 37).
This material was recorded as an extension of the previously recorded site 41TV2357. Cultural material
diminished in numbers considerably about 20 meters away the shoreline to the north.
The shovel tests placed at the proposed footing locations recovered no cultural material. Each of these
encountered similar, uniform sediments consisting of light brown silty clay with abundant CaCO3
nodules. Shovel Test 1 placed at the lower footing location encountered solid limestone bedrock at 102
cm (Figure 38). The test placed on either side of the proposed boat ramp also failed to recovered cultural
material. Sediments in these tests were similar to those in Shovel Test 1 and 2.
The path of the proposed boat ramp has been used as an informal boat ramp. Deep ruts from vehicles and
boat trailers run the length of the project area on the lower terrace. Rocks from recent campfires (and
possibly from ancient hearths) have been used to fill in low spots creating pseudo-hearths.

The survey on the upper terrace found little evidence of 41TV2180. Within the buffer zone, one primary
flake was seen on the surface in addition a tested cobble. Cobbles of chert and quartz were exposed on the
surface and low outcrops indicated that any loose deposits were probably shallow.

81

After surveying the project area, a reconnaissance was made to the north, east, and west to determine the
size of the site encountered at the south end of the boat ramp. To the north and east, a light scatter of
burned rock and debitage was seen to cover most of the area from the 660 foot contour down to the
waterâs edge at the 631 contour. Presumably the site continues underwater to the south. A few meters to
the east of the project area, two Darl points were found close to a moderate scatter of burned rock.
Interestingly, the stems of both points are very similar in shape and the distal ends of each show burinlike fractures, presumably from impacts (see Figure 37). An existing truck path runs outside the northern
edge of 41TV2357 before entering the project area at the north end of the lower terrace. This path will
provide access for vehicles and machinery to the construction site on the lower terrace.
To the west of the proposed boat ramp, the ground rises slightly and the sediments appear somewhat
darker. In this area south and west of the 41TV2357 dipping vat, five burned rock clusters were seen, all
presumably the remains of hearths that have recently eroded from the sediment. The only groundstone
artifact from the site, a burned mano fragment, was seen in one of these clusters. In addition to these
features, two large hearths (Hearth 1 and 2), both approximately 140 cm across, appear to be mostly
intact. Hearth 1 is located to the west of an unused informal boat ramp (Figure 39). About half the feature
appears to be still encased in sediments, although no subsurface testing was done to verify this. The soil
around the rocks is carbon-stained but no actual charcoal could be seen. Hearth 2 is eroding from the
sediments adjacent to a concrete slab associated with the dipping vat (Figure 40). Only the upper edge of
the feature is visible, seen as a ring of medium-sized burned rocks. The soil inside the ring appears darker
than the surrounding sediments.
All the prehistoric material encountered on the lower terrace and lower terrace slope are considered to
belong to a previously unidentified prehistoric component of 41TV2357 (Figure 41). As a result of this
survey, 41TV2357 is now known to be a multi-component site containing the remains of prehistoric
camps belonging to either (or both) the Darl and Scallorn periods, roughly from ca. AD 400 or a little
later to at least AD 1300 (Johnson 1995, Creel and Goode 1997 ), in addition to the previously-identified
twentieth century dipping vat. The majority of the site contains sparse burned rock and lithics on eroded
surfaces with no indication of depth. The known exception is a small area south and west of the dipping
vat where potentially intact prehistoric cultural deposits with hearths are present. The SAL eligibility of
this part of 41TV2357 remains undetermined.

SUMMARY

The survey identified a previously undetermined prehistoric component of 41TV2357 that extends across
much of the southwestern corner of Tournament Point between 631 and 654 feet amsl. The proposed boat
ramp runs north to south through the middle of the site where a small amount of burned rock and debitage
lie on an eroded surface. No artifacts were recovered during shovel testing in the project area. Most of the
identified site area contains sparse cultural material, except in the southwest corner of the site outside the
project area where hearths and possibly intact buried cultural material are present. This potentially
significant area lies south and west of (and perhaps under) the historic component of 41TV2357. On the
high terrace, little evidence of 41TV2180 was found and the main area of the site described by Wishoff
probably lies well north of the project area.

82

RECOMMENDATIONS

The LCRAâs Cultural Resources staff recommends that Travis County be allowed to construct the boat
ramp in its planned location. The portion of 41TV2180 within 30 meters of the proposed boat ramp
contains sparse material on the eroded surface of the upper terrace, and does not appear to be eligible for
SAL designation. Access to this end of the project area will be from an informal truck path entering from
the east, which will avoid any potentially significant areas of 41TV2180 that might lie further north.
The portion of 41TV2357 within the project area was also assessed as ineligible for SAL designation
because of the lack of intact cultural deposits. However, immediately west of the project area near the
631 foot shoreline lies an apparently intact portion of the prehistoric component of 41TV2357. This
potentially significant area is situated south and west of the cattle dipping vat. While these deposits and
the dipping vat are located outside the buffer zone, they could conceivably be impacted by heavy
machinery gaining access to the lower end of the project area. The LCRA has notified Travis County
officials about the need to avoid this area. As further insurance against inadvertent impacts to these
deposits, the LCRA will place a temporary orange and T-bar fence between these deposits and the
western edge of the buffer zone (see Figure 12).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Westcave Preserve Corporation, which operates Westcave Preserve in partnership with Lower Colorado
River Authority (LCRA), is in the process of acquiring funding to build a new hiking trail within the
preserve. LCRA owns the Westcave property and the proposed trail will run almost entirely through a
relatively new 47-acre addition to the preserve that was acquired by LCRA in recent years (Figure 42 and
Figure 43). The new trail will be approximately 840 m (2,755 ft) in length and 1.82 m (6 ft) in width.
Initially, the trail will be minimally marked as a mowed pathway. As funding becomes available,
decomposed granite gravel with a stabilizer additive will be spread over the surface of the trail. It is
possible that some minimal cut and fill work will be undertaken to level out the hiking path in a few
areas.
LCRA bought the original 30 acres of the preserve, which included Westcave Canyon with the grotto, in
1983. One year later, Prewitt and Associates Inc. conducted a cultural resources survey of that tract,
recording one new site, 41TV877, and revisiting three other previously recorded sites: 41TV56, 41TV57
and 41TV244 (see Figure 43). Sites 41TV56 and 41TV57 were considered ineligible for State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) designation, while the SAL eligibility of 41TV244 and 41TV877 were undetermined. In
2012, LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a linear survey for a perimeter fence around the
new property addition north of Westcave Canyon. Surveyors recorded a new site, 41TV2405, and
expanded the boundaries of the previously recorded 41TV877 (see Figure 43). Staff assessed the areas of
both sites within the fence project area as ineligible for SAL designation. Neither site was known to
extend into the current project area.
In February and March 2013, LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of the newly proposed trail. Because the trail will open the new preserve acreage to park
visitors, LCRA is concerned about indirect impacts to cultural resource sites outside the trail corridor.
Therefore, LCRA surveyed the entire 47 acres in order to provide an inventory of all cultural resources
that may be directly and indirectly affected by the opening of the trail to park visitors.
The surveyors recorded a new site, 41TV2431, a multi-component site containing an extensive prehistoric
lithic scatter with small areas of scattered burned rock, and an early to mid twentieth century farmstead.
Site 41TV2341 is a large site that covers most of the southern half of the new preserve acreage. Most of
the proposed trail lies within this siteâs boundaries. The prehistoric component of the site is assessed as
ineligible for SAL designation because of the shallow and disturbed nature of its deposits and the lack of
any intact features. The historic component is assessed as not meriting SAL designation because of
relatively recent age and the fact that the artifact assemblage does not appear to have the potential to
provide any new or interesting data about early twentieth century rural lifeways.

Aside from the recording of site 41TV2341, the surveyors expanded the boundaries of previously
recorded sites 41TV877 and 41TV2405. The extension of site 41TV2405 contains a possibly discrete
component with hearths buried under up to 55 cm of sterile sediment. This site is considered potentially
significant and its SAL status is assessed as undetermined. Site 41TV2405 is located about 220 m north
of the proposed trail in an area that will remain fenced and off-limits to trail users. Staff found the
additional area of 41TV877 to be a diffuse lithic scatter/procurement site lacking features, diagnostic
artifacts and any depth of deposits. Based on these findings, and a review of data on previously surveyed
portions of 41TV877, the entire site is assessed as ineligible for SAL designation. Site 41TV877 also is
located in the area north of the trail that will remain fenced and off-limits to trail users.
All work was conducted under the terms of, and in accordance with, LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 6443 issued to LCRA under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between
LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). There is no federal funding or permitting involved
requiring a Section 106 review. All artifacts collected during the survey will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The survey area is located on the Edwards plateau on the western edge of Travis County. The preserve
acreage consists mostly of gently sloping uplands overlooking the Pedernales River to the east. The
survey area wraps around the Westcave Canyon where the Westcave grotto is located. The area
investigated also includes a narrow riparian zone between the Pedernales River and the steep cliffs
ascending to the uplands. A small seasonal creek, sometimes called Westcave Creek or Heinz Branch
(LCRA 2007), enters Westcave Canyon from the west.
Most of the Westcave Preserve outside the Westcave Canyon is underlain by the Hensell Sand formation
of Lower Cretaceous age (Barnes 1981). Cow Creek Limestone outcrops along the canyon rim and forms
the upper canyon walls of Westcave Canyon and the bluffs along the Pedernales River. Rainwater
percolating through the porous Hensell Sand and Cow Creek Limestone is discharged through springs in
Westcave Canyon. Hammett Shale is exposed at the base of the canyon providing an impermeable barrier
below the Cow Creek Limestone, allowing water to pool in a mostly porous, geological environment.
Undercutting of softer shale in the canyon has caused the overlying Cow Creek Limestone to collapse in
areas, creating small rockshelters such as the Westcave grotto (LCRA 2007). No Holocene alluvium has
been mapped in the preserve but the field survey for this project found deeply buried prehistoric cultural
material in the north bank of Westcave Creek. This indicates that some kind of deposition, either alluvial
or colluvial (slope wash), was occurring during the Holocene.
Volente soils have been mapped over most of the project area, developing on slope alluvium found along
Westcave Creek and north and south in a wide band paralleling the canyon rim of the Pedernales River
(Werchan et al. 1974) (Figure 44). Volente soils are deep â their A horizons are typically 90 cm thick and
composed of silty clay loam. The Tarrant soils that formed on the Cow Creek Limestone at the east end of
the project area are thin, typically 30 cm thick over bedrock and composed of clay.

91

Figure 44. Soils mapped in Westcave Preserve.

The deep Volente soils support mesquite trees at the northwestern corner of the Preserve, along with
junipers and live oaks. Common understory woody species include agarita and persimmon. Staff noted
several species of cactus on the survey. Most of the areas containing Volente soils south of Westcave
Canyon were cleared for a large agricultural field (Figure 45). Although probably not tilled in decades,
92

this field is still mostly free of woody vegetation. Closer to the canyon rim, outcrops of Cow Creek
Limestone are common. The shallow Tarrant soils were apparently never plowed, and support the more
wooded areas of the preserve, with mature live oaks being the dominant tree. Understory vegetation
includes small cedars, agarita and prickly pear.
A narrow riparian zone is found between the Pedernales River and the bluffs (Figure 46). This zone also
extends into Westcave Canyon. Cypress, Mexican buckeye and black cherry grow in this sheltered and
well-watered environment, with a dense understory of persimmon and small cedar.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The archaeological potential of the limestone karst features of the Westcave area attracted the attention of
A.T. Jackson in the late 1930s. He recorded the Westcave grotto as an archaeological site (later
designated 41TV57) because of the potential for cultural deposits within the shelter. Nearby, where the
county road crossed the Pedernales River, Jackson recorded a terrace site with lithics and mussel shell,
which was later given the designation 41TV244. He also recorded the Hamilton Pool sinkhole east of the
Pedernales River as an archaeological site, noting that prehistoric cultural material was present along the
rim above, but not within, the sinkhole.

Figure 46. Small terrace facing Pedernales River, looking west towards bluffs.

In 1959, the areaâs karst features also attracted the attention of a University of Texas student, J. Milburn
Lathan, who conducted test excavations in shelters within Westcave Canyon, along the Pedernales River,
and especially along Cypress Creek (Lathan 1959). Lathan placed a 2 x 2-ft test unit in a small shelter
(41TV56) in Westcave Canyon 200 yards upstream from the Pedernales River. Although his test
recovered charcoal and ash to a depth of 1 foot, along with a stone knife fragment and a projectile point,
he felt the cave was not worth further investigation. Lathan also excavated a 2 x 2-ft test pit in the
Westcave grotto (41TV57) which failed to recover any artifacts. He did collect a Clear Fork gouge from
the surface of the grotto, apparently the only prehistoric artifact known from this site.
In 1984, LCRA hired Prewitt and Associates to conduct an archaeological survey of their holdings at
Westcave Preserve, which then amounted to 30 acres (Jackson and Girard 1984). The survey was done by
a two-person crew in one day and resulted in the recording of one new lithic procurement site, 41TV877,
and a revisit of the Westcave grotto (41TV57) where no cultural material was seen. They could not
relocate Lathanâs shelter site (41TV56). They also investigated a lithic scatter on the canyon rim thought
to be a part of Jacksonâs terrace site, 41TV244. They described site 41TV244 as âbadly disturbedâ and
site 41TV877 as sparse and compromised by artifact collecting by relic hunters.
LCRA archaeologists conducted a cultural resource survey for the construction of a proposed fence on the
north edge of the new property addition in March 2012 (Hixson 2012). The survey resulted in the
recording of one new archaeological site, 41TV2405, and a revisit of a portion of 41TV877. Staff
recorded site 41TV2405 as a prehistoric campsite because a burned rock cluster was observed to the south
outside the project area. Within the surveyed area, staff found approximately 20 flakes along the fence
line, four of them blade-like and most covered by a white patina. They also noted one combination endand-side scraper. They observed this cultural material on the surface of a borrow pit cut and floor, or in
eroded areas leading to the creek. Two shovel tests placed along the Hamilton Pool Road fence and three
others paralleling Hammetts Crossing Road failed to recover any cultural material. Staff placed these tests
in areas that seem to have intact soil. They presumed that the artifact density was extremely low or that
94

any intact soil lay just outside the site area. Staff assessed portions of both sites within the project area as
ineligible for SAL designation because of the low density of cultural material, erosion of deposits and
lack of features. Staff did not assess the SAL eligibilities of other portions of these sites outside the
project area.

METHODOLOGY

Staff conducted an intensive archaeological survey within the entire 47 acres newly acquired by LCRA,
except for areas along the northern perimeter fence, which had been previously surveyed during the 2012
fence project. The survey consisted of walking over the property and inspecting the ground for cultural
material. Staff conducted shovel tests in areas where ground visibility was poor and a potential for buried
cultural material existed.
Staff performed shovel tests at roughly 30-meter intervals along the paths of the proposed hiking trails
because ground visibility was generally poor, especially around the edges of an old agricultural field.
Staff did not shovel-test the central area of the field because ground visibility was excellent due to
erosion. Staff placed other tests around a standing house structure and a few in areas of shallow Brackett
soils, as well as in the low terraces along Heinz Branch at the northwest corner of the preserve, to
determine the extent of the buried cultural deposits at 41TV2405. Staff usually dug down into the clay
horizon or to bedrock. One exception was Shovel Test 45, which staff placed within a low rock shelter
facing the Pedernales River. The confined space prevented excavation deeper than 22 cm.
Staff dug 45 shovel tests during the survey (Figure 47). The recovery and soil profiles for these tests are
listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS

During the survey for this project, staff recorded one new archaeological site, 41TV2431, and revisited
and enlarged the boundaries of previously recorded sites 41TV2405 and 41TV877 (see Figure 47).
41TV2431
This multi-component site covers a large horizontal area measuring about 400-by-230 m. The site covers
much of the southern half of the new Westcave acreage and most of the proposed trail lies within the site
boundaries (Figure 7).
The prehistoric component of 41TV2431 could best be described as a low density lithic scatter although
staff found some burned rocks at the far western end of the site suggesting campsite activities. Staff also

95

found prehistoric artifacts mostly consisting of chert debitage with two projectile point fragments, several
biface fragments, two scrapers, and a few cores. Most artifacts seen on ground surface occur in the
southwestern half of the site where ground surface visibility is best and topsoils are eroded. A second area
96

where artifacts are more numerous on ground surface is an 80-by-30 meter spot in a heavily eroded area
within a former agricultural field in the north-central part of the site.

Figure 48. Map of 41TV2431.

Staff excavated a total of 31 shovel tests across the site. The shovel tests dug along the northern end of the
agricultural field all showed evidence of topsoil erosion and/or redeposition of topsoils from areas
upslope westward. The shovel tests dug in undisturbed areas west and south of the agricultural field
typically showed about 30 cm of brown loam or clay loam above limestone. All shovel tests were either
sterile or yielded very small numbers of artifacts; the largest find was just three artifacts from Shovel Test
9. All of the shovel tests yielding artifacts are located along the western edge of the site where the burned
97

rocks are also prevalent or in the vicinity of the historic component in the southeastern part of the site.
Two projectile points found on ground surface consist of a Middle Archaic Early Triangular point
fragment and a Late Archaic Montell point fragment.
The historic component of 41TV2431 consists of a turn-of-the-century homestead with a number of
additions (described in detail below), and outbuildings consisting of a reported outdoor kitchen with
nearby barbecue pit (Figure 49), a reported hog pen (Figure 50) and an outhouse (Figure 51). The house is
approximately 25-x-40 ft with an attached carport and front porch. The front, gabled end faces south and
additions have enlarged it to the west, north and east. The outbuildings are all located to the east.
About 75 ft to the east of the house is a shed partially open to the south. It is about 16-x-10 ft.
Newspapers stuffed into openings along the roofline and apparent door openings suggest it may once
have been fully enclosed. About 10 ft in front of it is a barbecue pit made of limestone, river cobbles and
cement, with iron posts and other supports embedded in or otherwise associated. It is about 3 ft in length
on each side. Inscribed in the original cement coating is âABC II NO TRCUO 15 agosto 1952.â A later
coating of cement mortar partially overlaps this inscription and is itself inscribed, although the markings
are too faint to be legible.
A reported hog pen is located about 90 ft to the southeast of the house. It is approximately 18âx-10 ft and
constructed of unsplit cedar crossrails between double uprights. An outhouse is located about 125 ft to the
east of the house. It is perhaps 10 ft on a side with a plank bench and modern seat.
A local legend associated with the house at 41TV2341 concerns a small unmarked cemetery that is said to
be located under an oak tree cluster about 115 m northeast of the house and about 12.5 m north of the
proposed hiking trail. John Ahrns, the former Westcave Preserve site manager, learned of this supposed
cemetery from a visitor in the 1990s. The visitor, who said he was a distant relative of the individual(s)
buried in the unmarked cemetery, showed Ahrns a location where several cedar posts lay on the ground
under the trees. More detailed information on this potential cemetery is provided later in the oral history
summary of this site description.
Artifacts seen in and the around the features and recovered from shovel tests include both cut and wire
nails; whiteware fragments; purple, amber and aqua glass; various pieces of metal; a single-holed shell
button; and modern jars and other utilitarian items. The only area with a very high historic artifact density
was in the vicinity of Shovel Test 18, where a 1950s-era trash dump reportedly had been located. Despite
the previously cultivated field to the west, there is little to suggest recent agricultural use.

The house consists of the original, core cabin and at least three recognizable additions that total 670
square ft of enclosed living space. A screened back porch, an open front porch and a carport total 1,216
square ft of improvements (Figure 52). Common elements include balloon framing, vertical board
exterior cladding, limestone foundation piers and corrugated metal roofing.
The core cabin is a front-gabled single room with balloon-frame walls and board-and-batten vertical
cladding. It is 14-x-12 ft, oriented on a north-south axis with a centrally located fireplace and an external
masonry chimney on the north side. The roof has a normal pitch (about 5:12). The floor is in excellent
shape and probably dates to a later round of remodeling events. The floor appears to rest on a
combination of rough cedar and non-dimensional 4-x-4 lumber. It has a front, central door, a central door
to the west, and off-center doors to the south and east. There are double-hung 2-x-3 lite windows on the
south, east and north ends. The vertical boards are irregular in width but average 11-and-three-eighths
inches wide. Cut nails, the only ones seen in the house, hold the battens in place.
The front porch measures 12-x-7 ft and is supported across the front by three cedar beams and is covered
by a secondary, dropped low-pitched, gable-end roof. The floor boards are in poor condition. The porch
may be original to the cabin.
There are two, largely symmetrical shed additions (Addition 1), on the east and west side of the core
(Figure 532). Each has an interior door opening from the core and exterior doors opening to the east and
west, respectively. The eastern addition has windows facing south and east, probably using reclaimed
windows installed horizontally (Figure 54), and the western addition has a single window facing south.
The eastern side has an 18-inch wide closet on the north wall that is clearly among the most recent of the
improvements. The western addition is extremely low, and the exterior door is only about 6 ft tall. Both
are covered by extended, low-pitched roofs.

Figure 53. Front (south) elevation of house with porch, center front door and two wings barely visible.

Figure 54. South and east windows in southeast bedroom. Note reclaimed blue-painted lumber and rotated windows.

On the south side of the house are two added rooms; one 12-x-12-ft room abuts the chimney and the 12-x10-ft room is located to the west (Figure 55). According to John Ahrns, these rooms were a cabin that was
brought from somewhere else. While the vertical board construction supports this, there is quite a bit of
102

reclaimed dimensional lumber in the wall and ceiling framing, much of it painted blue and seen elsewhere
within various parts of the house. The carport is 26-x-12 ft and may be contemporary with these two
additions.
Also on the south, behind the chimney, is a poured cement slab that is 12-x-12 ft and creates a screened
porch. Steps leading into the room to the west and an exterior window from the room overlooking the
porch clearly show it was unenclosed space. It is supported by reclaimed cedar posts. Similar posts
support the carport and are notched for a post-and-rail fence or corral.
The entire south elevation is covered by a low-pitched roof that drops off the south face of the primary
cabin area. Curiously, the roof of the porch rests under the roof of the room additions. The carport aligns
with the primary house axis. Its roof is dropped from the westernmost room addition and is supported by
cedar posts elsewhere.

Figure 55. Back (north) elevation.

The most recent and least-well-preserved portion of the house is the bathroom on the east side (Figure
56). Only the roof, some of the floor, and the north wall of the earlier portion of the house remain. A toilet
once led to an adjacent cesspool or septic tank, and an electric water heater was housed in the room.

103

It appears the house was fairly well tended through at least the 1970s and possibly later. A drilled well,
240-volt electric service, interior wood paneling and laundry connections all indicate recent use. Crude
bedsteads suggest a hunting cabin. The fireplace was probably rebuilt, using fire brick and possibly even
new masonry (Figure 57). A galvanized metal flue projects from the chimney and is clearly weathered
above the roofline, while the portion within the screened porch has, at minimum, been repointed. Inside, a
hearth made of river cobbles is framed by the more recent wood floor. The cobble construction is similar
to that seen at the âoutdoor kitchenâ which is inscribed with the date of August 15, 1953, written in
Spanish. (August 15 is also the date of the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.)
While there is some evidence of knob-and-tube wiring in various locations, most of the wiring is
relatively recent, insulated, ungrounded copper conductor. Above the mantelpiece is a framed wall
hanging that depicts a romanticized cowboy scene (Figure 58). Some of the house wiring runs behind this
covering. In the most northeasterly room some remnant wallpaper depicts a cartoonish square-dancing
scene (Figure 59). Hairstyles suggest the 1950s; the paper itself suggests a childâs room.
In summary, the house apparently started as a one-room cabin, sometime around 1900. Two wings were
added shortly thereafter and would have been bedrooms. The north half of the house reasonably dates to
the 1950s. A simple kitchen may have led to the screened porch, or both of the additional rooms may
have been bedrooms. Newspapers stuffed in ceiling cracks at the open shed next to the outdoor grill were
from Yank magazine and included stories on D-Day. It is possible Hispanic tenant farmers, perhaps
including a veteran, lived there at the time and made substantial improvements. The final round of
improvements probably occurred in the late 1960s or 1970s and included adding plumbing, upgraded
electrical service, the bathroom, laundry appliances and a water heater, as well a crude closet on the
western shed addition and wood paneling in some rooms. The building undoubtedly served as a hunting
cabin at that time.

Oral histories and archival information, primarily census records, were gathered to further understand the
historic sequence. On Feb. 28, 2013, a personal interview was conducted with John Ahrns. Later, a copy
of a video interview with longtime resident Elnora Neuman Kneese (Barnett and Sternberg 2004) was
obtained. Kneese was born in 1921 on a nearby ranch and lived very near the Westcave property, crossing
Hammetts Crossing daily. John Ahrns was instrumental in the development of Westcave as a preserve and
has intimate knowledge of the surrounding area. Kneese is considered a primary source for the period
after 1920.
(Note: The following discussion references two precinct numbers. Precinct 8 is the enumeration (census)
district that encompasses the westernmost corner of Travis County, including the study area, and Precinct
5 is located south along the Travis-Hays County line and includes the community of Cedar Valley.)
The property is on the E. Fountaine survey. No Fountaines were found in online census records
(Archives.com) nor was the name found in The Handbook of Texas History or the Southwestern
Historical Quarterly. The basic chronology according to Ahrns is that Hammetts Crossing was
established in 1875. Census records show no Hammetts in the area until 1880, when Missourians Iessa
(Isaac), Ameria (America), and two-year-old William are residing in Precinct 5. Other Hammetts from
Missouri are also in the area. The Hammett survey is at Hammetts Crossing on the opposite side of the
river from the Fountaine survey; however, there are no Hammetts indicated in the 1890 census and in
1900, Isaac, America, William and daughter Sarah are living in the Pecan Springs area. In 1910, a
widowed 76-year-old Joseph B.Hammett is boarding in Precinct 8 with Willie Redd, 24, and Edward
Grumbles, 21, with Willie as the head of the household. In 1900, he was a boarder in the household of
Benjamin Smith in Precinct 5. According to the census records, the Hammetts are no longer in the area
after 1910.
John Ahrns said the cabin was built close to the turn of the twentieth century, was lived in by Mansel
Bond in the 1930s, and sold to Chester Lay, a professor at the University of Texas, in 1937. Lay was
106

living in Austin in 1940, and owned the Westcave property until 1957. During the latter part of his
ownership he rented out the portions of the land, and a family of Duvals rented from him. No Duvals are
in the area in 1940, although several are living in Justice Precinct 3 in Austin, the same precinct where
Lay was living. Portions of the property may have been used for a campground with swimming at the
Westcave grotto or river, as there is mention of a Pappy Edwards collecting fees. The land was sold in
1957, subdivided, and then sold again in the 1980s and in 1998.
There are several stories about who is buried at the purported gravesite: that it was a female member of
the Hammett family and her baby; that it was an unidentified woman bitten by a copperhead; or that it
belonged to members of the Owen family. The last story is supported by a reported visit by an Owen
family member in the 1990s, and a resultant note with the names Luke Owen, March 8, 1849 â March 12,
1910; and Mary Alice Owen, Dec. 29, 1854 â Feb. 21, 1910. The gravesite was reportedly fenced during
the 1940s. As described below, while Luke Owen disappears from census records after 1880, his wife
Mary is still living in 1920, and their gravesite was conclusively located on nearby Reimers Ranch. Given
the uncertainty, THC recommended the gravesite not be formally recorded. The supposed gravesite is
situated about 12.5 m north of the hiking trail. It will not be impacted by the proposed trail construction
and its location will remain undetermined to trail users.
Kneese refers to the house as the âOld Bond Place.â Her family moved to the area in 1911, and in the
1920s, she walked to Hamilton Pool School across the river, often going past the Lee and Kate Bond
house and traveling with the Bond children. She remembers them as Mansel, Florine, Nellie Ruth and
Nova Jane. At the time, the âcaveâ was Hamilton Pool, and Westcave referred to the present property.
They often used the trail past the grotto as a shortcut, and she can remember crossing the river prior to the
bridge being built in 1924, in part by her father. They constructed the bridge using hand-carried buckets
of concrete.
Most people in the area were farmers, although some she recalled as road workers. Cotton was commonly
ginned at Double Horn, while corn was taken to Fitzhugh Road near Dripping Springs. The rich pecan
bottoms along the river were destroyed by a massive flood in 1952.
Census records for the Owen family show Luke and Mary in Hays County in 1880. There are no records
for them in 1890 or 1900, but in 1910, Mary is widowed and living in the area as the head of her
household. The census indicates she had lost five of 14 children by this time. Luke had died Feb. 12,
1910, and they were both buried in Blanco County (on Reimers Ranch) after her death in 1923
(findagrave.com; 41TV2234 â Chavez et al. 2006).
Census records for the Bond family first show them in Johnson City in 1900 with head-of-household
Faust, 55; wife Nancy A., 49; daughter Ella, 21; and adopted son Lee Roy, 8. In 1910, they are in the
project area, presumably on the property in question. Only Faust, Nancy and Lee Roy, now 18, are in the
household. In 1920, Lee Roy Bond and his wife Katherine, 24, and two-and-a-half year old Mansel are in
Precinct 5. There are no records for Faust and Nancy, but they may still be in Precinct 8. In 1930, L. R.
Bond and wife Milian (presumably Katherine) are in Precinct 8 with son Mansel, and daughters Florine,
10; Alice, 8; and Magie,5. In 1940, following the reported sale of the land to Chester Lay they were back
in Precinct 5 with Mansel, now 23, and daughters Nellie Ruth, 17; Nova Jane, 15; and Geraldine,7. Other
than Geraldine, these are the same names Elnora Kneese remembered as the children of Lee and Kate

107

Bond from the 1930s. Florine is no longer in the household and the remaining girls are probably now
referred to by other names.
With the link between the Owen family grave and the property in question resolved, combined with
Kneeseâs memories of the âOld Bond Place,â it appears the house was built between 1900 and 1910 by
Faust Bond who probably continued to live there through the 1920s after his son Lee Roy married and
moved to Precinct 5. Between 1920 and 1930, the two older Bonds probably died (no death records were
located â they may be buried on the property) and son Lee Roy and wife Katherine moved back until
selling the property in 1937.

108

41TV2405 (revisit)
LCRA archaeologists first recorded this site as a small prehistoric campsite in 2012 for a fence project
(Hixson 2012). They recognized that the site probably extended in a southeasterly direction outside the
project area because a burned rock cluster could be seen about 40 m south of the fence. They saw all of
the material on eroded ground surfaces and did not recover any artifacts from the four shovel tests placed
along the fence.
The present survey confirmed that the site did extend southwards and contains potentially significant
archaeological deposits (Figure 60). Staff saw a moderately dense scatter of debitage on the eroded
surface in the area immediately south and east of the 2012 survey. The burned rock scatter was also
relocated. Further to the southeast, staff saw two adjacent hearths (here designated Hearth 1 and Hearth 2)
eroding from the upper sediments of the terrace a short distance north of Heinz Branch (Figure 61).
Hearth 1 is a circular pavement 70 cm across about 50 fire-cracked limestone rocks averaging about 10
cm in diameter (Figure 62). Hearth 2 is less compact than Hearth 1 and possibly still mostly embedded in
the sediments. It is composed of slightly larger rocks, averaging about 12 cm. A shovel test placed on the
slope above Hearth 2 encountered a possible third burned rock cluster resting at 18 cm below the surface.
No carbon staining of the sediments around these features was seen although the rocks, when struck by
the shovel, exuded a strong sulfur smell.
Staff placed another shovel test (ST 39) on the next terrace lobes downstream from the hearths. This test
recovered three tertiary flakes and two burned rocks between 55 and 60 cm below the surface. The soil
profile consisted of 35 cm of grayish-brown loam over slightly reddish-brown loam. The test ended at 60
cm and it is undetermined if deeper cultural material is present. Shovel test 40 (ST 40) on the next terrace
lobe downstream from ST 39 recovered a burned tertiary flake between 20 and 40 cm, two pieces of
debitage and two small burned rocks between 40 and 60 cm. Staff placed shovel test 41 about 30 m
downstream from ST 40 where the ground is lower. It recovered one small mussel shell fragment between
40 and 60 cm. This was the only mussel shell seen within the site area.

These shovel tests show that buried cultural material is present along the north side of Heinz Branch
before it descends into Westcave Canyon. Most of the material lies below 40 cm, and consists of debitage
and a few small burned rocks. Considering that hearths have eroded onto the surface in other areas of the
site, there is a strong likelihood that other hearths lie buried in the terrace lobes along Heinz Branch. The
area within 41TV2405, where buried cultural deposits could be present, is outlined in red on Figure 60.
This area measures about 160 x 40 m horizontally. Test excavations would be needed to determine the
presence of buried hearths and their degree of preservation. At this level of investigation, the SAL
eligibility of this portion of the site is considered undetermined. Areas outside the solid red line in Figure
60, including the borrow pit and the areas along the perimeter fence, are not considered eligible for SAL
designation because of disturbances and sparse cultural material.
41TV877
Prewitt and Associates originally recorded this lithic procurement site along the northern rim of Westcave
Canyon. During the 2012 fence project, Cultural Resource Services staff expanded the boundaries of the
site to include a portion of newly acquired acreage north of Westcave Canyon. Since staff intensely
surveyed only the area within the path of the fence, the rest of the site was recorded during the current
project.
Surface inspection found a light scatter of debitage and cores over most of the site area. Artifact density
was highest towards the north edge of the site where ancient gravels are exposed. Most of the site area
appears to have shallow soils, presumably Tarrant or Brackett soils, even though they are mapped as
Volente soils. Low limestone outcrops are frequent, another indication of shallow soil depth. Staff placed
a shovel test in an area that appeared to have deep soil, encountering dense gravels beginning a few cm
below the surface.
While primarily a lithic procurement area, the extreme west end of the site contains a loose cluster of
about 50 fire-cracked rocks (Figure 63). Staff placed a shovel test immediately upslope from this feature
to see if there might be a buried lens of burned rock. The test encountered a thin layer of natural cobbles
over fine, very gravelly loam. Staff recovered one core, two tertiary flakes, and five small burned rocks
mixed in with the cobbles. The test showed that the cultural deposits are shallow and mixed. Based on the
results of the current investigation and a review of the description of the portion of the site within the
original Westcave Preserve acreage, the entire 41TV877 site area is assessed as ineligible for SAL
designation.

RECOMMENDATIONS

In February and March 2013, LCRA Cultural Resource staff conducted an intensive cultural resource
survey of a new proposed trail within acreage that has recently been added to the Westcave Preserve in
western Travis County, Texas. Additionally, LCRA staff surveyed the entire 47-acre addition within the
trail area in order to provide an inventory of all cultural resources that may be directly and indirectly
affected by the opening of the trail to park visitors.
Staff recorded and assessed three cultural resource sites, 41TV877, 41TV2405 and 41TV2431, within the
47-acre survey area. Site 41TV2431, which contains both prehistoric and historic components, is the only
site that will be directly impacted by construction of the hiking trail. The prehistoric component at
41TV2431 extends across the entire 400-x-230-meter site area. Because it has shallow and disturbed
cultural deposits and lacks features, the prehistoric component is assessed as ineligible for SAL
designation. The historic component, which is situated in the southeastern part of the site, is a farmstead
that dates from approximately 1900 to 1970. The historic component includes an abandoned house with
an associated outdoor kitchen shed, hog pen and outhouse. Additionally, a historic artifact scatter that
surrounds the house complex extends over an area measuring about 130-x-80 m. The house shows
evidence of several construction additions and its overall condition is poor. The house is not eligible for
SAL designation. Surface inspection and shovel testing suggest that the historic artifacts are sparse and do
not have the potential to provide any new or interesting data about early twentieth century lifeways in
rural areas of western Travis County. For these reasons, the historic archaeological component is assessed
as not meriting formal SAL designation. Since site 41TV2431 is the only site that will be affected by the

114

proposed construction of the park trail, LCRA recommends that the hiking trail construction be allowed to
proceed.
Other sites located within the new park acreage addition consist of 41TV877 and 41TV2405. Site
41TV877 appears to be a diffuse lithic procurement area with one small area at its west end where minor
campsite activities are evident. It is assessed as not eligible for SAL designation due to the low density of
artifacts, lack of depth of deposits, and absence of diagnostic artifacts and intact features.
At site 41TV2405, pedestrian survey and shovel testing at a terrace area along the northeast side of Heinz
Branch (sometimes called Westcave Creek) revealed that intact, buried prehistoric deposits including
burned rock features with associated artifacts may be present in some parts of the site. For this reason, the
SAL eligibility remains uncertain at this time. Site 41TV2405 is located about 220 meters north of the
proposed trail in an area that will remain fenced and off limits to trail users. Similarly, site 41TV877 is
also located in the area north of the trail that will remain fenced and off limits to park trail users.
Therefore, there should be no potential for vandalism to these sites by park users who stray off the
designated hiking trail.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) plans to remove dead trees in its Camp Creek and Shaffer Bend
Recreation Areas on the north shore of Lake Travis in Burnet County (Figure 64). These trees are located
along trails and in camping areas and pose a potential hazard to park visitors. LCRA will saw down the
trees by hand about two ft above ground and leave the stumps in place. There will be no bulldozing or
removal by other mechanical means. The fallen trees will then be moved to nearby open areas for
burning.
Most of the dead trees are located alongside existing trails and roads. They can be accessed from the trails
and roads, cut down and removed without disturbing archaeological sites. However, some of the dead
trees are located in off-road areas of the parks, which have not been surveyed for cultural resources. In
such cases, the tree cutting contractor may want to drag the cut trees through unsurveyed areas to load
them onto trucks with trailers. On March 20, 2013, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff conducted a
field survey of two such areas. The Camp Creek surveyed area is 1.7 acres located on a wooded terrace at
the confluence of Camp Creek and the Colorado River on the upper end of Lake Travis (Figure 65). The
Shaffer Bend surveyed area is 1.5 acres located on the far eastern end of the floodplain (Figure 66).
Cultural Resource Services staff conducted an intensive archaeological survey in the Camp Creek
Recreation Area for a proposed park development in 2005 (Prikryl and Hixson 2006). Staff surveyed 28
of the 46.6-acre Camp Creek tract, including an area within the southeastern quadrant of the current
project area where a restroom was to be built. Workers placed a backhoe trench (BHT 3) at that location
(see Figure 65). This trench reached a depth of 170 cm through mostly loamy sand and the upper 10 cm
was found to be disturbed. Workers did not see any artifacts in the trench walls, and a shovel test of one
wall reached a depth of 120 cm without any artifact recovery. The restroom at BHT 3 was never built and
most of the planned park development was cancelled, except for a large picnic table that was placed on a
raised platform resting on the surface of the terrace. A hiking trail that loops across the terrace has worn a
few cm into the ground.
About 75 percent of the Shaffer Bend Recreation Area has been surveyed for cultural resources (Hixson
and Prikryl 2012). One of the areas not surveyed is an off-road area in the northeastern corner of the
floodplain where a dense cluster of dead trees are scheduled for removal (see Figure 66). Prehistoric sites
have been recorded elsewhere in the Shaffer Bend floodplain, including 41BT428, located about 250 m to
the south of current project area.
The current Camp Creek survey resulted in the recording of one new site, 41BT482, a buried prehistoric
lithic scatter with mussel shell. The site lies along the north side of the terrace between the area where the
dead trees will be cut down and the area where the burn piles are proposed. The presence of mussel shell
suggests that cooking features might be present. Therefore the siteâs State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
eligibility is assessed as undetermined.

Because the 41BT482 cultural deposits lie near the surface, staff recommends banning vehicles and heavy
machinery use at this site during the project. The Shaffer Bend survey found no evidence of an
archaeological site and staff recommends that dead tree removal be allowed to proceed as planned at that
location.
Staff conducted the work under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 6443, issued to LCRA under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between
LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). There is no federal funding or permitting involved
that requires a Section 106 review. No artifacts were collected during the survey and no curation is
needed.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The underlying geology of both the Camp Creek and Shaffer Bend survey areas consists entirely of
Holocene alluvium (Barnes 1981). At Camp Creek, this alluvium is at least 6.7 m thick as demonstrated
by the Camp Creek cut bank, and is composed primarily of silt loam, sandy loam and loamy sand
deposits. The Camp Creek project area lies at the western end of a levee ridge that runs parallel to the
Colorado River channel (Figure 67). This western end, on the downstream side of the Camp Creek
confluence, is raised higher than the rest of the levee and is covered by dense woods of hackberry, pecan
and persimmon (Figure 68). Further inland from the river, a large swale runs at an angle to the levee ridge
and is probably an old stream channel of Camp Creek or a chute of the Colorado River (see Figure 67).
The surrounding hills have frequent exposures of sandstone, siltstone and clay stone of the
Pennsylvanian-age Smithwick formation.
The Shaffer Bend project area is located on the east side of the bend on the lower terrace immediately
above the full conservation pool of the lake. This area lies at a lower elevation relative to the river channel
than the Camp Creek project area. A forest of hackberry, pecan and wild grape completely covers the
terrace except where cleared for the park road and picnic area. Deadfall from large trees is common.
The Westwood silt loam has developed on the alluvium over both the Camp Creek and Shaffer Bend
survey areas (Dittemore and Alison 1979). The general soil profile in the county soil survey is described
as being fairly uniform, consisting of silt loam from the surface down to 80 inches.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

In 1967, Preston Millican, an LCRA land surveyor and avocational archaeologist, recorded three
prehistoric campsites in the Camp Creek tract. These sites were later given the trinomials of 41BT63-65.
Beginning in the late 1970s, professional archaeologists surveyed small fence and

126

brush clearing projects resulting in the recording of several more sites (Kegley and Black 1978).
All these sites are located outside the floodplain, and most of them on land no longer owned by LCRA.
Although reconnaissance-level surveys were done on the floodplain, probably by Millican and definitely
by LUAS and LCRA archaeologists, no prehistoric cultural material was seen. The one exception was in
1992, when LCRA archaeologists observed burned rocks and mussel shell in the disturbed sediments
around the boat ramp.
Staff first intensively surveyed portions of the Camp Creek floodplain during the 2005 park development
project (Prikryl and Hixson 2006). Relying mostly on shovel testing and backhoe trenching, staff
recorded and assessed two new prehistoric sites, 41BT375 and 41BT376. Both of these sites appear to
represent a series of short-term streamside occupations in settings with rapidly aggrading alluvial
deposits. At site 41BT375, located 80 m east of the current project area, staff found heavily disturbed
prehistoric campsite deposits within the upper meter of deposits. Backhoe trenching indicated that these
deposits have been heavily disturbed and redistributed by land clearing and subsequent construction of an
adjacent boat ramp. Staff determined the site was not eligible for SAL designation.
At site 41BT376, which slightly overlaps the western part of the current project area, staff noticed a
burned rock feature eroding out of a cut bank on the Camp Creek channel at a depth of about 2 m below
the terrace surface. Subsequent backhoe trenching showed other prehistoric artifacts, including chert
debitage, burned rock fragments and mussel and snail shells, extend from about 40 to 120 cm below
ground north of the cut bank. Because of the potential for multiple prehistoric components and intact
features, staff assessed the site as eligible for SAL designation and in 2007, the Texas Historical
Commission formally designated 41BT376 as a SAL.
In 2008, routine monitoring of the lakeside cut bank immediately southeast of the current project area led
to the discovery of 41BT445. At the time, a moderate amount of burned rocks, mussel shell, a bone, and
one flake were seen midway up the bank on ledges created by the slumping sediments. A few pieces of
cultural material were still embedded in the cut bank 3.6 m below the terrace surface. Most of this
material had been dislodged by someone using a sharp tool, presumably a looter looking for artifacts. The
cultural deposits did not appear dense, and very little was seen still in place in the cut bank. Subsequent
visits have found little trace of this site other than a mussel shell in the cut bank that could be there
naturally.
The history of archaeological investigations in Shaffer Bend is similar to that of Camp Creek. In 1967,
Preston Millican recorded four prehistoric campsites situated along the high terraces or upland margins
overlooking the floodplain. Fence and brush clearing projects from the late 1970s into the 1980s recorded
several small lithic scatters or procurement areas in the upland margins (Kegley and Black 1978). LCRA
archaeologists conducted further investigations of Millicanâs sites in the 1990s and 2000s.
Until 2004, no prehistoric sites had been recorded in the lowland/floodplain. Exploratory trenching with a
backhoe late in 2004 detected a diffuse scatter of chipping debris extending vertically from near the
surface down to a depth of 170 cm (5.6 ft). This site was recorded as 41BT361. Additional shovel testing
128

found that the site covers nearly three acres but artifact frequencies remained low and consisted entirely
of chert debitage and an occasional mussel shell. During a 94-acre LCRA brush clearing project, a second
floodplain site, 41BT428, was recorded in 2007 (Hixson 2007). Most of the cultural material from
41BT428 came from below 80 cm and included both prehistoric and historic (late nineteenth century)
artifacts. A 2011 brush clearing project revealed a third floodplain site, 41BT451 that probably represents
a prehistoric camping area.

METHODOLOGY
Impacts from this project are expected to be shallow and caused by trees falling and being hauled to burn
piles by heavy machinery. Therefore, the purpose of the survey was to locate archaeological sites in the
project area with surface or near-surface cultural deposits and assess their SAL eligibility. It should be
noted that all of the proposed burn piles are located in areas previously surveyed for cultural resources
with negative results.
Staff intensely surveyed the 1.7-acre terrace area at Camp Creek, which involved a walk over of the entire
survey area, 10 shovel tests (Figure 69), and an inspection of the hiking trail. Staff performed shovel tests
in areas where surface burned rock was seen as well as near trees designated for removal. The burned
rocks are probably recent since rock-ringed campfires are common in the Camp Creek project area (in
Shaffer Bend as well). Shovel testing was also done to find the limits of archaeological sites.
At Shaffer Bend, staff placed only one shovel test in the 1.5-acre survey area because of the good surface
visibility afforded by a worn hiking trail and the lakeside cut bank that runs the length of the terrace
where the dead trees are located (Figure 70).
With each shovel test, staff dug a 35-cm-diameter circular hole in 20 cm levels and screened the fill
through a quarter-inch hardware cloth. The tests were dug to depths of 50 cm to 60 cm, which was
sufficient considering the impacts will be shallow. Staff documented artifact recovery for each shovel test
level, along with the testâs soil profile. All artifacts were returned to the hole with the fill.

RESULTS
Staff recorded one new site, 41BT482, during the Camp Creek survey (see Figure 69). It was found while
shovel testing the northeastern edge of the survey area. It appears to be a small lithic scatter
or campsite located in the upper deposits of a narrow levee-like formation on the terrace at the confluence
of Camp Creek and the Colorado River. Staff recovered all of the artifacts from between 10 and 30 cm
below the surface (Table 3). They consist mostly of small tertiary flakes along with one small fragment of
a chert biface. In addition, staff recovered a small number of mussel shell fragments but no umbos or
hinge fragments.

Figure 69. Aerial map of the Camp Creek survey area showing shovel test locations and new site 41BT482.

The sediments that make up this levee consist of brown silty loam without pebbles or carbonates. Shovel
testing elsewhere on the terrace south of the levee and outside the site area encountered mostly sand. The
130

levee is clearly composed of a different type of sediment from those encountered elsewhere on the
terrace, and perhaps of a different age.
The other known prehistoric sites in the Camp Creek floodplain are deeply buried while 41BT482 is near
the surface. This site is either very recent (i.e., Late Prehistoric) or contained within a remnant of older
sediment that makes up the levee. In its low density and small area, the site is similar to the others found
on the Camp Creek floodplain where cultural material is rapidly buried. While staff did not recover any
burned rocks or other direct evidence of hearths at

41BT482, the presence of mussel shell suggests that cooking features could be present. The siteâs SAL
eligibility is undetermined at this time.
Staff did not find any archaeological sites during the Shaffer Bend survey. As at Camp Creek, burned
rocks from recent campfires are common in the eroded trails and terrace slope, but no lithics or mussel
shells were seen. The shovel test placed at the highest point on the terrace encountered fine sandy silt
from the surface to a depth of 60 cm with no artifact recovery (Figure 70).

RECOMMENDATIONS

Workers will avoid site 41BT482 during the tree removal project because potentially significant cultural
deposits lie near the surface. No vehicles or heavy machinery will move north of the hiking trail on the
terrace (Figure 71). The trees along the north edge of the trail can be cut down by hand and dragged
immediately southwards to the trail. From there they can be hauled by vehicle along the trail going east or
132

westward to the gravel roads and then to the burn pile areas in the swale (see Figure 71). Vehicles are
allowed to move over the area of the terrace south of the existing hiking trail since no archaeological sites
were found. At Shaffer Bend, no archeological sites were found in the survey area. Therefore, removal of
the trees can proceed there as determined by the work crew.

the burn piles.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services Corporation (LCRA TSC) plans to upgrade
its electrical transmission line between the towns of Plum and Flatonia in Fayette County. Staff conducted
a survey May 7, 2013, and recorded two cultural resources sites, 41FY579 and 41FY580. Both sites
contain chert debitage and a few small burned rocks that are dispersed in the sandy soil. Artifact densities
are low, with no evidence of features or discrete components in the soil around the existing H-frame
structures. The research potentials of these sites within the area of potential impacts are low and are
therefore ineligible for State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) designation.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Most of the survey area lies within a zone of Holocene alluvium that has accumulated along Buckner
Creek and its tributaries, especially Pin Oak Creek (Barnes 1981). Underlying this alluvium is the
Eocene-age Manning formation composed of clay, sandstone and bentonite. This formation is exposed on
the surface at the two northernmost structures surveyed. During the survey, sandstone was also observed
in the bed of Buckners Creek (Figure 73). A variety of soils have been mapped in the project area
(http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov). Most have thick zones of sand with underlying, and in some cases
overlying, zones of clay or clay loam.
The project area lies within the post oak savannah region of east central Texas. Presettlement vegetation
consisted of native bunch grasses with scattered post oak, live oak, blackjack oak and black hickory. Fire
suppression in historic times has led to an increase in understory woody vegetation such as yaupon holly,
cedar elm and hackberry (http://texastreeid.tamu.edu/content/texasEcoRegions/PostOakSavanah/).

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

The project area is located in a portion of Texas occupied by nomadic hunter-gatherers throughout the
prehistoric era. The project area lies outside any of the traditional archaeological regions that have been
defined for the state. This is probably due to the fact that relatively few surveys had taken place in Fayette
138

County when archaeological regions for the state were first proposed in the 1950s. Presently, the Fayette
County area is marked as southeast of Prewittâs (1981) Central Texas Archaeological Region, north of
Hesterâs (1995) South Texas Archaeological Region, and slightly west of Pattersonâs (1995) Southeast
Texas Archaeological Region.
More recent data from large cultural resource management projects that have taken place in Fayette
County show that the general area is located on the periphery of many projectile point style distributions,
a cultural trait that has traditionally been used to define prehistoric cultural areas in Texas. However,
beginning about 3,000 years ago, many Central Texas artifact types become common, and for that reason
the culture chronology for that region are utilized for this report. Therefore, a sequence of chronological
periods that borrow from work in central Texas by Johnson and Goode (1994) and Prewitt (1981) is
utilized for this survey report. These chronological periods are as follows: Paleoindian (pre 6500 B.C.),
Early Archaic (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3500 to 2200 B.C.), Late Archaic I (2200 to 50
B.C.), Late Archaic II (50 B.C. to A.D. 700), Austin (A.D. 700 to 1250), Toyah (A.D. 1250 to 1700) and
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700 to 1875).

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

The Spanish first crossed the region now known as Fayette County in the early eighteenth century
(Garrett 2001). Stephen F. Austinâs colonists arrived in 1822 and settled near an important road crossing
located near present-day La Grange. In 1837, the county of Fayette was established, named after the
Marquis de Lafayette; La Grange was made the county seat. Early industry, based on farms and
plantations, focused on production of corn, tobacco, wool and cotton. Slavery became a mainstay of the
economy, even as the county voted against secession.
After the Civil War, the plantation economy collapsed and share cropping became common. The number
of German and Slavic immigrants increased during the 1860s to the 1880s, and former plantation owners
sold large plots which were subsequently subdivided to newcomers. Germans and Czechs became strong
social forces around the turn of the century.
Plum and West Point, located near the north end of the transmission line project, were settled between
1831 and 1888 (Carroll 2002 a, b, c). Plum was originally known as Plum Grove and was the second
oldest community in Fayette County. The Plum (formerly Hopewell) Baptist Church was the first Baptist
church west of the Colorado River (Carroll 2002a.). One of the original settlers of the West Point area
apparently established a fort in the vicinity, although the actual community was formed around the
junction of three railroads (Carroll 2002 b). The town of Flatonia was founded in 1872 when the railroad
came into that area.
Across the area, cotton was the predominant cash crop through the Depression, but by the end of World
War II cattle became more significant. Oil was discovered in the county in 1943, leading to a new shift in
industry. LCRAâs coal-fired Fayette Power Project is now the largest employer in the county.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Thus far, 578 archaeological sites have been recorded in Fayette County, most of them in the northern
half of the county. Recorded prehistoric sites in the project vicinity mainly consist of open campsites,
lithic scatters and lithic procurement sites. Historic sites are primarily rural farmsteads that date from the
mid-nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century.
Large LCRA construction and development projects revealed many of the known sites in Fayette County,
including the Fayette Power Project (Jackson and Skelton 1975; Carter and Ragsdale 1976; Skelton
1977), the Fayette to Lytton Springs Transmission Line (Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980; Brown and
Kenmotsu 1980) and the Cummins Creek Lignite Mine (Nightengale and Jackson 1983; Nigthengale et
al. 1985; Kotter et al. 1991). More recently, smaller LCRA survey projects in Fayette County have
included the T-186 Plum to Winchester Transmission Line Rebuild Project (Malof 2008) and the T-216
Fayetteville to Bellville South Transmission Line Rebuild Project (Malof and Prikryl 2008).
Staff at the Texas Archeological Survey of the University of Texas (Kenmotsu and Freeman 1980)
surveyed the Fayette to Lytton Springs Transmission Line, which crosses the T-133 line about 600 m
south of the current survey area. At the intersection of these two lines, Texas Archeological Survey
archaeologists recorded 41FY157, a low density scatter of secondary flakes with some burned rock
occupying a terrace knoll near a meander of Blackjack Creek. Staff saw artifacts on the surface as well
the wall of a stock tank, but did not recover artifacts from the shovel probes. The site was considered
insignificant, primarily because of the disturbances caused by the stock tank and T-133 line constructions.
Other sites near T-133 recorded during this survey include 41FY173-178, 41FY189, and 41FY190. Most
of these sites are similar to 41FY157 in artifact inventory and density, and most are situated on small
tributaries of Pin Oak Creek. Sites 41FY189 and 41FY190 represent historic homesteads, the former
thought to date to the middle of the nineteenth century and the latter to the late nineteenth or early
twentieth century. Sites 41FY178 and 41FY189 were later tested by excavation (Brown and Kenmotsu
1980). The investigators gathered enough evidence from the testing to argue that 41FY178 potentially
represents a single component, Austin-phase campsite that should be protected. Test excavations at
41FY189 led to a reevaluation of the age of the homestead from mid to late nineteenth century. Historical
research on the site revealed the land was owned by an African-American who may have been a former
slave. Staff determined the site deserved full protection due to its historic nature and because the house
was occupied during a fairly short period, about 1876 to 1900.
The excavation of six prehistoric sites and three historic period sites at the Fayette Power Project (Jackson
and Skelton 1975) is among other excavation projects providing detailed data about the archaeology and
history of Fayette County. This work included the excavation 41FY74, a unique, single event Toyah
Phase bison butchering locale with an associated upland hunting camp. The historic period site
excavations focused on a rural German settlement called the Biegel Settlement with emphasis on the era
beginning in 1832 and continuing for the next 50 years.

140

At the Cummins Creek Lignite Mine Project, a total of 133 prehistoric sites and 63 historic sites were
recorded within the 22,200-acre mining area. Staff test-excavated four prehistoric sites - 41FY264,
41FY336, 41FY362 and 41FY442 - before the entire mining project was cancelled. The work
documented the presence of Middle and Late Archaic campsite activities. Staff conducted archival
research, oral history and limited testing before the cancellation date. These investigations provided data
on the rural farming traditions of families who mostly moved into the area from Germany and the
American southern states after the Civil War.
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) conducted archaeological survey and test excavations
in the immediate vicinity of the project area during the expansion of State Highway 71 (Goode 1984).
Further east in La Grange, Hester and Collins (1969) investigated a Late Prehistoric cemetery, 41FY42.

METHODOLOGY
The purpose of the survey was to locate any archaeological sites that might be impacted by the T-133
Upgrade project and assess their SAL eligibility. Staff confined the survey to nine existing transmission
structure locations along a 1,500-meter stretch of transmission deemed to have a high probability for
prehistoric sites because of the proximity of several creeks, the largest being Buckners Creek. A 150--m2
area was investigated at each structure location, with a total of 0.35 acre surveyed.
Surveyors inspected the ground around each structure for evidence of an archaeological site and then
excavated shovel tests to locate subsurface cultural material. Staff placed at least one shovel test within
3m of each H-frame structure within the high probability area (Figure 74). In some cases, the ground
slope determined test placement, with a preference given to higher or more level ground near a structure
believed to have a better potential for an archaeological site.
If a test was positive for artifacts, staff dug more shovel tests around the structure to adequately assess the
cultural deposits. In general, staff did not investigate archaeological sites more than three meters from
structures because they lie outside the area of potential impacts.
Staff dug 14 shovel tests during the survey (see Figure 74, Appendix). Each shovel test involved digging
a circular hole about 35 cm in diameter and screening the fill through a 0.25-inch wire mesh. Staff
recorded all recovered artifacts for each 20 cm level and returned them to the hole during refilling. Staff
recorded a wall profile for each test. Depth of tests ranged from 25 to 110 cm. In upland soils, the tests
ended when a clay zone was encountered. In alluvium, staff dug the tests to at least 70 cm below surface.

RESULTS
Staff recorded two new cultural resources sites, 41FY579 and 41FY580, during the survey (Figure 75).
Both represent prehistoric lithic scatters, or in the case of 41FY579, a possible short-term campsite. No
time-diagnostic artifacts were found at either site.

141

41FY579
This prehistoric lithic scatter or possible campsite is located on the south side of Pin Oak Creek, 275 m
north of Boulton Creek Road (see Figure 75). The creek runs in a southwest to northeast direction to the
west of the site. The site occupies a narrow point of land bordered on the west by a steep drop to the creek
channel and on the east by low-lying ground and a small gully (Figure 76, Figure 77). To the north, the
ground gradually slopes to the confluence between creek and gully. The creek has deeply incised into the
sediments and was flowing at the time of the survey. The upper soil zone is composed of very fine sand
averaging about 45 cm in thickness overlying very sandy clay. The soils have been mapped as Uhland
clay loam that forms on Holocene alluvium. However, the Uhland soil profile consists of a 15 cm zone of
clay loam over deep sand, a profile not encountered in the shovel tests. Outside the transmission line
corridor, close to the creek, grows a thick forest of post oak, mulberry, Osage orange and cedar elm.
The H-frame of Structure 15/7, the focus of the intensive survey, is situated where the ground is still
relatively elevated before beginning its descent northwards towards the creek (Figure 77). Ground surface
visibility was poor because of the thick grasses and forbs. The only piece of cultural material seen on the
surface was a small tertiary chert flake resting on the exposed earth surrounding one of the H-frame posts.
Staff placed shovel tests on the north, southeast and south side of the H-frame. No tests were placed to the
west of the structure because of the sloping ground. These three tests recovered a total of five pieces of
debitage and one small biface fragment. The biface fragment appears to be edge or âearâ to a projectile
point stem. In addition, one test recovered a burned chert chunk and a few small pieces of sandstone. Staff
recovered two small non-flake fragments of petrified wood from one test. While this type of stone was
used for stone tools in the region, these two appear to be natural and all lithic artifacts from the site are
made of chert.
To determine the extent of the site, staff placed a fourth shovel test 30 m south of Structure 15/7 beneath
the transmission centerline. The test recovered three pieces of chert debitage in the upper 20 cm of sandy
soil. The test also encountered a cluster of seven sandstone rocks resting at 58 cm below the surface. The
largest of these rocks measured 4 by 5 by 8 cm. The rocks did not show any signs of having been burned
and these rocks could represent a natural feature. No obvious artifacts were recovered from below 20 cm.
The soil profile from the surface to a depth of 60 cm consisted of very fine sand. Staff did not encounter
the sandy clay zone seen in the other tests around the H-frame in this shovel test.

The sediments within 3 m of Structure 15/7 contain a diffuse scatter of lithic artifacts, primarily debitage.
Staff did not encounter any No discrete cultural zones were encountered and all the artifacts probably
became dispersed throughout the sandy sediments through bioturbation. The lack of evidence for features
such as hearths in this area also compromises the research potential of this area of 41FY579. Thirty
meters to the south, staff came across a possible feature consisting of a tight cluster of seven sandstone
rocks. The southern part of the site, higher in elevation, was probably more attractive to prehistoric
occupation than the area around Structure 15/7. Should any construction be planned for this area, further
investigations would be needed to determine if other, more convincing cultural features are present in the
area of the site. In any

case, the survey found the cultural deposits of 41FY579 within 5 m of Structure 15/7 to not appear to be
eligible for SAL designation.
41FY580
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located on the north side of an unnamed tributary of Pin Oak Creek about
500 m upstream from their confluence (see Figure 75). The investigated part of the site around Structure
15/4 lies on the terrace edge immediately above the deeply incised creek channel (Figure 78). The
structure itself stands right along the drop-off, necessitating the placement of both shovel tests north of
the poles. The creek was flowing at the time of the survey even though it is not a particularly long stream,
originating about one kilometer to the west. A band of dense woods consisting of American elm, oak,
yaupon holly and mustang grape grows along the creek. These woods have been cleared within the
transmission line corridor. To the north between these woods and Buckner Creek lies a large open
pasture. This has the appearance of flat floodplain but the soil in the western half of the pasture, which
includes 41FY580, is mapped as Rutersville loamy fine sand, which forms on residuum weathered from
tuffaceous sandstone and shale. The geologic map (Barnes 1981) shows the site lying on the boundary
between Holocene alluvium to the south and east and the Eocene Manning formation to the northwest.
The Rutersville soil profile consists of a 35-cm thick surface zone of loamy sand overlying a 25-cm thick
sandy clay loam overlying fine sandy loam. The shovel tests placed around Structure 15/4 revealed only
fine sand to a depth of 110 cm.
Staff placed Shovel Test (ST) 6 about 3m northwest of the western pole of the H-frame structure, and dug
to a depth of 110 cm through fine sand. No sandy clay or sandy loam zones were

146

encountered. Artifacts, mostly chert debitage, were found vertically dispersed in the upper 100 cm of soil,
with one artifact in each 20-cm level down to 80 cm, and four pieces of chert debitage between 80 and
100 cm. The only non-debitage artifact was a small 1.5 quartzite fragment from between 20 and 40 cm
that appeared heat fractured. A relatively high number of artifacts â four pieces of chert debitage â were
recovered from 80 to 100 cm. Considering the composition of the soil, all the artifacts have probably been
vertically displaced by bioturbation.

147

Staff placed a second shovel test 3 m northeast of the east pole of the H-frame. This test reached a depth
of 95 cm without recovering any cultural material. This was unexpected because the test was only about
5m from ST 6. From the shovel test finding, and the general topography, it appears that the site extends
westwards from ST 6 where the ground gradually rises to a low ridge outside the transmission line right
of way (ROW). The site probably also extends an undetermined distance to the north. Staff did not
investigate by shovel testing the western half of the ROW beyond about 3m from the H-frame structure
and the significance of any cultural deposits there is undetermined. The shovel testing did show the soil
within 3 m of the 15/4 H-frame contains vertically dispersed cultural material, mostly chert debitage, and
that this part of 41FY580 does not appear eligible for SAL designation.

SUMMMARY AND RECOMMENDATION
The survey resulted in the recording of two new archaeological sites, 41FY579 at Structure 15/7 and
41FY580 at Structure 15/4. Site 41FY579 represents prehistoric lithic scatter or short term camps, while
41FY580 appears to be only a lithic scatter. Both are situated close to stream channels. Shovel testing
around the structures within both sites found low density chert debitage and a few small burned (or
possibly burned) pebble-sized rocks dispersed in sandy sediments. Staff found no evidence of discrete
cultural zones or features near the structures. The cultural deposits within 3 m of the structures are
assessed as having low research potential and are not eligible for SAL designation.
Because the archaeological deposits around structures 15/4 and 15/7 are not considered eligible for SAL
designation, the replacement of these H-frames with new H-frames should be allowed to proceed as long
as the new structures are installed within 3 m of the existing ones. Areas of 41FY579 and 41FY580 away
from structures were not thoroughly investigated and their SAL eligibility remains undetermined. Any
future ground-disturbing construction will require additional field investigation in these areas.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) plans to build a new electrical substation, called the Deer
Creek Substation, in Guadalupe County about 12 miles southwest of Luling, Texas (Figure 79). The
substation will be constructed within a 9.9-acre area of ranchland adjacent to the north side of U.S.
Highway Alternate 90 (Figure 80). The area is undeveloped except for LCRAâs T-538 transmission line
right of way (ROW) that runs north-south through the western half of the project area, and a gravel oil
field road that passes through the northeast corner of the project area. The project may also involve
relocating the first existing transmission line tower north of the proposed substation within a 0.75-acre
area of the T-538 ROW, and constructing an access road within the highway ROW, another 0.12-acre, for
a total project area of 10.77 acres.
A file search showed that the project area had not been previously surveyed by professional
archaeologists. Staff conducted a field survey on Aug. 27, 2013 because the project area lies within an
area with a moderate-to-high probability for prehistoric sites due to the proximity of Darst Creek, a
seasonal stream that comes within 200 m of the northeast corner of the proposed substation site. Staff did
not find any archaeological sites within the project area and staff recommends that the substation project
be allowed to proceed.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual State Antiquities
Permit 6443. There is no federal funding or permitting involved that requires a Section 106 review under
the National Historic Preservation Act. Since no archaeological sites were found, there are no artifacts
that will require curation.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Geologically, the project area is on the Eocene-era Wilcox Group which mostly consists of mudstone with
sandstone, lignite and ironstone concretions (Barnes 1974). According to the Guadalupe County soil
survey (Ramsey and Bade 1977), the soils within the project area are mapped as Branyon clay in the
extreme southeast corner of the project area, Demona loamy fine sand across the north and east parts of
the project area and Windthorst fine sandy loam in the south, west and central areas. In typical profile, the
Branyon clay has a 32-cm thick A horizon consisting of dark gray and grayish-brown clay above a pale
brown silty clay loam B horizon. The Windthorst and Demona soils typically have 20- and 60-cm thick
fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand topsoils, respectively. Beneath these topsoils, B horizon clayey
subsoil is encountered. However, during the fieldwork, staff found sandy topsoils only in the central and
south-central parts of the project area, suggesting the sandy topsoils had completely eroded away in many
areas probably due to previous cultivation practices.

The area is classified as part of a post oak woods, forest and grassland mosaic (McMahan1984), and in
prehistoric times the project area would have been an oak savanna with mottes of post oak present with
mixed grass prairies. The main vegetation at the project area currently is grasses, forbs, prickly pear and
mesquite (Figure 3).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

In the 1980s, Texas A&M Archaeological Research Laboratory staff recorded three sites in the project
vicinity during a Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative survey. The sites, 41GU3, 41GU180 and
41GU181, are located approximately 3.5 to 4 km to the southeast of the proposed substation along the
Guadalupe River. These sites are within a kilometer of each other. Sites 41GU3 and 41GU181 are on
terraces while 41GU180 is on a hill. Site 41GU3 had a Guadalupe tool and Fairland arrow point in
addition to thick and thin bifaces, all types of flakes and two burned rock hearths. Site 41GU180 had
retouched flakes, biface fragments and a flake âend-scraperâ tool. Site 41GU181 was a long open
campsite along the Guadalupe River. There were flakes, a biface, an end scraper and possibly burned
rock. This site was not fully investigated due to time constraints and could be substantially larger.

Figure 3. View of typical vegetation in the northwest part of the proposed substation area.

157

A file search also showed that site 41GU28 is located a little more than 3 km to the west of the project
area. This is a scatter of chert flakes 300 m southwest of the Guadalupe River. Further up the river at the
confluence of the Geronimo Creek and Guadalupe River is a long open campsite, 41GU21, which had
projectile points, tools, blanks, preforms and burned rocks. Sixteen km up the river is site 41GU142. This
site had four burned rock features at different depths. The deepest is below a Guadalupe tool that is
commonly dated to 5500 BP (Turner et al. 2011). A little further upriver, the McKee site (41GU117) has
a range of time-diagnostic artifacts ranging from Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric, including more than
40 Guadalupe tools. All of these sites, with the exception of 41GU28, are on Holocene deposits.

METHODOLOGY

The 1911 San Marcos and 1930 Seguin United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps were
examined for potential historical sites. There is a building that appears on both maps 150 to 200 m
northeast of the northernmost corner of the proposed substation. It is located on the north side of a
tributary to Darst Creek while the project area lies on the south side of that creek.
The survey consisted of a walkover of the entire project area by a three person crew using 30 m interval
transects. In addition, seven shovel tests were dug, with an emphasis on areas with poor ground visibility
and areas closest to Darst Creek and its tributary (Figure 4). This number was considered sufficient for the
10.77-acre project area because of the generally good ground visibility and the lack of mapped alluvium.
Furthermore, the first shovel test encountered a truncated soil profile with a missing A horizon probably
caused by erosion of once-tilled soil.

Figure 4. Digging shovel test 2 on northern edge of proposed substation area.

158

Each shovel test consisted of the excavation of a circular hole 35 to 40 cm in diameter. Shovel tests were
excavated through the A horizon into the top of the B horizon clays or to a maximum depth of 80 cm if
the B horizon was not struck. Staff passed all fill through a Â¼- inch wire mesh to recover any artifacts and
recorded a soil profile for each test (see Appendix).

RESULTS

Staff found no archeological sites in the project area. Ground surface visibility was variable, with a
majority of the project with good visibility. Areas within the transmission line corridor were previously
disturbed by the original construction. The area north of the substation where a transmission pole
structure may be replaced or added lies in and around an oil field road where recent ground disturbances
provided good ground surface visibility. Shovel tests were excavated where ground surface visibility was
poor and where there was a higher likelihood for buried cultural resource sites to be present in areas
closest to Darst Creek and one of the creekâs unnamed tributaries. Staff found thick sandy topsoil only in
shovel test 4, which lies near the center of the south boundary of the project area near the transmission
line corridor. Elsewhere, the shovel testing aided in confirming that the sandy topsoil A horizon is absent
or almost completely absent in some parts of the project area. This is probably due to former intensive
cultivation practices. Because of severe erosion, it became apparent that prehistoric sites, if present,
would be visible on ground surface in many areas. As a result, only seven shovel tests were excavated,
but LCRA staff feels that this number is adequate for assessment of the project area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Staff performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the entire 10.77-acre project area and found no
cultural resource sites. Staff recommends the project be allowed to proceed because no State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) or potential SALs will be affected by the construction of the substation and its access
road and transmission tower relocation.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA is proposing to upgrade the existing 7.1-mile-long T-540 transmission line between the Kenedy
Switch and Helena substations in Karnes County (Figure 81; Figure 82). The transmission line has a
typical 60-foot wide right of way. The project area totals approximately 51 acres. The current wooden Hframe structures will be replaced with steel or cement single-pole supports.
The project area had never before been surveyed, and the subsurface disturbances at new structure
locations that will be a necessary part of the upgrade process necessitated a survey for archeological
material. LCRA Cultural Resources staff and contracted archeologists conducted an intensive survey on
the July 15-18 and August 6, 2013 in accordance with CTA standards and under the terms of THC Permit
6443. There is no current or anticipated federal funding or permitting associated with this project.
Prior to the survey, a file and map review resulted in approximately 3.7 miles (27 acres) of easement
being identified as moderate to high probability areas for prehistoric cultural resources. One potential
historic resource was also identified. Twenty-nine replacement structures are presently planned within
these identified probability areas.
As a result of the survey, four prehistoric lithic scatter sites, some with small amounts of fire-cracked
rock, (41KA187-41KA190) were recorded. The portions of the sites within the transmission-line right of
way (ROW) are considered to be fully investigated and ineligible for formal listing as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL). No areas or sites were encountered that are felt to require any avoidance by
construction activities. It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without additional
cultural resource review, with the understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in
place.
The report was authored by Sean C. Zimmerman, presently employed as an LCRA archaeologist on a
temporary basis. LCRA staff archaeologist Andrew Malof served as Principal investigator and as Project
Archaeologist, and edited portions of the report.
No artifacts were collected during the project, so no curation will be necessary.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in south Texas within the southern edge of the Southern Post Oak Savanna
section of the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The project area south of the San
Antonio River is gently rolling hills and various drainages, including the Dry Escondido Creek. There is a
narrow band of floodplain south of the river, as well as a broader section north of the river. These are the

only sections utilized for farming. The rest of the area is mainly used for cattle pasture, with the
remainder left wooded. The San Antonio River supports a woody riparian zone.
The Geologic Atlas of Texas illustrates the underlying geology (Barnes 1975). The Oakville Sandstone is
present in the project area. This sandstone dates from the Miocene and the previously mentioned rolling
hills result from the erosion of this sandstone. Holocene alluvial and Pleistocene fluviatile deposits are
present along the San Antonio River. Many different soils cover the sandstone across the project area
(SSURGO), but Weesatche-Pernitas loamy soils and Papalote-Nusil sandy soils were common in the
uplands while Buchel-Sinton clayey soils cover the floodplains. The Weesatche-Pernitas soils have an
âAâ horizon that ranges from 18 to 20 centimeters deep. The Papalote soils have âAâ horizons that are
around 48 centimeters deep, while the Nusil âAâ horizon extends 91 centimeters deep. The Buchel-Sinton
soils have an âAâ horizon that ranges from 41 to 63 centimeters deep.
A definitive chronology has not been established, but evidence of climate change in south Texas suggests
that the area fluctuates from drier to wetter conditions on an indeterminate long-term basis
(texasbeyondhisotry.net). Short and tall grasses were common in flatter areas with deep soil while uplands
had more thorn brush. During subsurface testing numerous Rabdotus and Oligyra snail shells were found
north of the San Antonio River which could potentially indicate a more stable aggrading land form.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the northeastern edge of the south Texas archeological region as defined
by Hester (2004). Ellis et al. (1995) note the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about an
area as diverse as south Texas. Indeed, at various times south Texas shares diagnostic artifacts with the
Southern Plains, central Texas, the Lower Pecos, and the Coastal Plains regions. The prehistory of south
Texas is not clearly delineated, but the basic chronological divisions of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric provide a framework.
The beginning Paleoindian period is recognizable by Clovis points that date back to 11,000 years before
present (B.P.). Commonly thought of as big game hunters, no mammoth kill or butcher sites have been
found in south Texas, even though mammoth remains are commonly found in south Texas creeks (Hester
2004). Berger Bluff (41GD30), just south of the project area in Goliad County, provides the best example
of local Paleoindian lifeways. At this site there is a collection of faunal remains of amphibians, reptiles,
and small mammals which were radiocarbon dated to about 9500 B.P. with both younger and older dates.
The Paleoindian period lasts until approximately 8000 years B.P. before transitioning to the Early
Archaic. The Early Archaic is characterized by two separate intervals. A corner-notched projectile point
interval spans the years 8000 to 5500 B.P. after which a basal-notched projectile point interval continues
until roughly 4500 B.P.
The Middle Archaic shows an intensification of exploitation of plant resources through a greater array of
earth ovens, fire cracked rocks, and burned rock middens (Hester 2004). These are all likely the result of
166

processing various plant foods. It is at this time that similar projectile point types can also be found in
central Texas, the Lower Pecos, or the Coastal Plains (Hester 2004). The Middle Archaic ranged from
4500 to 2400 B.P.
The Late Archaic, 2400 B.P. to 1400 B.P., continues the extensive use of hot rock cooking; however in
one instance at least there is a large quantity of mussel shells near fire cracked rock (Hester 2004). There
is also increased conflict, evidenced by burials with projectile points embedded in the bones. In addition,
there are artifacts throughout south Texas from this period made from central Texas Edwards chert,
suggesting trade or travel.
The Late Prehistoric, 1400 B.P. to roughly 500 B.P., is identified by the introduction of pottery and the
bow and arrow. Arrow points and pottery are the most common diagnostic markers for the Late
Prehistoric period. Arrow shaft straighteners also appear in south Texas.
The Protohistoric period covers when Europeans were known in the area and impacted it to an
undetermined extent, but before they settled it extensively. Before Spanish settlers started ranching in the
area in the 1750s, the project area was between Presido La Bahia in Goliad County and the various
missions in San Antonio.
Spanish ranchos appeared in the area starting in the mid-1750s (Long 2013). The ranches waxed and
waned with the intensity of raids by Native American groups, mainly the Lipan Apache and Comanche.
The first recorded landowner in the project area south of the river was Carlos MartÃ­nez who received a
royal Spanish grant in 1791. He was reportedly killed in 1815 in a Native American raid. He or his
descendants are recorded as still owning part of the original grant in the original Republic of Texas Land
Survey. The rest of the project area south of the river was granted to soldiers and a surgeon who
participated in the Texas Revolutionary War. The project area north of the river was granted to RamÃ³n
MÃºsquiz by the Mexican government in the 1830s.
Karnes County was founded in 1853 with the county seat of Helena, a town that had been founded in the
1852 (Long 2013). Helena is four kilometers north-northwest of the project area. Panna Maria, the first
permanent Polish settlement in the United States, was founded in 1854 ten kilometers northwest of the
project area. These two towns are all but abandoned now. Karnes County focused on cattle ranching and
as a result there were only 327 slaves at the start of the Civil War. Helena started to decline in 1886 when
a rancher managed to get the railroad routed away from Helena in retaliation for the murder of his son. In
1893 Karnes City beat Helena and Runge in an election for the county seat. Karnes County was never
heavily settled however, reaching a high of 23,000 inhabitants in the 1930 census before dropping to just
over 10,000 in recent years.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

There were no previously recorded sites within the ROW; however surveys have found 41KA66,
41KA67, 41KA152, 41KA157, 41KA164, 41KA165 and 41KA168 within 1.5 km of the ROW. Site
167

41KA152 is a site on the Dry Escondido that has a few chert flakes and fire cracked rocks. Site 41KA157
is on the San Antonio flood plain and consists of fire cracked rocks, fractured quartzite hammerstone
fragments, and chert cores and flakes. Site 41KA168 contains two chert flakes in an agricultural field
north of the San Antonio River. Sites 41KA66, 41KA67, 41KA164, and 41KA165 are all lithic scatters
spread out on terraces and ridges overlooking the San Antonio River. They have chert, quartzite, silicified
wood and fire cracked rocks. They might be similar to sites excavated at the Choke Canyon reservoir
where âopen block excavations improved both recovery and studies of horizontal patterningâ (Hester
2004).
There are at least two prehistoric sites with burials reported in the county. Site 41KA102 is a Late Archaic
cemetery where later burials were dug through earlier interments. Twelve of the twenty-five individuals
buried at the site were less than twenty years old and nine of those twelve were younger than ten. This site
also has campsite debris on and around the location of the burials, but it is not present farther away.
(Texas Beyond History). According to the THC Archeological Sites Atlas, site 41KA23 was discovered
by a bulldozer âaltering the slope for a fenceline.â This was one burial of a person in a flexed position
with their head in the direction of the San Antonio River.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be eligible for formal
listing as State Antiquities Landmarks. All work was conducted under blanket TAC Permit 6443 and
terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA survey
and reporting standards.
Following a review of geology, soils, recent and historical maps, and previous investigations, 3.7 miles of
moderate to high probability areas were identified for prehistoric and historic sites. Pedestrian survey with
subsurface testing was conducted across all high probability areas, while moderate probability areas
received at minimum a windshield survey, when visibility warranted. When visibility was less than about
50 percent, pedestrian survey was conducted.
Subsurface tests were primarily excavated at new structure locations in locations within high probability
areas (Figure 83), and to augment information on sites that were encountered. Auger tests were dug using
a skidsteer (Bobcat) on the alluvial floodplains near the San Antonio River. Ground visibility was
generally good to excellent, often over 50 percent, due to the cleared, previously disturbed ROW. Fortyone subsurface tests were excavated within 3.7 miles of high to moderate probability areas. Because of
the excellent visibility, the largely upland setting with shallow soils, and the fact that new disturbance will
be limited to 29 new structure locations, the number of shovel tests is considered sufficient. Records
included field notes and photo logs with shovel and auger tests recorded on standardized forms and on
GPS equipment. A full list of subsurface tests is included as an appendix.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

As a result of the survey four sites were recorded, 41KA187-41KA190. These sites were all prehistoric
lithic scatters, some with small amounts of fire-cracked rock.

41KA187
Site 41KA187 is a 185-m-long lithic scatter on a saddle overlooking the San Antonio River (Figure 84;
Figure 85). It extends east and west for an undetermined distance out of the right of way. The site is on
Shiner soils over the Oakville Sandstone formation. The soils support short grasses that are used for
pasture. Visibility was estimated at 80 percent.
The surface scatter consists of tested chert cobbles, flakes, many pieces of unmodified silicified wood and
quartzite, and some fire cracked rocks. Three shovel tests (3-5) were excavated at the new support
structure location. Soils were generally shallow, about 40 cm in depth over sandstone or dense carbonate,
and the site is likely a palimpsest, as suggested by the co-occurrence of modern glass fragments and chert
flakes.
Observed surface materials consisted of five cores, an early stage biface, two to three primary flakes, and
about 40 secondary and tertiary flakes. Both hard hammer and soft hammer reduction was represented.
Small fragments of fire-cracked sandstone and quartzite were present, but not observed in any
concentration suggesting features, and they may be the result of recent land clearing. Shovel test recovery
was very sparse, consisting of a total five flake fragments, four small burned rocks, and two pieces of
recent glass.

169

Site 41KA187 is a minor lithic scatter located in apparent lag deposits of chert, quartzite and silicified
wood, probably originating from the Oakville Sandstone formation. There is no evidence of vertical or
horizontal patterning of artifacts, no recognizable features, no formal or informal tools, and no evidence
of organic preservation. The site is considered fully investigated within the ROW, and is not considered
eligible for formal SAL status. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary. Portions
of the site that may extend out of the ROW are considered to be of undetermined eligibility status,
although it is suspected that research value would be low.

41KA188
Site 41KA188 is a very small (20-30 m diameter) lithic scatter exposed along a ridge (Figure 85; Figure
86). It is roughly 170 meters south of 41KA187, and is also on the Oakville Sandstone. The local soil is
Pernitas sandy clay loam. The land is used for pasture. Visibility approached 100 percent.
The total artifact assemblage consisted of about 15 pieces of debitage, both secondary and tertiary flakes
and flake fragments, and one informal unifacial tool within a scatter of chert, quartzite and silicified wood
lag deposits. The landform upon which the site rests is heavily eroded on a non-aggrading upland setting.
Due to the excellent visibility, lack of potential for buried deposits, and the fact that no transmission line
support structure is planned for the location, no shovel tests were excavated.
Site 41KA188 is a minor lithic scatter associated with a light deposit of lag gravels. No suggestion of
artifact patterning was noted and there is no potential for buried materials. The single informal tool is not
diagnostic of either time or specific function. The site is considered fully investigated within the ROW,
and is not considered eligible for formal SAL status. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary. Portions of the site that may extend out of the ROW are considered to be of
undetermined eligibility status, although it is suspected that research value would be low.

170

41KA189
Site 41KA189 is a very small (about 20 m in diameter) lithic scatter on the Oakville Sandstone formation
with Pernitas sandy clay loam soil (Figure 87) on the steep north bank of Dry Escondido Creek (see Figure
83). In the right of way there are only short grasses due to clearing, however the surrounding area is
wooded.
About 10 flakes were seen along the eroded bank of the creek, along with a few possible burned rocks.
Two shovel tests (14 and 15) produced 2 chert chips, 10 burned chert fragments, 1 chert spall with
apparent edge wear, and 1 fragment of burned silicified wood. The shovel tests encountered gray subsoils
at depths of 25 and 31 cm. Because there is no transmission line support structure planned for this
location, three more shovel tests (16-18) were placed at the proposed new structure location, about 140 m
to the north, along the upper interfluvial divide. These tests were all negative for cultural material.
Within the ROW, 41KA189 consists of a very light scatter of lithic debitage and small fire-cracked rock
of indeterminate origin. There is no suggestion of artifact patterning or features, nor were any diagnostic
artifacts encountered. The shallowness of the soil, light recovery from shovel tests, and scarcity of
artifacts on the surface suggests the site lacks further research value.
The site is considered fully investigated within the ROW, and is not considered eligible for formal SAL
status. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary. Portions of the site that may
extend out of the ROW are considered to be of undetermined eligibility status, but unlike 41KA187 and
41KA188, there may be more substantial deposits elsewhere.

41KA190
Site 41KA190 is a lithic scatter located at the edge of mapped Holocene alluvium at the base of the ridge
system overlooking the San Antonio River located about 325 m to the north (Figure 85; Figure 88). The
modern USGS map suggests the site may be along an old meander of the river. Soils are mapped as
Buchel clay. The site was located at the south edge of a plowed field abutting open pasture. Visibility was
excellent within the plowed field and good in the pasture.
The site was first recognized by the presence of six or eight flakes seen in the vicinity of the existing Hframe structure within the plowed field. Further examination found widely scattered fire-cracked rock,
and three to six small mussel shell fragments. Four subsurface tests (24, 25, 27, 28) were placed at the
new transmission line support structure location, which will be very close to the existing H-frame
structure. Two more (2, 29) were placed just south of the new structure location within the pasture.
Due to recent rains and the extremely dense nature of the clay soils, the floodplain was tested by
mechanical means (augering), except for test 2, excavated to a depth of 80 cm. Following heavy rains,
even the auger had trouble penetrating the soil, and a rocking method was necessary to reach any
meaningful depth. Because of previous agricultural work, the vertisolic nature of the soil, and the
difficulty in extracting it from the tests, vertical provenience of recovery was a tenuous prospect. The
testing was therefore used as a presence/absence test for significant cultural material. Tests were
excavated to depths of 80 cm.
Of the six tests, three (27, 28 and 29) were negative. Test 2 had a chert flake and a burned quartzite
fragment between 60 and 80 cm, 25 had a single biface thing flake in the upper 20 cm, and 26 had one
chip and a single very small mussel shell fragment between 40 and 80 cm. Soils were primarily a dark
brown to dark gray grading to very dark gray and black clays with depth.

173

Observed surface materials did not continue towards the north, and test 27, furthest to the north, was
negative for cultural material. However, a new structure is planned to be placed about 225 m to the north,
about 110 m south of the river, also within a plowed field. Visual examination did not locate any artifacts
in this area. Subsurface tests 1 and 28 were excavated at the new structure location. The soil in this area
was a brownish silt loam over silt clay or silty loam with dense carbonates. Both tests were negative.
The portion of 41KA190 that is within the project area lacks horizontal and vertical patterning, has very
few artifacts, no identified features or diagnostic artifacts, and is within previously disturbed pasture and
agricultural fields. Therefore, the portion of the site within the right-of-way corridor is not considered to
be eligible for formal SAL designation.
The site is considered fully investigated within the right-of-way, and no further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary. Portions of the site that may extend out of the right of way are
considered to be of undetermined eligibility status, and areas elsewhere along the river may well contain
archaeological materials.

Other Areas
The north side of the San Antonio River is mapped as Holocene alluvium and was considered a high
probability area. Eleven subsurface tests (31-41) were excavated across approximately 1.4 km of recently
harvested cotton and maize fields, and were placed at new structure locations and topographic rises
(Figure 81; Figure 89). These tests were all excavated to a minimum depth of 100 cm, and in one case
reached 160 cm. Soils were different than on the south side of the river; much loamier in places and
generally a lighter color, often approaching a yellowish brown. Snails were commonly encountered,
mostly Oligyra and Rabdotus species, suggesting successional aggradation. No artifacts were seen either
on the surface nor recovered from any of the subsurface tests. A conversation with the landowner
indicated that campsites were located nearby, probably to the north on more elevated landforms. The
landowner had never found any artifacts along the transmission line corridor.
There is a structure shown on the 1952 and modern USGS map, situated outside the right of way about
0.5 miles north of the Kenedy Switch (southern) substation (see Figure 82), which was investigated. The
house location was seen, but the structure had recently burned, leaving no recognizable remains. (Figure
90). Three shovel tests (7, 8, 9) were dug to determine if historic materials were within the right of way,
however all the shovel tests were sterile and no artifacts were observed on the surface. This location was
not recorded as an archaeological site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

LCRA conducted an intensive survey of suspected moderate to high probability locations on July 15-18
and August 6, 2013, in anticipation of the T-540 Kenedy to Helena Transmission Line Upgrade Project.
The project area was within a 18.3 m (60 ft) wide right-of-way that is 7.1 miles long. Of that distance 3.7
miles was considered to have moderate to high probability for cultural resources. Work concentrated on
areas where transmission lines poles would be replaced. Four sites (41KA187-41KA190) were located
and recorded. They were all prehistoric lithic scatters. One was spread out over 185 m within the ROW
while the others are localized within 30 meters or less.
176

The prehistoric sites are similar to what Hester calls an âoccupation zoneâ (1995). The âoccupation zoneâ
is a spread out area that because of the relatively non-aggrading surface has no vertical separation of
different periods of occupation. This can make it appear to be one large occurrence when it could be any
number of visits. Such sites tend to be broad rather than deep. There are similar sites nearby (see Previous
Investigations). Site 41KA164 is similar to site 41KA187, except longer. Site 41KA152 is similar to site
41KA189. These transient sites could be short stopovers or specialized camps for a specific purpose that
split off from a larger camp located elsewhere near the San Antonio River.
While areas outside the ROW are of undetermined eligibility, research potential is considered low at
41KA187 and 41KA188, moderate at 41KA189, and possibly high in the vicinity of 41KA190. However,
as recorded within the ROW, it is recommended that none of those portions of the sites meet the
requirements for formal SAL designation nor do they require any mitigation or avoidance measures.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed, with standard emergency discovery procedures in
place.

Project 37.13 A Cultural Resources Survey of LCRAâs Nixon Substation Expansion Project in
Gonzales County, Texas

By Charles A. Hixson and Sean Zimmerman

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to expand its Nixon Substation which is located in
the southwestern part of Gonzales County, Texas (Figure 91). The expansion will be constructed within a
0.4 acre area adjacent to the southwestern side of the existing substation perimeter fence (Figure 92). This
area lies on the edge of the large pasture surrounding the substation, and is situated on a high, sandy
terrace-like rise overlooking a perennial stream.
In 1995, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted a cultural resources survey of the Nixon Substation, the
associated access road, and a segment of transmission line ROW running 600 meters southwest of the
substation site (Nash and Taylor 1995). This segment of transmission ROW appears to overlap part of the
proposed substation expansion area, and therefore part of the current project might have been included in
the EH&A survey. If so, no cultural resources sites were recorded there. Because the project is located in
an area with a high probability for prehistoric archaeological sites, and because the project area at least
partially lies outside the area surveyed by EH&A in 1995, staff decided to conduct an intensive field
survey of the entire 0.4 acre project area.
The survey was done on August 22, 2013 and resulted in the recording of one new archaeological site,
41GZ247, a buried prehistoric lithic scatter. The recovered cultural material consists entirely of debitage
widely distributed in deep sands. The site is assessed as not eligible for State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
designation because of the lack of tools, features, and discrete occupational zones. Because no SALeligible cultural resources sites will be impacted by the proposed substation expansion, staff recommends
that the substation expansion project be allowed to proceed.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual State Antiquities
Permit Number 6443. There is no federal funding or permitting involved that requires a Section 106
review. No artifacts were collected for curation.
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is underlain by clay and sandstone belonging to the Cook Mountain formation of Eocene
age (Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). The soil within the project area is mapped as Chazos loamy
fine sand, which develops on loamy or clayey alluvium of quaternary age (Natural Resources
Conservation Service 2013). A typical soil profile consists of a 28-cm (11-inch) thick surface zone of
loamy fine sand over clay and clay loam. However, all six shovel tests dug during the survey encountered
only loamy sand from the surface down to the bottom of the tests, most of which reached a depth of at
least 140 cm. The local topography consists of rolling hills and moderately incised streams.
A perennial stream called Clear Fork Creek lies 35 m to the south of the project area, running in a
northwest to southeast direction (Figure 93). It joins Sandies Creek about seven kilometers to the east,
which in turn enters the Guadalupe River near Cuero another 40 km to the southeast. The project area

occupies a terrace-like hill that rises 7.6 m (25 ft) above the Clear Fork Creek channel. This area lies at
the south edge of an extensive pasture, and is nearly devoid of woody vegetation except for a few small
hackberry and prickly ash trees (Figure 94). No grasses were noted in the survey area, and only forbs,
mostly of the spurge family, were growing at the time of the survey. A narrow zone of dry woods
composed of cedar elm and hackberry is found close to the creek channel.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the northeastern edge of the south Texas archeological region as defined
by Hester (2004). Ellis et al. (1995) note the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about an
area as diverse as south Texas. Indeed, at various times south Texas shares diagnostic artifacts with the
Southern Plains, central Texas, the Lower Pecos, and the Coastal Plains regions. The prehistory of south
Texas is not clearly delineated, but the basic chronological divisions of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric provide a framework.
The beginning Paleoindian period is recognizable by Clovis points that date back to 11,000 years before
present (B.P.). Commonly thought of as big game hunters, no mammoth kill or butcher sites have been
found in south Texas, even though mammoth remains are commonly found in south Texas creeks (Hester
2004). Berger Bluff (41GD30), just south of the project area in Goliad County, provides the best example
of local Paleoindian lifeways. At this site there is a collection of faunal remains of amphibians, reptiles,
and small mammals carbon dated to about 9500 B.P. with both younger and older dates.
The Paleoindian period lasts until approximately 8000 years B.P. before transitioning to the Early
Archaic. The Early Archaic is characterized by two separate intervals. A corner-notched projectile point
interval spans the years 8000 to 5500 B.P. after which a basal-notched projectile point interval continues
until roughly 4500 B.P.
The Middle Archaic shows an intensification of exploitation of plant resources through a greater array of
earth ovens, fire cracked rocks, and burned rock middens (Hester 2004). These are all likely the result of
processing various plant foods. It is at this time that similar projectile point types can also be found in
central Texas, the Lower Pecos, or the Coastal Plains (Hester 2004). The Middle Archaic ranged from
4500 to 2400 B.P.
The Late Archaic, 2400 B.P. to 1400 B.P., continues the extensive use of hot rock cooking; with large
quantities of mussel shells sometimes occurring near fire cracked rock (Hester 2004). There is also
increased conflict, evidenced by burials with projectile points embedded in the bones. In addition, there
are artifacts throughout south Texas from this period made from central Texas Edwards chert, suggesting
trade or travel.

191

The Late Prehistoric, 1400 B.P. to roughly 500 B.P., is identified by the introduction of pottery and the
bow and arrow. Since wood is rarely preserved in the archeological record arrow points and pottery are
the marker for the transition. Arrow shaft straighteners also appear in south Texas.
The land around the project area was predominately settled by European Americans following the Texas
Revolutionary War when the country (and later the state) used land grants to encourage settlement and
raise revenue. Gonzales, 36.5 kilometers to the north east, is a notable exception that formed in 1836 as
the capital of DeWittâs colony (Hardin 2013). Many of the towns in the area, Nixon, Poth, Pandora,
Smiley and others, formed around various railroads after the Civil War.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A number of linear surveys for roads, transmission lines, pipelines and similar projects have been
conducted near the project area. The project area itself was surveyed in 1995 for the Nixon substation and
transmission line rebuild project (Nash and Taylor 1995). This survey located site 41GZ204, 600 meters
to the southwest. This site was a surface scatter of chert and quartzite flakes and no subsurface artifacts
were found in shovel tests. Over the rest of the project area twenty shovel tests were dug to a depth of 50
to 100 cm. No artifacts were located in these shovel tests either.
Many of the sites located in linear surveys near the project area are similar to site 41GZ204. Sparse lithic
scatters close to creeks or streams that are not close to other sites. Two surveys had much different results
however. Two proposed reservoirs instigated area surveys that found clusters of sites. On the Guadalupe
River and tributaries the archeological survey for the proposed Cuero Reservoir found many similar sites
that were close together and the same was found on Cibolo Creek for the proposed Cibolo Reservoir.
The Shrew site (41WN73) is on a terrace half a kilometer south of the San Antonio River and 50
kilometers west of the project area. This site had intact portions ranging from the Early Archaic to the
Transitional Archaic and possibly to the Late Prehistoric (Labadie 1988). It also had four disturbed burials
dating to the Late Archaic.
LCRA conducted a linear survey near Seguin in 2012 that found a number of sites, one of which,
41GU142, is a prehistoric campsite on a terrace along the Guadalupe River (Prikryl et al. 2013). This site
had four burned rock features along with a Guadalupe biface and was buried at depths up to 145 cm bs.
Along with that site the survey also found four other sites, all but one of which were prehistoric campsites
or lithic scatters along creeks. The remaining site was a historic homestead.

192

METHODOLOGY

The survey consisted of a walkover of the entire project area and excavation of six shovel tests (Figure
95). Because of the poor ground visibility, the survey team had originally planned to dig at least three
shovel tests. Because artifacts were recovered in the first test, the number of tests was expanded to six in
order to learn the limits of the site within the project area, and to sample the site sufficiently to locate
possible features. Each test consisted of the excavation of a circular hole 35 to 40 cm in diameter to
depths of between 120 and 150 cm. All fill was screened through a Â¼ inch wire mesh to recover artifacts,
which were recorded and then returned to the hole with the fill. A soil profile was also recorded for each
test. Shovel test recovery is shown in the Appendix table.

RESULTS

One archeological site, 41GZ247, was recorded during the field survey (see Figure 95). The site consists
of debitage in low to moderate densities buried between 20 and 140 cm across the entire 0.4 acre project
area. No burned rocks or stone tools were recovered. No vertical concentrations of debitage were
encountered in the tests, and rarely was more than one artifact found in a 20 cm level per test. The vertical
distribution of the debitage is probably due to bioturbation of the loose, sandy soil, which is mapped as
quaternary in age.
The chert debitage varies in terms of color, texture, and presence of cortex, and includes both hard and
soft hammer flakes, flake fragments, and non-flake debitage. One quartzite flake, the only non-chert
artifact, was recovered from ST 6. The amount of debitage recovered ranged from one piece in three tests
(STs 3, 4, and 5), two in ST 6, four in ST 1, and five and ST 2. The larger recovery in the western half of
the project area suggests that the site continues to the west and is perhaps centered closer to the small
tributary that enters Clear Fork Creek 180 m upstream. Site 41GZ247 within the project area is assessed
as not eligible for SAL designation because of the absence of features, tools, and discrete components.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

One cultural resources site, 41GZ247, was recorded during the survey. It appears to extend across the
entire 0.4 acre of the project area and consists of lithic debitage dispersed in sandy soil. The site contains
no discrete occupational zones or features, and is assessed as not eligible for SAL designation. Because
no SAL-eligible cultural resources sites will be affected by the expansion of the Nixon Substation, staff
recommends that this project proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA proposes to rebuild an approximate 14.9-mile-long transmission line located in north-central
Karnes County. The line consists of two sections, one that runs for about 9.3 miles between the Helena
and Milton substations, and one that tees off about 6.8 miles north of the Helena Substation at the
Magnolia Tap then runs about 5.6 miles west and south west to the Magnolia Substation. Relevant project
components consist of replacing existing wooden H-frame support structures at new locations with metal
or cement single pole structures. Lattice structures may be used at certain angles. With a ROW defined as
18.2 m (60 ft) in width the project will affect approximately 108 acres.
Approximately 4.2 miles of high probability area for prehistoric archaeological sites were identified
during a map and file review (Figure 96; Figure 97; Figure 98; Figure 99). Although the line route does
not cross any previously recorded sites, several are recorded on similar land forms nearby. No historic
sites were suggested during a review of pertinent historic maps. The high probability areas were primarily
determined based on distances from streams, particularly Ecleto and Dry Ecleto creeks, and slope of land
forms. Terraces and lobes overlooking streams were given special consideration.
The cultural resource assessment was conducted for compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code under
the terms of LCRAâs Blanket Antiquities Permit 6443 for Calendar Year 2013. Since there are no federal
funds or permits involved in this project, a review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act was not required. There was a no-collection policy in place for this project, and therefore no curation
will be necessary.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located in south Texas within the southern edge of the Southern Post Oak Savanna
section of the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). This is characterized by
alternating areas of trees and grasses. Much of the land has been converted for farming and ranching.
Most of the project area is underlain by late Tertiary clay and sandstone deposits of the Oakville,
Catahoula and Whitsett formations. The Oakville Sandstone can include fossil wood, quartz and chert
pebbles, and both vertebrate and invertebrate fossils (Barnes 1974). Also present are high Quaternaryaged terraces and Holocene alluvial deposits along Ecleto and Dry Ecleto Creeks.
Alfisols make up most of the soil in high probability areas and include Bryde fine sandy loam, Gillet fine
sandy loam, Imogene fine sandy loam, Miguel fine sandy loam and Nusil fine sand. These soils have 1040 cm A horizons, with the exception of Nusil fine sand, which has a combined A and E horizon of at
least 100 cm. Mollisols, primarily in the form of clay loams, are present as well and have A horizons
between about 10 and 30 cm in thickness, with the exception of Sinton sandy clay loam, which has a 90
cm A horizon. Vertisols and an Enceptisol make up the remainder of soils in the high probability areas.

Ecleto and Dry Ecleto creeks are the primary drainages in the project area and tributaries of the San
Antonio River. The nearby Rhymes and McTennel creeks drain into Ecleto creek. The vast majority of
the observed project area consisted of pasture, some of which was heavily terraced. Oak, mesquite and
persimmon was the most common woody vegetation.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located near the northeastern edge of the south Texas archeological region as defined
by Hester (2005). Ellis et al. (1995) note the inaccurate homogenization that occurs when writing about an
area as diverse as south Texas. Indeed, at various times south Texas shares diagnostic artifacts with the
Southern Plains, central Texas, the Lower Pecos, and the Coastal Plains regions. The prehistory of south
Texas is not clearly delineated, but the basic chronological divisions of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric provide a framework.
The beginning Paleoindian period is recognizable by Clovis points that date back to 11,000 years before
present (B.P.). Commonly thought of as big game hunters, no mammoth kill or butcher sites have been
found in south Texas, even though mammoth remains are commonly found in south Texas creeks (Hester
2005). Berger Bluff (41GD30), just south of the project area in Goliad County, provides the best example
of local Paleoindian lifeways. At this site there is a collection of faunal remains of amphibians, reptiles,
and small mammals carbon dated to about 9500 B.P. with both younger and older dates.
The Paleoindian period lasts until approximately 8000 years B.P. before transitioning to the Early
Archaic. The Early Archaic is characterized by two separate intervals. A corner-notched projectile point
interval spans the years 8000 to 5500 B.P. after which a basal-notched projectile point interval continues
until roughly 4500 B.P.
The Middle Archaic shows an intensification of exploitation of plant resources through a greater array of
earth ovens, fire cracked rocks, and burned rock middens (Hester 200). These are all likely the result of
processing various plant foods. It is at this time that similar projectile point types can also be found in
central Texas, the Lower Pecos, or the Coastal Plains (Hester 2005). The Middle Archaic ranged from
4500 to 2400 B.P.
The Late Archaic, 2400 B.P. to 1400 B.P., continues the extensive use of hot rock cooking, and large
quantities of mussel shells sometimes occur near fire cracked rock (Hester 2005). There is also increased
conflict, evidenced by burials with projectile points embedded in the bones. In addition, there are artifacts
throughout south Texas from this period made from central Texas Edwards chert, suggesting trade or
travel.

203

The Late Prehistoric, 1400 B.P. to roughly 500 B.P., is identified by the introduction of pottery and the
bow and arrow. Since wood is rarely preserved in the archeological record arrow points and pottery are
the markers for this period. Stone arrow shaft straighteners also appear in south Texas.
The Protohistoric period covers when Europeans were known in the area and impacted it to an
undetermined extent, but before they settled it extensively. Before Spanish settlers started ranching in the
area in the 1750s, the project area was between Presido La Bahia in Goliad County and the various
missions in San Antonio. The La Bahia Road crosses the project area in two locations.
Spanish ranchos appeared in the area starting in the mid-1750s (Long 2013). The ranches waxed and
waned with the intensity of raids by Native American groups, mainly the Lipan Apache and Comanche.
Part of the project area west of Ecleto Creek was granted to RamÃ³n MÃºsquiz by the Mexican government
in the 1830s. The land east of the creek was pasture lands for Mission Espiritu Santo.
Karnes County was founded in 1853 with the county seat of Helena, a town that had been founded in
1852 (Long 2013). Helena is three km northwest of the southern extent of the project area. Panna Maria,
the first permanent Polish settlement in the United States, was founded in 1854 ten km west of the
southern extent of the project area. These two towns are all but abandoned now. Karnes County focused
on cattle ranching instead of plantations and as a result there were only 327 slaves at the start of the Civil
War. Helena started to decline in 1886 when a rancher managed to get the railroad routed away from
Helena in retaliation for the murder of his son. In 1893 Karnes City beat Helena and Runge in an election
for the county seat. Karnes County was never heavily settled however, reaching a high of 23,000
inhabitants in the 1930 census before dropping to just over 10,000 in recent years.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The earliest archaeological work in the immediate area was performed by Daymond Crawford during a
reconnaissance for a series of flood control dams on the Ecleto Creek watershed in DeWitt, Karnes and
Wilson counties (Crawford 1971). Sixteen prehistoric sites were recorded, 41KA8-41KA22 and 41DW12.
No sites were recorded in Wilson County, to the north of the present project area. Three site types were
defined: open sites with scattered chipping debris (lithic scatters); buried sites exposed in gullies (camp
sites); and workshop sites (lithic procurement in gravels). The buried sites were the common type
encountered. Two Tortugas points and one Morhiss point, along with scrapers, a gouge, choppers and
crude bifaces were documented. Artifacts made of silicified wood were common.
In the vicinity of the project area, about 2.6 km southwest of the Magnolia Tap, (Crawfordâs Dam Site 8
on Dry Ecleto Creek), were sites 41KA9, KA10, KA12, KA13 and KA17-19. Of these seven sites, four
were buried, one was open and two were workshops. No fire-cracked rock was mentioned in the site
descriptions, although testing, and in one case extensive excavation (41KA10) was recommended for
some sites. Buried components ranged from 6 to 40 cm in depth and were as thin as 5 to 8 cm.

204

Crawfordâs Dam Site 5, on Rhymes Creek, was located about 2 km north of the Magnolia Tap to
Magnolia section of the line, contained site 41KA20 and KA21, both buried sites recommended for
testing. Site 41KA21 included fire-cracked cobbles in a 5 to 12 cm-thick zone buried 106 cm below the
surface. Testing was recommended for both sites.
Nine other sites are shown on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas in the near vicinity of the present
project area. Mostly recorded during pipeline surveys, these sites include lithic scatters, procurement sites
and at least two apparent camp sites.
There are at least two prehistoric sites with burials reported in the county. Site 41KA102, the Silo Site, is
a Late Archaic cemetery where later burials were dug through earlier interments. Twelve of the 25
individuals buried at the site were less than 20 years old and nine of those 12 were younger than ten. This
site also has campsite debris on and around the location of the burials, but it is not present farther away.
(Texas Beyond History). According to the THC Archeological Sites Atlas, site 41KA23, the Rudy Haiduk
site, was discovered by a bulldozer âaltering the slope for a fenceline.â This was one burial of a person in
a flexed position with their head in the direction of the San Antonio River. Both sites had grave goods
including corner-tang knives, and in the case of 41KA23, red ochre and an ornamental stone fragment,
recorded.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

This survey-level project was designed to identify archaeological sites within the areas of direct impacts
and assess their eligibility for formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks. All work was done in
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA and TAC Permit 6443.
The 14.9-mile-long transmission line corridor was first reviewed for previously recorded sites, geology,
soils, and stream drainages. Historical maps were also consulted. High probability areas (HPAs) were
defined based on these reviews and subjected to intensive field survey. Approximately 4.2 miles (28
percent) of the corridor was assessed as having a high probability for prehistoric resources. No areas were
identified with high probability for historic resources.
Direct impacts consisted of 37 new structure locations within the map-assessed HPAs. Minimum survey
standards suggest about 67 shovel tests for the total length of HPA. Shovel tests (ST) were excavated at
most new structure locations and to help define archaeological sites that were encountered. They were
excavated to subsoil, bedrock equivalent, or clearly sterile elevations. In total, 25 STs were excavated.
This is considered a sufficient number given the generally excellent visibility and eroded nature of much
of the area, combined with typically shallow soils, often in upland settings where cultural material would
be expected within the upper soil zones (Figure 100; Figure 101).
Records included digital photographs and logs, GPS logs, field notes, sketch drawings and shovel test
records.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Eight prehistoric archaeological sites, 41KA191-41KA198 were recorded as a result of the survey (Figure
102; Figure 103; Figure 104). The sites are all open campsites- typically with decorticate flakes and firecracked rock fragments, and appear to signify short term encampments or perhaps lithic heat-treating
stations/workshops. Debitage and tools are made from materials including chert from cobbles, fine-

grained quartzite, high quality silicified wood â including transparent/translucent pieces, and apparent
chalcedony. One possible feature, a disrupted hearth, was found at Site 4. Otherwise, the sites are
relatively diffuse and lack time-diagnostic tools, have few recognizable functional tools, lack organic
preservation or observable stratification.

41KA191

Site 41KA191 is a prehistoric site close to a tributary to Ecleto Creek (Figure 105). The site runs from a
terrace down the slope to within 50 m of the tributary and it is also 300 m west of Ecleto Creek. The right
of way has been cleared but it runs through woods and brush of oak, mesquite, prickly pear, sumac,
prickly ash, and persimmon. A ranch road has been established through this site and in places fill has been
introduced.
STs 1 and 2 were dug on the terrace 15 meters apart and ST 3 at the foot of the slope 111 meters north
northeast of shovel test 2. The soil is shallow, between 12 and 20 cm deep, on the terrace and up to 100
cm deep at the bottom. Chert and quartzite flakes are present throughout the site, but there is an area with
scattered burned rock on the west side. The road acts as an artificial boundary on this area of burned rock.
There is a large quartzite hard hammer flake, and a trimmed cortical biface in addition to the flakes. Some
silicified wood flakes are also present.
The site is likely a short-term campsite. It could extend east and west outside of the ROW. The known
portion of the site is recommended as fully investigated and not eligible for former SAL listing.
Additional investigation is recommended in case work outside of the current proposed ROW is necessary.
41KA192
Site 41KA192 is a prehistoric campsite located 4.2 km northeast of Helena on the west side of Ecleto
Creek (Figure 106). It occupies a low rise within a large pasture between two small clumps of live oak
and mesquite trees. At the time of the survey, the ground was covered by short grasses and forbs, with
small bare areas caused by superficial erosion, especially along the ROW truck path. It was in these bare
areas that most of the artifacts were seen. A typical soil profile for the area shows about 18 cm of sandy
loam over silty clay.
The artifact inventory recorded for the site consists of about 20 pieces of debitage, mostly of chert with a
few of quartzite, along with a like number of small burned quartzite rocks averaging less than 3 cm in
diameter. This cultural material was scattered across the site area with about half concentrated in a ten by
ten meter area at the north end of the site. One chert core was also noted 18 meters north of Structure
10/7.

210

Figure 105. Map of 41KA191.

No features such as hearths were seen. Recovery from the three STs was meager, with two tests having
no recovery and a third test, placed at the north end of the site in the artifact concentration, recovering a
single flake of petrified wood from between 20 and 40 cm below ground surface. It was uncertain if this
flake was actually cultural in origin.
Shovel testing demonstrated little or no depth to the site, which is not surprising considering its location
on an elevated, non-aggrading landform. Cultural material occurs in low densities with no features, tools,
or diagnostic artifacts located during the survey. Therefore, the site area within the ROW is not
considered eligible for SAL designation. Areas of the site outside the ROW were not investigated and
therefore their SAL eligibility is undetermined.

211

Figure 106. Map of 41KA192.

41KA193
Site 41KA183 is located along the first stable terrace on the east side of Dry Ecleto Creek about 4 km
north-northeast of its confluence with Ecleto Creek (Figure 107). It is within Imogene fine sandy loam
over Quaternary terrace deposits. The once heavily-wooded lower terrace outside the ROW has been
recently bulldozed and a large stock tank berm borders the site to the south and east (Figure 108). It is
about 80 m in length within the ROW that parallels this section of creek.
Materials observed on the surface consisted of a few small fragments of burned chert and quartzite and a
few pieces of debitage, also of chert and quartzite. About five pieces of burned rock were between 5 and
10 cm in maximum diameter. ST 13 was placed at the location of the single new structure planned for the
site. It recovered seven pieces of chert and quartzite debitage and five small fragments of burned rock
from 28 cm of brown sandy loam over very dark gray clay. ST 14 was placed about 20 m north of 13 and

212

encountered about 56 cm of light gray fine loamy sand over yellowish-brown sandy clay. It recovered
three tertiary chips from the upper 40 cm, and a total of 31 burned rock fragments, with greatest recovery
in the lower 40 cm.
The site appears to be short-term camp along a narrow bench paralleling Dry Ecleto Creek. It may once
have extended further to the south and if so that portion was destroyed by stock tank construction. The
transmission line exits the terrace at the north end of the site, so it may extend outside of the ROW in that
direction as well as to both the east and the west.
The known portion of the site within and immediately adjacent to the ROW is recommended as fully
investigated and not eligible for formal SAL listing. No further work is considered necessary. Potential
site components outside the ROW are of undetermined eligibility and if future projects include ground
disturbances outside the present easement then additional investigations should be considered.

Figure 108. Site 41KA193, looking north along Dry Ecleto Creek towards 41KA194.

41KA194
Site 41KA194 is roughly 300 meters north of 41KA193, just north of Dry Ecleto Creek (Figure 109). The
site is on a rise and portions of a steep bank overlooking the creek. Vegetation in the right of way was
sparse with intermittent grasses having a negligible effect on visibility. It is approximately 60 m long in
the ROW. Part of the site has been used for agriculture and part has been used as a trash dump with the
notable presence of a 50âs era Chevrolet rusting out on the centerline of the site. In addition, there is a
shallow road cut going up the bank from the creek crossing and a transmission line structure in the middle
of the site.
The site consists of a scatter of debitage and burned rocks for 60 m along the ROW. There is also one
thick biface exposed on the east side of the road cut and a dispersed hearth two meters in diameter in the
agricultural field portion of the site (Figure 110). ST 16 was dug 5 m north of the current structure in an
area that had been used for agriculture. This shovel test recovered four small burned rock fragments and
one primary flake.
The site is likely a short-term campsite that has been disturbed to an undetermined degree. It could extend
east and west outside of the ROW. The known portion of the site is recommended as fully investigated
and not eligible for former SAL listing. Additional investigation is recommended in case work outside of
the current proposed ROW is necessary.

215

41KA195
Site 41KA195 is a lithic scatter located 9.5 km north northeast of Helena between the forks of an
unnamed tributary of Ecleto Creek. Cultural material was found a few meters south of the county road on
a low slope in the northeastern corner of cleared strip of land within a former pasture or cultivated field.
The USGS topo map (Ecleto quad) shows this area as lying between the forks of a minor tributary to
Ecleto Creek. The west fork, which is closest to the site area, was barely visible on the ground, appearing
as a mere swale with no obvious channel. The vegetation in the immediate area included a fairly thick
covering of grasses and forbs with small mesquite trees in the uncleared part of the field to the east.
The artifacts were observed in superficially eroded areas where some scattered chert and quartzite cobbles
and pebbles are exposed. Among these gravels, two thin tertiary flakes, one thick tertiary flake, one hard
hammer cortical flake, and two possible burned rocks were observed on the surface. No shovel testing
was done because of the thin soils and low artifact density.
This site might represent a lithic procurement area because knappable chert and quartzite cobbles
naturally occur at the site. Within the ROW, the amount of cultural material is extremely low, consisting
mostly if not entirely of debitage, and is assessed as not eligible for SAL designation. The site might
continue to the southeast following the tributary branch but this area was not investigated and its SAL
statue is undetermined.

41KA196
This upland prehistoric site extends from about 110 to 190 m west of an unnamed tributary of Dry Ecleto
Creek (Figure 111). The site is located within a recently cleared area where ground surface visibility is
excellent (Figure 112). Some chert, silicified wood, quartzite, and chalcedony gravels associated with
Pleistocene age deposits are visible on ground surface in the transmission line corridor and in the narrow
ROW of a county road that is located immediately north of the corridor. Topsoils observed at the site
consist of the Pavelek clay and an unmapped loamy soil.
The site was first identified during pedestrian survey as a light surface scatter of chipped stone debitage
and burned rock fragments. An initial shovel test, ST 17, was excavated at the proposed location of a new
transmission pole structure. This test revealed two chert flakes in the first level and one quartzite flake in
the second level. This shovel test also yielded a moderate number (n=34) of burned rock fragments of
various sizes including 14 small specimens in level 4.
Three additional shovel tests, STs 18, 23 and 24 were subsequently excavated to aid in defining the
horizontal extent of the site and its subsurface contents. ST 18, which was excavated 30 m west of ST 17,
produced only one definite artifact, a small burned rock fragment which was found in level 3.
STs 23 and 24 were then excavated 30 and 60 m east, respectively, of ST 17 to better define the eastern
boundary of the site. ST 23 yielded five pieces of chipped stone debitage, 17 burned rock fragments, and
one mussel shell fragment in the first level. Artifacts were much less numerous in Level 2 and none
216

Figure 111. Map of 41KA196.

were found in Level 3 before solid caliche bedrock was struck at 50 cm below ground surface. At ST 24
only three artifacts were found. These consisted of three pieces of burned chert and chalcedony that came
from Level 1. Caliche was found at 33 cm below ground surface in that ST.
To conclude, artifacts were most numerous in STs 17 and 23. Interestingly, a dark gray to black loamy
topsoil was found at these two shovel test locations as opposed to dense clay topsoil further to the west
and east in STs 18 and 24, respectively. In total, about 20 pieces of chert, quartzite, and chalcedony
chipping debris, one chert core, one mussel shell fragment, and about 50 burned rock fragments were seen
on the surface and in shovel tests. The site may be both a lithic procurement/quarry and a campsite. The
burned rocks are suggestive of cooking/heating features related to campsite activities and the presence of
a mussel shell fragment is also suggestive of campsite activities related to food preparation/consumption.

217

As an alternate explanation, the burned rocks may be residue from features used for heat treatment of
some of the lag gravel deposits, especially the quartzite, to improve the flaking qualities.
The portion of the site within the transmission line corridor is assessed as not eligible for formal
designation as a SAL due to the lack of intact features, the absence of diagnostic artifacts, and overall low
density and diversity of artifacts observed on the surface and in the shovel tests. Thus, it is recommended
that the proposed construction of a new transmission pole structure in the vicinity of ST 17 be allowed to
proceed. No other impacts to the site are anticipated.

Figure 112. Site 41KA196, looking east towards drainage.

41KA197
Site 41KA197 is a minor lithic scatter located on a dissected lobe system about 300 m north of a sharp
bend of Dry Ecleto Creek (Figure 113). It is within Weigang fine sandy loam over Catahoula formation
sandstone. The semi-upland lobe is covered by open pasture, which due to the ongoing drought was
mostly unvegetated bare ground. The site is about 50 m in length within the ROW.
Observed cultural materials consisted of two flakes (one of chalcedony), a silicified wood core, and a
crude biface with Clear Fork tool characteristics (Figure 114). ST 22 was placed at the location of the new
structure. One tertiary and one secondary fake were recovered from 20-40 cm. The soil profile was 9 cm
of gray fine sandy loam over 31 cm of dark gray silty clay loam that had increasing caliche with depth.
Non-cultural material consisted of a very light, widely spaced scatter of large chalcedony and silicified
wood pieces.

218

The site is interpreted as a short term lithic workshop or camp. Given the sparse nature of cultural
material and excellent visibility on an upland land form the site is recommended as fully investigated
within the ROW, and no further work is considered necessary. Although the potential for additional
significant cultural materials nearby is felt to be extremely low, should future projects require new ground
disturbance outside the existing ROW, then additional investigations should be considered.

41KA198
Site 41KA198 is a prehistoric campsite located 8.2 kilometers north northwest from Helena and south of
an unnamed tributary to Ecleto Creek (Figure 115). The site extends for about 100 m along the south side
of a county road. The eastern half the site lies within an open field, while the western half lies within an
area of mesquite brush that has been cleared within the transmission line ROW. Ground visibility was
nearly 100 percent at the time of the survey with little ground vegetation probably due to drought and
overgrazing (Figure 116).
Cultural material consists of a light scatter of chert and silicified wood debitage, and one thin chert biface
fragment that is possibly an arrow point preform (Figure 117). The silicified wood flakes are transparent,
and some larger chunks of this material were found that are translucent and glass-like in appearance.
Some widely scattered small pieces of burned quartzite are also present. There appears to be a slightly
higher concentration of this cultural material at the west end of the site where caliche is exposed on the
surface, but in general artifact density is low. No artifacts were recovered from a shovel test placed at the
location for the new transmission line structure. In addition to the prehistoric material, some early
twentieth century bottle glass (aqua, purple, and milk) and a few whiteware sherds were seen in the
western half of the site.
The part of 41KA198 that is located in the ROW does not appear to be eligible for SAL designation
because of the lack of features and diagnostic artifacts, and because the cultural material is confined to the
surface and probably disturbed. The site probably extends into areas outside the ROW, especially to the
north towards the creek, and the SAL status of these areas remains undetermined.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

An intensive cultural resources survey was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff on the proposed
Helena-to-Milton-to Magnolia Switch transmission line upgrade project. Approximately 4.2 miles of the
total 14.9-mile-long transmission line corridor was identified as having a moderate to high probability for
containing prehistoric archaeological deposits. Eight previously unrecorded prehistoric archaeological
sites, 41KA191-41KA198 were documented. The sites consist of lithic scatters and campsites. Common
lithic materials are chert, quartzite, silicified wood, and chalcedony. One cluster of fire-cracked rock at
41KA194 may represent a disrupted hearth, but otherwise, no features were identified.

221

None of the recorded sites is recommended for formal SAL listing due to the sparse and diffused nature of
artifact assemblages, lack of diagnostic artifacts and organic materials, or any evidence of stratified,
isolable deposits.
It is recommend that the project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural resource investigations,
with the understanding that eligibility recommendations are only for the known portions of the sites
within the transmission line easement and that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.

Project 49.13 Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of LCRAâs Proposed Parkway-to-E. C.
Mornhinweg Transmission Line Project, Comal and Guadalupe Counties, Texas

By Andrew F. Malof and Sean C. Zimmerman

TAC Permit 6443
Interim Report 13.13

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

LCRA proposes to construct an electrical transmission line (T-581) between the existing Parkway
Substation, located near Schertz in southwestern Guadalupe County, through the Weiderstein Substation,
also near Schertz, and then to the recently constructed New Braunfels Utilities E. C. Mornhinweg
Substation located just west of New Braunfels in southern Comal County (Figure 118; Figure 119). Of the
total 8.34-mile-long route, approximately 7.17 miles consists of rebuilding an existing transmission line
that has been present, in part, since the 1920s. This section runs from the Parkway Substation
northeastward, roughly parallel to I-35. Existing wooden H-frame and single pole structures will be
replaced with either H-frame or single-pole cement or metal structures. Some lattice towers may be used.
At a point where the existing line is about nearest to the E. C. Mornhinweg Substation, the new line will
turn generally north, crossing I-35 on newly acquired right of way for a distance of about 1.17 miles.
Structural supports will be similar to those used on the rebuilt section. Final structure locations have not
yet been determined for either section. Another 0.3 mile has been identified for construction (pulling)
easements, all associated with the new section of line. The right-of-way width is variable, but will mostly
be 24.4 m (80 ft) wide, creating an 83.78-acre project area.
Because the project area has never been intensively surveyed, staff conducted an archaeological
assessment during several days in October, November and December, 2013. The assessment consisted of
field survey following a file and records search. It was conducted under the terms of LCRAâs annual TAC
Permit 6443 in accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between LCRA and THC. There is no
known or anticipated federal permitting or funding associated with this project.
Based on a review of maps, soils and geology, 1.85 miles of easement was identified as having a
moderate to high probability for containing prehistoric archaeological sites. The topographic and historic
maps review further identified up to 19 locales with a moderate potential for containing historic resources.
In many cases the prehistoric and historic probability areas overlapped (see Figure 118and Figure 119).
Minimum survey standards suggest about 30 shovel tests for 1.85 miles of high probability area. Fifty-one
tests were actually executed, and some survey areas were expanded while in the field, either the result of
travelling from one area to another, or due to the observation of seemingly favorable landforms.
Only two archaeological sites, 41GU163 and 41GU164, were recorded. Site 41GU163 consists of minor
lithic procurement activities observed within an area of upland lag gravels. The site is considered fully
investigated within the project area and is recommended as not eligible for formal State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) status.
Site 41GU164 is a diffuse, sparse lithic scatter located along a series of benches overlooking East Dietz
Creek. The site is almost entirely surficial in very shallow soils. It is considered fully investigated within
the project area and is recommended as not eligible for formal SAL status.

230

Based on the results of the survey, it is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed to
construction without additional cultural resources review, with the understanding that standard emergency
discovery procedures will be in place.
No artifacts were collected during the survey, and therefore no curation will be necessary. This interim
report will be included in LCRAâs annual report of cultural resource investigations for 2013.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The project area follows the I-35 corridor between Schertz and New Braunfels along the boundary
between the Balcones Canyonlands portion of the Edwards Plateau and the Northern Blackland Prairie
(Griffith et. al 2007). Geologically, the transmission line crosses the Upper Cretaceous Pecan Chalk
formation that forms the transition between the Edwards formation limestone of the plateau and the
younger marl and sandstone formations to the south. Quaternary-aged fluviatile terrace deposits and
Pleistocene gravels (Leona formation) cross the Pecan Gap chalk along Cibolo Creek, Santa Clara Creek
and the Guadalupe River, and also are present along Dry Comal Creek, but are not crossed by the project.
Topographically, the project crosses an upland ridge system that appears to be an ancient outlier of the
escarpment that was isolated by downcutting of the San Antonio River to the west, Dry Comal Creek to
the north, and Santa Clara Creek to the east (Figure 120), probably due to the less resistant underlying
chalk formation. The project area therefore does not match descriptions for either the Balcones
Canyonlands or the Blackland Prairie. Rather, the land rises quickly south of I-35 and is seen as a series
of rolling hills. To the southwest soils are very shallow over bedrock, and much of the landscape is
covered by established oak forest. To the northeast, deeper, more clayey soils were more suitable for
pasture and farming so the land is more open, with mesquite common.
The ridge system also determines the drainage patterns. The transmission line runs across the divide
between south trending-streams feeding the San Antonio River and north-trending drainages supporting
Dry Comal Creek, which feeds the Guadalupe River, both of which eventually empty very near each other
at the Gulf of Mexico. These waterways diverge across the coastal plain, and if rivers serve as
transportation corridors, they would provide alternative paths, and therefore differing natural and cultural
interactions, for persons choosing one or the other.
Project area soils are almost exclusively clay and silty clay, with a minor amount of clay loam. Most of
the northwestern portion of the project area is within Houston Black-Heiden association soils that also
include Altoga, Branyon, Tinn and Trinity soils. These are all clays that are described as deep, moderately
well drained, and found in uplands (Batte 1984; Ramsey and Bade 1977). Soils associated with the Austin
series are primarily to the southwest. These soils can be very shallow and sometimes loamy. Doss soils
are found on some of the higher elevations along the southwestern portion of the project area.

Eddy gravelly clay loam is the only soil not described as a clay. Also found to the southwest, it is
typically very shallow forming over chalk. Austin, Doss and Eddy soils are found together (Ramsey and
Bade 1977).
The soils can also be viewed by soil order. Mollisols are mostly to the southwest and Vertisols are mostly
to the northeast. Altoga silty clay is an Inceptisol limited to the far northwestern end of the project area,
while the Eddy gravelly clay is an Entisol limited to the southwestern half. In general, the Vertisols, often
associated with the Blackland Prairie, correspond with areas that have been cleared for pasture and crops,
while the Mollisols are shallower and largely tree covered. The Altoga silty clay appears suited to pasture
and agriculture, while the Eddy clay loam is more suited for homesites, based upon the shallow depth to
bedrock.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND

Historic period Native American groups named the Jumana, Cibola, Catqueza, Cantona and Mandones
were listed by Domingo Teran de los Rios as being camped in the Guadalupe River area in Comal County
at the time of the first Spanish expedition that passed through the area in 1691 (Hatcher 1932). From 1756
to 1758, the Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe Mission was briefly located at Comal Springs within the city
of New Braunfels, about five miles north of the project area (Greene 2013). The mission was moved due

234

to raids by the Comanche. At the time of the first permanent settlement in Comal County by German
immigrants in the 1840s, the Tonkawa, Wichita, Lipan Apache and Comanche roamed the area.
The Spanish collection of trails called Los Caminos Reales that went from various crossing of the Rio
Grande to various Spanish settlements and then on to Louisiana ran just north of the project area, and a
vestige of them, the Old Nacogdoches Road, is still used today. The El Camino Real de Los Tejas was
designated a National Trail in 2004 in order to support collaborative efforts to create opportunities to
identify significant trail resources for public enjoyment (NPS 2011). Significant trail segments and sites
were identified through extensive field investigations over a period of years. In Comal County three
significant sites were Comal Springs, Davenport Crossing on Cibolo Creek, and the Guadalupe River
crossing in New Braunfels. There are no identified significant sites in the vicinity of the present project or
in Guadalupe County.
The first land grant in Guadalupe County was issued by the Spanish in 1806, but was not approved until
1832 by the Mexican government. Twenty-two families settled in southeast Guadalupe County as part of
DeWittâs Colony. Seguin, the largest city in Guadalupe County, was formed in 1838 as Walnut Springs
by a band of former Texas Rangers before changing its name a year later. The relative military safety of
Seguin encouraged settlers to congregate in the area, speeding the development of the town. Guadalupe
County was not formed until 1846 by an act of the legislature (Smyrl 2013). The town of Schertz near the
project area is named after Sebastian Schertz, who operated a store in 1875 when the Galveston,
Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railway was built through the area (Smyrl 2013). Guadalupe County grew
to around 20,000 people by 1900 and remained in the twenty thousands until 1970 when the population
started growing. This population growth is largely influenced by the expansion and sprawl of San
Antonio.
A Mexican land grant was given to Juan M. Veramendi in 1825, but it was not until 1845, when Prince
Carl of Solms-Braunfels of Germany acquired rights to more than 1,000 acres surrounding Comal Springs
that permanent settlement began in Comal County. By 1856 Comal County was formed by the Texas
Legislature, with boundaries finalized in 1858. Despite a large German population, Comal County voted
for secession during the Civil War, even though the agrarian economy was largely based on household
labor. New Braunfels also soon became a hub of industry, as a variety of skilled workers and tradesmen
arrived and set up support mechanisms for the surrounding farms and ranches. By 1920, New Braunfels
was taking full advantage of the railroad and had become a manufacturing and shipping center.
Throughout these times, the population retained a German flavor. The Great Depression did not seem to
impact the New Braunfels area severely, and manufacturing and related industry continued to increase in
abundance as tourism, fueled in great part by the Guadalupe River and Canyon Lake, has become
increasingly important to the economy.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

The prehistoric background can be considered typical for the central Texas archaeological region. This is
not rehashed in this interim report, but is covered in depth in the annual report.
235

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The project area lies in the ecotone created by the confluence of the Balcones Escarpment and the
Blackland Prairie. There have been a considerable number of previous investigations within 50 km. The
springs in New Braunfels and San Marcos lie within that distance, as do the San Antonio, Guadalupe and
Comal rivers. The Honey Creek State Natural Area, roughly 35 kilometers northwest of the project area,
had an archeological survey completed in 2002 that details the historic and prehistoric activity across 494
acres of the 2,294 acre park (McNatt et al. 2002). That area was chosen to focus on the known historic
sites and it gives a thorough background of typical historic settlement patterns in the hinterlands of the
Balcones Escarpment.
In New Braunfels, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) conducted excavations of two prehistoric sites,
41CM25 and 41CM167, for LCRAâs Clear Springs Autotransformer project. Both of these sites have had
previous investigations starting in the 1930âs for 41CM25 and the 1980âs for 41CM167. At 41CM167,
the excavations collected over 10,000 pieces of debitage and only 138 chipped stone tools. There was also
a dearth of ground stone artifacts (Dockall et al. 2006).
Additional excavations were conducted at 41CM25 near Landa Park for a redevelopment project (Malof
et al. 2007). The investigation targeted sheet midden deposits that appeared to be the result of intersecting
rock heating features and formed primarily during the Middle Archaic Period. Various special studies
indicated people were camped on the edge of a large lagoon formed by the nearby springs during a period
of overall dryness.
The Royal Coachman site, 41CM111, is 30 km to the northeast of the project area. This site is an example
of the âEarly-Middleâ Archaic short term sites in the area (Mahoney et al 2003), and like at LCRAâs
41CM25, investigations, found two intact features within surrounding sheet midden deposits. The site
was considered to be SAL-eligible.
In the immediate vicinity of the project area there are a number of sites on Cibolo creek to the south and
west. In 1998, Paul Price and Associates completed a survey of over 200 acres 2 km southwest of the
project area for the city of Universal City. On roughly 200 acres adjacent to Cibolo Creek they located
eight new sites consisting of six prehistoric campsite components, one lithic procurement component, two
lithic scatters, an historic cemetery, and a site composed of historic rock dams, foundations, and walls.
They also revisited a lithic scatter as well as a midden that had been previously recorded. Linear surveys
near the project area have found lithic scatters as well as historic sites on the hills farther away from
substantial creeks or rivers.
In 1997, LCRA surveyed the southwestern 2.5 miles of the present project area for a proposed fiber optic
line that was to be placed on new structures between what is now the Weiderstein Substation and the
Parkway Substation (Nightengale 1998). The investigations consisted of pedestrian survey with shovel
probes excavated to a maximum depth of 25 cm. No archaeological sites were recorded. Given changes in
survey standards and a wider availability of research resources such as historic maps, this section was
considered unsurveyed for purposes of this project.
236

In 2012, LCRA, on behalf of NBU, conducted a cultural resources survey of the then-proposed E. C.
Mornhinweg Substation (Malof and Prikryl 2012). The project area was shovel tested following minimum
survey standards, and no cultural materials were encountered, other than a single possible stone core on
the ground surface. No sites were recorded and the project was allowed to proceed.
Also in 2012, LCRA, on behalf of New Braunfels Utilities, conducted a cultural resource survey of
NBUâs proposed transmission line construction and rebuild project that ties the new E. C. Mornhinweg
substation to a series of transmission lines running east and north (Malof et al. 2012). Site 41CM113 was
revisited and enlarged, and sites 41CM330, 41CM331 and 41CM332 were recorded. Sites 41CM330 and
41CM331 were both lithic scatters in mostly shallow soils. Site 41CM330 also had burned limestone
present. Site 41CM331 is a highly disturbed sparse upland lithic scatter consistent with lithic procurement
activities. Neither of these sites was felt to contain information potential warranting formal SAL status
within or immediately adjacent to the project area.
Site 41CM332 consists of the company town of Dittlinger, known later in time as The Village. It was
built to create housing opportunities for workers at the nearby quarry and lime operations and was present
from sometime after 1917 until 1968. The project crossed a very small portion of The Village, which was
highly disturbed with few artifacts. Oral histories and historic map and aerial reviews allowed new
information to be gained on Dittlinger. The portion of the site crossed by the proposed transmission line
was recommended as not eligible for formal SAL status. The entirety of the town was recommended as
having undetermined eligibility for formal SAL status.
Site 41CM113 was originally recorded as a lithic scatter/open campsite, due primarily to a relatively high
number of tools seen at the time. The revisit found an extensive buried lithic scatter with numerous tools
and dense lithic debris, as well as a historic ranching component. Because the lithic scatter was within an
average 30-40 cm-deep heavy clay soil and appears to have spanned much of the Late Archaic period, it
was felt that there was very little that could realistically be accomplished by further work at the site, and it
was therefore considered to be ineligible for formal SAL status within the project area. The historic
component consists of a cement foundation, dipping vat, water tank, well and outbuilding dating to the
mid-twentieth century. These features are most likely associated with the Charles Schmidt ranch. They
are highly disturbed and do not hold the potential to add significant data to what is known about local
history. Additionally, the identification of the dipping vat caused the rerouting of the transmission line
completely away from the complex of features, and they were not impacted. The historic component of
41CM113 was also recommended as not eligible for formal SAL status.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND FIELD METHODS

The project was designed to identify and assess archaeological sites that might be eligible for formal
listing as State Antiquities Landmarks. All work was conducted under blanket TAC Blanket Permit 6443
and the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA, which incorporates CTA
survey and reporting standards.
237

According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Barnes 1974), the entire project area is within the Upper
Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk formation. Subsurface tests were therefore placed judgmentally in areas
where there was a high probability for cultural materials to be present, either buried in near-stream
deposits or areas with colluvial accumulation, where visibility was poor, and when unexpected surface
artifacts were encountered. Tests were a minimum of 30 cm in diameter and excavated in 20 cm levels to
depths sufficient to confirm presence or absence of buried artifacts.
Along the 6.9-mile-long existing portion of the transmission line, approximately 0.8 mile of high
probability area for prehistoric sites and 15 potential historic locales were identified. The 1.1-mile-long
new section of line had approximately 0.79 mile of prehistoric high probability identified, and four
potential historic locales.
Prehistoric high probability areas were based on proximity to streams while considering stream size and
adjacent stable landforms. Potential historic locales were based on examination of available historical
topographic and county highway maps, and included New Braunfels (1916), Bracken (1928, 1938), 1936
Comal and Guadalupe county highway maps, Schertz USGS (1953), and Marion and New Braunfels
USGS quads from 1958. The modern USGS quads, ca. 1980, were also examined for potential structures
prior to photo revision. Given differences in mapping systems and scales, particularly on the 1930s-era
highway map, historic site locales are subject to great variation in actual location.
Records kept included field notes, field site forms, digital photos and photo logs, shovel test logs, and
GPS waypoints with a typical 3 m accuracy range.
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Only two archaeological sites, 41GU163 and 41GU164, were recorded, and are discussed below. Then
follow brief descriptions of the various high probability areas (HPAs) and potential historic sites that were
surveyed with negative results. These locations can be referenced in Figure 118 and Figure 119, and
shovel test locations are referenced in Figure 121 and Figure 122.
41GU163
Site 41GU163 was identified while driving down the right of way to access potential historic resource 1
(discussed below). It is not associated with a map-derived HPA. This prehistoric procurement and lithic
scatter site lies on an east-trending upland lobe. The soil at the site is mapped as Heiden clay and Doss
silty clay and was observed as shallow to very shallow over limestone. Vegetation on the lower slope is
mainly grasses with occasional brushy trees while the upper ridge has a greater density of trees.
The site is located in an area where the transmission line will be rerouted slightly, shifting about 45 m
southeastward causing a divergence about 340 m in length. The original right of way follows the existing
support structures on the ridge while the new right of way follows the road along the south side of the

lower slope before turning northwest just before a house (potential historic resource 1) and then rejoining
the original alignment (Figure 123). As documented, the site is 250 m long and 50 to 80 m wide.
Observed materials consisted of five multi-directional cores located on the ridge along with chert cobbles.
There were roughly 20 primary flakes, 10 secondary flakes and 10 tertiary flakes in addition to one thick
biface. Most of the flakes were observed along the upper portion of the ridge. The lower portion had been
rootplowed and the test there (ST 3) recovered only one possible chert chip from Level 1 (Figure 124).
The site is a prehistoric procurement area that lacks any temporally diagnostic material. Given the
sparseness of cultural material, the shallow upper soils and the excellent visibility on the lower slopes, the
portion of the site within the ROWs is considered fully recorded and not eligible for consideration as a
formal SAL.

41GU164
Site 41GU164 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located to the northwest of East Dietz Creek (Figure 125). It is
within a pasture over very short grasses, well-established live oaks and other small trees and shrubs
(Figure 126). Soils are mapped as Austin/Doss/Eddie series and were seen as shallow to very shallow
over benched, chalky bedrock.
Cultural materials were observed in two primary locations. The first was at the first stable bench above
East Dietz Creek, where about 15 pieces of debitage and a possible thumbnail scraper were observed over
shallow soils and exposed bedrock. About 120 m upslope was another concentration of about 10-15
pieces of debitage and a nearby bidirectional core that may have functioned as a chopper. The hillslope
tops out at an upland agricultural field, and just prior to the field edge was seen a final piece of debitage,
which is considered an outlier. Very occasional pieces of chert tied the concentrations together. Debitage
consisted of both large hard-hammer cortical flakes and smaller tertiary debris. Heavily patinated dark
brown Edwards chert seemed to be the predominant material. No raw chert was seen in the vicinity.
In total, nine subsurface tests (10, 11, 45-51) were placed within or near the site. They were typically
excavated through about 15 cm of loamy soil before chalky bedrock was encountered. Only one, ST 48,
was positive for cultural material, with a single flake fragment recovered.
Interestingly, there was no evidence of the site along a transect erroneously placed under a large adjacent
transmission line just 30 m to the north. The portion of the site within the ROW therefore appears to be
the edge of a scatter that probably continues upslope and to the south, where the ridge system forms a
lobe. The artifacts within the project area may actually be the result of colluvial redeposition.
Site 41GU164 appears to represent an activity area and possible campsite located primarily outside the
ROW. Due to the small number of artifacts, the shallow soils, and lack of evidence of features or other
preservation, the portion of the site within the ROW is considered fully recorded and not eligible for
consideration as a formal SAL.

HPA 1
High probability area 1 is located near the southern end of the project area on either side of East Dietz
Creek, the first stream north of the Schertz substation. Soils are mapped, from southwest to northeast, as
Eddy gravely clay loam, Trinity clay, and Austin silty clay. Trinity clay fills the broad channel of the
creek, presumably caused by the meandering waterway (Figure 127), which at present is only three to
four feet wide at the transmission line. Flood debris is present across the entirety of the small valley and
the originally defined high probability area was expanded in the field from 200 m to 350 m to include the
higher elevations to the northeast of the creek. A single large flake was seen in an erosional gully just to
the southwest of the creek, and on either side of the creek, small piles of angular limestone were seen.
Close examination of these two features indicated these were not of prehistoric origin, one clearly being
the result of tree throw in the shallow rocky soils, and the other possibly a recent pushpile.
Six subsurface tests, 1, 2 and 8-11 were excavated in this area. The tests encountered the expected
gravelly loams and clays, and were concluded at depths of 15 to 50 cm when bedrock, dense carbonates,
or prismatically structured clays were encountered. No artifacts were seen.
It was later determined that the actual alignment is at present a single-pole optic fiber corridor, and not the
large lattice-supported transmission line that was identified in the field. Although the actual alignment is
only 30 m from what was originally surveyed, it was thought best to resurvey. Site 41GU164, which is
discussed above, was recorded as a result.

HPA 2
High probability area 2 is an 830-m-long section that crosses and parallels a series of small, mapped-butunnamed drainages rising out of an upland ridge system and flowing northward where they combine and
eventually enter Dry Comal Creek about 2.7 km to the north. Soils are mapped as Heiden clay, Trinity
clay, and Altoga silty clay. The entirety of this HPA is within an existing golf course, and most is along
the base of the ridge system (Figure 128). Visibility was generally good, especially along the ridge base,
where bedrock was visible. The stream banks and other exposures were examined.
Two shovel tests (4, 5) were excavated in this area, one on either side of the HPA. Both encountered
dense clays with stream cobbles seen at about 50 cm. There was no artifact recovery. Due to the generally
shallow soils, the generally good visibility and the disturbed nature of the ground due to golf course
construction, this area is considered to be fully investigated.
HPA 3
High probability area 3 is located along the main trunk of a mapped, unnamed drainage system
originating from several sources along the ridge system to the south and entering Dry Comal Creek about
1.7 km to the north. It is within Altoga and Heiden clays. Just to the north of the transmission line the
stream enters a continuation of the golf course, but at the project area is within a relatively recent housing
development. The creek itself has been deeply channelized in order to flow through a large culvert under
a subdivision street (Figure 129).
Three subsurface tests (6, 7, and 12) were placed to the southwest of the creek. Immediately to the
northeast the creek bank is underneath a street, so subsurface test 13 was placed at the base of the slope
on the opposite side of the creek. Soils in this area were heavily disturbed, probably from spoils
245

associated with channelizing the creek. The tests that penetrated this zone found mottled clay, which is
represented especially well at subsurface test 13 (Figure 130). No artifacts were encountered, and this
area is considered to be fully investigated.

HPA 4

High probability area 4 is on either side of a relatively long south-trending drainage originating from the
ridge system to the south and entering Dry Comal Creek about 1.6 km to the north. It is within Tinn series
clay across a terraced pasture with short grasses and low mesquite. Two subsurface tests, 17 and 21, were
placed on either side of the drainage. These were excavated to depths of 50 and 25 cm, respectively. Soils
were typical clay, and on the west side of the creek was clearly disturbed with an admixture of road base.
No cultural materials were located. This area is considered to be fully investigated.

247

While in the field, the toe of a ridge was noticed to the northeast. It looked promising, so subsurface test
18 was placed there. Test 19 was placed on a ridge 330 m to the northeast, and test 20 was placed within
the unmapped drainage between the two ridges. These tests were all negative for cultural material.

HPA 5
High probability area 5 crossed the upper portion of a drainage that separates the northeast trending ridge
south of IH 35 from the Dry Comal Creek basin. The drainage joins Dry Comal Creek about 3 km to the
northeast. The drainage channel is only about 1 m wide, although the actual bed is about 10 m wide. The
area is wooded pasture, with areas of dense juniper, mesquite and other shrubs. Soils are mapped as
Heiden clays. In addition to the transmission line route, there are two pulling easements that each run
about 100 m to the southeast and northwest.
Subsurface tests 22-27 were placed in this HPA, with tests 23 and 24 on either side of the creek. Tests
were excavated to typical depths of 40-50 cm and encountered generally dark, silty clays. No non-modern
cultural materials were observed in tests or on ground surface, other than a single aqua-colored crown-top
bottle fragment from test 40, located along a pulling easement, which is described in more detail in the
discussion of Historic Locale 14, below. This area is considered to be fully investigated.

HPA 6 and 7
High probability areas 6 and 7, combined, were the most lengthy of all HPAs, as it is generally within 150
m of a side drainage to Dry Comal Creek, which it joins about 1.5 km to the north. Due to two angles at
the south portion of this HPA there are also two pulling easements running northwest and northeast, each
about 100 m in length. About one-half of the HPA (HPA 6) is within wooded pasture where side-gullies
created excellent additional visibility (Figure 131), and the northern half is within open, cleared pasture
(HPA 7). Soils are mapped as Altoga, Branyon and Heiden clays.
Fourteen subsurface tests, 28-41, were excavated along this HPA (Figure 132). They were excavated to
typical depths of 40-50 cm. They all encountered sterile clays, except at the far northern end, where a few
large chert cobbles were encountered at depth. No non-modern cultural materials were observed in tests
or on the surface. This area is considered to be fully investigated.
IO 1
One isolated object (IO) was recorded in an upland setting to the northeast of HPA 3 (Figure 133). The
artifact was bifacially worked with a flat ventral surface and strongly convex dorsal surface. It was broken
at what may have been a hafting end, although patterned retouch was most obvious along the lateral
edges. The artifact appears to have been perhaps a gouge or possibly a âturtle-backedâ scraper.
Subsurface test 14 was placed in the vicinity of this feature, where soils are mapped as Heiden clay. The
general area was once open pasture that has significant secondary mesquite growth. The field has been
248

obviously terraced in the past. The subsurface test encountered a brown loamy soil inconsistent with the
mapped Heiden clay. The test was terminated at 50 cm, and no artifacts were encountered, nor were
others seen elsewhere on the surface. This location is not considered to be an archaeological site, and no
further work is considered necessary.

Historic Locales
No mapped structures are depicted underneath the existing line on the 1950s or modern USGS maps and
project alignment is sketchy on the earlier maps. Historic locales were therefore largely determined by
apparent proximity to the easement, and areas where structures were mapped within about 200 m were
investigated, primarily to determine if activity areas associated with likely ranchsteads were present. In
some cases, buildings associated with the maps could be seen outside the ROW, in others there was no
evidence. Only in two cases were artifacts encountered. One involved about 10 pieces of whiteware,
mostly outside the ROW, that were too far distant from a structure to be considered associated, and were
therefore considered a twentieth century trash scatter and not recorded as a site. The other was a single
aqua-colored crown-top bottle fragment in the pulling easement near historic locale 14. This is considered
an isolated object and was not recorded as a site. The following discussion proceeds from southwest to
northeast, and the numbered locales are therefore not in order (see Figure 118 and Figure 119).
Potential historic resource 1 is seen only on the modern USGS map. It is an occupied house with vinyl
siding (Figure 134). There is a small collapsed pole barn behind the house, but no artifacts or other
features suggestive of pre-1960s construction. This was not considered an archaeological site.
Potential historic resource 2 is seen as a church on the modern topographic map. Driving by, it was seen
as clearly a modern church well-removed from the easement. No additional investigation was attempted.
Potential historic resource 3 overlapped with HPA 2, located at the golf course. The structure at this
location is a maintenance shed associated with the golf course. No additional investigations were
attempted.
Potential historic resources 4 and 9 consisted of structures seen on both the modern USGS quad and on
1916 New Braunfels map. The golf course clubhouse and surrounding parking lot is at this location. No
additional investigations were attempted.

250

Figure 134. Potential historic resource 1.

Potential historic resource 8 lined up with a structure seen on the 1916 New Braunfels map. This area of
open pasture was walked. There was no evidence of a structure or a road, and no artifacts were seen. This
is considered to be a map alignment issue, so no additional investigations were attempted.
Potential historic resource 10 is seen on the 1928 Bracken map. This area was recently-tilled open pasture
across an upland ridge system. No artifacts were seen, and no additional investigations were attempted.

Figure 135. Pasture in vicinity of potential historic resource 10. View to southwest.

Potential historic resources 11, 15 and 16 are seen as a probable ranch complex about 150 m south of the
ROW on the 1958 USGS map (resource 11) and on the 1936 Comal County highway map (resources 15
and 16). This area is presently being developed with new housing. During pedestrian survey the likely
location of resource 16 was seen about 100 m south of the ROW. It appeared to be a metal shed near an
old camping trailer. No evidence of either 11 or 15 was seen. The area was not investigated further.

251

Figure 136. Vicinity of resources 11, 15, and 16, looking southwest.

Figure 137. Probable historic resource 16 in trees to left of camper. View to south from ROW.

Potential historic resources 12 and 17 are seen to the south of the easement on the 1936 Comal County
highway map, the 1958 New Braunfels quad, and the modern USGS quad. A farm complex is visible
about 150 m south of the right of way. Visual inspection of the easement found no artifacts or evidence of
features.
Approximately 150 m to the northeast is a distinct topographic ridge. The 1958 USGS map shows this as
a drainage, while the modern map merely indicates a swale, based on the presence of vegetation. Along
the upper edge of the ridge a prehistoric core and large hard hammer flake were seen in an area with a few
exposed gravels. At the base of the ridge were about ten pieces of broken whiteware. Ground surface
visibility approached 100 percent at both areas. Subsurface tests (15, 16) were placed at both locations.

252

Both encountered very dark gray loamy clays and were excavated to depths of 40 to 50 cm. Neither of the
artifact scatters is felt to warrant site designation, and no further investigations are considered necessary.

Figure 138. Potential historic resource 12 and 17. View from right of way looking generally south.

Potential historic resource 18 is present on the 1953 Schertz USGS quad as an apparent ranch complex
about 240 m north of the ROW. This area is now a well-developed subdivision. The ROW was walked.
Visibility was excellent along a hill slope with little to no soil. No artifacts were seen, and no additional
investigations were conducted.
Potential historic resource 5 was defined based on an apparent ranch complex depicted on recent
topographic maps. An apparent outbuilding or barn is located about 130 m south of the transmission line
easement, and only about 30 m from the south end of a pulling easement. Shovel test 27, negative for
cultural material, was placed as close as possible to an extant barn. Because the standing buildings are all
on the opposite side of a fence in an area cleared of most vegetation, and the easement appears to be on a
separate property, and no artifacts were encountered in tests or observed on the ground, this area is
considered fully investigated.
Potential historic resource 14/19 is located on the north (west) side of IH 35 and was designated based on
structures mapped about 70 m to the northwest on modern topographic maps, and more particularly
because the line crossed directly over two structures seen on the 1936 county highway map. This also
corresponds with HPA 6. At present, there is a cluster of buildings and businesses that correspond with
those seen on recent maps, but they are on an area of relatively recent fill which includes road asphalt
debris, and are completely outside the ROW. Subsurface test 40, mentioned above, recovered a single
aqua-colored crown-top bottle fragment. Test 41 was placed about 20 m further northeast, and was
negative. No non-recent artifacts were observed on the ground. Further to the southwest, just outside the
IH 35 ROW appears to be an old roadbed, possibly the original road between Austin and San Antonio.
This depression disappears under the fill which supports the buildings to the northeast. Given the scale of
the 1936 county highway map (houses show as 120 m on a side), the structures were most likely under

253

the modern ones, and the single artifact an outlier. This area is not considered an archaeological site and is
considered fully investigated.
Potential historic resource 7/13 is an apparent farm complex seen on modern USGS maps and the 1936
highway map. At present it is an occupied modern house with one or two apparent older outbuildings
located about 110 m west of the ROW. Subsurface tests 33 and 34 were placed in HPA 6 downslope from
these features. There was no artifact recovery and none were seen on the surface. This area is considered
to be fully investigated.
Potential historic resource 6 is based on an apparent farm complex located about 40 m to the east of the
transmission line easement. It is present on the modern USGS maps and possibly the 1936 high map. In
the field, these buildings are seen to be across a property fence from the project area. Subsurface test 38
was placed within the ROW as close as possible to the nearest structure. It was negative for cultural
material, and no non-modern artifacts were seen on the surface. This area is considered to be fully
investigated.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Staff conducted a cultural resources assessment for LCRAâs proposed Parkway-to-E. C. Mornhinweg
transmission line project during October, November and December, 2013. Fifty-one subsurface tests were
excavated across approximately 1.85 miles of high probability area and at up to 19 potential historic
locales.
Two prehistoric archaeological sites, 41GU163 and 41GU164, were recorded as a result of the
investigations. Site 41GU163 is a diffuse lithic procurement area consisting of a few large flakes, tested
cobbles and cores within large chert cobbles resting upon an upland ridge system. Soils are shallow and
cultural materials are fairly sparse, and the site is recommended as being ineligible for formal listing as a
SAL.
Site 41GU164 consists of a broad, light scatter of debitage and perhaps a couple of tools. It is distributed
across a hillslope over shallow soils and exposed bedrock. The recorded site, within the transmission line
easement, is considered fully documented and is recommended as being ineligible for formal listing as a
SAL. Potential portions of the site elsewhere, particularly on higher ground to the south, would be
considered of undetermined eligibility.
Elsewhere, there was no evidence of structured land use by prehistoric inhabitants. While there were
some presumably historic farmsteads in the vicinity of the project area, there were no features or artifact
concentrations encountered that could be considered an archaeological site.
The relative lack of prehistoric sites is curious, given what should be a transitional ecotone between the
Blackland Prairie and the Edwards Plateau. A cursory review of the Sites Atlas, however, demonstrates a
general paucity of recorded sites in the region, especially when comparing site densities along the plateau
254

edge with those on the prairie margins. Numerous surveys have been conducted in this area, so the issue
does not seem to be one of sampling. It may be that resource richness, particularly in terms of chert
availability, was greater in surrounding areas, or it may be more a factor of artifact durability, and
therefore visibility, assuming that stone resources were conserved in lithic-poor areas.
In respect to the current report, it is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed without
additional cultural resource investigations, with the understanding that if unexpected cultural materials are
encountered during construction, than ground disturbance will cease in the area of the discovery until the
find can be assessed in consultation with THC.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Travis County is planning three park improvement construction projects on Lake Travis in
northwestern Travis County. The three projects are located on lands owned by the Lower
Colorado River Authority (LCRA) that are leased by Travis County. LCRAâs Cultural Resources
team conducted cultural resources investigations for these projects for compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas. These Travis County projects consist of 1) a further extension of the
originally proposed boat ramp at Tournament Point in the Pace Bend Park and delineation of an
associated informal parking lot, 2) paving of existing park road paths in Kateâs and Johnson
Coves in Pace Bend Park, and 3) extension of the existing boat ramp at the Sandy Creek Park
(Figure 139; Figure 140)
An archaeological survey of an originally proposed Pace Bend boat ramp extension was
conducted by the LCRA Cultural Resources team in February, 2013 and a report sent to the THC
for review (Hixson 2013). The THC concurred with our assessment that no State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL)-eligible sites lie within the project area, and with LCRAâs recommendation that
the project proceed as long as a barrier fence is put up to prevent damages to potentially
significant areas of 41TV2357 that lie outside the project area. The boat ramp has not yet been
constructed. The lake is now at a level six feet lower than when the survey was conducted, and
Travis County wants to extend the proposed ramp to the present level (625 ft), requiring an
additional 20 m of ramp. Survey of the additional area during the present project showed no
evidence of any cultural deposits associated with 41TV2357.
An area immediately north of the Pace Bend boat ramp within and near previously recorded site
41TV2180 was also investigated for use as an informal parking lot for boat ramp users. A portion
of this site that does not contain any SAL-eligible deposits is proposed for usage as the parking
lot.
LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a field survey of the proposed boat ramp extension
at Sandy Creek Park. No cultural resource sites were found in the 20 m long extension area.
However, incidental survey of an area further westward resulted in the recording of 41TV2445.
The cultural material from this site is meager, consisting of an Early Archaic Gower point
recovered from a shovel test and one burned rock and a few mussels noted on the surface. The
cultural materials are sparse and represent artifacts that could have washed into the area during
floods from an intact site located somewhere upstream in the vicinity. Although the portion of
41TV2445 examined during the current survey is assessed as not eligible for formal designation
as a SAL, construction crews should be careful to confine their ground-disturbing activities to the
boat ramp expansion area.
Travis County is also proposing to construct an extension of the existing asphalt roadway that
currently ends at the entrance to Kateâs and Johnson Coves at the far north end of Pace Bend
Park. This proposed construction would consist of placing asphalt over several existing gravel
and dirt roads that have been used for many years by park visitors. A file search showed that this
264

area was previously surveyed for cultural resources in 1985 with one prehistoric lithic
procurement site, 41TV950, being present in and around the road improvement project. The site
was assessed as insignificant. Based on the results of the file search and the fact that since the
road improvement project will not involve any new excavation,

LCRA recommends that the proposed road work be allowed to proceed without any further
cultural resource investigations.
All work was conducted under the terms of and in accordance with LCRAâs annual State
Antiquities Permit Number 6443. There is no federal funding or permitting involved that requires
a Section 106 review under the National Historic Preservation Act. Artifacts collected during the
project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The Sandy Creek and Pace Bend parks are located near the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau
about 8 to 15 miles west of the Balcones Escarpment, respectively. The underlying geology of the
Pace Bend tract consists of Cretaceous Cow Creek limestone in the lower elevations along the
valley edge bluffs, Hensell Sand at higher elevations covering about half the tract, and at even
higher elevations the Glen Rose formation covering most of the north end of the tract. (Barnes
1981). Cow Creek limestone has a honeycomb appearance due to dissolved fossils.
The Colorado River has eroded deeply into this formation creating sheer bluffs along most of the
eastern edge of Pace Bend. Tournament Point is one of the few places where this natural barrier
to the river has been breached. Holocene, and perhaps Pleistocene alluvium have built up to
create the point, hemmed in by limestone outcrops to the east and west. Shovel testing during the
current project found that the lower area near the present shoreline is composed of about three
feet of brown silty clay over smooth, flat limestone. The upper end of the project consists of a
high terrace composed of river gravels of chert and quartz with frequent limestone outcrops.
These outcrops are most prominent on the terrace slope between the lower and higher terraces.
The Sandy Creek Park area is located to the east of Pace Bend. Here the Glen Rose formation is
exposed at the base of the narrow valley, while the Edwards formation outcrops at the hill
summits to the east outside the project area (Barnes 1974). The lower slopes along Sandy Creek
display the stair-step topography that is characteristic of the Glen Rose formation. With the low
lake level due to the current drought, areas below the full pool conservation of the lake are
exposed. The geology of these areas is not shown on the modern geological map, but the current
survey found that the lakebed in the project area is covered by Holocene alluvium at least 90 cm
thick. The thickness of these sediments decreases as one proceeds upslope, ending about at the
talus slope on the valley margin.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A cultural resource survey of Pace Bend Park was conducted by Espey, Huston & Associates,
(EHA) Inc. (1985). Thirty-one cultural resource sites, all of which are prehistoric with the
exception of one historic period site, were described and assessed. Many of these sites were found
267

to have been disturbed by natural and man-made causes. Prehistoric sites consist of lithic scatters,
lithic procurement sites, campsites, rockshelters and burned rock middens. The historic site dates
to the early twentieth century and may be a farmhouse related to the former rural community
called Mud.
Three sites consisting of 41TV129, 41TV132, and 41TV975 were assessed by EH&A as
potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and for formal
designation as SALs. Since the time of the EH&A survey, no additional investigations have ever
been conducted at these three sites. However, 12 other new cultural resource sites have been
recorded in more recent years. These are primarily prehistoric sites that have been become visible
as the lake level has lowered due to drought conditions.
Previous cultural resource work at Sandy Creek Park has all been conducted as a part of the larger
LCRA tract known as TN-10A. Although no cultural resource sites have ever been recorded in
Sandy Creek Park despite several survey efforts, 11 sites have been found in the adjacent part of
the TN-10A tract known as the Wheless Preserve (Prewitt and Kotter 1980; THC Site Atlas).
These sites are all prehistoric sites and include lithic scatters, lithic procurement sites, and burned
rock middens. The SAL status of the majority of these sites has not been determined. A review of
site records suggests that at least one burned rock midden site, 41TV2099, is potentially
significant.

METHODOLOGY

The fieldwork consisted of pedestrian survey of the two proposed boat ramp extensions and the
proposed parking lot area for the Pace Bend boat ramp. Additionally, shovel testing was
conducted at these project components to check for buried cultural deposits. A total of 1.34 acres
were surveyed.
Ground surface visibility was found to be very good at the areas where the two boat ramps and
the parking lot will be constructed. Since the LCRA field crew originally thought that the Sandy
Creek Boat Ramp would extend an additional 50 m northwestward, that area was also surveyed
and shovel tested. A total of six shovel tests were dug, which is twice the THCâs survey
standards for a project of this size. Each test was a circular hole 35 cm in diameter dug in 20 cm
levels. All fill was screened through a Â¼â wire mesh. Artifact recovery was recorded and artifacts
were returned to the hole during refilling, except for diagnostic artifacts such as projectile points,
which were collected for curation. Soil profiles were also recorded for each shovel test, and these
along with test recovery are provided in the Appendix table.

SURVEY RESULTS
Pace Bend Boat Ramp Extension and Parking Area
The new section of proposed boat ramp, approximately 20 m in length, was assessed by
pedestrian survey and shovel testing (Figure 141). The entire boat ramp area had been heavily
gullied due to recent heavy rains, and visibility was excellent. Moderate amounts of chert
debitage, mussel shell and burned rock were visible along the sloping surface and within the
gullies in the areas upslope that were surveyed in February 2013. Shovel Test (ST) 1 was placed
within the ramp extension area, about 6 m past the previously surveyed shoreline. The test was
excavated to a depth of 100 cm and was devoid of definite cultural material (Figure 142 ). The
only recovery was between 80 and 100 cm, where two Rabdotus shells, one mussel shell remnant
and one small chunk of charcoal were recovered. The soil profile consisted of redeposited
laminated dark gray and tan sand over about 55 cm of very dark gray silt, possibly redeposited,
then dark grayish brown silt with some sand particles. Given the sloping landform, the excellent
visibility and the negative results of the shovel test, this portion of 41TV2357 does not appear to
have cultural materials that would be compromised by the proposed boat ramp extension.
An additional concern regarding increased vehicular traffic and informal parking was addressed
by evaluating the area around the top of the boat ramp, which partially overlaps previously
recorded site 41TV2180, described as a lithic scatter with tools, mussel shell, various projectile
points including an Ensor, and a stone bead. Pedestrian survey indicated that the lower portion of
the most likely parking area consists of dense limestone and chert cobbles in coarse, sandy
matrix. Areas to the north on the higher, flatter potion of the site had relatively dense vegetation
and areas with apparent intact soil were observed.
Shovel Test (ST) 3 was placed near the upper portion of the possible parking zone. It recovered
22 tertiary flake fragments in the upper 20 cm and 21 tertiary flake fragments and a large burned
limestone rock cobble in the lower 20 cm. Minor amounts of brown, clear and aqua glass were
also present. The profile consisted of 5 cm of redeposited fine and coarse sand over 13 cm of dark
brown loam with sand becoming brown sandy clay loam with coarse sand, reddish clay and
increasing rock content to a final depth of 40 cm.
Shovel Test 2 was placed further downslope and confirmed the shallow gravelly soils. It was
excavated to a depth of 20 cm through 50 cm of fine sand followed by 13 cm of grayish brown
loam before brown sandy clay loam dense gravels were encountered. Recovery consisted of one
possible small burned rock, one secondary flake, and one tertiary flake.
Staff defined a parking area roughly 80-x-40-m (0.8 acre) in size based on the shovel tests. It will
avoid the northern portion of 41TV2180 where ST 3 suggested that deposits with larger amounts
of prehistoric cultural materials are present. This parking area will be maintained in the lower,
gravelly part of the site through both passive (the existing access road to the head of the boat
ramp) and active (temporary barriers maintained by Travis County) means.

269

The investigations indicate that the boat ramp extension and secondary parking impacts will not
affect potentially significant portions of 41TV2180 or 41TV2357. However, Travis County will
need to follow recommendations made in LCRAâs original report for this project that call for
avoidance of potentially significant prehistoric deposits that lie west of the boat ramp. As
previously recommended, a temporary fence should be placed on the west edge of the boat ramp
construction area to aid in avoiding these deposits. Further, the LCRA recommends that the
existing dirt road that passes through the southern part of the proposed parking area be utilized as
the road for vehicular access during the construction of the boat ramp. Use of this road will also
avoid impacts to a third previously recorded site, 41TV2207.

Sandy Creek Boat Ramp Extension
LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a field survey of the 20-meter long proposed boat
ramp extension at Sandy Creek Park (Figure 143). Much of the proposed extension area has
limestone bedrock on or near ground surface. Pedestrian survey of the area revealed no artifacts
(Figure 144). Shovel Test 4 was excavated at the downslope end of the boat ramp extension
where thicker topsoil deposits are present. The shovel test produced two modern beer bottle
fragments from the upper 40 cm of deposits. No other artifacts were found in the 70 cm thick soil
column before limestone bedrock was struck.
Incidental survey of an area 20 to 50 m further downslope of the boat ramp extension area
resulted in the recording of 41TV2445. This prehistoric site is located on an alluvial terrace on
the left (or east) side of Sandy Creek below the conservation pool of the lake at an elevation of
about 629 ft amsl. At the time of the survey, the terrace was covered by high herbaceous
vegetation, principally Roosevelt weed. A few tree stumps were noted at the lower end of the
terrace near the creek. To the southeast above the terrace, a rocky slope ascends to a limestone
shelf. A dry creek enters Sandy Creek from the east about 60 m upstream from the project area.
The survey found a small amount of cultural material that probably represents prehistoric
camping debris, although it is also possible that the material may have washed into the area
during floods. Definite prehistoric material consists of a burned limestone rock and several
mussel shells on the surface on the southeast edge of the site area near ST 5, and a Gower
projectile point recovered at a depth of 50 cm

271

below ground surface in ST 6 on the northwest edge of the site. Two very small burned rock
fragments and a very small amount of charcoal found in Levels 2 and 3 of ST 5 may also be of
prehistoric origin.
The Gower point was retrieved from sediments consisting of brown silty loam with scattered
limestone detritus. The point is made from fine-grained brown chert and has moderate white
patination on one side and slight patination on the other. The point is nearly complete and appears
to have been reworked. It has a prominent impact flake scar running longitudinally from the distal
tip.
272

The investigated area of site 41TV2445 contains very little cultural material and what artifacts are
present may have washed in during floods. The Gower point was recovered from a low elevation
only a few feet above the creek channel within sediments that are possibly much younger in age
than the point. The surface artifacts noted further upslope are also of uncertain age. Because of
the low number of artifacts and their uncertain context, the site deposits near the boat ramp
project are assessed as ineligible for SAL designation. However, intact parts of the site may exist
in areas of the terrace to the southwest (downstream) and north (upstream), and the SAL
eligibility of these areas remains undetermined. Although the portion of 41TV2445 examined
during the current survey is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a SAL, construction
crews should be careful to confine their ground-disturbing activities to the boat ramp expansion
area.

Kateâs and Johnson Coves Road Extension
Travis County is also proposing to construct an extension of the existing asphalt roadway that
currently ends at the entrance to Kateâs and Johnson Coves at the far north end of Pace Bend
Park. This proposed construction would consist of placing asphalt over several existing gravel
and dirt roads that have been used for many years by park visitors (Figure 145). A file search
conducted by the LCRA Cultural Resources team indicated that the area was previously surveyed
for cultural resources in 1984 with one prehistoric lithic procurement site, 41TV950, being
present in and around the road improvement project (EH&A 1985). The site was assessed as
insignificant. Based on the file search data and the fact that since the road improvement project
will not involve any new excavation, there should be no effect on any sites

eligible for formal designation as SALs. Staff decided that no additional cultural survey work was
needed for the road paving project.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

In November 2013, the LCRA Cultural Resources team conducted cultural resource
investigations for three projects located on lands that Travis County leases from LCRA. These
Travis County projects consist of 1) construction of a boat ramp extension and associated parking
lot at Tournament Point in the Pace Bend Park, 2) paving of existing park road paths in Kateâs
and Johnson Coves in Pace Bend Park, and 3) construction of a boat ramp extension at the Sandy
Creek Park. A total of 1.34 acres were intensively surveyed.
Based on the results of the investigation, construction of the Pace Bend boat ramp extension and
associated parking lot should be allowed to proceed with the provision that Travis County follow
previous recommendations to avoid potentially significant prehistoric cultural deposits associated
with 41TV2357. This can be accomplished by erecting temporary fencing along the west edge of
the boat ramp extension area so construction activities do not extend into sensitive areas west of
the fence.
The LCRA Cultural Resource team also recommends that construction of the Sandy Creek boat
ramp extension proceed since no cultural resource sites are present in the extension area and it
does not appear that nearby site 41TV2445 contains any cultural deposits eligible or potentially
eligible for SAL designation. Similarly, the construction of the paved roads at Kateâs and Johnson
coves should proceed since adjacent site 41TV950 has previously been determined to not be
eligible for SAL designation.

Part II. Negative Surveys Less Than 5 Acres in Size, Transmission Line Maintenance
Projects, and Projects Cleared through File Searches.
During calendar year 2013 there were 31 projects that were cleared internally through memos
from LCRAâs Cultural Resources staff to project managers. These projects included the T-157
Electrical Transmission Line Overhaul Project where six new cultural resource sites were
recorded. LCRA staff determined that no significant or potentially significant cultural deposits at
any of these sites would be affected by the project activities. Electrical transmission line
overhauls for LCRAâs T-108 and T130 lines involved revisits to several previously recorded
cultural resource sites, but again it was determined that no SAL-eligible cultural deposits would
be adversely affected by the overhaul activities. Field survey work was undertaken for one other
electrical transmission line overhaul project, T545, but no cultural resource sites were found.
Staff did ensure that an existing historic cemetery would be avoided during the overhaul of the T545 line. Five other electrical transmission line overhaul projects were cleared for construction
after files searches were conducted.
Part II also includes internal memos for negative results fieldwork conducted on one new
electrical substation, two electrical substations additions, two new water wells, one water
treatment plant upgrade project, one dam maintenance project, and one park entry station and
boat ramp improvement project. In all cases, the acreage surveyed for each individual project was
less than five acres and no cultural resource sites were found.
The remainders of the projects in this portion of the LCRA Annual Report were low-level impact
projects that mostly consisted of the removal of dead trees in LCRA park properties.

Project 10.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed T-545 Overhaul
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: July 2013

LCRA is planning to overhaul a portion of its T-545 transmission line that runs between the Nada
and Altair substations in Colorado County (Figure 146). This transmission line has not been
surveyed for cultural resources. However, in 2010 maintenance crews discovered an unrecorded
cemetery in the ROW, and notified LCRAâs Cultural Resources team about the find. Soon after, a
member of the Cultural Resources team made a field visit to the cemetery and formally recorded
it as an archeological site. Cultural Resources Services also notified the Colorado County Clerk
about the existence of the cemetery, as is required by state law.
As part of the overhaul, a number of deteriorating transmission structures will be replaced by new
ones. Although the new structures will be placed within ten feet of the existing ones, the
construction could disturb any unrecorded cultural resources sites. Therefore, the Cultural
Resources team conducted a cultural resource survey of T-545 on July 30, 2013. The survey was
limited to 10 structure locations where structures are scheduled for replacement within areas
thought to have a high probability for archeological sites. The structure locations that were
surveyed include 30/5, 30/6, 30/7, 31/1, 31/2, 31/3, 31/5, 31/6, 32/1, and 32/2. The survey
consisted of an inspection of the ground within 10 ft of each of the 10 structures, and the
excavation of a shovel test within each of these areas to detect any buried cultural material.
The cultural resources survey found no evidence of a cultural resource site at any of the 10
structure locations. Because no cultural resources sites will be affected by the overhaul, the
project can proceed without additional oversight by the Cultural Resources team. While the
cemetery will not be directly affected by the project, construction crews should be aware of its
existence and know to avoid it. The cemetery is located between 60 and 85 feet south of Structure
32/2 in the eastern half of the T-545 ROW. It is enclosed by a wire mesh fence, which is its most
obvious feature since the grave markers are not visible in the high grass.

Project 11.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the T-157 Lockhart to Luling Overhaul
County: Caldwell
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: June 2013

The LCRAâs Transmission Services Corporation is planning to overhaul their T-157 transmission
line that runs between the Lockhart and Luling Substations in Caldwell County (Figure 148
through Figure 151). The overhaul will include the replacement of 25 H-frame structures with
new H-frame structures. The replacement structures will be erected within a few feet of the
existing ones.
The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff identified 16 of these 25 structure locations as
being within areas with a high probability of having prehistoric archaeological sites. These high
probability areas were defined as areas within 200 meters of a perennial or seasonal stream. On
June 4 and 5, 2013, LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services team field surveyed these 16 structure
locations to record any cultural resource sites that might be present and assess their significance.
The survey method involved inspecting the ground surface within 15 meters of each of the
pertinent structures, and excavating shovel tests near the structure poles to detect any subsurface
cultural material.
The survey resulted in the recording of six new cultural resource sites, 41CW151 through
41CW156. All the sites contain evidence of prehistoric occupation or other prehistoric use,
especially as locales for procuring flint rocks and for the early-stage manufacturing of stone tools.
Site 41CW156 also contains trash from an early to mid twentieth century house located outside
the T-157 ROW.
Site 41CW151 is located on a right tributary of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek in the east half of
the ROW north of Structure 4/3. It contains a light surface scatter of chert chipping debris
including cores. One burned quartzite rock was also observed. No cultural material was seen
within 5 meters of the structure, and a shovel test placed two meters from one of the H-frame
poles recovered no artifacts. It does not appear that significant cultural deposits are present near
Structure 4/3.
Site 41CW152 is a minor prehistoric lithic procurement area located at the head of one of the
right tributaries of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek. A few pieces of chert chipping debris were
noted amid the gravels that are scattered across the area. A shovel test placed near Structure 4/9
encountered shallow soil containing no cultural material. This site does not appear to be
significant.

283

Site 41CW153 is located in a pasture on the right or south side of the West Fork of Plum Creek.
The site contains a fairly extensive scatter of chert chipping debris and a few flaked stone tools in
the area around and to the south of Structure 6/9. Two burned rocks suggest the presence of
hearths, but within the ROW, most evidence including cores and a large percentage of cortical
flakes indicates lithic procurement. Naturally-occurring chert pebbles are present here, as they are
at all six sites recorded in the T-157 ROW. A shovel test placed near the structure did recover two
pieces of flint chipping debris but also showed that the upper soil zone is less than six inches
thick and presumably disturbed. Therefore, the area of 41CW153 around Structure 6/9 is assessed
as insignificant.
Site 41CW154 is a prehistoric campsite located at Structure 11/3 near where a small drainage
enters Seals Creek. Three shovel tests placed around the H-frame recovered moderate amounts of
flint chipping debris and burned quartzite rocks. The tests also showed that the cultural zone is at
most 12 inches thick. Since the cultural deposit is relatively thin and no features were
encountered, the site area around Structure 11/3 is not considered significant. However, other
areas of 41CW154 within the ROW might have features, and further investigation would be
needed before any construction takes place away from the existing H-frame.
Site 41CW155 is small lithic procurement site located around Structure 11/5. It contains a few
pieces of flint chipping debris and one burned quartzite rock. The site is considered unimportant
because of the small number of artifacts and thin deposits.
Site 41CW156 is located around Structure 13/5. It is primarily a mid twentieth century house site
with some evidence of use as a prehistoric lithic procurement locale. Historic artifacts include
purple bottle glass and old amber bottle glass, both suggesting a pre-1915 use of the area that
could be unrelated to the existing house. The house itself lies outside the ROW and has been
abandoned for decades. It is surrounded by trash that appears to date to the middle decades of the
twentieth century. The site is not considered important because of the late date of the main
historic component and the few artifacts belonging to the prehistoric component.
To summarize, the Cultural Resource Services team surveyed 16 H-frame structure locations in
high probability areas for prehistoric archaeological sites. The survey resulted in six new
archeological sites being recorded. None are assessed as significant and they are not considered
eligible for State Antiquities Landmark designation. Therefore, the LCRAâs proposed T-157
overhaul can proceed as planned, but standard emergency provisions still need to be followed.
Should work crews uncover any presently undetermined archaeological features anywhere during
the overhaul project, work in the immediate area should stop and Cultural Resource Services staff
be notified of the discovery.

Project 13.13 Excel Construction Lease for Floating Intake Structure
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: April 2013

The LCRA is preparing to lease eight acres of land in Travis County to Excel Construction
Services as a temporary construction area for a floating intake structure (Figure 152). The
proposed lease is located on the west side of the Sandy Creek branch of Lake Travis below the
conservation pool of 681 ft msl (Figure 153).
A records search by LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff found that one previously recorded
archaeological site, 41TV223, extends into the northeast corner of the proposed lease. This site
was recorded in 1937 during the Surface Survey of the Marshall Ford Lake, and was described as
a two acre area containing prehistoric camp refuse. Archaeological sites recorded during the
1930s are often imprecisely plotted and not thoroughly investigated. Therefore, LCRAâs Cultural
Resource Services staff conducted a field survey to locate and assess all archeological sites in the
proposed lease.
The cultural resources survey was conducted on April 17, 2013, during which a small prehistoric
camp was found on the northern edge of the survey area (Figure 1). This site could be 41TV223,
although it is considerably smaller in area. The site contains eight small stone hearths along with
flint chipping debris and a few stone tools. All the hearths had been dispersed by waves, and
nearby tree stumps indicate that at least 6 inches of soil had been removed by erosion. Because of
the disturbances, the site is assessed as having little research potential. However, the THC would
have to concur with this assessment should the site area be included in the construction lease.
LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff recommended that this archaeological site not be
included in the proposed construction lease to Excel. No construction activities should be
conducted north of the blue dashed line in Figure 1. The line lies 150 feet north of (and parallel
to) an existing concrete boat ramp that runs northwest to southeast into the western part of the
proposed lease. Construction may proceed anywhere in the area south of the dashed line. LCRA
project management for the lease project agreed with staffâs recommendation to exclude the site
area from the lease to Excel.

Project 15.13 Camp Swift LS #2 Force Main Replacement
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: May 2013

The LCRA is planning to replace 5500 linear feet of 4-inch wastewater force main pipeline
within the Camp Swift Regional Wastewater System (Figure 154). The pipeline runs through a 20
ft LCRA utility easement, and the new pipeline will be laid in the existing trench when possible.
The LCRA Camp Swift Regional Wastewater project was surveyed by LCRA archeologists in
1990 and 1991. Three archeological sites, 41BP365-367, were recorded along Segment A of the
wastewater pipeline, which corresponds to the segment being replaced in this project. Site
41BP365 was described as a sparse scatter of prehistoric chipping debris that had been disturbed
by artificial and natural impacts, and is assessed as not eligible for State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL) designation.
Sites 41BP366 and 41BP367, both located on the creek north of FM2336, were described as
small prehistoric campsites lying mostly outside the LCRA pipeline ROW on Camp Swift
property. The small areas of both sites that lie within the LCRA ROW were assessed as
insignificant. However, the areas of these sites outside (and primarily east of) the LCRA ROW
are potentially important and could be eligible for SAL status. Therefore, work crews and
vehicles should stay within (or west of) the LCRA ROW in the vicinity of these two
archeological sites. These two ROW areas are shown in hatched red boxes in Figure 155. LCRA
project management agreed with the avoidance recommendations.

Project 16.13 Grelle Recreation Area Dead Tree Removal
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: May 2013

The LCRA is planning to cut down dead trees in their Grelle Recreation Area on the south side of
Lake Travis in Burnet County (Figure 156). The trees will then be transported to areas on the
exposed lakebed for burning. The use of heavy machinery off road and the burning of trees could
impact surface and near-surface cultural deposits. Therefore, LCRAâs Cultural Resources
Division staff conducted a file search to determine if these specific areas have been previously
surveyed for cultural resources, and if any archeological sites have been recorded at these
locations
The file search showed that the areas where the dead trees are located have been previously
surveyed, resulting in no archeological sites being recorded. The same is true for the areas on the
lakebed where the trees will be burned. Since no archeological sites are located in the areas of
potential impact, this project can proceed at Grelle without further oversight by Cultural
Resources Division staff.

Project 17.13 Removal of dead trees from Black Rock Park Area
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: May 2013

LCRA proposes to remove a number of dead trees from along existing pathways and adjacent to
other facilities within Black Rock Recreation Area (Figure 157). The trees will be hand cut then
moved mechanically to designated disposal areas where they will be burned or otherwise
disposed of. Due to the potential for near-surface disturbance required for tree movement, a
cultural resources assessment was conducted.
The file search showed that the entire Black Rock Park property was surveyed for cultural
resource sites by former LCRA archaeologist Woody Wooldridge in 1988. No cultural resource
sites were found during that investigation. Further, the LCRA files indicated that the LCRA
Cultural Resource staff monitored the construction of water pipelines within the park in 1992. No
cultural resource sites were found during that investigation.
Based on the negative results of previous cultural resource investigations at Black Rock, the
proposed removal of dead trees may proceed. If project elements change, then additional
assessments may be necessary. In that case please contact Cultural resource Services staff at ext.
6714 or 2753.

Project 18.13 Removal of dead trees from Gloster Bend Recreation Area
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: April 2013
LCRA proposes to remove a number of dead trees from along existing pathways within Gloster
Bend Recreation Area (Figure 158). The trees will be hand cut then moved mechanically to
designated disposal areas where they will be burned or otherwise disposed of. Due to the potential
for near-surface disturbance required for tree movement, a cultural resources assessment was
conducted. The assessment consisted of a file and map review designed to evaluate the potential
for disturbance to potentially significant archaeological sites within the park.
The assessment included the following assumptions: the trees will be cut by hand; the trees will
be dragged to a redistribution point from which they will be loaded onto trucks for movement to
the disposal areas, or they will be dragged to disposal areas; moving the trees will occur, to the
extent practicable, along existing roadways.
The map and file review indicted that if the assumptions stated above are correct, then no adverse
impacts to potentially significant sites will occur. LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff
therefore has no objections to the project as it is proposed, as long as the trees are transported
along the shortest, most direct routes possible from the removal areas to existing roads and from
existing roads to disposal areas.
If project elements change or the recommendations above cannot be followed, then additional
assessments may be necessary. In that case please contact Cultural Resource Services staff at ext.
6714 or 2753.

LCRA proposes to remove a number of dead trees from along existing pathways within Turkey
Bend Recreation Area (Figure 159). The trees will be hand cut then moved mechanically to
designated disposal areas where they will be burned or otherwise disposed of. Due to the potential
for near-surface disturbance required for tree movement, a cultural resources assessment was
conducted. The assessment consisted of a file and map review designed to evaluate the potential
for disturbance to potentially significant archaeological sites within the park.

Project 20.13 Muleshoe Bend Recreation Area Dead Tree Removal
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: May 2013
The LCRA is planning to remove dead trees in their Muleshoe Recreation Area on the south side
of Lake Travis in Travis County (Figure 159. The trees will then be transported to nearby areas
on the exposed lakebed for burning. The use of heavy machinery off road to lift the fallen trees
and transport them to the burn areas could harm surface and near-surface archeological deposits.
Also burning trees on top of archeological sites could impact the cultural deposits. Therefore,
LCRAâs Cultural Resources Division staff conducted a file search to determine if these areas
have been previously surveyed for cultural resources, and if any previously recorded
archeological sites of known significance are located in the project area.
The file search showed that most of the Muleshoe Recreation Area has been surveyed for cultural
resources, including those areas where the trees will be cut down and burned. No sites that have
been declared State Antiquities Landmarks, or sites eligible for this designation, are located in the
project area. Therefore, LCRAâs Cultural Resources Division staff has no objections to this tree
removal project in Muleshoe Bend. When at all possible, it is recommended that existing roads be
used to haul the fallen trees to the burns piles.

Project 23.13 T-410 Bastrop West to Sim Gideon TL Overhaul
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: July 2013

The LCRA Transmission Services is planning to overhaul its T-410 transmission line that runs
between the Bastrop West and Sim Gideon substations in Bastrop County (Figure 161). Ground
disturbing construction associated with this project will involve the replacement of four existing
H-frame structures with new steel poles to increase height for clearance issues. A file search done
by LCRAâs Cultural Resources Services staff found that this line has not been surveyed for
cultural resources. A review of USGS topographic maps showed that the four structures
scheduled for replacement are located in low probability areas for archaeological sites.
Because ground disturbing construction will only take place in areas with a low probability for
archaeological sites, Cultural Resources Services staff does not believe a field survey is necessary
for this project. Therefore, the overhaul of T-410 can proceed without further involvement of
Cultural Resources Services staff. However, standard emergency provisions still need to be
followed. Should work crews uncover any presently undetermined archaeological features
anywhere during the overhaul project, work in the immediate area should stop and Cultural
Resource Services staff be notified at ext. 6714 of the find.

Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: July 2013

The LCRA Transmission Services is planning to overhaul its T-582 transmission line that runs
between the Elroy and Wolf Lane substations in Bastrop and Travis counties (Figure 164). The
project will involve the replacement of deteriorated wood structures. A file search done by
LCRAâs Cultural Resources Services staff found that this line was surveyed for cultural resources
by Espey, Huston, and Associates for the 1993 Wolf Lane to Lytton Springs transmission line
rebuild project. The EH&A archaeologists recorded four archeological sites (41TV1662-1665)
along the segment of the line that is now designated as T-582. These sites are all minor
prehistoric lithic scatters or lithic procurement locales, and were assessed by the EH&A
archaeologists as insignificant. Because T-583 was previously surveyed for cultural resources and
no sites eligible for State Antiquities Landmark status were recorded in the ROW, the upgrade
project can proceed without further oversight by Cultural Resources Services staff.

Project 28.13 Mockingbird Substation Addition Project
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: July 2013

LCRA proposes to execute an Interconnection Agreement with American Electric Power
(AEP) at the site of AEPâs proposed new Mockingbird Substation, located just west of
the town of Columbus and adjacent to SH 71 (Figure 166). LCRAâs portion of the project
that might affect cultural resources will consist of adding two A-frame transmission
structures within the substations, as well as potentially replacing or modifying a structure
located within existing LCRA transmission line T-176, which is immediately east of the
AEP substation. Because a desktop assessment of the project area indicated that there was
a moderate potential for undetermined cultural resources to be present within LCRAâs
portion of the project area, it was determined that a cultural resources assessment was
needed.
The assessment was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff on May 15,
2013, and consisted of a pedestrian survey and shovel tests. Upon arriving at the location,
it was observed that substation site had been fully graded and covered with compacted
road base. Structures seen on topographic maps and aerial imagery that looked like a set
of pole barns had been removed. Cultural resource investigations were therefore limited
to the area of potential effect within LCRAâs existing transmission line easement.
Two shovel tests were excavated within the approximate 100 x 330 ft (.75 acre)
easement. These tests were designed to determine if cultural resources might be present
within any portion of the easement, and were spaced 30 m apart. Test 1 was about 10 m
south of an existing support, and encountered 21 cm of mottled grayish-brown to brown
clayey sand over 29 cm of dark grayish brown clay. Below 50 cm was mottled pale sand
with orange clay. Test 2 had the same profile.
As a result of these investigations, it was determined that the probability for potentially
significant undiscovered cultural materials at this location is very low. On May 15, 2013, an
email was sent to the project manager, informing her that there were no concerns regarding
cultural resources for this project. The result of the investigations will be submitted with LCRAâs
Annual Report to the Texas Historical Commission for 2013.

Project 29.13 Additional land acquisition at Clear Fork Substation
County: Caldwell
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: July 2013

LCRA is currently planning to construct the new Clear Fork Substation located adjacent to SH
130 northwest of the city of Lockhart in Caldwell County (Figure 167). The original substation
site was surveyed in February 2013 by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff. One previously
unrecorded prehistoric site, 41CW150, was documented and recommended as ineligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. The Texas Historical Commission concurred
with these recommendations on February 21, 2013, and the project was allowed to proceed
without additional cultural resources coordination. A subsequent slight adjustment in the site
layout was not surveyed.

On June 4, 2013, Cultural Resource Services staff was informed the substation property was
being increased in size by four acres. In order to facilitate cultural resource clearance it was
determined a field visit was advisable. The new acreage was surveyed by LCRA staff on June 10,
2013. Eight shovel tests, which meet minimum survey standards for a project of this size, were
excavated. All were negative for cultural material. Tests were excavated to a typical depth of 4050 cm, and encountered dark clay loams over clay. The lower soils were considered
representative of subsoils on the non-aggrading surface.
Because the new project area is less than 4 acres in size and no archaeological sites were
recognized, the project may proceed without a formal report to the Texas Historical Commission.
Instead, the project will be reported in LCRAâs Annual Report of Cultural Resources
Investigations for 2013.
This information was relayed to the project manager by email on June 11, 2013. This memo
serves as formal correspondence on the project.
As with all projects, if unexpected buried cultural materials are encountered during grounddisturbing activities, then such work should stop until LCRA archaeologists can be informed of
the discovery and any potential actions considered.

Project 30.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Tow Village Water
System Improvements
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: July 2013

LCRA is planning improvements to its Tow Village Water Plant in Llano County (Figure 168).
These improvements will mostly consist of new construction within a 24 by 24 foot area
immediately to the north of the plantâs existing perimeter fence. In this area, concrete slabs will
be poured for a chlorine building and water treatment units. Some construction will also occur
within the existing plant.
On July 19, 2013, a member of LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a cultural resources
survey of the project area. An inspection of the grounds outside the perimeter fence found
indications, including a large push pile, that the area around the plant had been bladed. This was
done probably to level the surface before its original construction. The area within the plant was
also inspected, and little if any original soil surface was seen there. The survey included the
excavation of five shovel tests, three in the project area north of the plant, a fourth on the east side
adjacent to an existing concrete slab, and a fifth shovel test 40 meters north of the plant. The last
test was dug in order to learn how the undisturbed, natural soil in the area appears. All the shovel
tests encountered extremely stony soil usually less than a foot thick over limestone bedrock.
No evidence of a cultural resource site was found during the survey. Because no cultural
resources sites will be affected by this project, it can proceed by virtue of this memo.

Project 33.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Guadalupe Substation
County: De Witt
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: July 2013

On July 15, 2013, LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a cultural resources survey of the
proposed Guadalupe Substation project in De Witt County (Figure 169). The survey included the
4.3 acre substation footprint as well as two 0.25 acre areas where poles will be erected (Figure
170). The cultural resources survey consisted of a walkover of the entire project area and the
excavation of eight shovel tests to detect any subsurface cultural material. The shovel tests were
dug down to the clay B horizon, and the fill put through a Â¼â wire mesh to recover any artifacts.
The cultural resources survey found no evidence of a cultural resource site within the project area.
All shovel tests were negative, meaning no buried cultural material was recovered. Because no
cultural resource sites were found, and because the project covers less than five acres, according
to the MOU LCRA has with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), LCRA is not required to
send the THC an interim report of our findings and recommendations. Instead, the substation
project can proceed at this time by virtue of this memo. Our staff will report the results of the
survey at the end of the year in our Annual Report to the THC for Calendar Year 2013.

Project 35.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Lake Bastrop Dam Safety
Project
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: August 2013

LCRA is planning to construct an earthen platform adjacent to the west (downstream) side of the
Lake Bastrop Dam south of the dam gates (Figure 171). The platform is needed to support a crane
that will be used to access the dam gates for repair or replacement. The platform will be 150 feet
in length and will widen the dam crest by 15 feet. The north end of the proposed platform will
abut the fence enclosing the gate area of the existing dam.
LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a file search for the project area that showed that a
previously recorded prehistoric archeological site, 41BP350, lies adjacent to the south side of the
dam. Because the siteâs importance has not been determined, the Cultural Resources team
decided to conduct a field survey to determine if this site extends of the project area.
The survey, which was done on August 1, 2004, found that the proposed earthen platform will be
built on artificial fill brought in to construct the dam embankment. A shovel test placed in the
middle of the project area just below the crest of the embankment found that this portion of the
dam fill was constructed of clay with a thin overlay of sand. Interestingly, the sand overlay
contained two pieces of prehistoric flint chipping debris. Several more pieces of chipping debris
were also noted on the surface of dam embankment. An inspection of the natural ground surface
at the base of the embankment to the west in the direction of 41BP350 found dense flint pebbles
and cobbles but no actual artifacts.
It appears that the artifacts located in the sandy overburden on the dam embankment were
brought in with the fill when the dam was constructed in the 1960s and have no relationship to
41BP350. No artifacts were noted on the natural ground surface in the vicinity of the dam, and
therefore 41BP350 must lie outside the project area. Because no cultural resources sites will be
affected by the construction of the earthen platform, the project can proceed without additional
oversight by the Cultural Resources team.

Project 36.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Lake Bastrop LPPP
Groundwater Wells Project (Wells SB-3 and SB-4)
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: August 2013

LCRA is planning to construct two groundwater wells (Wells SB-3 and SB-4) on LCRA property
on the east side of Lake Bastrop near the Sim Gideon Power Plant (Figure 172, Figure 173).
Drilling of the wells will impact an area within a radius of 70 feet at each drill site. In addition, a
buried water pipeline will run from the SB-4 well due south to Lake Bastrop through a 20-foot
right of way for a distance of 490 feet. A buried water pipeline will also run through a 20-foot
right of way from the SB-3 well due east to the power plant discharge canal. New buried
electrical lines will run electricity to the drilling rigs and well pumps from the power plant. These
lines will be buried within 20-foot rights of way along existing roads leading to the power plant.
A total area of four acres will be impacted by this project.
On August 9, 2013, LCRAâs Cultural Resources Division staff conducted a field survey of two
proposed well sites, including the proposed pipeline routes. Since the electrical line will run
mostly through disturbed ground near the power plant, only the segment of electrical line in the
pine woods running from the SB-4 well site eastwards for 2400 feet was surveyed. The survey
consisted of an inspection of the ground within the potential impact areas, and the excavation of
shovel tests at select intervals to detect buried archaeological deposits. A total of 14 shovel tests
were dug. Each test involved digging a hole about 16 to 18 inches in diameter through the upper
soil zone down to the clay or rock substrate. The dirt removed from each hole was screened
through a Â¼â mesh to recover any cultural material. Soil profiles were recorded for each shovel
test as well.
The survey resulted in no cultural resources sites being recorded. Because no cultural resource
sites were found, and because the project covers less than five acres, according to the MOU
LCRA has with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), LCRA is not required to send the THC
an interim report of our findings and recommendations. Instead, the well project can proceed
immediately by virtue of this memo. Our staff will report the results of the survey at the end of
the year in our Annual Report to the THC for Calendar Year 2013.

Project 38.13 Double Horn fire break
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: August 2013

LCRA proposes to clear vegetation along or near a portion of the property boundary of the
Double Horn Preserve located in Burnet County (Figure 174). The work will be done by
bulldozer, seppi, and by hand. Approximately 4,200 feet of land will be cleared to a maximum
width of 16 feet, totaling approximately 1.5 acres. The work will take place along previously
cleared fencelines.
Two previously recorded prehistoric archaeological sites, 41BT410 and 41BT418, both of
undetermined eligibility for formal State Archeological Landmark status, will be avoided by any
new ground disturbing activities. The project is cleared to proceed as described.
This project is a modification of an earlier proposed, more extensive fire break which included
areas on the south side of Double Horn Creek that had not been previously surveyed and areas in
which sensitive archaeological sites are known to be present. A field investigation of the
previously unsurveyed portions of the southern boundary was conducted, and the known sensitive
sites, 41BT100, 41BT101 and 41BT389 were briefly revisited.
No new archaeological sites were found during the survey of the southern boundary. The area
near 41BT101 may, in the future, be cleared by way of seppi or other equipment that minimizes
ground disturbance. The area near the river, at 41BT100 and 41BT389 should have no ground
disturbance. Vegetation should be cut and removed by hand.
Additionally, this memo serves as guidance for potential ground disturbance due to movement of
equipment. There are numerous sensitive archaeological sites within the Double Horn Preserve,
and any movement of heavy machinery in areas not described above should be coordinated with
Cultural Resources staff.

Project 39.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Sandstone to Eckert T-130
Transmission Line Overhaul
County: Llano
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: August 2013

LCRAâs Cultural Resources Services team has completed its investigation for the Sandstone to
Eckert T-130 transmission line overhaul project (Figure 175). The main concerns from a cultural
resources perspective are ground disturbing construction associated with transmission tower
replacement. A file search showed that four structures (9/2, 10/7, 10/9, and 12/1) will be replaced
within the limits of three previously recorded archaeological sites, all prehistoric campsites that
were originally assessed as potentially eligible for State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) designation.
However, the significance of the archeological deposits at these specific structure locations has
not been determined. Therefore, the Cultural Resources team decided to conduct a field survey of
the four structure locations to determine the significance of the cultural deposits in the immediate
area of the four structures. A fifth structure, 15/2, located on the south side of Sandy Creek, was
also surveyed because it lies in an area with a high probability for prehistoric sites.
The survey was carried out on August 29 and September 4, 2013, consisting of an inspection of
the ground surface within ten feet of each structure and the excavation of a shovel test within a
few feet of each pole of the H-frame. Each shovel test involved digging a circular hole 18 inches
in diameter and passing the fill through a Â¼ inch wire mesh to recover artifacts. The survey found
the soil and cultural deposits around structures 9/2, 10/9, and 12/1 to be extremely thin, six inches
or less, with no indications of features such as hearths. Therefore, the archeological deposits
around these three structures can be considered ineligible for SAL-designation. The situation is
quite different at Structure 10/7, where soils are deeper and a buried zone of prehistoric cultural
material, including a probable stone hearth, was encountered within three feet of the east pole.
Therefore, the cultural deposits around 10/7 are potentially significant. No archeological material
was found at Structure 15/2 located on the south side of Sandy Creek. Only one shovel test was
dug at this location because the first test failed to recover any cultural material.
To summarize, only one structure, 10/7, appears to have potentially significant archeological
deposits buried in the soil around the poles. This structure is located east of Oxford on the south
side of a small tributary to Hondo Creek. The Cultural Resources team recommends that the
existing pole holes be used for the replacement the 10/7 H-frame so that the soil outside the holes
is not disturbed. If this is impossible to do, then the Cultural Resources team will have revisit the
site for additional shovel testing in spots where any new holes will be dug. It would also be a
good idea to have alternative hole spots in case archeological features are encountered.
Elsewhere, structure replacement can take place within ten feet of the existing structures without
further input from the Cultural Resources team.

Project 40.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Buchanan to Burnet T-108
Transmission Line Overhaul
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: August 2013

A file search showed that LCRA staff had previously undertaken a cultural resource field survey
of proposed maintenance activities within the T-108 corridor in 2005. Ten cultural resource sites
were found with two of these, 41BT112 and 41BT123, being assessed as potentially significant.
Review of the currently proposed overhaul work plan indicated that 41BT112 is the only
potentially significant site that might be affected by the overhaul. On August 29, 2013, LCRAâs
Cultural Resources team conducted a cultural resources field survey at T-108âs Structure 4/9 that
is scheduled for replacement within site 41BT112 (Figure 176).
Because the main concern was impacts to any buried cultural deposits in the vicinity of Structure
4/9, the survey consisted of digging two shovel tests within a meter of each pole of the H-frame
structure, for a total of four tests. The tests recovered low to moderate amounts of flint chipping
debris dispersed in generally shallow soil, averaging around 30 cm over bedrock, except for a test
placed to the west of the south pole, which found slightly deeper soil to a depth of 50 cm.
Significantly, the edge of a possible stone hearth was encountered in this test resting about 30 cm
below the surface. A untyped dart point was also recovered from the soil slightly below the
hearth.
While we were excavating the fourth shovel test, a Terracon crew arrived at the structure site and
informed us that only the south pole of 4/9 would be moved, and that the new location for this
pole would be 56 cm south of the existing pole it will replace. We therefore excavated a fifth
shovel test at this spot and recovered six pieces of flint chipping debris dispersed in extremely
stony soil about 50 cm deep.
To summarize, the testing found moderate amounts of buried flint chipping debris in the shallow
soils around Structure 4/9, and one possible hearth with a spear point buried about 30 cm below
ground surface about one meter west of the H-frameâs south pole. Only the hearth is considered
potentially significant and must be avoided during the overhaul project. The spot where the new
pole will go does not contain significant cultural deposits, and the LCRAâs Cultural Resources
team has no objection to moving the pole to that spot as long as no ground disturbing construction
occurs west of the existing south pole of 4/9.

Project 41.13 Muleshoe Bend Fire Break
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: September 2013

LCRA proposes to construct a bladed and shaded fire break at Muleshoe Bend using mechanical
and hand clearing methods (Figure 177). Because the project involves potentially new ground
disturbance a cultural resource assessment was conducted by LCRA cultural resources staff on
September 13, 2013. The assessment consisted of a map and file review.
As depicted, the fire break will be constructed through previously recorded prehistoric
archaeological site 41BT147. Originally described as a lithic scatter with possible burned rock
and mussel shell warranting testing, a later revisit determined the site was mostly destroyed.
Despite this, the findings have not been reviewed by THC and the site should have no new
ground disturbance.
The remainder of the north/south portion of the firebreak was previously surveyed in 1979 for a
brush clearing project and no sites were recorded. Subsequent visits have not resulted in any more
sites being recorded.
The east/west portion of the firebreak that is north of Ridge Harbor was surveyed for a fence
project in 2012 that was included in LCRAâs annual report of investigations for THC review. No
archaeological sites were indentified and no avoidance is necessary.
To summarize, for the Muleshoe Bend firebreak there is one area where there should be no new
ground disturbance (Figure 178). It is located at the very edge of the steep drop to the lower lake
terraces, about 365 meters (1,200 ft) north of the entry road. In this area there should be no new
ground disturbance. A maintainer or seppi can work the existing road but should stay within the
roadbed. Hand clearing within the avoidance area is permissible.
If avoidance is not possible or if unexpected archaeological materials are encountered during the
project, than the Cultural Resources team should be contacted.

Project 42.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Gloster Bend Vegetative Fuel
Reduction Project
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: September 2013

Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to clear vegetation in its Gloster Bend
Recreation Area to create shaded fuel breaks and bladed fire breaks to reduce the chance for
wildfires. The vegetation will be cleared using hand tools such as chainsaws and loppers, as well
as machinery including shredders and seppis. All vegetation will be cut at or near ground surface,
and some superficial ground disturbances will occur from the wheels or treads of heavy
machinery.
The clearing will take place in two areas within the southeast corner of the park, totaling about
four acres (Figure 179). LCRAâs Cultural Resources team conducted a file search for this project
and found that the proposed clearing area to the south was surveyed for cultural resources during
a 2007 park improvement project, which found no archeological sites in that area. The file search
also found that the proposed clearing area to the north was included in a cultural resources survey
for a 1979 brush control project, which recorded a prehistoric archaeological site, 41TV478, in
that area. The site was described as primarily a lithic procurement locale containing a light scatter
of flint chipping debris over cobble outcropping. No special precautions for the brush control
project were recommended at the time, and the Texas Historical Commission concurred with that
recommendation. Therefore, the present vegetation reduction project can proceed in both areas of
Gloster Bend without further oversight by the Cultural Resources team.

Project 43.13 FY 14 Mansfield Dam Area Vegetative Fuel Reduction, Cultural
Resources
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: September 2013

The LCRA is planning to construct shaded and bladed fire breaks at its Mansfield Dam area
properties using both mechanical and hand clearing methods (Figure 180). Because the project
involves potentially new ground disturbing activities a cultural resource assessment was
conducted by the LCRA Cultural Resources team on September 17, 2013. The assessment
consisted of a file search and the production of this internal memo.
The file search showed that the Mansfield Dam properties encompass LCRA tracts TN-1 and TN2 and that all areas having a high probability for cultural resource sites have been previously
surveyed for cultural resources. The previous surveys were conducted by Kotter (1980), Malof
and Prikryl (2000), Henderson (2006) and Malof (2009).
As a result of these previous investigations, two cultural resource sites, 41TV527 and 41TV2181
were recorded and assessed. Site 41TV527 is located in the southwest part of the project area. It
has both historic and prehistoric components with the historic component consisting of a former
early 20th century farmstead with no remaining standing structures. The prehistoric component
consists of a light scatter of chert chipping debris and tool fragments, and some possible burned
rocks. Both components were assessed as insignificant.
Site 41TV2181 was recorded during the survey for the WCID #17 Water Treatment Plant lease
project. It has both historic and prehistoric components. The historic component consists of the
remains of a 1930âs era government workers camp associated with the construction of Mansfield
Dam. Archival research determined that the government workersâ camp consisted of a single
residential street lined with eight houses on each side of the street. The camp was mechanically
razed after the dam was completed so that only a few concrete foundations and curbs, and a few
rusted metal can fragments are still present. The historic component was assessed as insignificant.
The prehistoric component was also assessed as insignificant due to the absence of features and
the lack of any subsurface deposits.
The Texas Historical Commission has previously concurred with the archaeologistsâ assessments
that 41TV527 and 41TV2181 are not eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks. Based on the review of data, the proposed fire breaks project may proceed without
any further cultural resource investigations. If any unexpected archaeological materials are
encountered during the project, than the Cultural Resources team should be contacted.

Project 47.13 FY 14 Shaffer Bend Dead Tree Removal Project
County: Burnet
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: October 2013

The LCRA is planning to remove hazardous dead trees and dead tree limbs around public use
areas and access roads in the Shaffer Bend Recreation Area (Figure 181). The removal work will
be done with hand tools including chain saws. All cut tree waste will be processed with a chipper
except for large tree trunks which will be conveyed by truck to a predetermined burn pile site.
The tree stumps will be cut as close to grade as possible.
The LCRA Cultural Resources team conducted a file search for the project and determined that
all proposed tree cutting areas having a high probability for cultural resource sites have been
previously surveyed by staff. Four known archaeological sites consisting of 41BT67, 41BT70,
41BT428, and 41BT451 are located within the areas where dead trees and limbs may be cut,
chipped and/or removed. Care needs to be taken not to damage subsurface deposits when
dragging dead tree trunks to trucks at these sites except for 41BT428. None of these four site
areas should be used as the burn pile area. Additionally, there are five other cultural resource sites
located outside the dead tree removal project area that should not be used as the location for the
burn pile. These consist of 41BT49, 41BT68, 41BT177, 41BT416, and 41BT483 which should
not be used for the burn pile area.
The project may proceed if the restrictions described above can be followed. If you have any
questions or need any additional information, please contact me at ext. 6714

Project 48.13 FY Austin YMBL Sunshine Camp at Turkey Bend â New Improvements
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: October 2013

The Austin YMBL Sunshine Camps leases 21 acres of land at LCRAâs Turkey Bend Recreation
Area (Figure 182). The present facilities, consisting of cabins, a dining hall, bathhouse, playing
field, ropes course, and other supporting infrastructure were constructed following a 2008 cultural
resources assessment of the project. (Malof 2009:38-55). As a result of these investigations, a
previously recorded prehistoric archaeological site, 41TV1849, was enlarged, and also
determined to be ineligible for formal listing a State Archeological Landmark.
Austin Sunshine Camps proposes to make improvements and additions to the Turkey Bend
facility in order to serve more campers. A pavilion, amphitheater and additional staff housing will
be added (Figure 183).
A review of the proposed improvements indicates that they are all located within areas that were
previously investigated. Therefore, there is no need for additional survey or coordination with the
Texas Historical Commission, other than including the review within LCRAâs annual report of
cultural resource investigations.
However, because this is a known archaeological site on public lands, it needs to be stressed that
all artifacts should be left on site. Also, should any unexpected archaeological materials, such as
human or animal skeletal remains, be encountered during construction, then work must cease in
the area of the discovery until LCRAâs Cultural Resources staff is contacted and the find is
assessed.

Project 50.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed T-540 Equipment
Laydown
County: Karnes
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: October 2013

LCRAâs Cultural Resources Services team has completed its investigation for the proposed T-540
Equipment Laydown area in Karnes County. The area is located in a field on the south side of
Hwy 81 about two miles northwest of Helena (Figure 184). The investigation consisted of a file
search and a field survey. The file check found that no cultural resources sites have been recorded
in the project area. The field survey was conducted on October 17, 2013, and involved walking
across the entire project area in 20-meter-interval transects while inspecting the ground for
cultural material. The survey also included the excavation of four shovel tests. Each of these tests
involved digging a 35 cm diameter hole to a depth of 20 inches and screening the fill through a
Â¼â wire mesh to recover any buried artifacts.
The ground inspection found a moderate surface scatter of flint and quartzite cobbles. Many of
these rocks had been broken by plows and heavy machinery but no obvious artifacts were seen.
Field terracing was also evident in the southern part of the project area. The four shovel tests
failed to recover any cultural material. The soil consisted of a clay to clay loam with a few
scattered pebbles.
To summarize, LCRAâs Cultural Resources team surveyed the project area and did not find
evidence of a cultural resources site. Because no cultural resources sites are located in the project
area, and because the project covers less than five acres, according to the MOU LCRA has with
the Texas Historical Commission (THC), LCRA is not required to send the THC an interim report
of our findings and recommendations. Instead, use of the equipment laydown area can proceed
immediately by virtue of this memo. Our staff will report the results of the survey at the end of
the year in our Annual Report to the THC for Calendar Year 2013.

Project 51.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the proposed Muleshoe Bend Pay
Station, Park Host Site, Roads & Boat Ramp Improvements
County: Travis
Type of Investigation: Field Survey
Date of Investigation: November 2013

LCRA is planning improvements to its Muleshoe Recreation Area on Lake Travis (Figure 185).
These include (1) construction of a pay station and additions to the Park Host site along the south
edge of the existing pavement at the entrance to the park, (2) widening of the existing road
leading from the main park road to the Turner Farm Campground, and (3) construction of a boat
ramp and parking areas at the Turner Farm Campground.
A file search conducted by LCRAâs Cultural Resources team found that the road leading to the
Turner Farm Campground passes through the boundaries of a previously recorded prehistoric site,
41BT500. This site was investigated by the Cultural Resources team for a 2008 park
improvements project and was assessed as ineligible for State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)
designation. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with this assessment. During this same
project, the entire Turner Farm Campground above the 681 ft contour was investigated and given
clearance for future construction. The only areas of the current improvement project that have not
been previously cleared for construction include the proposed construction areas at the entrance
to the park as well as the proposed boat ramp (which lies below the 681 ft contour).
On October, 2013, the Cultural Resources team conducted a field survey of these areas. The
survey found that the proposed construction area at the entrance station had been previously
disturbed by land contouring and blading with no evidence of an archaeological site. The
proposed boat ramp area was surveyed next and found to lie on a steep eroded slope in the path of
an existing dirt road. No archaeological material was noted on the surface and no subsurface
testing was done because of the steepness of the slope.
To summarize, all areas of the current improvements project have been previously cleared for
construction by the THC with the exception of the entrance station construction areas and the
boat ramp. The Cultural Resources team conducted a field survey of these areas and found them
to be disturbed with no evidence of archeological sites. Because no cultural resources sites are
located in the project area, and because the project covers less than five acres, according to the
MOU LCRA has with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), LCRA is not required to send the
THC an interim report of our findings and recommendations. Instead, construction can proceed
immediately by virtue of this memo. Our staff will report the results of the survey at the end of
the year in our Annual Report to the THC for Calendar Year 2013.

Project 54.13 A canal easement in Matagorda County
County: Matagorda
Type of Investigation: File Search
Date of Investigation: November 2013

A third-party request has been made to LCRA for an easement across an existing canal located
immediately east of Hwy 60 about 3 miles north of Bay City in northern Matagorda County
(Figure 186). The requested easement is 75 feet in width across the 150-foot-wide canal right of
way, about 0.25 acres.
A due diligence cultural resources assessment was conducted by LCRAâs Cultural Resources
staff on December 19, 2013. The assessment consisted of a file and records search.
According to the Texas Historical Commissionâs Historic Sites Atlas, there are no archaeological
sites recorded in the vicinity of the proposed easement. Because the easement is across a highly
disturbed canal and embankment, there are no cultural resource concerns with possible impacts
associated with the third-party crossing. Therefore, LCRAâs Cultural Resources team has no
concerns with the proposed easement.

Part III

Letters to THC Requesting Clearance through File Searches

During calendar year 2013 there were nine projects for which letters were sent to THC. These
projects included one new electrical substation and two equipment laydown yards to be placed in
areas with a low probability for prehistoric sites, three irrigation canal maintenance and one
irrigation pipe replacement projects planned in already disturbed areas, a transmission line
relocation project through an area previously surveyed for cultural resources, and an office room
demolition project. The THC concurred with the assessments and recommendations that no SALeligible sites would be affected in all these cases.

Project 7.13 Cultural Resource Assessment for the Proposed T-260 Transmission Line
Relocation Project
County: Bastrop
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: March 2013

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is working with Luminant Energy to relocate a
section of the LCRAâs existing T-260 electrical transmission line so that Luminant Energy can
expand its lignite mining operation southward at the Three Oaks Mine in Bastrop County, Texas.
Previously, the LCRA had moved another section of the T-260 transmission line corridor
southward to accommodate an earlier expansion of the Three Oaks Mine by Alcoa, Inc.
(Luminantâs predecessor) in 2004. At that time the LCRA coordinated a cultural resource review
with your office, and it was concluded that the first relocation project would not affect any
cultural resource sites eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL)
and/or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
As shown on Figure 187, the currently proposed T-260 relocation right-of-way (ROW) corridor
will extend for a length of about 7.2 kilometers and will be 30 meters (100 ft) wide. The
relocation corridor lies entirely within areas of the Three Oaks Mine area that have been surveyed
for cultural resources by Ken Brown of the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1986 and
Solveig Turpin of TAS, Inc. in 2003. A total of six previously recorded cultural resource sites are
situated in the vicinity of the proposed transmission line relocation ROW. These sites consist of
the following:
41BP265: an open prehistoric campsite assessed by the contractor and the THC as not eligible for
listing on the NRHP, and no further work recommended.
41BP573: an artifact scatter and a former fireplace feature that mark the location of the former
Hudler tenant house site that the contractor and the THC assessed as not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP, and no further work was recommended.
41BP582: a burned trash scatter containing debris from the former Wright Parmer house site that
was assessed by the contractor and the THC as not eligible for listing on the NRHP with no
further work being recommended.
41BP589: an open prehistoric campsite assessed by the contractor and the THC as not eligible for
listing on the NRHP, and no further work recommended.
41BP590: a small prehistoric lithic scatter assessed by the contractor and the THC as not eligible
for listing on the NRHP, and no further work recommended.
354

41BP636: a prehistoric open campsite assessed by the contractor and the THC as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work recommended.
In summary, the previous field investigations of the currently proposed transmission line
relocation corridor found no significant cultural resource sites. Thus, no cultural resources
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and/or eligible for formal designation as SALs are located
within or near the new permanent transmission line ROW.
The LCRA recommends that no further cultural resource investigations are needed for the
proposed permanent transmission line corridor and that construction in the permanent line
corridor should be allowed to proceed with the provision that standard emergency discovery
provisions will be followed. However, there is a potential that LCRA may acquire two temporary
easements that extend outside of the permanent transmission line corridor and outside the
previously surveyed Three Oaks Mine boundary. These temporary easements, which are called
pulling easements, are areas where heavy trucks are sometimes used to pull the electrical wires
tight where the transmission line makes sharp turns. The two pulling easements of concern are
shown on Figure 1. Should the LCRA negotiate agreements for temporary construction easements
in these two areas, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff will conduct an intensive cultural resource
survey of these areas prior to construction and report the results to your office.
The LCRA requests your concurrence with its assessments and recommendations for the project.
If you have any questions or need any additional information, please contact me at 730-6714.

Project 8.13 Cultural Resource Assessment of a 4-acre equipment laydown area for
LCRAâs T-265 transmission line rebuild project
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: March 2013

In May, 2012, your office concurred with recommendations resulting from a survey of high
probability areas for a proposed T-265 transmission line rebuild project in Colorado County.
Avoidance was maintained for one previously recorded archaeological site (41CD125). Project
management has since determined that an area is needed for temporary storage of materials and
equipment. The location of this 4-acre tract is in agricultural fields about 1.5 miles north of the
transmission line. The project will consist of creating a fence around the perimeter of the site with
minimal grading if needed (Figure 188, Figure 189).
A cultural resources assessment consisting of a map and file review was conducted by LCRA
cultural resources staff in March, 2013, under terms of the State Antiquities Code, the
Memorandum of Understanding between THC and LCRA, and TAC Annual Blanket Permit
6443. No federal permitting or funding is known or anticipated.
According to the Historic Sites Atlas there are no recorded archeological sites in the vicinity of
the project area, nor have any survey projects been conducted nearby. The laydown yard is on a
divide between Sandy Creek and Pinoak Creek and along an irrigation canal that probably took
advantage of minor drainages. The geology is mapped as Lissie formation quaternary deposits,
and soils are described as Garwood series fine sandy loam, eluviated below a 13-inch A horizon.
No historic structures are depicted on the Sheridan NE USGS quadrangle (1965, revised 1981),
and a georeferenced 1936 highway map for Colorado County indicates the present county road
was not there at that time (Figure 190).
In the opinion of LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff the proposed laydown yard is an area of
low probability for containing cultural resources eligible or potentially eligible for formal listing
as State Archeological Landmarks. LCRA therefore requests concurrence that the project may
proceed without additional cultural resource investigations, with the understanding that if
unexpected buried cultural material is discovered then work will cease until your office can be
notified and a decision on how to proceed obtained.

Project 12.13 LCRA Gulf Coast Automated Gate Project
County: Matagorda
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: April 2013

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to modify the internal parts of five
existing check gate structures at its Gulf Coast Irrigation District (GCID) canal system in
Matagorda County, Texas (Figure 191). Each of the new check gate structures will have an
aluminum slide gate with actuators and instrumentation for automatic control. To enable the
upgrade, the old screwgates and pipes will be removed from four of existing gates (Figure 192 to
Figure 195). At a fifth structure which has already been modified to some extent, the existing
aluminum frame will be altered and the existing aluminum boards will be replaced with one
larger aluminum slide gate (Figure 196). The associated concrete structures will remain, but may
need some modification to support the new gates.
Installation of one or more small towers for a radio based data communication and control system
will also be required. The project will require the use of an excavator to conduct excavation while
setting the tower(s) and installing the grates. The tower(s) will be set adjacent to the canal within
the previously disturbed backdirt from the original excavation of the canals. Placement of each
tower will require the excavation of a 36 inch diameter hole to a depth of 5 feet. Portable
generators and welders will be used at the site. Some chipping or grinding of concrete will also be
conducted.
In 2010, the LCRA Cultural Resource staff provided the THC with data and photographs of 11
other check gate structures within the GCID system that were being proposed for conversion to
an automated control system through funding from a Bureau of Reclamation grant. A review
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act concluded that no historic properties
would be affected and that the project could proceed. Since the current review has no federal
funding or permitting, the review is being conducted under the State Antiquities Code.
A literature review indicates that construction of irrigation canals in the Matagorda and nearby
Wharton county areas began around 1900. The construction of the irrigation canals encouraged
rice production which helped diversify the local economy. Farmers in Matagorda County and
other counties on and near the Texas Gulf Coast increasingly turned to rice farming in the early
1900s as cotton crops were being attacked by the boll weevil. By 1912, Bay City, the Matagorda
County seat, was one of the leading rice markets in the state. Although cotton production would
rebound in the 1910s, rice production continued to expand until the rice market collapsed at the
end of World War I. Rice production and agriculture in general continued to decline in these
counties during the Great Depression. Rice cultivation revived in later years so that by 1940,
16,000 acres were planted in rice in Matagorda County. In 1948, nearby Brazoria County was the
361

nationâs number-one rice producing area. Since the 1970s, the number of rice farms in Texas has
remained generally stable at 1,200 to 1,500 farms in production. The Handbook of Texas Online
reported in 2000 that the rice industry was expected to remain stable in Texas due to increases in
domestic consumption and the opening of international markets.
The history of the GCID begins in the early twentieth century when Victor L. LeTulle built the
Bay City Irrigation Company in 1901. That same year the Bay Prairie Irrigation Company
constructed the Lane City Pump Plant and some of the companyâs first canals further northward
in Wharton County. Le Tulleâs success sparked the growth of competing canal builders. In 1927,
LeTulle bought the other 12 canal companies operating in Matagorda County and 1 in Wharton
County, combining them into one of the largest individually owned canal companies in the world.
He named it the Gulf Coast Irrigation System. LeTulle sold his company to Interstate Public
Service in 1931, which renamed the irrigation system as the Gulf Coast Water Company. In 1960,
the LCRA purchased the Gulf Coast Water Company and renamed it the GCID. The GCID is one
of three irrigation districts on the lower Colorado River drainage system that the LCRA owns and
operates.
A search of the LCRA Records and Archives Department along with conversations with staff at
the GCID office in Bay City for the earlier project in 2010 indicated that LCRA received very
little archival data from the Gulf Coast Water Company relating to the construction of the canals
and check structures when the LCRA purchased the company in 1960. According to LCRA
GCID personnel, the existing check gate structures under current review were built about the time
that the nearby Oxea chemical plant was constructed in 1964. The LCRA Records and Archives
Department does have a copy of an evaluation study of the assets of the Gulf Coast Water
Company that was conducted by Freese, Nichols and Turner in 1956 for LCRA prior to LCRAâs
purchase of the company. All sections of the canal system in the areas of the five check gate
structures are shown on a map in the 1956 report except the section of the canal where the Oxea
#3 is located. That canal terminated in the area between the Oxea #2 and 3 check gates according
to the 1956 map.
The three Oxea check gate structures are of very similar design suggesting that they all date to the
same general time period (see Figure 192 to Figure 194). The LCRA GCID staffâs oral report of a
1960s era date of construction is probably correct for these three check structures. The Brown
House check gate structure (see Figure 195) appears to have been modified in the more recent
past while the Ryman check gate structure (see Figure 196 and Figure 197) appears to be older
and similar to many of the check gate structures reviewed in 2010. Many of those structures in the
2010 review were thought to retain some components that dated to the 1920s and 1930s. As
previously stated, the 2010 review concluded that no historic properties would be affected. The
LCRA believes that the same finding is applicable for check gate structures involved in the
current project.
The LCRA Cultural Resource staff also conducted a file search for the archaeological component
of the project. The file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites
within or near the project area. Based on the previous disturbances, the absence of any known
362

cultural resource sites and absence any substantial natural water sources near check gates, LCRA
requests your concurrence that construction associated with the check gate structures and
associated radio towers does not have the potential to affect any cultural resource sites that may
be eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. The LCRA recommends that
the construction of the proposed project be allowed to proceed with the understanding that
standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable.
LCRA requests your concurrence with its assessments and recommendations.

Project 14.13: Van Vleck Area Gulf Coast Automated Gate Project
County: Matagorda
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: July 2013

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to modify portions of eight existing
check gate structures and one overflow structure that are all situated near the town of Van Vleck,
in Matagorda County, Texas (Figure 198, Figure 199, Figure 200). These structures are located
within the eastern portion of LCRAâs Gulf Coast Irrigation District (GCID) canal system. The
upgrade will involve modification of parts of the existing check gates in order to install
automated gates. Each of the new check gate structures will have an aluminum slide gate with
actuators and instrumentation for automatic control. Wooden and steel structures will be replaced.
The concrete portions of the structures will remain, but may be modified. Some of the concrete
structures are dated mid-1930s, while others were built in the 1970s, and also 2005.
Installation of several small towers for a radio based data communication and control system will
also be required. These towers will be placed at locations immedately adjacent to the canals. The
project will require the use of an excavator to conduct excavation while setting the tower(s) and
installing the grates. The tower(s) will be set adjacent to the canal within the previously disturbed
backdirt from the original excavation of the canals. Placement of each tower will require the
excavation of a 36 inch diameter hole to a depth of 5 feet. Portable generators and welders will be
used at the site. Some chipping or grinding of concrete will also be conducted.
In 2010, the LCRA Cultural Resources team provided the THC with data and photographs of 11
other check gate structures within the GCID system that were being proposed for conversion to
an automated control system through funding from a Bureau of Reclamation grant. A review
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act concluded that no historic properties
would be affected and that the project could proceed.
Earlier this month, the LCRA Cultural Resources team sent a letter to your office providing
information on a similar project located on a section of GCID system south of Bay City that will
involve retrofitting five check gate structures and construction of one or more adjacent radio
towers. That project was submitted for review under the State Antiquities Code since it does not
include any federal funding or permitting. On this recent project, LCRA asked for your
concurrence that no cultural resources eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks would be affected.

368

The history of rice farming and the associated irrigation canal system in Matagorda County has
been described in our letters to your agency on the previous two check gate structure modification
projects and will not be repeated here. LCRA purchased this irrigation system in 1960 and did not
receive any archival data from the previous owner relating to the construction of the check gate
and overflow structures. The LCRA Records and Archives Department does have a copy of an
evaluation study of the assets of the Gulf Coast Water Company that was conducted by Freese,
Nichols and Turner in 1956 for LCRA prior to LCRAâs purchase of the company. All sections of
the canal system involved in the current project are shown on this map. Some type of check
structure is shown on this map at the locations of the current check gates and overflow structure
under review. Descriptions of the current structures based on recent photographs are provided
below along with information of the structure type that is indicated as being present in 1956 when
the historic map was drawn.
Skelly Lock (Figure 201, Figure 202, Figure 203): The 1956 map shows this check gate to be
constructed of concrete and having a bridge. According to current photos, the lock appears to
have a wood plank bridge and concrete headwalls with one vertical concrete column. The date
1/7/37 has been incised on the concrete. The wooden panels on the gates have been replaced with
metal panels. The railing is also metal.
Savage Lock (Figure 204, Figure 205, Figure 206): The 1956 map shows this check gate to be
constructed of concrete. Currently, the lock appears mostly unmodified in present-day photos. It
currently has concrete headwalls with two vertical wooden columns. The gates themselves appear
to be wood planks, although many of the planks are missing. The rail and walkway are also
wooden.
Johnnie Hahn Lock (Figure 207, Figure 208, Figure 209): The 1956 map shows a concrete check
gate. Current photos show concrete headwalls with two vertical concrete columns and a concrete
slab foundation. This might not be the same concrete structure present in 1956 because concrete
rubble litters the channel on both sides of the lock. This check gate appears to have a bridge of
wood planks supported by wooden beams. The two side gate openings are covered by plastic
sheets and wood planks, while the center gate opening is partially closed by one or two wood
planks. The lock has a relatively new metal walkway and railing.
Van Vleck Lock (Figure 210, Figure 211): The 1956 map shows this lock to be constructed of
concrete. The lock appears to have no major modifications in the current photos. They show the
lock as having concrete headwalls and two vertical concrete columns. The gates, walkway, and
railing are wood construction. The lockscrew is metal.
Horn Lock (Figure 212, Figure 213, Figure 214): The 1956 map shows a concrete lock. Current
photos indicate that the lock still has a concrete headwall with two vertical concrete columns. The
gates themselves consist of metal panels. The lock has a metal grate walkway with metal railing.
Sand Pit Lock (Figure 215, Figure 216): The 1956 map depicts a timber check gate. Apparently
this timber check gate no longer exists because current photos show concrete headwalls with

369

three vertical concrete columns. The gate panels are a mix of wood and metal. The walkway is
made from wood planks.
Lee Lock (Figure 217, Figure 218): The 1956 map shows a concrete check gate. Presently, the
lock has concrete headwalls with two vertical concrete columns. The gate panels appear to be of
metal, as are the walkway and railings.
Black Lock (Figure 219, Figure 220): This check gate structure is listed as being of wood timber
construction on the 1956 map. As shown in recent photos, it is the only example of a check gate
structure that has not had any of its components such as the headwalls, vertical columns or actual
gates modified to concrete and/or metal construction. The structure appears to be in fair
condition.
George Hall Overflow Structure (Figure 221Figure 222, Figure 223, ): The 1956 map shows a
lock having timber construction. The current photos show considerable modification in that the
lock has been converted into a vertical overflow structure. It now consists of a mostly buried
concrete box with a wood plank gate. The concrete box is covered by a metal grate walkway and
railing.
The Black Lock appears to be completely unchanged since 1956, and is perhaps in much the
same condition as when first built in the early twentieth century. This lock is fairly good
condition considering it is constructed entirely of wood. The Savage Lock has not been modified
but is missing some gate panels. The Van Vleck Lock has had minor metal additions but may be
otherwise intact. Both have concrete headwalls with wooden gate panels, walkways, and railings.
One structure, the Sand Pit Lock, has been completely rebuilt from timber to concrete and metal,
and its function converted from a lock gate to a vertical overflow structure. It also has a metal
walkway and railing. Another structure, the George Hill Lock, has been also been rebuilt, being
originally a timber lock and latter converted to a concrete vertical overflow structure with timber
gate panels and metal railing and walkway.
The other locks, all constructed partially of concrete, have had relatively recent minor
modifications. These include having wooden gate panels replaced with metal ones, as has
occurred on the Skelly, Horn, and Lee locks. The most common modification is the addition of
metal walkways and railings, in most cases probably replacing wooden ones. This modification
has occurred on the Skelly, Johnnie Hahn, Horn, Lee, and George Hall locks.
We request your comments concerning the proposed modifications to these check gate structures
and the overflow structure under the State Antiquities Code. A file search showed that there are
no previously recorded cultural resource sites within or near the areas where the radio towers will
be installed. Based on the previous disturbances and the absence of any known cultural resource
sites, LCRA requests your concurrence that construction associated with the radio tower
installations does not have the potential to affect any cultural resource sites that may be eligible
for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks.

Project 31.13: LCRA Lakeside Irrigation District Prairie Pump Plant Office Demolition
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: July 2013

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to demolish the office room portion
of the Prairie Pump Plant at the LCRA Lakeside Irrigation District in Colorado County, Texas
(Figure 224). The Prairie Pump Plant is located about 2.8 miles northwest of Eagle Lake, Texas
on one of the two main stem canals that extend eastward from LCRAâs River Plant Pump Station,
which is the main water source for the Lakeside Irrigation District System.
The office room is actually a later-dating addition to the original Prairie Plant Pump Station
(Figure 225). LCRA staff is no longer using the office room and it is becoming a safety hazard.
Bees have managed to build a hive in the ceiling/roof, owls have been inside the room, and the
entire addition is starting to detach from the main building and could soon fall away from the
main building (Figure 226, Figure 227, Figure 227). Since no federal funds or permitting is
involved in the demolition, the review of the proposed project is being conducted under the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
The LCRA purchased the Lakeside Irrigation District in 1983. At that time, LCRA received a
limited number of archival documents from the previous owner. Those materials often do not
provide a complete history of the various components of the irrigation district such as pump
plants, lift stations and canals. During a review of the existing materials in the LCRA archives, a
plan view design drawing dating to 1932 for the proposed construction of the pumps at the Prairie
Pump Plant was found. Additionally, retired LCRA irrigation district employee, Ralf Johnson,
stated that he had been told that the pump plant was built in the 1930s. Mr. Johnson also said that
in the 1960s, he was one of the LCRA workers who constructed the office room addition.
Since the office room is a later-dating addition to the original Prairie Plant Pump Station, it does
not appear to be historically significant. The LCRA Cultural Resources team recommends that the
proposed demolition of the office room be allowed to proceed with no further cultural resource
investigations.
We ask for your concurrence with our recommendations.

Project 34.13: Maintenance activities at LCRAâs Garwood River Pumping Plant
County: Colorado
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: July 2013

LCRA is proposing to conduct maintenance work at its Garwood River Pumping Plant, located
north of Garwood in Colorado County (Figure 229). The plant is part of LCRAâs Irrigation
Divisionâs system of pumps and canals that provide water, primarily to rice farmers, downstream
of Austin. LCRA began acquiring the systems in the early 1960s.
The project consists of replacing two of five discharge pipes that run from the pumps within the
plant to the gates at the canal head. All five discharge gates will be replaced. The work will
consist of excavating the ground above the pipes to be replaced, and conducting welding and
other work necessary to replace the gates (Figure 230). There is no federal funding or permitting
known or anticipated for this project.
Because there will be ground disturbance and alterations to a historic-aged structure, a cultural
resources assessment was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resource Services staff on July 24, 2013.
The work was conducted under LCRAâs annual blanket permit 6443 and within the terms of the
Memorandum of Understanding between LCRA and THC. The assessment consisted of a file
search and records review.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no archaeological sites are recorded in the
vicinity of the project area. All excavation will take place within previously disturbed fill located
between the pump plant building and the headwall (Figure 231). In the opinion of LCRAâs
cultural resource staff, there is no need for any archaeological field investigations.
According to engineering drawings on file at LCRA, the plant was originally designed in 1937 to
include three pumps, and thus three suction and discharge pipes. By 1939 the plans had been
revised to include five pumps, and that same year one of the discharge gates had already
malfunctioned, requiring a replacement. The plant was therefore operating by 1939.
According to a long-time LCRA employee the present gates are original to the plant, although
they have been repaired and otherwise modified over time (Figure 232). The gates have therefore
reached the end of their lifespan and must be replaced. The new gates will be the same size but
somewhat different in appearance. They will be the same as those used on the Lane City pumping
plant near Wharton (Figure 233).
Because the project is not subject to federal review, and the pump plant structure is not listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, it is not eligible for review under the Antiquities Code of
392

Texas. LCRA therefore recommends that the project be allowed to proceed without additional
cultural resource coordination, with the understanding that standard emergency discovery
procedures will be in place.

Project 44.13: STP Canal Rehab Project
County: Matagorda
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: September 2013

LCRA proposes to rehabilitate a 2.2-mile-long portion of an existing canal located near the South Texas
Nuclear Project in Matagorda County (Figure 234, Figure 235). The project consists of mechanized
removal of trees and other vegetation along the canalâs levees, raising the levees to their original height or
higher, and replacing an existing pipe flume that runs over a drainage ditch with one of greater capacity
(Figure 236, Figure 237). A final element consists of replacing an open connection to the STNP system
on the east end of the project area with a larger capacity flume within an underground bore (see Figure
235). There is no known or anticipated federal funding or permitting associated with this project.
Because of the potential for ground disturbance a cultural resources assessment was conducted by LCRA
Cultural Resources staff. The assessment consisted of a map and file review.
According to the Archeological Sites Atlas there are no recorded archaeological sites within or near the
project area. Ground disturbance will be limited to the previously disturbed levee embankment and the
highway crossing. An analysis of geology and soils indicates a very low potential for buried cultural
materials to be present. The geology is mapped as Beaumont formation clays, and the soil is described as
Labelle silt loam with a six inch organic (Ap) horizon over a series of Bt horizons.
Although this project is exempt from federal review, this letter also serves as notification of modification
to historic structures. According to LCRA personnel familiar with the canal system, the canal was built
prior to the 1940s. The total canal width, including the levee embankment, is 100 feet. The pipe flume,
essentially a corrugated metal culvert, will be replaced with similar construction.
Because the project is not subject to federal review, and canal and associated pipe flume structure is not
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is not eligible for review under the Antiquities Code
of Texas. LCRA therefore recommends that the project be allowed to proceed without additional cultural
resource coordination, with the understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in
place.

Project 45.13: Cultural Resources Assessment of 6.8-Acre Equipment Laydown Area for
LCRAâs Kenedy Switch â Nixon â Seguin Transmission Line Upgrade Project
County: Karnes
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: September 2013

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is planning to upgrade its T-540 electrical transmission
line as a part of the larger Kenedy Switch to Nixon to Seguin Transmission Line Upgrade Project. A draft
cultural resource survey report for the first segment of the T-540 line that was field surveyed for cultural
resources was mailed to your office in late August 2013 and is currently under review by your staff.
Additional portions of the transmission line upgrade will be field surveyed and reported to your office as
more precise information about the project becomes available. In the meantime, the LCRA staff has
determined that an approximately 6.8-acre sized equipment laydown area will be needed for the T-540
portion of the project. The proposed equipment laydown area is located about 1.25 miles southeast of the
Helena community in central Karnes County, Texas (Figure 238). The laydown area is located
immediately northeast of State Highway 81 on sloping ground that descends to the head of a dry gully.
A cultural resources assessment consisting of a map and file review was conducted by LCRA cultural
resources staff in September 2013, under terms of the State Antiquities Code, the Memorandum of
Understanding between THC and LCRA, and TAC Annual Blanket Permit 6443. No federal permitting or
funding is known or anticipated.
According to the Historic Sites Atlas there are no recorded archeological sites are located within or near
the proposed equipment laydown area. The file search also indicated that the project area has not ever
been surveyed by professional archaeologists. The 1987 Helena, Texas 7.5â USGS map shows that the
closest water source is an intermittent unnamed tributary of the San Antonio River that lies from 1,400 to
2,300 feet west of the equipment laydown area. Based on the distance from a water source and the slope
of the land, the LCRA Cultural Resource team assesses the area as having a low probability for any
Native American archaeological sites.
No buildings or structures are depicted within or near the proposed equipment laydown area on the 1987
Helena, Texas 7.5â USGS map, nor are any shown on earlier dating historic topographic maps consisting
of the 1960 Helena, Texas 7.5â USGS map and the 1909 Kenedy, Texas U. S. Army Corps of Engineers
Tactical Map which has a scale of 1:125,000. It should be pointed out that a fair number of individual
houses are plotted elsewhere on the 1909 map which suggests that a serious effort was made to plot such
buildings on this map. The LCRA Cultural Resource team assesses the project area as having a low
probability for any historic period sites based on the map review and the topography of the project area.

402

In the opinion of LCRA Cultural Resource team the proposed laydown yard is an area of low probability
for containing cultural resources eligible for formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks. Therefore,
LCRA requests your concurrence that the project may proceed without additional cultural resource
investigations, with the understanding that if unexpected buried cultural material is discovered then work
will cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Cultural Resource team will be contacted
so that a determination can be made in consultation with your office as to whether any avoidance
measures or mitigation work is needed.

Project 53.13: Proposed construction of LCRAâs new Benedum Substation
County: Upton
Type of Investigation: File search
Date of Investigation: December 2013

LCRA proposes to construct a new substation on 5 acres of land located in eastern Upton County, Texas.
The substation will be built underneath LCRAâs existing T-441 Midkiff-to-Crane transmission line and
will be owned by LCRA. There will be an access road consisting of an existing 12-ft-wide ranch road that
will be widened to 35 ft along its approximate 1,500 ft length, for a total of about 1.2 acres. The total
project area, therefore, is approximately 6.2 acres (Figure 239).
The project area is within an active oilfield. The nearest city is the community of Midkiff, located 11 mi
to the north. Geologically it is mapped as late Pleistocene Aeolian deposits. Soils are mapped as a vast
expanse Rader fine sandy loam, which have a combined 14-inch A horizon over eluviated and successive
B horizons. The nearest water source is High Lonesome Draw, located about 1,000 m to the southwest.
On the Geologic Atlas of Texas it is called Centralia Draw and is depicted with a narrow band of
Holocene alluvium along it.
The transmission line was surveyed by Hicks and Company under TAC Permit 2889 in 2002, prior to a
major transmission line rebuilding effort by LCRA (Karbula et al. 2002). The project area was not
considered to be within a high probability area. Hicksâ high probability area Segment 10 crossed High
Lonesome Draw and extended to within about 500 m of the present project area. No archeological sites
were recorded in this segment.
A review of THCâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas shows the nearest recorded site as 41UT43, described
as a heavily disturbed, surficial burned rock deposit, a little over 5 km away on a small tributary to High
Lonesome Draw. No sites are recorded in setting similar to the project area.
Because the project area is in a location previously assessed as having a low probability for cultural
resources, and the distance from communities making historic sites very unlikely (with none shown on
the 1970 Lindsey Ranch USGS quad), it is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed, with the
understanding that standard emergency procedures will be in place.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl

Lake Buchanan is an artificial reservoir created in 1937 by the construction of Buchanan Dam across the
Colorado River 50 miles upstream from Austin (Figure 240). Lake Buchanan was the first of a chain of
reservoirs, which came to be known as the Highland Lakes, that were built by the Lower Colorado River
Authority (LCRA) for water storage, flood control, and hydroelectricity. At the time of its impoundment,
Lake Buchanan was the largest fresh water body of water in the state, covering 22,333 acres within the
Colorado River valley in the Texas Hill Country (Figure 241). Periods of drought have caused the lake to
drop as much as 36 ft below its full pool level of 1020 ft above mean sea level (msl), exposing large areas
of lakebed. During the most recent drought cycle, which began in 2011 and continues to this day, LCRA
staff have conducted archaeological surveys of exposed lakebed owned by LCRA. The following report
presents the results of these and earlier drought-related surveys dating back to the year 2000.
Before impoundment of the lake, the area appeared as a basin with a low rolling topography hemmed in
on the north, south, and east by steep cedar-covered hills (Figure 242 and Figure 243). The Colorado
River flowed along the east side of the basin in a series of meanders. Prior to construction of the State
Highway 29 bridge in the early automobile era, the frequent river shoals or shallows were used as fords,
with human- or mule-powered ferries on deeper stretches. Small farms and ranches dotted both sides of
the river. The numerous tree stumps seen on the shorelines when the lake level is low indicate that the
basin was wooded, probably not unlike the surrounding ranchland today. The tops of submerged trees
poke out of the water in the vicinity of the river channel when the lake is low, remnants of a riparian
forest that grew along some stretches of the river, while old photos show other stretches completely
cleared for farmland or pasture. Within one of the riverâs larger meanders lay Bluffton, the only town that
would have to be vacated because of construction of the Highland Lakes reservoirs.
Prior to impoundment, archaeological surveys and excavations were conducted in the basin of Lake
Buchanan by the University of Texas under the direction of J. E. Pearce (Jackson 1938). Nine prehistoric
campsites were excavated, including those around the base of Fall Creek Falls, one of the largest
waterfalls on the river. Fifteen years later, during the drought of record of the early 1950s, no
investigations were done by professional archaeologists despite the lake reaching its all time low of 983 ft
msl. When lake levels dropped again during a drought in the early 1960s, a few minor archaeological
investigations were carried out (Tunnell and Newcomb 1962, Davis 1962, Crawford 1965). Severe
erosion was reported by this time, with 30 cm or more of soil along the shore having been washed away
by waves. For nearly 25 years afterwards, the lake remained mostly full except for a brief period in the
mid 1980s. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, drought has been a more common occurrence
and lake levels have remained mostly 3 m (10 ft) or more below the full pool elevation.
One hundred and sixty-seven cultural resource sites have been formally recorded at Lake Buchanan below
the full pool elevation. Less than half of these were recorded in 1937 and were soon covered by the rising
waters of the impounded river. Most of these early sites have never been exposed since that time, being
situated at low elevations adjacent to the river channel.
410

In the last 14 years, LCRAâs Cultural Resources Division staff has surveyed 1,450 acres of the lakebed
exposed along the shoreline. Seventy-nine new cultural resource sites were recorded and six previously
recorded sites were revisited. These recent surveys have benefited from the unusually high visibility
offered by the eroded shorelines, revealing sites that were all but invisible in 1937. This erosion has also
had detrimental effects to the integrity (preservation) of the sites, which will be discussed in detail in this
report. The current surveys were mostly conducted at a reconnaissance level, meaning that they relied on
surface inspection with little subsurface testing. The extensive erosion and lack of vegetation on the
shoreline has provided excellent ground surface visibility. In the southern half of the lake, these newlyrecorded sites, mostly prehistoric campsites, all lie a considerable distance from the river channel, usually
along the few perennial streams that enter the lake from the east and west, and at the upper branches of
small drainages, which are particularly numerous. That campsites, sometimes relatively large, should
occupy such areas is a strong indication that springs or seeps were active.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl

Physiography
Lake Buchanan is located within the southern end of the Central Texas section of the Great Plains
province (Fenneman 1931:54-59). Lake Buchanan also lies within the region of Texas known as the
Central Mineral Region which is so-named because of the presence of diverse rocks and minerals
including quartz, granite, gneiss, schist, chert, feldspar, limestone and sandstone (Raisz 1957). In
particular, the pink granite and unique exposures of Llanite, with its unusual blue quartz, are well known
to rock collectors and other enthusiasts. The Lake Buchanan area is more frequently associated with the
eco-region called the Llano Uplift (Figure 244). The area is called an uplift due to the raised elevations of
Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks that are buried elsewhere in Texas. These ancient formations were
covered by later-dating sedimentary strata, which were subsequently eroded to the extent that some of
uppermost igneous and metamorphic rock formations were exposed. One prominent Precambrian
exposure is Enchanted Rock, which is a large granite dome that rises 425 ft and covers about 640 acres. It
is located far distant from Lake Buchanan, however, near the southern end of the Llano Uplift.

Geology
Lake Buchanan is located just within the eastern edge of the Llano Uplift (Figure 245), a circular dome of
Precambrian rock, primarily the Town Mountain granite that is surrounded by outer rings of gneiss and
schist, which are also Precambrian (Barnes 1981). These geologic exposures are, in turn, surrounded by
other uplifted Paleozoic strata that include limestone and sandstone. An ancient history of geological
faulting along with the differential erosion rates for the varied rock formations have resulted in
topography well-suited for engineering a large reservoir. The Colorado River has cut narrow canyons in
the sedimentary rock which is more resistant to erosion than granite. Erosion has been more widespread
over the granite areas, creating an immense basin drained by the Colorado River, which skirts its eastern
edge. With the construction of Buchanan Dam, the flow of the river on the downstream side of the basin
was blocked, creating an extensive but relatively shallow lake, bordered by limestone ridges to the east
and allowed to spread westwards across the rolling granite landscape.
The following paragraphs describe the basic surface rock types found beneath lake ordered by the
geological age of the associated formations. The modern geological map for the region (Barnes 1981) was
surveyed after the impoundment of the lake and therefore does not show the geology beneath the
reservoir. Data used to create the Figure 245 map comes primarily from a 1911 geological map (United
States. Dept. of the Interior 1911).

415

Gneiss
Valley Spring Gneiss, the oldest Precambrian rock formation in the state at over one billion years,
outcrops around the southeast corner of the lake (Barnes 1981). In this area, the surface gneiss is pink in
color and composed of quartz and feldspar minerals in thin leaf-like layers or foliation. Buchanan Dam
was built into this strong, dense rock, which in hardness rivals that of granite. The two rock types appear
similar to the untrained eye because they are mostly composed of same types of minerals, feldspar and
quartz. The feldspar minerals predominate and lend the rock a pinkish color. Gneiss in a type
metamorphic rock, more specifically a paragneiss, which means it was formed from sedimentary rock.
Schist
Nearly as ancient as the gneiss are the various types of schist distributed across the Llano Uplift region
and collectively called Packsaddle Schist (Barnes 1981). Schist does not outcrop within Lake Buchanan
but small clasts of this rock are transported into the lakebed along streams. Graphite schist, one of the
more common types in the area, is readily indentified by its dark gray color.
Granite
Dating to about one billion years ago, the Town Mountain granite is the most extensive surface rock
under the lake, covering nearly two-thirds of the lakebed (Barnes 1981). Much of the granite rock near the
surface has decomposed into grus, unconsolidated mineral grains of feldspar, quartz, and mica retaining
the basic structure of the original rock. The primary agent of this decomposition is chemical weathering
known as hydrolysis. The rate of hydrolysis increases with an increase in temperature and precipitation.
While most of the surface granite grus has eroded into loose gravels, consolidated granite cobbles are
frequent in the form of core-stones â large clasts of residual rock (Figure 246). These core-stones
provided ready material for hot rock cooking. Castle tors, spherically rounded outcrops and boulders are
also part of the local granite landscape (Figure 247), as are granite domes that weather by exfoliation.
Both types of formations provided material not only for cooking stones but also as surfaces for grinding
plant seeds.
Sandstone
Sandstone covers most of the north end of the lake between Morgan Creek and Willow Slough at the
north end of Canyon of the Eagles (Figure 248). These rocks belong to the Cambrian-era Riley formation,
which has two sandstone members: the Lion Mountain Sandstone and the Hickory Sandstone. The latter
rock is distinctly dark red from the hematite that cements its sand grains and even in its natural state
appears burned (Sellards et al. 1932:57).
Limestone
Limestone formations are found at the extreme north end of the lake. These limestone formations are
much more ancient than Cretaceous rocks of the surrounding Edwards Plateau, belonging to the Paleozoic

era. The San Saba member of the Wilberns formation occurs immediately north of the sandstone zone
(Sellards et al. 1932:58-59). This is the type of rock found at Fall Creek Falls and can erode into
spectacular rockshelters such as White Bluff on the east side of the lake. Further north outcrop slightly
younger (but still Paleozoic) limestone and dolomite formations of the Ellenburger Group.
Pleistocene Fluviatile Terrace Deposits and Holocene Alluvium
Holocene alluvium and possibly some Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits would be found adjacent to
the river in places that have remained inundated since 1937. These deposits should also occur along the
streams and would therefore have a chance of being exposed during droughts. The 1911 geological map
(US Department of Interior 1911) only depicts bedrock geology, so the extent of any Holocene deposits is
undetermined. Although some alluvial deposits exist beneath the lake water, they are probably not as
extensive or deep as those found along the Colorado River where it flows through limestone areas
upstream and downstream from the lake. Jackson reported no deep stratified sites in the granite areas of
the lake. However, his finds of several prehistoric chert quarries such as 41LL40 would suggest the
presence of some Pleistocene terrace deposits.
During the current survey, the archaeologists encountered no alluvium along major streams entering the
lake, and in fact no alluvium has been mapped in areas adjacent to the shoreline. Small patches of
Holocene alluvium are mapped further upstream on the north and south forks of Morgan Creek east of the
lake. Other patches of Holocene alluvium and some Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits are present
along the flanks of the Colorado River downstream of Inks Lake, and other alluvial deposits show in a
few spots on the nearby Llano River. Site 41LL40 and newly recorded site 41LL557 both have large

420

quantities of chert cobbles strewn over the south terrace slope of Horseshoe Bend peninsula. However,
both of these sites are heavily deflated.

Soils
The soils beneath the lake have not been formally mapped by the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, but they can be reconstructed by considering the underlying geology and slope. Three soil series
would be prevalent in areas underlain by granite grus: Lou, Click, and Voca series (Goerdel 2000). These
soils form a catena, related soils whose slight differences are attributed to their different slope positions.
Click soils generally occur near the top of the slope, Lou series at mid slope, and Voca on the nearly level
areas at the base of the slope.
The profile of Lou soils consists of a 7 inch-thick surface layer of brown coarse sandy loam over a
subsurface layer of similar thickness composed of brown gravelly coarse sandy loam. (Goerdel 2000) The
subsoil consists of an 8 inch-thick zone of reddish brown gravelly coarse sandy loam over an 18 inchthick zone of yellowish red gravelly sandy clay loam. Click soils have an 1inch-thick surface layer of
brown very gravelly coarse sandy loam. The subsoil consists of a 7 inch âthick zone of yellowish red very
gravelly coarse sandy loam over 11 inches of red very gravelly sandy clay loam over 17 inches of light
red very gravelly coarse sandy loam.
The north end of the lake is underlain by sandstone and limestone, over which a different group of soils
has formed. These include the Nebgen and Yates soils in the Tow area, and the Nuvalde and Luckenbach
soils in the Tow Village area immediately to the north.
Streams and drainages
A large number of small streams drain into Lake Buchanan, and their confluences with the Colorado
River are now inundated by the reservoir. Only three of these streams can be considered perennial; these
are Calvert Creek entering the lake from the northwest at Tow, Beaver Creek, entering from the northeast
below Canyon of the Eagles, and Morgan Creek whose two branches enter from the east join at the
shoreline. Before impoundment, the united Morgan Creek flowed in an easterly direction for two miles
before entering the river at Horseshoe bend.
For the purposes of this report, two other streams entering from the west, Campground Creek and
Redrock Creek are considered intermittent streams. Both have a continuous flow for much of the year
with their channels running for about four miles. The other streams entering the lake are all much smaller
than the two intermittent streams and are best described as ephemeral. Water flows only for short periods
after rains and the entire length of the channels is usually less than two miles.
Vegetation
The vegetation of the Llano Uplift is a mixture of species found in surrounding regions. These include the
live oak common in the Edwards Plateau to the east and south, the post oak and black jack oak common
421

to the Cross timbers to the north, and catclaw acacia and soaptree yucca common to West Texas (Griffith
et al. 2004).
The region was once a mosaic of woodland and savanna, but fire suppression and overgrazing has
encouraged the spread of woody vegetation into the grasslands. The upland areas inundated by Lake
Buchanan were once mostly wooded as evidenced by the numerous tree stumps exposed by the drought.
Most of these stumps appear to be either cedar (ashe juniper) or oak.

CHAPTER 3: HISTORIC BACKGROUND
By Daniel J. Prikryl

The history of the Lake Buchanan area has been described in detail by Yarbrough (n.d.) in his publication
entitled Canyon of the Eagles â A History of Lake Buchanan and Official Guide to the Vanishing Texas
River Cruise. Additional data comes from various entries found in The Handbook of Texas Online. The
historic background summary that follows relies heavily on data from these two sources.
During the early Spanish Colonial Period, the Hill Country northeast of San Antonio was generally
avoided by the Spanish except for occasional military expeditions against the Apaches and other hostile
Indians. In 1753, during an expedition to determine a good location to build a mission for the Apaches,
Lt. Juan Galvan heard from Indians of a hill of red ocher, which the Apaches used as face paint. At that
time, the Spanish associated ochre deposits with silver ore due to their co-occurrence at mines in Mexico.
Word spread and soon some private citizens from San Antonio began prospecting for silver at a site called
Los Almagres, which means ochre in Spanish. Spanish officials in San Antonio became aware of Los
Almagres and in 1756 sent an exploratory party under Bernando de Miranda y Flores to investigate the
claims and take samples of the ore. Mirandaâs party was led by to the Los Almagres mine, located on a
hill near a steam now called Honey Creek in Llano County. This location in about 10 miles southwest of
Buchanan Dam (Yarbrough n.d.; Weddle 2012).
Only minute traces of silver were extracted from the ore, and Spanish officials quickly lost interest in the
Los Almagres mine. By the Mexican Period, the location of the mine was lost and treasure hunters began
to confuse the mine area with the area around the Spanish presidio at Menard. The general location of the
mine was rediscovered in the early 1900s by University of Texas historian Herbert E. Bolton using
Mirandaâs original journal. The reality is that there may be extremely small amounts of silver and gold in
the Llano Uplift rock formations, but none that is economically feasible to mine. No Spanish or Mexican
period artifacts have ever been found by professional archaeologists in or around the mine or elsewhere in
the vicinity of Lake Buchanan.
The first recorded permanent settlers in the immediate Lake Buchanan area were David Cowan and his 12
extended family members (Yarbrough n.d.; Heckert-Greene 2012). Cowan and family established their
home at the location of a salt spring on the west side of the Colorado River in 1852. Their homestead
became the core of a community called Colorado Saline.
Cowan utilized the salt spring to start a saltworks business. Salt was obtained by boiling the salty water in
large kettles. At the peak of its operation there were 26 kettles, each of which held 250 gallons. These
were filled with brine water and fires were kept burning beneath the kettles until all the water had boiled
away leaving only the salt. A great deal of labor was needed to keep the wood cut for the fires, water in
the kettles, and salt emptied out of them. Most settlers who came into the area worked at the saltworks
until they could get a start at securing land and starting a farm. During the Civil War, the operation
became known as the Confederate States of America Saltworks. It was destroyed by a tornado in 1871
(Yarbrough n.d.:15-16; Heckert-Greene 2012)
423

Another early family was the Davis family who settled at Horseshoe Bend in 1853. After a grist mill was
constructed at Horseshoe Bend near the Davis family homes in 1857, that area became known as Bluffton
and by 1859 the communityâs name appeared on the first Llano County map. Their extended family
included Isaac Maxwell, who as a member of the Texas legislature in the 1880s, led the movement to
have the new state capitol building constructed of red granite from Llano County (Yarbrough n.d.:33).
The Morgan family was also among the early settlers in the same vicinity. John Morgan first worked at
the saltworks and then opened a hat factory where he made highly distinctive hats from the skins of
beavers and other animals. William and Mary Tow also arrived in the area in 1853, settling on Fall Creek.
Their family included three sets of twins. The current Tow community is named for this family (HeckertGreene 2012).
The first historic period activities in Burnet County on the east side of Lake Buchanan centered around
the area that later became the town of Burnet. In 1847, a Texas Ranger Company established a station
about three miles south of the future townsite. In 1848, the station became a federal fort called Fort
Croghan and was moved to the Burnet townsite, which was originally called Hamilton (Smyrl 2012).
Burnet County was organized in 1854 and in 1856 the Texas Legislature created Llano, San Saba and
Lampasas counties.
Early economic activities in Burnet and Llano counties consisted of subsistence farming and stock
raising. In Llano County, for example, there were 89 farms by 1860. That year the agricultural census
reported 21,344 cattle and 1,492 sheep in the county. The principal agricultural crop was corn with over
23,500 bushels being reported.
In the late 1850s, Indians, primarily the Comanche, were routinely stealing horses in Burnet, Llano and
San Saba counties. During the Civil War, when many men were away in the Confederate army, the Indian
menace was very prevalent. They killed a number of settlers, and it was not until 1874 that the threat of
Indians raids was over. The last fight between the settlers and the Indians in this area occurred in 1873 on
Packsaddle Mountain.
Like all of Texas, the economy of Burnet and Llano counties suffered during Reconstruction. Because
Bluffton was on one of the feeder trails during the great cattle drives of the 1870s and early 1880s, the
commercial businesses in the town prospered from visiting cowboys during the cattle drives. However,
these visitors often clashed with local cowboys in saloons and elsewhere. The conflicts led to the burning
of several buildings in the town and a final fire in 1883 that destroyed most the original townsite. In 1883,
the town was rebuilt further to the south and the location of a new county road that was being built
through the county.
In 1882, the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was constructed from Austin to Burnet. The track was
extended to Granite Mountain, Marble Falls, and Llano in the next 10 years. The quarrying of granite
became a big industry in the Marble Falls area, and a major graphite mining operation was established on
the east side of the future Lake Buchanan area in the 1910s.

424

In the late nineteenth century, cotton production increased in both counties, but corn continued to be the
principal farm crop. Llano Countyâs economy declined in the first decades of the twentieth century after
the prospects of iron mining proved negative and cotton production declined. During the Depression,
prices for agricultural products plummeted and residents in both counties suffered. The construction of
the LCRA dams on the Colorado River provided jobs to many men, as did federal programs including the
Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Youth Administration.
After World War II, cattle and hog production were important to Llano Countyâs economy in the 1950s
and 1960s as was the wool production from Angora goats. In Burnet County, much farm land was put
into pasture for cattle grazing. Small farms and sharecropping declined as larger farms and ranches
became more economically feasible.

CHAPTER 4: PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
By Charles A. Hixson and Andrew F. Malof

The indigenous peoples of the Llano Uplift region are known to us only through the archaeological
record. By the time the earliest Spanish expeditions, the region and surrounding portions of the Edwards
Plateau had become depopulated except for an occasional band of Apaches, and even they could be
scarce. Miranda, in a 1756 expedition to the Los Almagres mines about ten miles southwest of Lake
Buchanan, resorted to smoke signals to attract Apaches without success. The fate of the original
aboriginal people is undetermined, although some may have entered the Spanish mission system while
others were assimilated or annihilated by the Apaches. Even if we were better informed of the contactperiod people, we still could not necessarily rely on their information to interpret sites and artifacts
thousands of years old.
The archaeological record of central Texas contains little evidence of agriculture, and this part of state
was apparently inhabited by hunter-gatherers throughout the prehistoric period. The term âhuntergathererâ refers to a subsistence mode that relies almost exclusively on hunting, fishing, and the gathering
of wild plant foods (Painter-Brick 2001). Very late in the era of central Texas hunter-gatherers, some use
of corn and other cultigens was probably made, either by intrusive semi-agricultural groups or obtained
from exchange with food-producing regions to the east. Prehistoric corn remains have been reported from
only two central Texas archaeological sites, a rockshelter in Bosque County (Jelks 1962) and another
shelter in Hays County (Harris 1985). Cultigen use by indigenous peoples of central Texas must have
been of short duration and perhaps only important in the extreme northeastern part of the region (Shafer
2006). Jackson (1938) does report finding two corncobs in a small rockshelter at the Fall Creek sites
(either 41SS2 or 41LL4), although he felt they were probably recent.
Much of our understanding of how prehistoric hunter-gatherers lived has come from comparisons with
ethnographically-known hunter-gatherers, the presumption being that modern hunter-gatherers are âliving
fossilsâ that retain certain cultural traits of our distant prehistoric ancestors. There is a strong cultural
evolutionary aspect to this reasoning in that it assumes all peoples progress through similar cultural
stages, regardless of geography and history. One influential model of human settlement and subsistence
strategies derived from ethnographic observations is Lewis Binfordâs (1980) collector/forager spectrum.
He uses the term âforagersâ to label groups who move together from resource to resource, and the term
âcollectorsâ for those who establish base camps from where various resource acquisition expeditions are
staged. It assumes that all hunter-gatherers must fall somewhere along the spectrum between foragers at
the low end of social complexity and collectors at the high end.
Much regional archaeological work involves interpreting the archaeological record in terms of human
behavior within a chronological framework based on one or more cultural traits. Several frameworks or
chronologies for ordering the past have been proposed for the Central Texas Archaeological Region
(Prewitt 1981, Johnson and Goode 1994, Collins 1998). Archaeologists in the mid twentieth century
viewed human culture as a series of shared traits â what came to be called the normative model â and
each of these archaeological regions were defined and set apart from the others by a list of cultural traits
426

that for Texas included projectile point styles and other aspects of material culture. Within each of these
regions, cultural traits were classified using the Midwestern Taxonomic system, later modified to consider
temporal aspects. This classification system was eventually replaced by a chronological sequence of
âphasesâ, originally defined by Phillips and Willey (1953) as archaeological manifestations that
correspond to human societies. Each phase consisted of an assemblage of traits that distinguished it from
others both spatially and temporally. Weir (1976) used this system to propose a chronological sequence of
phases for the Central Texas Archaic, later elaborated on by Prewitt (1981). The chronological ordering
of such âarchaeologicalâ cultures, known as culture history, was the main paradigm of archaeological
thought into the 1960s (Lyman et al. 1997).
Most of the data used to create the chronological frameworks proposed for central Texas have come from
stratified sites to the east of Lake Buchanan. These sites occur in the Blackland Prairie (Prewitt 1981),
Balcones Canyonlands (Johnson 1995), and the Lampasas Cut Plains (Collins 1998). The Collins
chronology is a refinement of the one proposed by Johnson and Goode (1994) which is derived from
earlier ones such as Prewittâs (1981). All these frameworks start with the three cultural evolutionary
periods used for North American prehistory based to a large extent on subsistence patterns. âPaleoindianâ
and âArchaicâ are terms universally used for the earliest of the three periods while âLate Prehistoricâ is
now commonly used to name the last of the prehistoric periods in central Texas, although other terms
have been applied.
The Late Prehistoric, or at least the first part of this period, presents problems in that subsistence practices
differ little if at all from those of the preceding Archaic. In fact, it could be said that central Texas saw no
significant changes in subsistence practices from the first known cultural group (Clovis) all the way up to
the historic period. Generalized hunting and gathering characterized all periods with two possible
exceptions: the early Paleoindian Folsom culture and the Toyah interval in the latter half of the Late
Prehistoric (Collins 1998). Both possessed toolkits thought to be specialized for hunting and processing
large animals, although this view is not universal, and there is evidence that generalized hunter-gathering
persisted through the Late Prehistoric (Dering 2008). While generalized hunting and gathering may have
prevailed throughout central Texas prehistory, this does not mean that the social and political systems
remained static. For example, there were times when central Texas peoples participated in interregional
exchange networks (Hall 1981).
The three main prehistoric periods are further divided into subperiods which are defined by finer
distinctions in subsistence patterns. These subperiods were divided by Prewitt into phases which
essentially denote archaeological cultures, but as originally used by Phillips and Willey (1953) correspond
to actual societies. Many researchers have questioned if there is sufficient evidence to define phases at all
for central Texas prehistory and point out that archaeological cultures do not always equate to real
societies. (Johnson 1986). For the Archaic, most archaeologists today prefer to use projectile point style
intervals as time markers within the established subperiods (Collins 1995).
Criticisms of the concept of a cultural region have focused on the environmental diversity present in many
of these regions, especially central Texas (e.g., Ellis et al. 1995). Influenced by Julian Stewardâs (1955)
cultural ecology, some archaeologists since the 1960s have viewed the environment as playing a major
role in shaping human culture, contending that culture acts as a self-regulating system allowing human
427

groups to adapt to a changing environment. The unique physical properties of the Llano Uplift along with
the relative dearth of site information provide a set of opportunities beyond the simple recording and
assessment of prehistoric sites. Are granitic burned rock middens truly rare? To what extent are base
camps present? Can the common lithic scatter be placed into systemic (if not temporal) context? Do such
sites exhibit internal or extra-site patterning distinguishable from surrounding physiographic zones?
Potter (2006) cites Butterwick (1979) in noting the presence of black walnut, post oak and blackjack oak,
three nut-bearing trees that are present as island species in the Uplift; in other words, they are uncommon
in the surrounding portions of the Edwards Plateau. This is significant because as Potter, citing Rector
(1996), states, the blackjack oak has a much higher protein and fat content than the live oaks typical of the
Plateau, and are even higher than the black oak of California, well-demonstrated to have been a staple
food for late hunter-gatherers in that region (Potter 2006:3). The coarse sandy soils of the Uplift make the
presence of these species possible. The Llano region claims itself to be the âDeer Capitol of Texas,â
perhaps for good reason. Potter extrapolates on the potential processing capabilities of the recorded
groundstone features along Sandy Creek in Enchanted Rock State Park, demonstrating that if they were
all in use at a single time they could support fairly large populations. Considering that deer would in
general be in turn well fed and presumably present in fairly high numbers, especially in the fall when the
acorns are ripe, these two food sources would create a compelling reason for humans to establish
themselves within or near the uplift, at least on a seasonal basis.
Using Binfordâs (1980) collector/forager spectrum, Potter suggests the mortar sites at Enchanted Rock are
suggestive of a collecting strategy (Potter 2006:14). The indication that the mortars along Sandy Creek
have the potential to produce almost 1.5 tons of acorn flour in a single day certainly suggests a large and
hungry population, but more probably smaller groups taking advantage of seasonal abundance. Surplus in
production, beyond the socio-political implications, would require some sort of storage. Storage could be
accomplished with the use of baskets or other archaeologically invisible means. Another possibility is the
use of in-ground storage pits. Two pits at 41BT60 at Inks Lake State Park (Drake 1996) were interpreted
as cooking features, and as described it sounds as if that is the most reasonable explanation. A brief search
of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas suggests that storage pits in Texas have been recognized only in
areas with agriculture and semi-sedentary to sedentary populations (i.e. the Caddo area, the
Panhandle/Plains, far west Texas). Despite this, it useful to at least acknowledge the potential for storage
systems within Central Texas hunter-gatherer realm, and be prepared to consider appropriate analytical
methods if such are found (e. g. Kent 1999; Whelan et. al 2013).

CHAPTER 5: PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl

Early Investigations
In 1932, A. T. Jackson led the first archaeological investigations in areas that that were later inundated by
Lake Buchanan (Jackson 1932). These involved explorations and excavations within three caves on the
Mack Yates Ranch in the rocky bluffs surrounding Fall Creek Falls in San Saba County. The site was
later given two trinomials, 41SS2 and 41LL4, because the county line runs through it. Cave #1 lies at one
end of a rockshelter within 145 m of three burned rock middens. This cave and rockshelter had the
deepest deposits of the three â up to 70 inches (178 cm) thick â with at least one âfire pitâ and one poorlypreserved human burial. Cultural material included debitage, burned rock, and mussel shell. These sites
were extensively excavated five years later by the University of Texas before impoundment of the lake.

1937 Basin of Lake Buchanan Investigations
As Buchanan Dam was nearing completion, J. E. Pearce, head of the Anthropology Department of the
University of Texas in Austin, acquired WPA funding to excavate sites that would be flooded by the
reservoir. A. T. Jackson was made the field archaeologist for the project, with A. M. Woolsey supervising
the 20 relief workers from Austin who excavated the sites. While sites were being excavated by
Woolseyâs crew, Jackson conducted an archaeological survey of the basin and was sometimes involved in
the excavations. Pearce visited the project area occasionally (Jackson 1938).
Jacksonâs survey of the basin was the first intensive large scale archaeological survey done in the state
(Figure 249). The primary purpose of Jacksonâs survey was to locate sites with sufficiently dense cultural
material for excavation by Woolsey and his team. Although not explicitly stated by Jackson, he appears to
have been interested in the geographic patterning of site types. To this end, site locations and settings
were recorded and typology of site types was established. Jacksonâs sites types included: (1) mound, (2)
village or campsite, (3) shelter or cave, and (4) quarry or workshop. Within his mound type are sites that
contain burned rock middens, but this type also includes sites with dense camping debris on natural rises.
This can lead to some confusion in that a mound can refer to two different types of archaeological
deposits. It is also unclear what his criteria were for classifying a site as a village (or campsite) and how
this type of site differs from a midden site. His workshop site type seems to be the same as a lithic scatter
which he groups with quarry, locales where chert was procured and early-stage tool manufacture took
place. Jacksonâs methods of recording involved description, mapping, and surface collecting artifacts. For
some sites, photographs were taken.
Jackson surveyed the western or Llano County side of the basin in the first half of 1937, where a total of
52 sites were recorded. He concluded that sites were usually situated on elevated terraces 50 to 200 yards
from the river channel near the junction of a tributary creek. Sites were also situated adjacent to the river
channel within 50 to 200 yards of a rocky promontory even with no nearby tributary creeks. He also noted
429

Figure 249. A. T. Jackson's sites plotted on 1925 USGS Tow quad, and on portions of 1909 Burnet and 1925 Marble
Falls quads. Sites with trinomials are discussed in the text.

430

that even at these apparently favorable locations, sites were absent if deep sands were present. Jackson
(n.d.) also noted the lack of burned rock middens at these sites and offers an explanation:
An outstanding feature of most of them is the absence of burnt-rock mounds,
such as exist in many Central Texas Counties. The explanation of this seems
to be in the scarcity of limestone and abundance of granite, quartz, sandstone
and other stones not so well suited as limestone for use in primitive cooking.
Jackson was aware that bedrock mortar holes might be present in the basin and consciously searched rock
outcrops for them (Jackson and Woolsey 1938). He had earlier documented three deep mortars in granite
bedrock in Flagg Creek southwest of the town of Llano. Jacksonâs search resulted in two mortar hole sites
being recorded on the west side of the basin, a single mortar hole in coarse sandstone outcrops at Site No.
9 (41LL5), and eight shallow mortar or metates in a granite boulder at Site No. 50 (41LL16). Jackson was
struck by the large number of manos on these sites, about 25 percent of all surface finds. He notes one
distinctive type of mano, the âedged mano,â which occurs in small numbers at sites across the basin. In
cross-section, they appear wedge shaped, having the appearance of an axe blade but without the edge
wear patterns expected for that type of tool. Metates were proportionally scarce, but considering the large
number of metate fragments seen in hearths on the lakebed today, most were probably recycled in
prehistoric times as hot rock stones. Chert âknivesâ represented five percent of the collection and
projectile points, six percent, low percentages to Jackson who speculated that these classes of artifacts
may have been taken by âcertain amateur collectors.â
Jacksonâs survey of the east side of the basin in Burnet County was not completed because of the rising
lake level. Still, he was able to record 21 sites, most along a five mile stretch of the river south of Morgan
Creek. There was enough time to excavate two of the east side sites: 41BT62, a small rockshelter
containing geometric pictographs, and 41BT10, a prehistoric campsite with burials (Johnson 1997).
While Jackson was involved in the early weeks of his archaeological survey, Woolsey supervised the
excavation of the previously-mentioned sites around Fall Creek Falls. As described above, Jackson had
already excavated several caves around the falls and knew the area contained dense archaeological
deposits.
Woolsey and crew also excavated at least seven other sites: 41SS8, 41LL3, 41LL5, 41LL6, 41LL28,
41BT10 and 41BT62. Woolsey used what was called the broadcast method of excavation, a term usually
referring to the practice of casting or spreading of excavated earth to retrieve artifacts. This was a
common practice in the 1930s before screening became the norm. The actual excavation was
accomplished by digging a trench across one end of a site and then expanding the trench across the site by
shaving a wall with a shovel. This method required the excavator to be alert when an artifact was struck
by the shovel or fell from the wall, so that the depth could be recorded. A notable departure from this
excavation method was tried in a burned rock midden in 41LL4, where a 10 by 10 foot area was troweled
horizontally in 6 inch levels down to bedrock, similar to how exaction excavation is done today. Jackson
(1938) states the reason for using this method was to obtain better vertical control.
Although some attention was paid to stratigraphy, the report that was published the following year mainly
dealt with descriptions of the artifacts recovered during the excavations. A wide array of artifacts were
431

found with the predominant classes being chipped stone and ground stone. In particular, the large
numbers of ground stone manos found during the excavations are noteworthy. Minor artifact classes
included pottery, painted pebbles, carved and scratched stone, boatstones, stone gorgets, obsidian, shell
and bone beads, and bone awls. Features primarily consisted of burned rock middens, individual stonelined hearths, and human burials. An attempt was made to discern chronological differences between
projectile point types based on depth. One of the patterns noted was that âarrowheadsâ (arrow points)
occurred closest to the present ground surface and were therefore the more recent than the various dart
point types. Other chronological assignments are harder to reconcile with present knowledge and could be
explained by a combination of the typology used at the time, excavation methods, and disturbed cultural
deposits.
In summarizing the work, Jackson (1938:117) made the following statements. He noted two major
cultural periods: 1) a combined recent late prehistoric and historic period occupation that shifted rapidly
and, 2) a much longer, earlier occupation by groups that he called the âoriginal occupantsâ of the area. He
stated that there were evidences of âintrusionsâ from the west, east and south as indicated by various
artifact classes that originated from those three areas.

1950s Drought
During the severe drought of the 1950s, a local avocational archaeologist, Albert Field, investigated sites
that had been exposed around the lake (Field 1956). He reported two petroglyphs on a boulder at
Maxwells Slough. Fields also found a steatite tubular pipe at a prehistoric site below White Bluff that is
probably 41BT407, along with an unassociated human crevice burial. Importantly, he noted that erosion
had already exposed many hearths, and that large numbers of artifacts were being collected by relic
hunters.

1960s Drought
On September 12, 1962, Curtis Tunnell and Lathel Duffield of the Texas Memorial Museum made a visit
to Lake Buchanan to record a prehistoric human burial that Daymond Crawford had discovered on the
exposed shoreline. Tunnel found the burial to be badly disturbed by wave action with no artifacts in good
association (Tunnel and Newcomb 1962). This site, with the field id of Site#1, was later given the
trinomial of 41BT71.
During the same visit, Crawford led them to three other sites (now with the trinomials of 41BT72,
41BT73, and 41LL58) on the exposed lakebed where he had seen unusual circular stone features
consisting of a hearth surrounded by smaller piles of rocks. A map drawing was made of 41BT72 that
appears to show four of these circular features in addition to nine other hearths without satellite clusters.
A plan map drawing was made of one of these circular features (Feature #1), showing a central heath with
an approximately 1.83 m diameter surrounded by eight clusters of rocks that have diameters ranging from
49 to 117 cm. Both Fairland dart points and Scallorn arrow point were recovered at the site suggesting

432

that the features dated to either the Transitional Archaic or the Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric, about
AD 200 to 1400.
A few days later, Tunnell, along with University of Texas professor E. Mott Davis, returned to these sites.
They visited 41BT73 where Davis (1962) examined these circular features. One had a large central
burned rock feature surrounded at distances of 90 to 120 cm by five evenly spaced rock clusters. If the
feature represented a structure, then it measured only 2.1 to 2.4 m in total diameter. This led to Davis state
that his ââ¦immediate impression was that of a structure; but the space within the structure was so much
occupied by the central hearth that it is difficult to see how it could have been actually occupied by people
unless perhaps it was something like a sweat lodge.â
Plan map drawings were also made of three features at 41LL58. These had central hearths measuring 1.4
to 1.9 m in diameter, and each had four to six satellite rock clusters. The total diameters of each of the
features were 3.6-x-3.1- m, 5.1-x-4.6-m, and 5.0-x-4.5-m. A photograph of the diagnostic projectile points
from this site suggests a predominance of Scallorn arrow points. Transitional Archaic types such as Ensor
and Fairland are also present. Thus, these structures may well date to the Transitional Archaic or Austin
Phase of the Late Prehistoric.

Figure 250. Archaeological sites recorded during the 1962-64 drought.

433

During the same drought, Crawford discovered a site containing projectile points spanning the Late
Paleoindian and early part of the Early Archaic period. Known as the Granite Beach Site (41LL2), it also
contained at least 51 hearths, some of which had satellite rock clusters similar to those recorded by
Tunnell and Davis (Crawford 1965). The hearths averaged about 122 cm in diameter with a maximum of
122 X 183 cm and a minimum of 36 X 46 cm. If our present understanding of the chronology of central
Texas subsistence technology is correct (Collins 2005), then these features are associated with the Early
Archaic occupations. Other features included a crescent shaped concentration of burned granite rocks 3 m
long and 90 cm) wide, and two piles of granite rocks180cm in diameter and 75 cm above ground. No
excavation was done so the depth of these features is undetermined.

1980s Drought
Apparently no archaeological investigations were done by professional archaeologists during the 1984
drought. A local avocational archaeologist, John Wallin, collected a large number of prehistoric artifacts
from sites exposed along the shoreline. He apparently recorded the locations of many of his finds and
perhaps other details of these sites, but unfortunately the whereabouts of his records are undetermined. A
part of his collection is on view at LCRAâs Nightengale Archaeological Center in Kingsland.

The Lion Creek Site and Turkey Bend Ranch Site
The Lion Creek site, 41BT105, is located about 85 meters east of the east shore of the Lake Buchanan
conservation pool. In 1977, excavations were necessitated by construction of a ranch-to-market road
(Johnson 1997). 41BT105 is one of the very few sites that has been excavated in the Lake Buchanan area
since the WPA/University of Texas excavations of the late 1930s. Work at this site yielded three
examples of the large circular features that appeared similar to those viewed earlier by Tunnell, Duffield
and Davis (Johnson 1997). The two better preserved features were interpreted as representing the remains
of aboriginal houses. Evidence for this hypothesis was greatly aided by the results of excavations at the
Turkey Bend Ranch site at the O. H. Ivie Reservoir near San Angelo, Texas (Treece et al. 1993:204-224).
House 1 at the Lion Creek site had a central burned rock feature that measured 1.8 m in diameter. The
rocks lay in a shallow basin that was 15 cm deep in the center. The central feature was found to be lined
with large flat sandstone rocks on its bottom. These large rocks measured 21 cm in length on average.
Other smaller rocks were found on the surface of these flat stones creating a generally flat-top surface.
The clear space around the central feature in House 1 was 90 to 110 cm wide. The author and the field
crew estimated that 10 smaller rock piles that were present, surrounding the hearth. These smaller rock
piles were presumed to have supported posts that would have been about 20 cm in diameter at their base.
The posts were set 55 to 91 cm apart in a rough circle or oval. The overall structure had an ovoid shape
with a diameter ranging from 4.0 from northwest to southwest and 4.6 m from northeast to southwest.
Johnson states that the builders probably put the wall support posts in shallow holes and then packed the
outlying rock clusters around all sides of the posts. The entrance to the structure appears to be to the
north. Associated diagnostic artifacts were Pedernales and Nolan-Travis dart points.
434

The other feature said to be a definitive house at the Lion Creek site was called House 3. It was the best
preserved example and measured about 4 m in diameter. The central hearth basin had a maximum
diameter of 1.8 m. According to the excavators there was evidence that the aborigines dug a wide basin
into the sandy soil for each of the wall posts. The basins averaged about 1.2 m in diameter and were each
about 30 cm deep. Once the soil was dug out, each basin appeared to have been partially filled with
darker, less sandy soils, which may have aided to reduce the sideways migration of the butt ends of the
posts. Johnson (1997:42) also suggests that the field notes, drawings, and photographs may show some
evidence of a shallow wall trench, which ran in straight lines between the wall posts, connecting them. If
so, the trench could have served to set the wall base below ground surface providing a wind-proof seal.
At the Turkey Bend Ranch, a large feature similar to those previously seen by Tunnell, Duffield and
Davis was uncovered at depths of 12.1 to 12.5 m below ground surface (Treece et al. 1993:204). Adjusted
radiocarbon dates of 7500 +/- 350 BP (Tx-6572) and 7560 +/- 116 BP (Tx-6573) from the central burned
rock hearth placed it in the Early Archaic. The central burned rock feature measured 3.1-x-2.7-m and 33
cm thick. Large rocks ranging up to 30-x-50-x-22-cm were found to line the bottom of this hearth. Rocks
near the edge and overlying the center tended to be smaller and more angular. Close inspection of the 14
outer clusters of rocks revealed greater densities and slightly larger cobbles at regular intervals. Each of
these concentrations had 18 to 45 cobbles within an area measuring 35 to 55 cm in diameter. Many of
these concentrations seemed to have hollow or empty centers that were 15 to 25 cm in diameter. Treece et
al. (1993:204) stated that the clusters are believed to be supports for wall posts with the hollow areas
representing the spots were the posts stood. The proposed structure had an overall maximum diameter of
5.8-x-5.4- m.
Three of the rock clusters were cross-sectioned and they revealed no disrupted sediments in the
underlying strata to suggest that holes were dug for the posts. Instead, it appeared that the rocks were
stacked on ground surface in heights of 10 to 35 cm around the posts on the living surface. The basal
elevations of the rock clusters indicate that the rocks were stacked around the post butts resting on the
living surface rather than used as shims to wedge timbers in post holes below the ground surface.
In conclusion, the house structure at the Turkey Bend Ranch site dated much earlier in time than any of
the features found at the sites at Lake Buchanan. The feature was larger than nearly all the circular
features recorded at Lake Buchanan during the shoreline survey. Only Feature 1 at 41BT476 was
comparable in overall size.
Other Excavated Sites in the Llano Uplift
41BT6
Excavations at this site uncovered a thin, shallowly buried sheet midden that consisted entirely of granite
and quartz rocks (Young 1985). It was noted that the rocks did not appear burned. Nine individual hearth
features were found around the periphery of the midden. Interestingly, all the individual hearths were
constructed of sandstone rocks. Diagnostic artifacts suggested that the occupation of the site primarily
dated to the Transitional Archaic with Fairland, Frio, and Ensor dart points being the predominant types.

435

41LL78
In the report of this TxDOT excavation, Patterson (1987) proposed that seven circular house features like
those at the Lion Creek site were uncovered during the excavations of this site. These features are
described as ranging from 2.2 to 3.25 m in overall diameter with each having a central burned rock cluster
surrounded by other burned rock clusters. Johnson (1997:27-28) reviewed the 41LL78 data for his Lion
Creek site report, and he was not convinced that house outlines were present. Interpretation of the features
at this site is clouded. Diagnostic artifacts range from the Paleoindian Period through the Toyah Phase of
the Late Prehistoric. However, like 41BT6, the majority of the diagnostic artifacts consist of Fairland,
Ensor, and Frio types of the Transitional Archaic Period.

41LL419 (Graham/Applegate)
Graham/Applegate, 41LL419, is a prehistoric campsite located in the southeastern part of Llano County
in central Texas on the western edge of Kingsland (Hixson 2012). Large-scale excavations conducted by
volunteers from the Llano Uplift Archaeological Society (LUAS) between July 1998 and May 2004
uncovered substantial portions of an early Late Prehistoric (Austin Phase) campsite that includes circular
rock features very similar to features reported at 41BT105. These features were at first also interpreted as
house floors, but during the course of the excavations they were reinterpreted as the remains of earth
ovens.
The site is located within the far eastern part of the Llano Uplift region of central Texas in an upland area
of rolling hills carved from granite grus, which constitutes the predominate surface geology. Other
prehistoric sites have been excavated on the regionâs granite formation, but Graham/Applegate differs
from these in being situated in uplands far from perennial streams. While an upland site, the high integrity
of the features suggests they were buried relatively quickly. Pedoturbation caused by gophers and other
animals appears to be responsible for the rapid burial of features. Because of the burial process, the site
does not contain stratified cultural deposits, although in one case a hearth is superimposed on another
separated by a few inches of soil. While a palimpsest with mixed deposits, large areas were apparently
occupied by a single cultural group, and probably some areas were only used during a single occupation.
Therefore, mixing, at least by separate cultural groups, is minimal in most areas.
Sixty-eight features were uncovered during the excavation, most being small, burned rock clusters.
However, six of the features each consisted of a larger than average stone cluster or pavement surrounded
by piles of (usually) smaller rocks referred to in this report as satellite clusters. Similar features recorded
in the region and have been interpreted as the remains of houses with a central hearth and surrounding
post supports or covering weights (Lintz et al. 1995, Johnson 1997). After the first of these large features
was uncovered, excavation proceeded with the expectation that other houses were present. Five such
features were eventually uncovered, but the accumulating evidence contradicted the house interpretation
and showed that earth ovens were a better fit for the data.

CHAPTER 6: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SURVEY METHODOLOGY
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl

Purpose of the shoreline survey
The main purpose of the survey was to locate sites with high research potential so that they could be
afforded some measure of protection from vandalism. Initially, the survey crews sought intact cultural
deposits, meaning that they escaped the erosion that is commonly seen on exposed portions of the
lakebed. As the survey progressed, it became apparent that almost all of the sites along the shoreline were
eroded and deflated. Despite their condition, many prehistoric sites contained burned rock features whose
outlines were still easily discernible. Attention became focused on determining to what extent these
burned rock features retain research potential. This potential may come from the preservation of their
basic patterns from which a typology of burned rock features can be developed. Also, the potential to
contain charred plant material could provide data on subsistence and radiocarbon dating. At historic sites,
features such as house foundations and underground cisterns and wells were found to be recognizable
despite the erosion and deflation problems.
One clear hindrance to research is the lack of temporal control for the burned rock features. Wave action
in almost all cases has removed any charcoal that could be radiocarbon dated. Diagnostic artifacts such as
projectile points are absent from a majority of sites, and in any case have probably been displaced from
their primary context by waves. The large number of features at some sites clearly represents a palimpsest
that accumulated within long spans of time. Therefore only general, atemporal statements can be made
from the hearth data regarding how particular parts of landscape were used in the past: âthis was a place
where people frequently camped and cooked foods that required small hearthsâ or âthis was a place where
large ovens were constructed to cook particular kinds of foods requiring long exposure to heat,â etc. Only
two sites on the lakeshore appear to have been occupied within a restricted time period. One is the Granite
Beach site (41LL2) where only (or mostly?) Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic projectile point were
collected in the early 1960s (Crawford 1965). The other is 41BT476, recorded during the present
shoreline survey, where apparently many Scallorn arrow points (AD 800-1300) were collected by
beachcombers.
As part of the research component of the survey, an attempt was made to measure certain attributes of
burned rock features, including diameter, rock size, and rock type, that might bear on how these features
were used to cook food. Diameter generally correlates positively with feature weight, which itself gives
an indication of the amount and possibly type of food that was cooked in the feature. The presumption is
that larger features with a relatively large mass of cooking rocks were used to cook food including
geophytes and desert succulents such as sotol, food types that require long cooking periods. These foods
provide a dependable source of digestible energy, a nutritional component that is often rare in nature
(Milton 2000). The large percentage of fiber in these foods means that caloric value is low. Therefore, the
economy-of-scale principal comes into play, where a relatively large volume of food must be cooked to
make the whole effort worthwhile.

437

The diameter of the feature is a reasonably good indication of the amount of food it is capable of holding
but is this measurement a good indicator of the total weight of the cooking stones and therefore the
amount of heat available for cooking the food? Rock size might be a more important factor concerning
the amount and type of food because larger rocks retain temperature longer than smaller rocks, mostly
due to the relatively small amount of surface exposed compared to volume. Rock size could also give an
indication of the amount of local rock available for cooking, with small rocks suggesting that large rocks
were absent from the immediate area, or that the few available rocks had to be reused to the point where
they became highly fragmented. Concepts of heat storage as opposed to heat transfer (baking ovens as
opposed to grilling devices) may also be relevant (Malof 2007).
Rock type might also tell us of how the users perceived the different qualities of the rock, and if there
were preferences. Quartz for example, is known to fragment when heated and chert can even explode.
Use of these rocks as cooking elements might also be an indication that rocks better suited for heating
elements were not available, although at some sites quartz and granite or sandstone hearths were located
side by side suggesting task-specific use, perhaps including stone boiling.
During the survey, there were practical difficulties involved in measuring the diameter of the features.
Time constraints prevented a thorough feature recording at some sites, particularly those with dozens of
hearths, such as 41LL542 and 41LL543. In these cases, more generalized descriptions were made with a
few representative examples measured. Large oven-type features, usually with satellite rock clusters, were
almost always measured. Many features were partially buried in compacted sand and measurements could
not be made.
For the larger sites, all feature locations were recorded with a GPS unit and later used to make a digital
map. A paper map was usually made in the field for smaller sites with features, and for all historic
homestead sites which had architectural remains. For such maps, distances were measured by paces and
orientations were made by compass. GPS readings were also recorded for the major features at these sites.
The shoreline surveys generally focused on newly exposed areas of lakebed for several reasons: (1)
ground visibility was usually excellent because vegetation had not had time to become established; (2)
higher elevated areas close to the full pool elevation of the lake have suffered the detrimental effects of
waves for longer periods of time; (3) contain potentially more information, especially time-sensitive
diagnostic artifacts, because of less surface collecting by local beachcombers; (4) newly exposed areas
were the lowest in elevation and therefore closer to streams than higher areas. Sometimes the droughtperiod shoreline was over a mile from the full pool shore.
The survey involved walking informal transects parallel to the shoreline. Usually shovel testing was not
done because of the excellent ground visibility and the deflated surfaces of nearly all the lakebed sites.
When shovel testing was done, such as at 41LL508 at the south end of the lake, the tests usually
encountered loose sand over a sterile clay subsoil or bedrock. In a few sites where intact soil appeared to
be present, such as at 41LL549 on Campground Creek, shovel testing helped confirm the presence of
buried cultural deposits and assess their integrity.

438

Site Types
The prehistoric site types recorded during the survey are classified as camps, lithic scatters, and lithic
procurement sites, following the convention for site typology used by archaeologists in the region
(Collins 1995). While other site types were recorded during the 1937 survey, including shelters and burial
sites, none of these site types was encountered during the shoreline survey.
All prehistoric sites contain lithic material, especially debitage or chipping debris left behind from stone
tool making or refurbishing. Camps are distinguished from the other sites by the presence of burned rock,
which is an indication that cooking took place at the site. The burned rock is found either in clusters or
scattered. Burned rock clusters are usually interpreted as the remains of cooking hearths and ovens, and
occur in large numbers in some Lake Buchanan camps. Tool forms are often more varied in camps,
reflecting the multitude of tasks carried out at places where people reside for relatively long periods of
time. Milling equipment (manos and metates), being heavy, is usually present even in heavily eroded sites
and often show signs of heat damage such as cracks because they were often recycled as cooking stones.
Some Lake Buchanan camps contain burned rock middens while others have outcrops with bedrock
mortars. Since geology appears to influence both these features, camps are further classified into those
with burned rock middens and those with bedrock mortars. One site, 41BT465, has both middens and
bedrock mortars.
âCampâ and âcampsiteâ are catchall terms encompassing a multitude of residential types used within the
various settlement systems that might have existed in the region. As Collins (1995) puts it, âthese are
places where people stayed for a time, regardless of their more specific purposes for being at that
location.â In size or âuse-intensityâ they would be expected to range from overnight hunting camps to
places where occupation was nearly continuous. Binfordâs (1980) forager-collector model of human
settlement systems is still widely used by archaeologists. It posits a continuum between two types of
subsistence strategies: foragers who move the entire residential group to the food source and collectors
who establish a base camp from which small logistical parties travel to the food source and bring back to
food. The former system generally is tenable in areas where resources occur more or less evenly across
the landscape and the latter in areas where resources are concentrated in distant locales across the
landscape. Another model of hunter-gatherer settlement systems is seasonal concentration and dispersal
where people live in small residential groups most of the season but temporarily come together when and
where resources are sufficiently dense. This system is considered by some to be one of the defining traits
of hunter-gatherers (Lee and Daly 1999). It is also the system described by Cabeza de Vaca (2012) when
he lived among native groups on the south Texas plains in the 1520s. In this case, prickly pear fruit
(tunas) which ripen in late summer was the food source that allowed multiple bands to live temporarily in
close proximity.
Lithic scatters are sites were debitage and stone tools are found, but groundstone and burned rocks are
absent. In terms of human behavior, these sites form from a wide range of human activities that can
sometimes be inferred by analyzing the lithic remains. Many lithic scatters might best be described as
locations in the sense used by Binford (1980), places were extractive tasks were carried out and artifacts
accumulate through accretion over long periods of time. Artifact deposition is low but given sufficient
439

time and the fact that extractive tools such as scrapers or gouges need refurbishing, they can be
sufficiently dense to be recorded as a site. These long-term palimpsests can be difficult to interpret,
especially if a wide range of tasks were carried out in a particular location. For this reason, lithic scatters
are rarely assessed as having high research value.
Few lithic scatters were recorded during the survey. This is unusual in that lithic scatters are a fairly
common site type in upland areas in the region. This site type is probably underrepresented because most
lithic artifacts are light and more easily washed away by waves. Another possibility is that most lithic
scatters recorded in the region are actually camps where burned rocks and features are buried and go
undetected.
Lithic procurement sites (or quarry sites) are distinguished from lithic scatters by being located on gravel
beds where chert cobbles occur. They typically contain a high percentage of unfinished tools, usually
early stage bifaces and cores. All the Lake Buchanan procurement sites also contain one or more burned
rock clusters and therefore are classified in this report as âquarry/camps.â However, the overwhelming
amount of artifacts in these appears to relate to lithic procurement activities.
Historic sites, those formed through the activities of people who lived in times when written accounts
were made. In the Lake Buchanan area, historic sites are usually associated with people of European
origin or ancestry, specifically Anglo-Americans, and all probably date to after 1850. Historic sites
recorded during the shoreline survey are classified into four types: towns, cemeteries, homesteads, and
dumps. The remains of two towns were recorded during the survey, Second Bluffton and the eastern part
of Tow. A third town site lies under the lake, the first site of Bluffton, but it has not been exposed since
the lake was impounded in 1937. The locations of these towns remain in the living memory of a few
individuals, and are also shown on early USGS topographic maps. The town sites contain the remains of
buildings, typically wall foundations and chimney fall, since all structures were dismantled or removed
prior to the impoundment of the lake. The identification of the town buildings remains was given by local
informants, especially Hallmark and Russell (2009).
Homestead sites consist of remains that lie outside town sites, along with any outbuildings and the
surrounding artifact scatters. Many of these sites align with structures shown on the 1909 and 1925 USGS
topo maps. The resident families of many of the homesteads at and near Second Bluffton have been
identified by Hallmark and Russell (2009). Nearly all the house sites have cisterns, the main water source
for most people in the region prior to modern plumbing. Their collars are the only masonry surviving
more or less intact in these typically inundated sites.
One historic cemetery lies below Lake Buchanan. It lies north of Second Bluffton and served that town as
well as the earlier incarnation of Bluffton that lies to the northeast of the cemetery. The graves and nearly
all the markers were relocated to the new Bluffton cemetery in the 1930s. A large building once stood on
the west side of the road opposite the cemetery, the foundation of which is still preserved on the lakebed.
It served as a church, a schoolhouse, and a Masonic lodge.

440

Historic-period dumps are sites containing historic artifacts such a bottle glass, glazed ceramics, and
metal with any associated homestead. As used in this report, the term âdumpâ does not necessarily imply
any formal disposal area for community, and can mean any area where trash accumulated.

CHAPTER 7: SURVEY RESULTS
By Charles A. Hixson and Daniel J. Prikryl

The LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff has recorded 76 new archaeological sites since 2000 below
the conservation pool (below 1020 ft msl) of Lake Buchanan. In addition, nine other sites that had been
previously recorded were relocated and additional information recorded. Table 5 lists of all sites recorded
or revisited during the shoreline survey, and Figure 251 shows the locations of these sites as well as the
nine revisited previously recorded sites under the conservation pool of the lake. For a total list of sites
including previously recorded ones not revisited during the current survey see Appendix 1.
Because of the large number of new sites, they have been divided into 11 groups or survey sectors based
on their locations on the lake (Figure 252). Beginning at the north or upper end of the lake, these sectors
are: (1) Tow Village; (2) Tow; (3) Cedar Point; (4) Canyon of the Eagles; (5) Garrett Island; (6) Shaw
Island North; (7) Horseshoe Bend; (8) Campground Creek; (9) Redrock Creek; (10) Black Rock/Granite
Beach; and (11) Lion Creek. Generalizations will be made for each of the ten sectors and important
individual sites will be described in detail.
Following the survey sector discussion is a section on burned rock features, burned rock middens, and the
results of a wave action study.

Survey Sector Results

Tow Village Survey Sector
This sector lies on the west side of the Colorado River at the extreme north end of the LCRA-owned
portion of Lake Buchanan (Figure 253). Fall Creek Falls is about one mile north of this sector and is not
owned by LCRA. The sector lies between 200 and 600 meters from the Colorado River channel where
several small, intermittent creeks enter from the west. Approximately 17.5 acres were surveyed in this
sector, resulting in the recording of two archaeological sites, 41LL574 and 41LL575.
During most of the 2012-2013 drought, the upper end of the lake had retreated back to the river, which in
stretches was only about 3.65 m to 6.1 m wide. Most of the lakebed in this area is covered by recent
sediments because waterborne silt and clays have settled out of the slowing current as the river enters the
lake. A shovel test placed near the river channel in this sector encountered sterile silty clay to a depth of
60 cm where the test ended before the bottom of the recent sediments was reached. Surface inspection and
shovel testing are therefore useless in locating sites in this sector, except near the conservation (full) pool
shoreline where recent sediment are thin or absent. The bedrock geology consists of Cambrian-age
Hickory sandstone in the south half of the survey sector and Cap Mountain limestone in the north half.
Site 41LL574 contains very little cultural material, a few cores and some non-flake debitage, on a low
point close to the shoreline. These artifacts possibly mark the edge of a more substantial site that has
become buried in the recent sediments. A shovel test placed over these sediments reached a depth of 53
cm without artifact recovery. The bottom of the recent sediments was not reached by the test. Because of
the potential for intact cultural deposits below the sediments, the SAL eligibility of 41LL574 is assessed
as undetermined. Site 41LL545 is more substantial and will be described in detail below.

41LL575
This is a small prehistoric camp and early twentieth century trash scatter covering the northeast end of a
point of land where erosion from waves has exposed rough limestone rocks and gravels. The higher land
adjacent to the lakebed consists of sandy loam supporting large live oaks. This intact soil contains many
large chunks of charcoal from recent fires, perhaps from the burning of driftwood, which tends to
accumulate along this stretch of shoreline.
The prehistoric component contains fairly dense lithics lying on top of the exposed bedrock. These
artifacts were probably once encased in the thin soil that covered the rocks before inundation. Soil above
the shoreline appears intact but was not shovel tested because it lies outside LCRA-owned land. One
untyped dart point (probably Late Archaic) was collected from the site. Also noted were four thin biface
fragments, five sandstone metate fragments, three sandstone manos, and over 100 pieces of debitage.
Historic artifacts consist mostly of bottle glass (mostly clear but with some aqua and blue with all
observed finishes machine made), a few pieces of whiteware, and miscellaneous metal including a small

447

hand-wrought spike. The historic artifacts might have originated from nearby house shown on the 1909
USGS topo.
There is a potential for buried cultural deposits under recent silts at lower elevations downslope that were
still under water, as well as on private land above the conservation pool. Therefore the siteâs SAL
eligibility is assessed as undetermined.

Tow Survey Sector
This survey sector lies on the west side of the river channel across from Canyon of the Eagles, extending
from Tow southwards to the western edge of the LCRA Cedar Point Recreation Area (Figure 254). The
survey covered 101 acres in this sector, and recorded ten new sites: 41LL559 through 41LL563, and
41LL566, 41LL567, 41LL569, 41LL572, and 41LL573. All ten sites recorded in this sector during the
shoreline survey have prehistoric components, and three, 41LL560, 41LL562, and 41LL569, also have
historic components. The prehistoric components include six camps (41LL561-563 and 41LL566, 567,
569, 572, and 573) and two lithic scatters, 41LL559 and 41LL560.
This sector was surveyed in the late spring and early summer of 2012 when the lake level was between
995 and 997 ft msl. At this level, most of the lakebed at the upper end was exposed above water except
for the river channel and the mouths of several small streams that enter the river from the west. As with
the Tow Village sector, because this area is located at the far upstream part of the lake, river-borne silts
tend to settle out with the slowdown in current. This has resulted in a thick deposit of silt and clay over
the lakebed below about the 998 foot contour, covering any surface evidence of archaeological sites
(Figure 255). The only lakebed areas not affected by sedimentation are the upper surfaces of lobes
extending out from the mainland, as well as the tops of several prominent knolls. All these elevations
have been eroded by the waves and surface visibility was often excellent. For practical reasons, the only
areas actually inspected in this survey sector were these elevations, and all of them contained
archaeological material.
The extreme south end of the survey sector lies nearly on the banks of the Colorado River channel, but
most of the surveyed area lies mostly between 500 and 1200 m west of the river channel. This sector is
crossed by several small tributary streams, the largest being Calvert Creek. At the time of his fieldwork in
the area in the 1930s, Jackson (1938) stated that the local people referred to this creek as Cowan Creek,
although the 1909 USGS topographic map and later ones give that name to a creek several miles
downstream. The historic 1909 USGS map shows several roads in the survey area including one that
connected Tow to SH 29. The map also shows several buildings in the area south of Tow. The surface
geology consists principally of Hickory sandstone with small areas of granite outcrops.

Camps 41LL562, 41LL566, 41LL567 contain the densest cultural material, and perhaps best preserved
hearths, and both will be discussed in detail below. The other prehistoric camps consist of scattered
burned rock and lithics resting on deflated surfaces. The portion of 41LL561 on LCRA land is completely
exposed and has eroded down to bedrock. The LCRA-owned part of this site is assessed as not eligible for
SAL designation. The SAL eligibilities of the other prehistoric camps (41LL562, 463, 566, 567, 569, 572,
and 573) and the two lithic scatters, 41LL559 and 41LL560, are assessed as undetermined because of the
lack of subsurface testing and possibility that potentially significant areas of these sites still lie under
water.
The three sites with historic components are 41LL560, 41LL562, and 41LL569. The former two sites
probably represent late nineteenth to early twentieth century homesteads although no actual architectural
449

remains were seen. Both sites align approximately with houses depicted on the 1909 Burnet USGS topo
map. Artifacts at these sites include historic ceramics (whiteware and stoneware) and aqua and purple
bottle glass. The third historic component is at 41LL569 and it represents a portion of the old town of
Tow inundated by the reservoir.
Jackson recorded three sites in this area close to the river channel; these have since been given the
trinomials 41LL1, 41LL3, and 41LL5. Because of their low elevation, they were either never exposed or
only briefly exposed during the present drought. In any case, they were not revisited during the shoreline
survey. Two of these sites, 41LL3 and 41LL5, were excavated by Woolsey and his crew, with the latter
(41LL5) published in the report (Woolsey 1938). Site 41LL5 was classified by Jackson as a mound site,
probably containing camping debris and not a burned rock midden since Woolsey does not mention the
latter in his description. Woolsey (1938) reported that the midden deposits were thin, with an average
depth of around 38 cm. Interestingly, few mussel shells were found in the deposits even though Jackson
reported a mussel shell heap on the river bank 140 m away. The site also has a single mortar hole, the
only one located during the survey that could be considered deep, having a depth equal to the orifice
diameter of 25 cm.

numbers understood to have â41LLâ before them.

41LL562
This prehistoric campsite is situated on a prominent granite knoll on the west (left) side of a right tributary
to Calvert Creek. It also contains some historic trash that might derive from an old house site. When the
site was recorded in May, 2012, the knoll was nearly surrounded by water and joined to the dry lakebed
by a low, narrow strip of land to the south (Figure 256). While the knoll is composed of granite, the
surrounding rock is mapped as sandstone, although this could not be verified in the field because of the
sedimentation. A few stumps are present along the base and granite outcrops in a few areas. Vegetation
was mostly sparse at the time of survey with areas of recent sand drifts. The summit of the knoll appears
eroded down to grus or subsoil but areas along south or downstream base might still have an intact upper
soil zone.
At least six clusters of burned granite rocks, between 50 and 120 cm in diameter, were all located within
larger scatters of burned granite. On the very top of the knoll lies a dense 8-by-5-m cluster of burned
granite rocks. This appeared from the surface to be a burned rock midden but probing under the rocks
indicated that it was only one rock layer thick. This feature might simply be a large, deflated hearth with a
small amount of midden accumulation. One dart point was collected from the surface. The point is
probably Late Archaic and is made of an unusual black chert streaked with white inclusions. This chert
might have come from one of the nearby Paleozoic formations, but also might be from a distant source
outside the region. Other artifacts noted on the surface include several bifaces, a core, hundreds of flakes,
burned sandstone metate fragments, purple and aqua bottle glass fragments, old clear bottle glass
fragments, a few whiteware sherds, and a few Bristol glaze stoneware sherds.
This is a fairly substantial prehistoric campsite with dense cultural material spread over an 80 m diameter
area. Importantly, some of the stone hearths near the south base of the knoll have dark-stained soil under
the rocks. Also some intact upper soil zone appears to be present as well. If the burned rocks on the
summit are part of a burned rock midden, it would be the only granite midden so far recorded during the
451

current shoreline survey. In any case, it would be a small midden. There were no signs of a historic house
other than a moderate scatter of late nineteenth or early twentieth century trash, but a structure is shown at
this approximate location on the 1909 USGS topo map. The integrity of the buried cultural deposits at
41LL562 is undetermined because no shovel testing was performed. Therefore the siteâs SAL eligibility is
considered undetermined.

The upper elevations of this prehistoric campsite were visited by Bruce Nightengale of the LCRA
Cultural Resource staff in 1996 after he received a report that the site was being looted. Nightengale
accessed the site by boat â which was then essentially an island - and noted scattered burned rock and
chert chipping debris. He also described the locations of several looter holes. One chert scraper was
collected by Nightengale.
The entire site was exposed when it was revisited by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff in 2012. The
survey team mapped the site as extending from about 50 to 330 m southeast of the former Calvert Creek
channel at elevations from 3.65 to 6.7 m below the normal conservation pool level of Lake Buchanan
(Figure 257). The width of the site appeared to be about 150 m. Several dozen burned rock clusters were
observed during the revisit. These are mostly located within a 1.5-acre area in the eastern half of the site.
Nearly all of these clusters were seen lying on deflated sands or gravels, or partially buried in redeposited
sands. Many of the clusters had been dispersed by the digging of pothunters or by wave action. Thirteen
of the features that were recorded in detail by the survey team constituted the best preserved of the burned
rock clusters. In general, the features were composed of 10 to 14 cm diameter granite rocks with lesser
amounts of sandstone and limestone interspersed among the hearth stones. Nearly all of the features were
less than 1 m in diameter, and none were judged to be of oven-size. Although the site appears completely
eroded, shovel testing would be needed to confirm this. The Siteâs SAL eligibility therefore remains
undetermined.
41LL567
This prehistoric site is located about 1.8 m (6 ft) to 4.3 m (14 ft) under the normal conservation pool on an
east-facing terrace slope overlooking Calvert Creek. The upper elevations of the site have been scoured to
bedrock by wave action, while the downslope areas are covered by thick vegetation that had grown since
the site became exposed. Based on the distribution of surface artifacts, the site was judged to cover an
area measuring 230 m northeast to southwest by 70 m northwest to southeast. Eight burned rock clusters
were seen and recorded, but an 80 m long scatter of burned rocks along an old shoreline cut suggests that
many others have been dispersed by wave action. Three of the intact burned rock clusters measured over
1 m in diameter. Hearthstone materials consisted of sandstone, granite, and quartz. Two diagnostic
artifacts, a Castroville point and an arrow point perform were collected.
Shovel testing is needed to determine if any buried cultural deposits are present closer to the creek
channel. The siteâs SAL eligibility remains undetermined.

41LL569
This is a multi-component site containing the remains of at least two historic buildings amid a more
extensive historic trash scatter, as well as the remains of prehistoric campsites. The buildings belong to
the old town of Tow, parts of which were inundated by the lake in 1938. The 1909 USGS topo map
shows three buildings within the survey area lining the west side of a north-south road. The map also
shows a small creek to the east and beyond that a church and one other building. The town was small with
only eight buildings representing the core of the settlement on the 1909 USGS map. Historic accounts
describe the town moving slightly upslope as Lake Buchanan was impounded by water (Yarbrough n. d.).
The eastern building remains consist of concrete steps, two concrete piers with wooden posts, and a small
concrete "L" -shaped support. Buddy Harris, a landowner who lives adjacent to the site, told the shoreline
survey crew that these features are the remains of the general store (Figure 259). His knowledge is based
on conservations he had with an unidentified man who said he once lived in Tow. Another informant,
Jerry Ramsey, who also lives nearby insists that this is the site of the schoolhouse and that the building
was moved by mules to its present-day location about 200 ft to the northwest where it serves as the
townâs community center. Ramseyâs information comes from Miles B. Bragg, whom he knew personally.
Mr. Bragg, who lived from 1909 to 2012, was a life-long resident of Tow and deacon of the Tow Baptist
Church. More stone rubble with three pier-sized stones was noted 15 m southeast of the concrete steps.
To the east of the small creek lie three piles of sandstone rocks and boulders that probably mark the site of
a second structure. None of the piles contains enough material for a fireplace although all three together
might. While they appear to have been bulldozed into these piles, Ramsey told us that they have been that
way for as long as he can remember (since 1950). Ramsey also said these rocks represent the remains of
the blacksmith shop, apparently based on conversations with Bragg. The soil around the rock piles is
relatively deep - 43 cm above bedrock - and contains dense prehistoric and historic material but no
obvious evidence of a blacksmithing.
Historic artifacts are abundant across the site, but are particularly so west of the creek and around the
three stone piles. This material mostly consists of small fragments of clear, aqua, purple, and amber bottle
glass, and whiteware and Bristol/slip-glazed stoneware sherds. Miscellaneous metal is common,
especially horseshoes. Modern trash, some burned, is mixed with the historic material.
The siteâs prehistoric component consists of hundreds of pieces of debitage and a moderate amount of
scattered burned rock over most of the site area. The survey crew collected a Fairland point, and noted
several bifaces, mano and metate fragments. A shovel test placed near the stone piles recovered nine
mussel shell umbos, in addition to large amounts of debitage. While the umbos were heavily weathered,
they suggest that the soil has remained fairly stable because such light objects are typically absent from
wave-eroded deposits on the lakebed.
The overall site area measures 400 m east to west by 60 m north to south. With so many nearby lake
houses, the site has probably been heavily collected. Wave erosion has removed soil cover over most,
although there are areas where some intact soil can be found. Further shovel testing would be needed to
determine the extent and condition of the buried cultural material. The SAL eligibility therefore remains
undetermined.

Cedar Point Survey Sector
This survey area is located along the shoreline of the LCRA Cedar Point Recreation Area between 200
and 850 m south of the submerged river channel, which along this stretch flows in an east to west
direction (Figure 260. Cedar Point Survey Sector archaeological sites plotted on the 1967 Lake Buchanan,
Texas 7.5â USGS map (above) and the 1925 Tow, Texas USGS map (below). The shoreline here is about
5,000 m in length and includes one large inlet where Cowan Creek enters the lake. Since 2006, LCRA
archaeologists have surveyed 81 acres of the lakebed fronting the park, resulting in the recording of three
new sites, 41LL505 through 507, and revisited 41LL32 (Figure 261). As with the Tow area upstream,
recent silts have covered areas below the 998 foot contour. However, much of the lakebed around Cedar
Point lies above this elevation and the pre-lake surface is exposed within a hundred meters of the river
channel in some areas. This sector marks the northern boundary of the great expanse of Town Mountain
granite under the lake. The surface geology consists of granite west of Cowan Creek and Cambrian
sandstone to the east of this stream.
During his 1937 survey, A.T. Jackson recorded several prehistoric campsites near the mouth of Cowan
Creek, which he noted was called Nobles Creek by the local people. These sites were later given the
trinomials of 41LL31-33. Erosion has removed most of the soil above about the 996 elevation, exposing
large areas with prehistoric cultural material that Jackson could never see.
Sites 41LL505 and 41LL507 contain scattered burned rocks and lithics on deflated surfaces. Site
41LL507 also has the masonry collar of a well or cistern (the interior is filled with sand) and possible
stone piers to a house. Historic artifacts are light and consist of purple, aqua, and clear bottle glass and
whiteware and salt-glazed stoneware sherds. No shovel testing was done during the surveys and buried
cultural deposits could be present at 41LL505 and 507, especially in lower-lying areas covered by recent
silts. Therefore, the SAL-eligibility of both sites is assessed as undetermined.

456

41LL32
This is a large site with both prehistoric and historic components located between the Cedar Point
promontory on the west and Cowan Creek on the east. The prehistoric component was first recorded by
A. T. Jackson during his 1937 survey where he collected 19 artifacts, including manos and stone tools.
The shoreline survey located dozens of dispersed prehistoric hearths and other burned rock concentrations
on the deflated lakebed above the silt-covered areas adjacent to the river and creek channels.

Figure 260. Cedar Point Survey Sector archaeological sites plotted on the 1967 Lake Buchanan, Texas 7.5â USGS
map (above) and the 1925 Tow, Texas USGS map (below).

457

The historic component consists of two former farmsteads, each having the remains of a former house.
House #1 facing Cowan Creek consists of well-preserved pattern of foundation stones with two chimney
falls (Figure 262. Sketch map of remains of House #1 at 41LL32.It appears to be laid out in 'dog trot'
fashion, with a later addition forming an 'L' shaped plan. Artifacts noted around the house included aqua,
amber, purple, and clear bottle glass. This house appears on both the 1909 USGS topo map, Llano quad,
and on the 1925 USGS Tow quad. Large pier stones seen about 150 m to the west-northwest might have
belonged to a barn. A second homestead, House #2, lies about 150 m to the north of House #1 facing the
river. It has the remains of one large chimney with foundation stones. Artifacts include clear, aqua, and
amber bottle glass, some with a tooled finish indicating a manufacturing date between the 1880s and
1910s. Notably, a sherd of featheredge ware was also seen, probably dating no later than the 1850s. This
artifact, along with the lack of purple bottle glass and the absence of a house site at this location on the
1909 USGS top map, all suggest that the house was abandoned before the turn of the twentieth century.
While this site appears to be completely exposed, the lakebed immediately to the north in the direction of
the river channel is covered by recent silts. This area was not shovel tested because of the depth of these
deposits â several feet as indicated by tree stumps â and because of the area was waterlogged at the time
of the survey. The siteâs SAL eligibility is therefore assessed as undetermined.

458

Figure 262. Sketch map of remains of House #1 at 41LL32.

41LL506
This prehistoric site is one of several campsites that are exposed along the north shoreline of the LCRA
Cedar Point Recreation Area during droughts. This site lies about 1.8 m (6 ft) to 3.65 m (12 ft) below the
normal conservation pool level of the lake and covers a saddle-shaped low ridge with Cowan Creek
located on the west side and a small tributary creek on the east. Erosion has removed the loamy topsoil
that held most of the artifacts and features, leaving the clay subsoil exposed. Some of the upper soil zone
is still present at the north end of the site.
Artifacts, mostly chert debitage and burned rocks, are scattered on the clay surface of the ridge or
superficially embedded in it by heavy vehicular traffic. On a small knoll off the north end of the ridge, six
burned rock clusters are visible on the surface. These features are on average about 40 cm in diameter.
Two shovel tests were excavated on the knoll in the vicinity of the burned rock features. These shovel
tests indicated that about 20 cm of very gravelly sandy loam is still present above the clay subsoil. Both
shovel tests yielded between 10 to 20 pieces of chert debitage and a few burned rock fragments. The
principal find in the shovel tests was a Fairland dart point.
Site 41LL506 appears to cover an area measuring about 380 m in length by 100 m in width. The far north
end of the site may have some research potential because approximately 20 cm of gravelly sandy loam
deposits are still present. This represents only a small portion of the site measuring about 30x60 meters,
and it is still uncertain if these sandy loam deposits contain intact cultural material. The remainder of the
site is heavily eroded and does not appear to have any potential for further investigations. Still, shovel
testing would be needed to confirm this. The siteâs SAL eligibility is assessed as undetermined.

Canyon of the Eagles Survey Sector
The Canyon of the Eagles area, which is situated at the northeast end of Lake Buchanan (Figure 263),
takes its name from an LCRA property that is currently leased and operated by an outside vendor as a
nature park and preserve. The shoreline survey covered 79 acres in this sector during which one new site,
41BT455, was recorded and two previously recorded sites, 41BT303 and 41BT305 were revisited.
459

The survey sector lies between 80 and 700 m from the Colorado River channel. No stream enters this
sector but an unnamed intermittent creek flows into Willow Slough immediately upstream to the north.
The bedrock geology consists of the Cambrian-age Hickory sandstone and Cap Mountain limestone
The 940-acre tract was surveyed for cultural resources prior to its development by the LCRA Cultural
Resource staff and contracted archaeologists (Kotter et al. 1996) with 27 cultural resource sites being
recorded and assessed. Several of these sites are situated along and/or below the conservation pool level.
These sites consist of 41BT303-305, 41BT308 and 41BT309. As stated above, only 41BT303 and
41BT305 were revisited during the survey, and the new information of these sites will be discuss below
and with a description of the new site, 41BT455.

Buchanan, Texas 7.5â USGS map (left) and the 1925 Tow, Texas USGS map (right). All Burnet County sites are
preceded by â41BT.â

460

41BT303
This prehistoric site is situated about 200 m east of the former Colorado River channel at elevations
ranging from 1023 to 1010 ft msl (Figure 264). The site extends from a rocky ridge downslope along an
alluvial surface to cover an area measuring 115 m east-west by 65 m north-south. Shovel testing showed
that cultural materials were present in a 10-to-30-cm thick brown loam with sterile clay lying deeper. At
least 14 dispersed to tight clusters of fire-cracked sandstone were noted at the time, the more intact
features between 50 and 70 cm in diameter. Large amounts of debitage, some stone tools and numerous
sandstone manos were also noted. The site was assessed as potentially significant.
In 2009, Cultural Resources staff revisited the site. Four mortar holes that had not previously been noted
at the site were recorded (Figure 265; Table 6). There of these features were under water when the site
was first recorded and the fourth may have been buried by shallow topsoil that has eroded in recent years
due to shoreline fluctuation. A shovel test was also dug, which encountered which encountered a thin 12
cm zone of possibly intact soil under wave-deposited sand. Another visit to the site was made in
December, 2012, to relocate heaths that that had been documented in 1994 to study the effects of wave
action on burned rock features (see Chapter 8). During this visit, an Ensor point was collected.
Although cultural deposits appear thin, only the upper elevations of the site close to shoreline have been
shovel tested. Therefore, the SAL status of the site is assessed as undetermined.

This site was first located by the Llano Uplift Archaeological Society in 1994 and formally recorded
during the 1996 Canyon of the Eagles Survey (Kotter et al. 1996:47). The site was originally described as
being located on a terrace about 300 m east of the former Colorado River channel. During the mid 1990s
the site was mostly underwater and only the portion along the full pool shoreline of the lake was
investigated, between the 1020 and 1010 foot elevations. At that time cultural materials were found to
extend for a length of about 250 m along the shoreline in a 20 m wide area. The only feature seen was a
small sandstone hearth less than 1 m in diameter, although larger scatters of burned rock were noted
previously. The surface artifact inventory consisted of a Castroville point, a thick biface, and scattered
tertiary debitage. Two shovel tests encountered thin loamy soil over clay and little cultural material. The
cultural remains were interpreted as that upslope part of a site that probably extended downslope under
the lake. Because of the potential for better-preserved intact deposits still under the lake, the site was
assessed as potentially significant.
462

The site was revisited in 2009 during the shoreline survey when the lake had dropped to 996 foot msl.
Most of the new areas of cultural material lie northwest of where the site was initially recorded. Overall,
the site is now thought to extend for a length 350 m and have a width of 70 m. Thirteen additional hearths
were seen in various stages of dispersal. These features ranged from tight to loose clusters. The four tight
clusters, which may approximate the original hearth sizes, ranged from 65x37 cm to 100x80 cm. Four
shovel tests that were excavated during the revisit indicate that surface soil deposits in the newly recorded
part of the site vary from loose sand to brown sandy loam to dark gray clay. A sparse number of artifacts
were found in two of four shovel tests down to maximum depths of 40 cm at which point sterile clay and
sandy clay subsoils become evident. It is possible that additional portions of the site continue below 996
ft msl. The site continues to be assessed as having undetermined SAL eligibility.
41BT455
This historic period site is located actually located southwest of the Canyon of the Eagles park. It lies near
the base of a prominent topographic rise that is an actual island when the lake is at its normal
conservation pool level. When exposed, it is a gradually sloping sandy shore with some tree stumps and
covered by various weeds.
The main features at the site are an alignment of foundation stones that mark the outline of a probable
house and a crude cement/concrete above-ground collar of a well or cistern (Figure 266). The house
feature consists of a rectangular outline of sandstone, limestone and granite rocks about 45 ft in length on
an east-west line by 15 ft in width. There is a possible ell addition on the southwest side. The collar of the
well/cistern is situated about 45 ft west of the house outline. The location of these features corresponds
with a house shown on the 1909 Burnet, Texas 15â USGS map.
Artifacts seen on the surface of the site are not very numerous. They consist of clear and aqua-colored
glass fragments and cast iron stove parts. One of the clear bottle fragments had a date of 1908 embossed
on its surface. Small numbers of artifacts were recovered from three shovel tests that were excavated
around the outside perimeter of the house foundations. These artifacts consisted of several whiteware
ceramic sherds, about 10 glass fragments of amber, aqua, and clear colors, and two window glass pane
fragments. Soil deposits consisted of 10 to 22 cm thick grayish-brown gravelly sandy loam and fine sandy
loam above basal clay.
Archival research from the original Canyon of the Eagles survey indicates that the house area is within
the J. Boyce Survey and was owned by J. J. Peacock from 1895 to 1928. The homesite appears to be
located on a secondary, southern river crossing with the Tow community being located along this road on
the west side of the river. The main road was about one mile to the north. The site is assessed as ineligible
for SAL designation because of the thin cultural deposits and the fact it is not associated with anyone of
historical importance.

Garret Island Survey Sector
This survey sector is located on the east side of the Colorado River channel and it extends from the area
south of Beaver Creek southward to the area around Garret Island, as well the shoreline running east from
the island for a distance of about one kilometer (Figure 267). The total area surveyed in this sector comes
to about 141 acres. The underlying bedrock mostly consists of Cambrian-age sandstone although there
appear to be some localized outcrops of granite. Hearths at prehistoric camps in this sector often contain a
mixture of both rock types. Unlike the areas upstream, no silt sedimentation was noted on the areas
exposed above water within this survey sector, that is, above the 988 contour, but sand accumulation was
noted southwest of Garret Island within the bend of the river channel.
The first survey of the Garret Island area was conducted on September 9, 2011 when the lake level was at
992 ft msl. The area south of Beaver Creek was surveyed on January 20, 2012 when the lake had dropped
to the 988 foot contour. The Garret Island sites were revisited on December 5, 2012 when the lake was
back up to the 992 foot contour. During this trip the shoreline to the east of the island was surveyed.
These surveys recorded 11 new sites and revisited one previously recorded site, 41BT47. Seven of these
sites (41BT47 and 41BT460-467) lie relatively close to the Colorado River channel, most within 250 m.
The other three (41BT477-479) are located in an upland area over 800 m from the river channel. All of
these sites represent prehistoric camps with from three to 15 hearths. One previously recorded site,
41BT206, was not revisited during the recent droughts. This is a historic homestead site with house
foundations and other structural remains. A house appears at that location on the 1909 USGS topographic
map but not on the 1925 map.

464

The portions of sites 41BT47, 41BT461-467, 41BT478, 41BT479, 41BT481, and 41BT491 that were
exposed by the drought all showed evidences of deflation and erosion. Burned rock features of various
numbers and sizes along with chipped stone artifacts and other scattered burned rocks were observed on
the surface of each of these sites, but no shovel testing was conducted at any of these sites to determine if
any intact buried cultural deposits are present. One site, 41BT465, has unusually dense cultural material
including two burned rock middens composed primarily of sandstone and bedrock mortar holes in
sandstone outcrops. In all cases, undetermined portions of these sites continued downslope beneath the
waterâs edge. Because of the lack of data on potential subsurface deposits and on the total horizontal
areas, the SAL eligibility status of each of these sites is currently undetermined.
Sites 41BT460 and 41BT477 are both more heavily eroded sites and neither continued downslope beneath
the lake at the time that they were recorded. These sites had fewer artifacts and burned rock features than
the group of sites discussed in the previous paragraph Most of these features at these two sites consisted
of burned rocks that had been disrupted by wave action. Sites 41BT460 and 41BT477 are assessed as not
eligible for formal designation as SALs.
41BT464
This large prehistoric campsite is located south-southwest of Garret Island about 300 m east of the former
Colorado River channel (Figure 268). The site extends for a length of 540 m along an upland terrace that
runs parallel to the former river channel. The maximum width of the site is about 140 m. The northern
end has been heavily impacted by looter digging, with a 40-x-40-m area in the far north-central part of the
site being almost totally destroyed by the looters. The depth of the looter holes and the results of one
shovel test placed in the area indicate that these deposits are only 20 to 30 cm thick and contained within
a loamy matrix strewn with cobbles and boulders. These large rocks and boulders had aided in preserving
the soil deposits from erosion and deflation prior to the looting. To the south of the looted area, the terrace
is partially covered by redeposited sand and occasional small potholes are evident. At least one dozen
hearths, which are all flat stone pavements 1 m or less in diameter, were noted within a 90 m long stretch
of the terrace. A shovel test that was attempted in one section of this area showed that only 3 cm of brown
sandy loam covered the red and orange clay subsoil. Clayey subsoil was also visible between patches of
sand in some other areas.
To the west and southwest, the ground surface slopes downward about 2.5 m before reaching the
shoreline. Scattered burned rock and chert chipping debris were observed along 320 m stretch of beach.
However, no intact or loose arrangements of burned rocks suggestive of hearth features were noted along
the beach. One Ensor point was found in this area.
The site has been examined on two occasions with the lake levels stood at 988 and 992.5 ft msl. It is
probable that additional portions of the site extend westward toward the river channel in areas that were
still inundated during both site visits. As stated in the introductory section on Garret Island, the SAL
eligibility status of this site is undetermined.

41BT465
This is prehistoric campsite with at least two burned rock middens located on a knoll 70 m east of the
river channel. Its elevated position means that much of the site lies at or just below water level and is
therefore subject to the detrimental effect of waves. However, sandstone outcrops have protected the
majority of the site area making this is one of the few lakebed sites with intact deposits. Unfortunately its
prominent position has also made it a target to looters and substantial parts of the site have been destroyed
by illegal digging for relics (Figure 269). The site was visited by LCRA archaeologists after learning that
an LCRA ranger had caught two people looting the site.
At the time of the visit, the lake level was at 988 ft msl and the knoll was attached to the mainland by a
narrow, saddle-like neck of land. Northeast of this neck, the ground rises deeply up a rocky slope towards
lakeside residences. Sandstone outcrops run east to west across the northern half of the site area.
An apparent burned rock midden is located in the south-central part of the site area (when the lake level is
at 988 ft msl), but looter digging has mostly destroyed this feature. The digging covers at least 500 m2,
perhaps giving some idea of the middenâs original size. A shovel test was placed along the edge of an
open looter hole, encountering burned rocks, mussel shell, and lithics to a depth of 60 cm. Below the
cultural deposits was decomposed granite. Three other burned rock concentrations were seen on the
surface, one of which is probably a small burned rock midden. This midden is located on the waterline
467

(990 ft contour) on the southeast edge of the site. It is irregularly-shaped, perhaps dispersed by waves or
looting, and is about 6 m across in maximum dimension. Three shallow bedrock mortars â two of these
might be better described as slicks - were observed in the sandstone outcrops on the northwest edge of the
site (Figure 270).
Six projectile points were found within a 1 m2 area west of the looted burned rock midden. These include
a Pedernales point and other Late Archaic points too fragmentary to type with confidence. The close
proximity of these points suggests that they are looter discards.
Because this is one of the few sites visited during the shoreline survey that has intact soil, it would appear
to have significant research potential. However, there is doubt that any of these deposits have escaped
disturbances from the extensive digging by looters. More intensive shovel testing would be needed to
determine if undisturbed cultural deposits are still present at 41BT465. Therefore the siteâs SAL
eligibility remains undetermined.

41BT466
Site 41BT466 is a deflated lithic scatter located on the east side of the river channel where Beaver Creek
enters the lake. It is across a northwest-facing narrow spit of land at the base of a steep upland slope about
230 m north of campsite 41BT465. It is also very near the plotted location of 41BT10, a burned rock
midden site with seven burials recovered in the 1930s, and may be an outlier of that site. As recorded, the
site is on a lobe about 20 m long and 30 m wide that slopes to the northwest into the lake. Soils were
gravelly sands with little to no vegetation. While cultural material was initially difficult to see, closer
inspection revealed many hundreds of flakes, mostly small tertiary flakes and chips. A number of flakes
tools were also recognized, including a small dart point, probably a Darl, with fine parallel flaking and
with the tip reworked to a short awl or perforator, the medial section of a heavily reworked thin biface, a
side scraper on a hard-hammer flake, and a middle stage biface, all of which were collected. No burned
rock or other evidence of features was seen.
The portion of the site documented as 41BT466 is fully recorded. It is undetermined how far the site
extends past the 990 msl level and therefore the siteâs SAL-eligibility is undetermined. This area should
be reinvestigated if the lake continues to recede.
41BT478 and 41BT479
These two sites represent small camps located in upland areas 800 m from the river channel (Figure 271).
They are fairly typical of sites recorded along the minor drainages entering the lake. Site 41BT478 is a
camp located close to what appears from the 1925 USGS topo map to be an intermittent creek. It contains
fairly dense lithics, including dozens of flakes, several bifaces, and milling equipment including a
complete sandstone metate. Seven burned rock clusters were recorded at this site, one of which is
considerably larger than the others. It measures 130 across and is composed of medium-sized (10 to 15
cm) granite rocks. Site 41BT479 is located on the same creek but has suffered considerable erosion. Four
granite clusters was recorded on its deflated surface, two of which are extremely massive. One of these is
230 cm in diameter and composed of large granite rocks up to 40 cm across.

469

Undetermined parts of these two sites extended underwater at the time they were recorded. Also, no
shovel testing was conducted at either site to determine if any substantial subsurface deposits are present.
For these reasons, the SAL eligibility status of the two sites is undetermined.

Shaw Island North Survey Sector
This survey area lies on the west side of the lake between the south side of Alexander Branch on the north
and the east edge of Shaw Island on the south (Figure 272). The total area surveyed for this sector was
approximately 79 acres, but there is a substantial gap in the middle of this section of shoreline that was
not surveyed (see Figure 272). Four sites were recorded north of Shaw Island Road: 41LL534, 41LL544,
41LL545, and 41LL556. Another site, 41LL570, was recorded at the north end of the sector on the south
side of Arnold Branch.

470

Buchanan, Texas 7.5â USGS map (left) and the 1925 Tow, Texas USGS map (right). All site numbers preceded by
â41LL.â

Three of the sites north of Shaw Island Road, 41LL534, 41LL544, and 41LL545, represent small
campsites situated on the high terrace crest between minor drainages and swales. They possibly could be
the edges of larger sites lying closer to the river channel. The most substantial of these, 41LL534, will be
discussed in more detail below. One small site, 41LL570, was recorded on the south side of Alexander
Branch. It contains ten small hearths, but more probably lay under water. Because all the sites recorded in
this sector except 41LL556 were only partially exposed during the shoreline survey, their SAL eligibility
remains undetermined.

41LL534
This small campsite covers a point of land projecting northward toward the river. At the extreme northern
end of the site is a small hillock that was connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land at the time
471

of the survey. A large pile of granite boulders was sticking up out of the water a few m north of the
hillock.
On the hillock rests a circular burned rock cluster 130 cm across with a mixture of large (30 cm) and
small (10 cm) granite rocks. The soil (or gravels) under the rocks is almost black, probably from charcoal
but possibly from decaying plant matter. There is a moderate scatter of small burned rocks around the
feature with open space on the east and northeast sides. Four smaller burned rock clusters or hearths are
present on the mainland, one of which has two small satellite clusters. Hearth #5 is a rock cluster 70-x-90
cm that might be a natural pegmatite feature. Artifacts collected or noted at the site include a dart point
(probably a Marcos). Two arrow point preforms, debitage, manos, metate fragments and burned rock.

41LL556
Site 41LL556 is only recorded site in this sector that is completely exposed, and it is also the most eroded.
The site contains one dispersed hearth that might be the remains of a modern campfire. It consists of a
loose cluster of about ten large (20-25 cm) granite rocks with an equal number of smaller ones scattered
within a 10 m radius. Another possible hearth is located at the south end of the site near some low granite
outcrops. It consists of a tight cluster of moderate-sized (10-15 cm) quartz rocks plus a few granite rocks.
This latter hearth might be a natural feature because it is located in an area with no debitage or other
artifacts.
One untyped Paleoindian point and a large scraper were collected from 41LL556. Also noted on the
surface were a biface fragment, five cores, 20 to 30 pieces of debitage, and one mano fragment. A shovel
test placed in an area that appeared the least eroded encountered only a thin overburden of redeposited
sand over sterile clay subsoil. Elsewhere, bare rock and clay subsoil is visible over much of the present
surface. The complete lack of topsoil within the site means that there is no chance for any buried cultural
material. The site is considered fully recorded and not eligible for SAL designation.
Horseshoe Bend Peninsula Survey Sector
This large bend in the Colorado River nearly encircles a 1,300-acre area where some of Llano Countyâs
earliest Anglo-American settlers, including the Ike Maxwell and Billy Davis families, established
homesteads in the 1850s. The town of Bluffton sprang up on the north side of the bend by 1859, only to
be destroyed by fire in 1883. The town was then rebuilt at a second location about one-half mile to the
south on a recently constructed road which ran between Llano and Burnet. The town was moved 10 miles
westward to a third location in 1937 when the lake inundated the second Bluffton townsite.
Staff surveyed a total of 406 acres on the Horsebend Bend Peninsula, during which 13 cultural resource
sites were recorded: 41LL502-504, 41LL529, 41LL530, 41LL532, 41LL538-541, 41LL546, 41LL554
and 41LL571. Site 41LL504 represents the second Bluffton townsite. Many of the other sites are rural
historic period farmsteads associated with the Bluffton community. Detailed descriptions of 11 of the
sites are presented below along with SAL eligibility recommendations for each site. Two other sites that
are not described in detail are 41LL530, a lithic procurement site that includes one burned rock feature,
and 41LL546 which appears to represent a historic trash dump. Both of these sites were recorded along
472

the shoreline and it was apparent that additional parts of each site extended below the water. For that
reason the SAL eligibility status of these two sites remains uncertain.
41LL502
This historic home site is located about 700 m east-southeast of the center of the second Bluffton townsite
in an area that is normally inundated by Lake Buchanan. The center of the site lies about 130 m south of
the old SH 29 that extended on an east-west line through the townsite and is on the southeastern side of
the Horseshoe Bend terrace with the former Colorado River channel located 920 m to the southeast.
According to Karylon A. Russell, a local historian, this house site was the home of Asa Arnold, a
blacksmith, who operated the blacksmith shop in the second Bluffton townsite.
Site 41LL502 becomes exposed when the lake level drops to about 1000 ft msl. At the time that it was
recorded in 2007, there was very little vegetation present. Features observed include a 20 foot long band
of large limestone rocks which probably represent a fallen chimney. A well or cistern lies 20 to 30 ft
southeast of the center of fallen chimney stones. This second feature consists of an above ground 5 foot
diameter circular stone and mortar collar with an associated 4-x-5-ft base of a filter box on the northwest
side. A U-shaped arrangement of sandstone foundation stones was seen on the ground surface 15 to 25 ft
south of the well/cistern. These stones may represent the outline of an outbuilding. This feature measures
about 15 ft in length on an east-west line by 10 ft on a north-south line. The south end of the rectangular
feature has no stones to mark its outline.

Figure 274. Sketch map of site 41LL502

It is assumed that the house was formerly situated between the fallen chimney and the cistern/well. If so,
the house may have covered a 30-x-20-ft area (Figure 274). A concentration of surface artifacts was noted
south-southwest of the house area. Artifacts included bottle glass fragments of aqua, amber, and clear
colors along with a Bristol glazed stoneware sherd, and some metal scraps. Overall, the site features and
artifact scatter cover an area measuring about 35 m north to south by 20 m east to west. Wave action has
disturbed the upper sandy soil zone. It is possible that some historic artifacts have been collected by
boaters and beachcombers.
Shovel testing is needed to determine if subsurface deposits and buried features are present. Additional
archival research is also needed to more firmly establish the dates of occupation of the site. At present, the
SAL eligibility status of 41LL502 is undetermined.
475

41LL503
This historic site is situated about 740 m east of the second Bluffton location in an area that is normally
inundated by Lake Buchanan. The site is located on the north side of old SH 29 that runs on an east-west
line through the townsite. Site 41LL503 lies at an elevation of 999 ft msl on the crest of the Horseshoe
Bend terrace with the site being approximately 900 m south of the former Colorado River channel. At the
time that the site was recorded in 2007 there was very little vegetation growing on the site surface.
According to Karylon A. Russell, a local historian, this site was Davis family homestead and was
occupied by the Billy Davis family. The Davisâ were the first family to settle in the immediate Bluffton
area, arriving there in 1854. The house was later given to son Caleb Davis and his family in 1870 by the
Davis family heirs.

The site was recorded during the drought of 2007. At that time, the rectangular outline of the former
house was marked by limestone foundation stones visible on ground surface (Figure 275). The house area
measured about 26 ft on a north-south line by 28 ft on an east-west line. A more concentrated area of
limestone rocks along the center of the west wall was thought to be a fallen chimney. An above ground
circular collar of an underground cistern lay immediately outside of the foundation perimeter on the
eastern half of the north wall. Several rows of limestone rocks that may represent the piers of a former
barn structure were noted about 235 ft west of the house foundation. Overall, the site appears to cover an
area measuring about 260x40 ft (80x20 m).
The sandy topsoil deposits at the site have been eroded and deflated by wave action from the fluctuating
lake level. No surface artifacts were seen at the site. However, the single shovel test that was excavated at
the site did show that subsurface artifacts are present. These consisted of a pale aqua glass fragment, a
clear bottle glass fragment, a ground mussel shell fragment, and three slate fragments from level 1 and
another slate fragment from level 2. Additional shovel testing is needed to better assess the potential for
subsurface deposits and features. Pending that work, the siteâs SAL eligibility status is undetermined.

Figure 275. Sketch map of site 41LL503.
476

41LL504 (Second Bluffton Townsite)
This historic site represents the second location of Bluffton. The original townsite is located about 1 km
or more northward in an area that remains inundated during the current drought because of its low-lying
position adjacent to the Colorado River. This second location came into existence around 1883 when a
new county road that later became SH 29 was built on higher ground south of the original townsite. It also
occurred at about the same time that many of the buildings at the first location were destroyed by fire.
This second townsite existed until the residents were forced to move due to the construction of LCRAâs
Lake Buchanan project in 1937.
Site 41LL504 is situated on the west side of the Colorado River on a terrace inside a large river bend
known as Horseshoe Bend. The former river channel is located about 1.25 km north of the center of
41LL504. The elevation of the second townsite is about 15. 2 m (50 ft) above the original river bank. This
site is normally inundated by Lake Buchanan, and no descriptions of the original vegetation at the
townsite have been found in the archives. It is possible that the area was originally a patchwork of oak
woodlands and grassy prairies. When the site becomes visible during droughts, it is apparent that much of
the original sandy loam topsoil has been eroded away by wave action and undercurrents. Some stumps of
the original trees at the site are still present when the lake recedes.
Cultural materials evident at the site consist of foundations, fallen chimney stone scatters, and artifact
concentrations that mark the former locations of businesses and residences. In 2007, with the aid of
William Hallmark, who lived at the second townsite as a child, the LCRA Cultural Resources team was
able to identify the locations and remains associated with the former hotel, cotton gin and associated seed
house, the blacksmith shop, the store/gas station, the grist mill, and four former house residences that had
been occupied by the Hallmark, Garrett, Meador, and Croft families. These features are primarily located
on either side of the new road that was constructed just prior to 1883. The locations of all of these former
structures and other features are shown on Figure 276. In total, the site covers an area measuring about
360 m on an east/west line by 225 m on a north/south line. Additional features consisting of the former
town cemetery and the foundations of the building that served as the school, church and lodge are situated
300 plus m further to the north and were recorded as a separate site, 41LL571.
Description of Features at 41LL504
The Old Bluffton Hotel
The most substantial features at 41LL504 are located at the western end of site to the east of the
intersection of the old SH 29 and another road that leads northward to the first Bluffton townsite. One of
these features, the old hotel site, is located about 45 m northeast of this intersection. According to
Hallmark and Russell (2009:9) the hotel at the second Bluffton townsite was constructed and originally
owned by Jack Mabry. In addition to serving as an overnight lodge, the hotel was a daily stopping place
for the stagecoach that ran daily from Llano to Burnet.

477

41LL571

Figure 276. Sketch map of 41LL504 and other nearby sites.

478

At present, numerous sandstone and granite boulders that appear to represent the fallen chimney stones
and other rectangular-shaped stone blocks that are probably foundation stones are present on the surface
of the hotel area (Figure 277; Figure 278). Overall, this scatter of stones measures about eight m
north/south by six m east/west. Two back-to-back fireboxes for the chimneys at this former structure are
located in the center of the scatter of stones. These are marked by outlines of granite rocks. Each firebox
measures 25 by 50 cm in plan view. A large rectangular-shaped granite stone is located at the south end of
the hotel stone scatter. Its size and the quality of the workmanship suggest that it may have functioned as
a stair step to enter the front door of the hotel.
Another feature at the hotel area is an above-ground collar of an underground cistern that is situated just
two to three and one-half m northeast of the northeast edge of the limestone rock scatter that represents
the hotel. A concrete water collection/filter box lies immediately west of the collar. Several alignments of
limestone rocks are visible on ground surface elsewhere in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. One of
these alignments begins just one and one-half m west of the cistern and filter box. It consists of a line of
seven small foundation stones that extend in an east-west line from the north central to the northwest edge
of the hotel foundation and chimney scatter. Another east-west alignment of five foundation stones
extends for a length of seven m off the southeast edge of the main foundation/chimney stone scatter.
Other foundation stones extend southward off of this alignment at two points.

Figure 278. Sketch map of hotel area at site 41LL504.

The Bluffton Cotton Gin
The cotton gin consists of several above-ground concrete foundation features including the former engine
stand, the line shaft, the bearing race for the line shaft, and the weighing scales (Figure 279; Figure 280).
The cotton gin complex is located about 80 m east of the old hotel building on the north side of Old
Highway 29 (see Figure 276). The cotton gin was originally owned by Joel Garrett, and was last operated
by Pierson Hallmark from 1927 to 1930 (Hallmark and Russell 2009:11). The gin was a two story, sheet
metal structure with a wooden frame. Although there is no trace left today, a small building used to store
cotton seed stood south of the gin. A windmill stand is still present about 40 m south of the gin complex.

480

Figure 279. Various foundations associated with the cotton gin at site 41LL504.

Former Residences on the north side of Old Highway 29
Other features that are located on the north side of the Old Highway 29 consist of two former residences â
the Hallmark home and the Garrett rent house (see Figure 276). At both of these house sites, artifact
scatters consisting of brick fragments, rusted metal fragments, broken whiteware ceramics, and broken
pieces glass fragments of various colors are present. The Hallmark home site is located close to the north
edge of the old highway about 40 m east of the previously mentioned windmill stand. The remains of the
Garrett rent house are located about 100 m northeast of the Hallmark home site. The Garrett rent house
marks the northeastern edge of the second Bluffton townsite.
Features at Southwestern Part of Site
The former grist mill is the westernmost feature on the south side of the Old Highway 29. It lies
immediately south of the intersection of the highway and the old road that extended north to the first
Bluffton townsite. Physical remains of the mill consist of two concrete slabs â one at the east end of the
feature measuring 16x10 ft and a slightly elevated second one measuring 8x10 ft with a 14 inch high
piece of rebar extending upwards. A discontinuous line of sandstone foundation stones extends about 50
ft west of the second slab. A former privy had been located about 30 ft south of the west end of the
sandstone alignment but was not recognized until looters dug into the filled-in privy hole in July 2009.

481

482

Bluffton Store/Croft House Site
Visible remains of the Bluffton Store consist of a 24 ft long concrete slab that has been broken into three
sections, an exposed subsurface barrel in which gasoline was stored, and several miscellaneous sandstone
and concrete fragments. These features are located about 60 m southeast of the intersection of the Old
Highway 29 and the road that ran northward to the original Bluffton townsite. The store, which
functioned as a gas service station, grocery store, and post office, was the heart of the second Bluffton
community.
A photograph of the old store that was probably taken in the 1930s just before the town was moved out of
the lake basin suggests that the concrete slab was located in front of the store where vehicles pulled up to
fill up with gasoline (Yarbrough nd:47). This area appears from the photo to have had a tin roof overhang.
The photograph also suggests that the store was a one-story building with a large sign on which was
printed âA.E. CROFT GROCERIES + AUTO SUPPLIES.â Two other signs on the front wall of the
building advertised Coca Cola and Texaco Gasoline and Motor Oil. An additional sign in the window of
the store indicated that the store also served as the Bluffton Post Office. The store building was moved to
the third Bluffton townsite in 1937.
Mr. A. E. Croft owned the Bluffton Store for the last 10 years of its existence at the second Bluffton
townsite. Previous to him, Henry A. Coggins had owned and operated the store for 20 years. Earlier
owners were Joel Garrett, a man named Culberson, and T. P. Prickett. An earlier version of the store that
had been located at the original first Bluffton townsite had originally been opened by either Alvis D.
Hamlin or John B. Pankey (Hallmark and Russell 2009:10-11).
The remains of the Croft family house site are located about 40 m south of the store. According to
William Hallmark (personal communication 2007), the Croft house was moved to the third Bluffton
townsite area. Currently, there is a diffuse scatter of household debris in this area. The main feature in the
vicinity of the former house is a large underground cistern with a square above-ground collar. The cistern
feature is located about 13 m east of the northern edge of the Croft house artifact scatter.
The base of a chimney box-like feature is visible about 45 m east of the Croft house site. The feature is a
U-shaped arrangement of mortared stones that rises four to six inches above ground surface. Hallmark
and Russell (2009:13) describe this feature as a part of the remains of the blacksmith shop that had been
located at the second Bluffton townsite. Other scattered foundation stones lay in the vicinity of this
feature.
Meador House Site
The last feature on the south side of the Old Highway 29 at the second Bluffton townsite consists of the
remains of the George Meador homestead. The homestead lies about 100 m east of the blacksmith shop
area. Debris at the house site consists of foundation stones, broken glass of various colors, whiteware
ceramic sherds, scrap metal and a few bricks. According to Hallmark and Russell (2009:23), the house
had always been primarily used as a rent house, and it was demolished prior to inundation by the lake.
Families that lived in the house at various times were Pink and Betty Meador, Guy and Jewel Croft, and
Walter and Laveta Veasey.
483

41LL504 Summary
The site appears to cover an area that measures 360 x 225 m. A total of eleven features were recorded
with the assistance of William Hallmark. No standing structures are still present, but the foundations and
rubble of the old hotel and cotton gin are fairly well preserved. Other concrete slabs mark the former
locations of the general store/post office and the grist mill while the location of the blacksmith shop is
marked by only one foundation feature. The remaining features in the core of the town consist of four
former house sites. Mr. William Hallmark, who lived at the townsite as a child, identified and described
each of these features to the LCRA staff.
Exposed tree roots on numerous tree stumps that are still present indicate that an average of 30 cm of
sandy loam topsoil deposits have eroded away due to wave action and undercurrents. Nevertheless, the
excavation of four shovel tests indicates that 20 to 40 cm of sandy loam A horizon deposits are still
present in some parts of the site. Two of these shovel tests, ST 1 and 2, were excavated in the vicinity of
the old hotel with only one subsurface artifact, a piece of pink colored frosted glass being found. This
artifact was recovered from Level 1 of ST 1. The other two shovel tests, ST 3 and 4, were dug around the
grist mill feature. In ST 3, seven pieces of rusted metal were found in Level 1. At ST 4, six pieces of
similar rusted metal were recovered in Level 1 and two other pieces of rusted metal were found in Level 2
of that test. Artifact collectors have removed many historic period artifacts from the site since the time
that the site was first re-exposed by a drought in the early 1950s.
The site is assessed as eligible for formal designation as a SAL. This assessment is made due to the
presence of numerous and diverse features, the rich archival history that has been assembled by Hallmark
and Russell, and the fact that despite removal of many artifacts by visitors to the site, some subsurface
deposits are still present.
41LL529
This multi-component site is located about 875 m east of the second Bluffton townsite just north of the
old SH 29 road bed. The site is situated on the top of the upland terrace at the west end of Horseshoe
Bend and is about 3.65 m (12 ft) below the conservation pool level of Lake Buchanan.
The historic component of the site is depicted on Hallmark and Russellâs (2009:2) as being the homestead
of Jim and Nancy Maxwell. Born in 1859, Jim Maxwell was the oldest son of pioneer settlers Ike and
Margaret Maxwell. The house was apparently built at this site shortly after Jim and Nancyâs marriage in
1881. They lived in the structure until being forced to move in 1937 due to the construction of the lake.
Jim Maxwell aided in the relocation of the graves from the old Bluffton cemetery, and he reportedly
wrote several articles about the old Bluffton townsite.
Physical remains at site 41LL529 consist of the above ground collar of a well or cistern and a scatter of
house piers that are located about 20 ft west of the well. The collar of the well/cistern is about 4 ft in
diameter, and the house piers consist of 10 large limestone blocks, the largest measuring 23x20x18
inches.

Artifacts are not abundant and are mixed into the sand that has been redeposited across much of the site
by wave action and underwater currents. It is also possible that looters have removed many of the
artifacts. Historic period materials seen at the site consist of solarized, aqua-colored, and clear glass
fragments, Bristol glaze stoneware, and a pocket watch gear. Prehistoric artifacts were seen at the site also
and consist of a modified flake, a core, and some chert debitage. Most of the prehistoric artifacts were
found in the open area east of the well/cistern.
The site covers an area measuring 40 meters east-west by 20 meters north-south. The research value of
this site is considered to be low because little of the original topsoil is still present. The site is assessed as
not meriting formal designation as a SAL.
41LL532
This prehistoric site is located on the north slope of the upland terrace on the Horseshoe Bend peninsula.
The site was found just as the upslope portion of it was becoming exposed by the drought at an elevation
of 988 ft msl. Additional parts of the site probably extended downslope into the lake at the time it was
recorded. The part of the site examined covers an area measuring 100 m from east to west and 80 m from
north to south.
A line of granite and pegmatite outcrops on the eroded surface of the site on a southwest to northeast line.
Most, if not all, of the exposed portion of the site has been scoured down to the clay substrate or grus.
Artifacts seen at the site consist of 1 untyped dart point, 1 medial section of a dart point, 2 thin biface
fragments, 1 uniface, three cores, about 12 chert flakes, and 1 burned metate fragment. At present, the
site is classified as a lithic scatter although hearths could be present downslope in parts of the site still
underwater. The SAL status of the site is undetermined at this point since the entire site has not been
exposed. Continued monitoring of the site is recommended as the lake recedes.
41LL538
This historic period site is located about 1.85 km west of the second Bluffton townsite. The site lies on an
upland terrace slope about 400 m south of the former Colorado River channel. The elevation of the site
extends from about 988 to 998 ft msl, and it covers an area measuring about 100 m north-south by 65 m
east-west.
According to Hallmark and Russell (2009:2, 4-7), this site was the homestead of Isaac âIkeâ Maxwell. He
arrived in the area in 1854, with the Davis family and married Margaret Davis. The house was probably
built sometime before 1859. Ike Maxwell was a frontier Indian scout, Church of Christ preacher, and was
elected to the Texas State Legislature in 1884. He is noteworthy for convincing the legislature to build the
current Texas Capitol building out of granite from the Llano Uplift area.
Site 41LL538 contains some of the largest building foundations recorded at any of the historic sites at
Lake Buchanan in terms of pier size and overall horizontal areas (Figure 281). The foundation stones of
what appears to have been the house cover an area measuring 45 ft east-west by 36 ft north-south. The
north side of the foundation consists of stacked rocks forming a low wall. Remains of

fireplaces/chimney lie on the east and west sides of the foundation area. A well is also present (Figure
283).

487

Two other features are located 50 to 70 m northeast of the former house. Each of these features consists of
rows of foundations stones that probably mark the locations of barns or other types of outbuildings. The
foundation stones of one of these features extend into the lake and additional rows of foundation stones
associated with that structure may still have been totally inundated at the time the site was recorded. The
second features is located 20 m southward and consists of three rows of foundations stones that cover an
area of about 35x33 ft.
The siteâs SAL eligibility status is currently rated as undetermined because there has been no shovel
testing to assess the potential for subsurface deposits. Additionally, it is possible that some portions of the
site were still underwater at the time the site was recorded.
41LL539
This historic site is located on the southeast edge of Horseshoe Bend about 180 m northwest of the former
Colorado River channel and 1.1 km southeast of the second Bluffton townsite. The site is situated on a
narrow point of land on the southeast end of high terrace that overlooked the river. All topsoil has been
eroded from the site by wave action leaving small gravels and bedrock on ground surface.
A former house foundation is outlined by large limestone and sandstone rocks with a large rock pile from
the chimney in the southeast corner. This scatter of stone debris covers an area of 30 ft east-west by 20 ft
north-south. A well-preserved underground cistern with an above-ground collar is located about 7 ft to the
northeast of the northeast corner of the stone scatter (Figure 284). A second, more ambiguous, scatter of
foundation stones extends from about 15 to 35 ft northwest of the north edge of the house scatter. It
probably represents the location of a second structure that formerly stood on the site.
Artifacts seen at 41LL539 mostly consist of solarized, aqua, and clear glass fragments. One slipped
stoneware sherd, one porcelain sherd, and much miscellaneous metal including cast iron fragments and a
horseshoe were noted on the site surface. A small amount of scattered chert debitage was also observed to
suggest a minor prehistoric component.
According to Hallmark and Russell (2009:2) this site was the homestead of the Solomon âHorseâ
Maxwell family. Mr. Maxwell operated a river ferry, and he was the brother of pioneer settler Ike
Maxwell. The site is extremely eroded and deflated. The only potential for any substantial cultural
deposits would be in refuse pits, and no indications of any such pits were seen. The site is assessed as not
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

41LL540
This site is situated at an elevation about 9.1 m (30 ft) below the normal conservation pool level of Lake
Buchanan. The site is located on the slope of an upland terrace above the Colorado River floodplain. The
river channel was originally about 600 m east of the site.
Many limestone, chert, and quartzite cobbles are strewn about the surface of the site. Two early stage
bifaces, several chert cores and about 100 chert flakes and chips were seen on ground surface within an
area encompassing 35x40 m. Most of the flakes are hard-hammer flakes, and many retain some amount of
cortex.
The site area appears to have been deflated but some sandy topsoil appears to still be present. Although
no diagnostic artifacts, features or burned rocks were observed, additional portions of the site may extend
downslope below the lake level. Therefore, the SAL eligibility status of the site is undetermined at this
time.
41LL541
This is a multi-component site that is located on the first terrace above the Colorado River floodplain
within Horseshoe Bend. The site lies about 330 m west of the former Colorado River channel and about
2.3 km south-southwest of a prominent limestone cliff called White Bluff which rises above the northeast
shore of Lake Buchanan. The site, which is normally inundated by the lake, lies at about 994 ft msl.
The site area has very sandy topsoil that contains limestone, quartz, and chert gravels. There was little
vegetation growing on the site area when it was recorded because the site had just become visible as the
lake level had dropped.
489

The historic component is a historic homestead that includes a scatter of cut stones that cover a 2x4 m
area either marking the location of a fallen chimney tower and/or the foundations of a former house
(Figure 285).
Some old metal stove parts, clear and solarized (purple and pink) glass fragments, cut nails, and plain
whiteware ceramic fragments were found in the vicinity of the stone cluster. A 7x7 m area immediately
southeast of the limestone blocks had been dug up in recent weeks by looters. There are several other
looter holes about 4 m further south.
Remnants of three wooden fences are present at the site. One is about 40 m in length on a north-south line
and is situated at the north end of the site on the east side of a dirt road that may be the old road bed of SH
29. It is generally located 40 to 75 m northwest of the foundation stone cluster. The second fence begins
about 70 m south of the first fence and follows the same north-south alignment for about 30 m before
curving slightly to the southwest and quickly disappearing. The third fence is situated at the far southwest
edge of the site and extends on an east-west line from about 25 to 80 m west of the dirt road. The historic
component is probably related to the Bluffton community, but the site is not described in Hallmark and
Russellâs (2009) publication on the Bluffton community. Archival research and oral history work is
needed to determine the individuals associated with the historic component.

Figure 285. Foundation and/or chimney stones at 41LL541.

The prehistoric component includes five intact and semi-intact burned rock features along with chert
chipping debris and cores, and several ground stone manos. While the historic component is confined to
an area of about 30x20 m, the prehistoric component covers a much larger horizontal area measuring
about 120 m north-south by 80 m east-west (Figure 286). The majority of the prehistoric surface artifacts
490

were seen on the surface of two more eroded areas adjacent to the dirt road. The burned rock features are
all situated on slightly higher ground in the southwestern part of the site on the west side of the dirt road.
It seems possible that additional prehistoric burned rock features could be shallowly buried near the
exposed ones. Shovel testing will be needed to explore this possibility. At present, both the prehistoric
and historic components of this site are of undetermined SAL eligibility.

41LL554
This historic period site is located about 625 m west of the second Bluffton townsite. It lies about south
slope of the upland terrace on the Horseshoe Bend peninsula. The site is about 45 m south of the old SH
29 road bed. Much of area within and around the site is covered with coarse sand that has been
redeposited over the site surface by wave action and strong underwater currents. The elevation of the site
is about 995 ft msl.
Historic remains at the site consist of the dismantled remains of a chimney and fireplace along with two
cast iron stove legs and several rusted pieces of metal. The chimney rock scatter measures about 6 m east
491

to west and five meters north to south. The course of rocks on the west side of the chimney foundation is
intact and measures 1.5 m in length. The rocks are all of granite and the largest one measures 80x40x30
cm. Four weathered wooden stakes were noted sticking out of the ground to form a square on the north
side of the chimney. Also, about seven meters south of the chimney, several large rocks appear to be
sticking up partially out of the sand. These could be foundation stones. Overall, the site, as currently
known, covers an area measuring about 40x40 m.
Hallmark and Russell (2009:2) note this site on their map of the second Bluffton townsite. They list the
owner as undetermined. Because there are portions of the site that appear to be covered by redeposited
sand, the site should be revisited during future droughts to determine if wave action and/or underwater
currents have exposed these areas. The siteâs SAL eligibility status is currently undetermined.

41LL571
This historic site represents the original Bluffton community cemetery and the adjacent structure that
served at various times as a church, a school and a lodge. The site is located in between the locations of
the first and second Bluffton townsites. When Lake Buchanan is at its normal conservation pool level, the
site lies about 9.1 m (30 ft) beneath the lake. When exposed by drought, the site area is a level sandy
terrace with very little vegetation covering the surface. The original Colorado River channel is about 700
m north of the site area.
The site is bisected by a north-south running road that extended from the first to the second Bluffton
townsites. The cemetery is situated on the east side of the road and is not demarcated by a fence or any
permanent boundary markers. However, the Hallmark family undertook a formal boundary survey in
2011 and the flagged lathes left by the surveyors showed that the cemetery covers an area measuring
about 525 ft north-south by 170 ft east-west. Prior to its inundation by Lake Buchanan, 464 graves were
removed from the cemetery in 1931. The graves were relocated at a new cemetery that is located seven
miles to the west on higher ground at the third Bluffton townsite.
At the time that the site was recorded by the LCRA Cultural Resource staff in 2011, there were seven
cement blocks that were the bases of former grave stones still present within the original cemetery. There
were also two rectangular sets of foundation stones that appeared to mark former grave plots (Figure
287). Each of these sets measured about 16 x 13 ft in outline. One actual grave stone for an infant named
Johnny C. Parks was still lying on the ground at the north end of the cemetery during the visit to the site
in November 2011. LCRA determined that the remains of the child had been removed in the 1930s, but it
is unclear why the grave stone was not relocated with the human remains.
During a previous drought in 2009, the grave stone of a second individual, Dollie E. Tanner, had also still
been present within the cemetery. This grave stone was removed and relocated to the site of the reburied
human remains in 2009 by family descendents with the permission of the LCRA Cultural Resource staff.
On the opposite (west) side of the road, the foundation stones that mark the outline of the old building
that served at various times as a church, school and a lodge are visible on ground surface (Figure 288).
The outline of stones measures about 20 ft on a north-south line by 50 ft on an east-west line. There were
492

very few artifacts on ground surface at the time of the November 2011 site visit and no shovel testing was
undertaken around the former building.
The former structure was probably erected during the 1860s. Photographs of the building indicate that the
structure was a two story wood frame building that had two side-by-side front doors on the ground story.
There were also two windows on the second story of the front side of the building. The ground floor of
the building originally functioned as a church and school while the second story was used as a Masonic
Lodge. After the lodge lost its charter a few years later, the entire building became a church with the
school being relocated elsewhere (Hallmark and Russell 2009:13-14).
The cemetery area at site 41LL571 is assessed as not worthy of formal designation as a SAL because the
human remains have been removed to another location. The western portion of the site where the former
public building that served variously as a church, school and lodge is rated as potentially significant but
shovel testing is needed to determine if buried deposits and features are present. Additionally, other
associated features may have still been below the waterâs edge when the site was recorded. Based on
these factors, the SAL eligibility status of western part of the site is undetermined.

Campground Creek Survey Sector
This survey sector is located on the west side of the lake south of Shaw Island Road along both sides of
Campground Creek on the lakebed around the inlet west of Shaw Island (Figure 289). The Cultural
Resources team surveyed 148 acres in this sector, resulting in the recording of 11 new sites, 41LL533,
542, 543, 547, 549-552, 555, and 557, and the recording of additional information for two previously
recorded sites, 41LL40 and 41LL285 (mistakenly re-recorded as 41LL558). Another Jackson site,
41LL15, is located on the south side of Campground Creek and probably encompasses three of the new
sites (41LL550, 41LL552, and 41LL555). Another of Jacksonâs sites (41LL286) lies further downstream
on the south side of the creek, and although probably exposed during the 2011/12 drought, no attempt was
made to revisit it. Most of the Campground Creek sites are prehistoric campsites, along with one lithic
scatter and one lithic procurement site/campsite. These sites are situated on elevated lobes between minor
tributary drainages feeding Campground Creek. This part of the lakebed is underlain completely by
granite, although there are areas where quartz and chert gravels are the dominant surface rocks. Scattered
tree trucks indicate that this small valley was open woods prior to impoundment of the lake.
All these sites have been subjected to some erosion by waves, as evidenced by the large number of
hearths and lithics exposed on the surface. The best preserved site seems to be 41LL549 located furthest
up the Campground Creek estuary and therefore more protected from waves coming off the main lake.
However, even at this site the upper 15 cm of soil - which contains most of the cultural material - has
been disturbed by waves.

Buchanan, Texas 7.5â USGS map (top) and the 1925 Tow, Texas USGS map (bottom). All site numbers are
preceded by â41LL.â
495

The campsites vary considerably in the number of hearths, ranging from a low count of two for 41LL285
up to 42 for 41LL543. The sizes of the hearths range between 50 and 100 cm in maximum dimension.
Satellite rock clusters are present around some hearths, but massive oven-type features are absent except
for one 120 cm hearth with satellite clusters at 41LL40. This latter feature is located over half a mile from
Campground Creek suggesting that nearby minor drainages, presently appearing as mere swales, may
have carried water in the past.
The majority of these features are composed of small to mid-size granite rocks, which is the most
common surface rock. Interestingly, at three sites, 41LL40, 41LL557, and 41LL558, the hearths are
composed primarily of quartz or chert, rock types that would appear to be unsuitable for heating elements
because they explode or fracture into small pieces when rapidly heated (Figure 290). These are the only
rock types commonly available on the surface in these areas.
One campsite, 41LL551, has a few shallow bedrock (granite) mortar holes (Figure 291). These bedrock
features appear to be rare even though suitable rock outcrops occur frequently on the exposed lakebed.
Such features have been identified at three other lakebed sides, 41LL16, 41BT303, and 41BT466.
Sites 41LL40, 41LL542, 41LL543, 549, and 41LL557 are discussed in more detail below. Most of the
other Campground Creek sites, 41LL285, 533, 549-552, 555, and 558, represent prehistoric camps
containing hearths, scattered burned rock, groundstone, and lithics on deflated surfaces. Because no
shovel testing was done because most of these sites probably extended under water when they were
recorded, their SAL eligibility is assessed as undetermined.
41LL40
This is one of the few â and the largest â of the lithic procurement sites recorded on the lakebed and is
described here in detail. Although primarily a procurement site, it was also used as a camp, as indicated
by five scattered hearths. The site was first recorded by A. T. Jackson in 1937 as part of his
reconnaissance of the Basin of Lake Buchanan. He described it as a small âworksiteâ with chert cobbles
scattered over the surface âshowing evidence of human work.â He noted that some flakes were present
but were not numerous. But he did find one side scraper. The LCRA relocated this site in 2012 during a
survey along the north side of the Campground Creek estuary.
The site is located just below the full pool elevation of the lake west of Shaw Island. It covers two lobes
on the east side of a minor drainage leading south towards the submerged Campground Creek channel.
The soil that was probably once present on the lobes has eroded away, leaving bedrock strewn with
numerous chert cobbles and chunks of purple quartz rocks. The gravel on the south lobe is considerably
larger than that on the north, covering about two acres. These sand drifts obscure large areas of both
lobes.
Five hearths were observed north of the gravel beds. These hearths ranged in diameter from 50 cm to 120
cm, the largest one was located farthest to the north over half a mile from Campground Creek. The
hearths are composed of mixtures of quartz, granite, and chert except for the one adjacent to the larger
496

cobble bed which was made up entirely of chert. Fifty m to the northeast of the gravel beds rests a
partially buried hearth with three possible satellite rock clusters. The site area and especially the gravel
beds are littered scores of cores, dozens of early stage bifaces, hundreds of flakes, most with cortex. All
burned rocks and the one sandstone metate fragment noted at the site are confined to the hearths.
Most of this site was exposed at the time of the survey. However, areas of the site to the north of the chert
beds were not adequately surveyed. In addition, no shovel testing was done. For these reasons, the siteâs
SAL eligibility remains undetermined.

Figure 291. Bedrock grinding features at 41LL551.

41LL542 and 41LL543
These two sites are considered here together because of their close proximity â they lie on adjacent points
of land projecting southwards towards the Campground Creek channel â and because they each contain a
relatively large number of hearths. The sites rest on low lobe rising slightly above swales or small
drainages that fed into Campground Creek about 100 m to the south. Numerous stumps show that the area
was wooded prior to lake impoundment. Granite bedrock or pegmatite seams are exposed in the northern
portions of these sites, and 41LL543 in particular is covered by large areas angular quartz cobbles.
Thirty three hearths were recorded at 41LL542 and 42 hearths were recorded at 41LL543 (Figure 293).
Probably many more are still buried in the sands of both sites. Most are circular pavements of burned
granite rocks up to 110 cm across. One feature at 41LL542 appears as a ring of rocks about 70 cm across,
probably the upper edge of a basin-shaped oven suggesting some vertical integrity. However, most of the
features at both sites appear deflated and a few are clearly dispersed somewhat by waves. A couple of the
large hearths have a few satellite rock clusters, but no unusually large hearths or hearths completely
surrounded by satellite clusters.
These sites lie close to a group of lake houses and no doubt have been heavily collected from by relic
hunters. LCRA archaeologists happened to reach 41LL542 soon after it was exposed and recovered five
projectile points. In chronological order these include a Pedernales, a Castroville, an Ensor, a Scallorn,
and a Perdiz. These points cover a roughly two thousand year period, from 1300 BC to AD 1700. Site
41LL543 was visited later after it had been exposed for some time, and no points were found. The long
span of projectile points recovered from 41LL542 suggests that the hearths accumulated through repeated,
most likely short-term, occupations. Considering their small and low thermal capacity, these hearths were
probably used to cook foods that required short cooking times. Examples of such foods would be meat
and shell fish. Unfortunately, deflation by waves has removed all evidence of these foods.

Small areas of 41LL542 and 41LL543 were probably covered by water when they were visited by the
Cultural Resources team. For this reason, and because neither site was extensively shovel tested, their
SAL eligibility remains undetermined.
41LL549
Site is located on low knoll 330 m due south of the south end of Beaver Circle off of Shaw Island Road.
Site elevation is below full pool of Lake Buchanan within the estuary of Campground Creek. The
submerged channel of Campground Creek runs along the north side of the site. Site covers a low knoll on
south side of Campground Creek. A line of granite boulders and outcrops lies between the site and creek.
A line of cedar fence posts crosses the tributary just northeast of the site. Knoll was covered by thick
grass at time survey with no woody vegetation. Numerous gopher mounds seen on knoll.
During the first visit to the site, a few pieces of debitage and one Marshall point were discovered on
gopher backdirt mounds on the knoll. The composition of the dirt was a sandy loam, indicating that the
soil had not completely eroded away has it has as other Lake Buchanan sites. One possible hearth was
seen in a low area at northeast edge of the site. Since it lies in line with the granite boulders, it might be a
natural feature. The feature is circular in plan, 160 cm across, and composed of large granite (30 cm)
rocks that do not look burned. Also, a few small (5 cm) burned rocks were seen in gopher backdirt. The
site was initially assessed as a buried, possibly intact camp.
A return visit was made to shovel test the site because it appeared to be one the few shoreline sites with
buried cultural deposits in intact soil. Six shovel tests were dug across the knoll. The tests encountered a
surface layer of sand 3 to 10 cm thick over a 16 to 37 cm thick zone of apparently intact sandy loam
resting on red clay. The tests recovered small amounts of debitage from the loamy soil above the clay, and
one apparently old mussel shell. No burned rock or diagnostic artifacts were recovered. Because the
feature recorded during the first visit does not appear be to a hearth, and because no burned rocks were
recovered during shovel testing, the site was reassessed as a lithic scatter. The siteâs SAL eligibility
remains undetermined because the site requires additional subsurface testing due to the presence of intact
soil.
41LL557
This prehistoric site is located on a terrace about 300 to 500 m northeast of the original Campground
Creek channel. The site lies beneath the normal conservation pool of Lake Buchanan at elevations ranging
from 992 to 1005 ft msl. During an initial visit to the site in April 2012, 19 stone hearths were seen on the
deflated surface of the site. Except for one, all of these features are relatively small hearths measuring
about 60 to70 cm in diameter. The exception is a loose 4x4 m cluster of small burned rocks. Interestingly,
most of these features are composed of a mixture of quartz, chert and granite rocks. Chipped stone
artifacts that were seen at the site included a heavily reworked Gower point, six or more early stage
bifaces, a few cores, dozens of chert flakes and chips, a granite mano, and several sandstone metate
fragments. These materials and the features extended over an area measuring about 290 m on a northwest
to southeast line by 200 m on a northeast to southwest line.

500

The site was revisited in December 2012 when the lake level stood at 992.4 ft, approximately 1 m (3 ft)
lower than during the first visit. During the second visit additional burned rock features were observed at
the lower elevations as were three large surface accumulations of rocks. These surface scatters ranged
from 13x50 m to 25x75 m, and all three scatters extended into the lake waters. The rocks themselves
averaged 5 to 20 cm in diameter. The crew initially thought that the rocks represented deflated hearths
and/or burned rock middens, but closer inspection showed that most of the rocks were chert cobbles
including many that were cores. Additionally, it quickly became evident that hundreds of chert flakes and
chips lay among the cobbles and cores. Within the northernmost of the three rock scatters, individual
flakes lay stacked one atop another suggesting that the accumulation represented a deflated prehistoric
chert quarry. Some early and late stage bifaces were noted in this northern scatter with (Figure 294)
showing a representative sample of the materials observed.
Based on the second surface inspection, the site appears to have functioned both as a campsite and lithic
procurement area. Another lithic procurement site/ campsite, 41LL40, is located on the opposite side of a
small tributary creek about 110 m east of the east edge of 41LL557. The SAL-eligibility of 41LL557 is
considered undetermined because the site has not been shovel tested and because the site probably
extends eastwards under water to the submerged channel of Campground Creek.

Redrock Creek Survey Sector
Judging from the numerous prehistoric campsites along its shores, Redrock Creek must have been one of
the more reliable streams entering the Colorado River from the granite country to the west (Figure 295).

501

In this sector, the Cultural Resources team surveyed 265 acres, mostly along Redrock Creek but also
segments of two right tributaries of this creek, resulting in the recording of 10 sites: 41LL487, 523528,535-537, and the revisiting of 41LL407 where new areas exposed by the drought were investigated.
The whole sector is underlain by granite, with mostly grus exposed on the surface. Consolidated rock for
cooking hearths was available in a few low outcrops, and possibly in the streambeds.
The largest sites (41LL526-528) recorded in this estuary during the shoreline survey are located on the
left (north) side of Redrock Creek on a series of raised lobes separated by swales and ephemeral drainages
(Figure 296). Large sites may have once existed on the south side but have since been obliterated by
development. One exception is the Crawford Site, 41LL407, located on the south side of the creek at the
upper end of the estuary. These large contain dozens of small hearths less than1 m in diameter along with
smaller number of large hearths that probably functioned as earth ovens (Figure 296). These larger
features often contain extremely large rocks, some in excess of 40 cm, capable of storing the large amount
of hearth needed for long cooking periods. These sites were first visited in the summer of 2011 when
many hearth features were exposed in areas within 100 m of the creek channel. When revisited again in
the fall of 2012 to better record the hearths, these features were no longer visible because a brief rise in
the lake earlier in the year caused sand drifts to cover the area. A dense grass cover also made relocating
the features difficult. These later revisits did locate a large number of hearths at 41LL526 and 41LL527
close to the full pool shoreline, an area which was not surveyed during the earlier visit.
Sites 41LL407, 487, and 527 will be described and assessed in the following sections. The other sites in
this survey sector (41LL524-526, 528, 535-537, 568) all represent prehistoric camps positioned along
Redrock Creek or its tributaries. They all contain multiple hearths, groundstone and lithics on apparently
deflated surfaces. Considering their upland locations and the large amount of cultural material exposed on
the surface, substantial intact buried cultural deposits seems unlikely. But because of this uncertainty, the
SAL eligibility of these sites remains undetermined.
It should be noted that 41LL525 also has low granite outcrops with bedrock features consisting of flat
polished areas on the granite surfaces (Figure 297). Similar features were identified on granite outcrops at
Enchanted Rock State Natural Area by Potter (2006), which he called âslicks.â Potter does not offer an
explanation for what âmotor activityâ may have produced the polished surfaces but felt that soft, pliant
material was involved. The slicks at 41LL525 were the only such features identified during the shoreline
survey.
Sites 41LL407, 487, and 527 with be discuss in more detail below. The other nine sites, 41LL523-526,
528, 535-537, all represent prehistoric camps with in most cases multiple burned rock features on deflated
surfaces. Debitage and groundstone fragments are generally common. Little shovel testing was done at
these sites and the presence of any intact buried cultural deposits is undetermined (although not likely).
Also many of these sites probably extended below the water during the time when they were visited by
the Cultural Resources team. For these reason, the SAL-eligibility of the nine sites remains undetermined.

41LL407
Site 41LL407 is located on the south (right) side of the Redrock Creek where a small tributary inters from
the west. The site extends from the near-shore lakebed westwards onto wooded private land above the full
pool of the lake. Little of the lakebed was exposed when the site was recorded in 1993 during a Llano
Uplift Archaeological Society field trip led by LCRA archaeologist Bruce Nightengale. Nightengale
reported 76 hearths similar in form to those reported from the Granite Beach site (41LL2). A bedrock
metate was noted on granite outcrops west of the ownerâs house. There is also a historic component
containing house foundations dating to about 1922 according to the landowners, and other associated
structural remains. However, no structures are shown near this location on either the 1909 or 1925 USGS
topographic maps. The site has been impacted by recent construction and heavy surface collecting but
Nightengale reported that intact areas offer high research potential.
In the winter of 2013, the portion of the site below the full conservation pool of the lake was surveyed by
LUAS members. The lakebed in this area was found to be severely eroded down into the subsoil and
underlying grus. An incised tributary creek of Redrock Creek runs along the south side of the cove
fronting the previously-recorded site area. A few burned granite rock scatters, probably represent the
locations of former hearths, were seen but cultural material was generally sparse. Presumably most
artifacts have been washed away from the area by waves. A Bulverde point was collected from the
lakebed immediately north of tributary channel. Several looter holes were also noted, and it is curious
why anyone would be digging into the presumably culturally sterile grus. A pocket of dark soil was
observed in one of the deeper looter holes located near the shoreline. On closer inspection, no cultural
material was noted in the dark soil, or anywhere in or around this hole and the dark soil could be a natural
feature.
505

The SAL eligibility is assessed as undetermined because of the lack of shovel testing. Erosion appears
particularly severe below the full conservation pool (1020 ft msl) due to wave action, but multiple looter
holes in this area suggest that buried artifacts are present. These artifacts might simply be dispersed in
redeposited sands and gravels. The site is known to continue onto private above the conservation pool,
and this area has a better chance of have SAL-eligible cultural deposits.

41LL487
This prehistoric camp is located on the south side of Coggins Creek about 500 m upstream from its
confluence with Redrock Creek. It occupies a north-facing point of land notable for a group of high
granite outcrops on its northwest side. Within these outcrops are rock-free areas that could have been used
as protected camping areas but no evidence of use was seen. However, one of the granite outcrops
contains a metate or shallow bowl-like mortar hole that is 20cm in diameter and 1 cm deep surrounded by
smooth area 35cm across (Figure 298). This site is located very close to, and probably is the same as one
recorded by A. T. Jackson in 1937, and has since been given the trinomial of 41LL291.
The site was recorded when the lake was at 997 ft when large areas of site were probably still under
water. No vegetation was present although there were scattered stumps. Four parallel rows of quartz rocks
about 1 m wide and up to 10m long run across the sandy area east of the outcrops. These appear to be
natural features.
Six clusters of burned granite rocks were noted in the sands south of the outcrops. One of these features
appears to be concave. The hearths measure 0.5 to 1.0 m across. Artifacts noted at the site include bifaces
of various stages of manufacture, dart point stem, debitage, and burned rocks. The site appears to continue
under water to the northeast towards the submerged Redrock Creek channel. Because of this area has not
been investigated, and because of the lack of shovel testing in the part that has been surveyed, the siteâs
SAL-eligibility remains undetermined.

41LL527
This large prehistoric campsite is located on the left (north) side of Redrock Creek about a mile
downstream from the FM261 crossing. It occupies two lobes projecting southwestwards towards the
creek channel and separated by a swale or small drainage. At the time of the October 2012 survey,
numerous hearths were exposed on the surfaces of both lobes. These probably represent only a small
percentage of the hearths actually present at the site since large areas, particularly those closest to the
creek channel, are covered by sand drifts. Much of the site was also covered by patchy Bermuda grass and
stands of bequilla. In size, as well as the number and type of hearths, this site is similar to 41LL526
immediately upstream, and 41LL528 immediately downstream (Figure 299; Figure 300).
The higher areas of the site lie only a few feet below the full pool elevation of the lake, while the lower
areas closer to the creek are about 20 ft below the full pool. As with so many of the shoreline sites, the
upper soil zone has mostly eroded away and been replaced by sand and gravels. A shovel test placed near
17 cm of loose sand over sterile gravelly clay. The only cultural material recovered was a burned rock the

edge of the creek bank â an area which appeared to have the best chance for intact soil - encountered
within the loose sand. Only the heaviest cultural materials, mostly the rocks that make up the hearth
features, have remained in or near their original locations. In most cases, the rocks that make up these
hearths have been dispersed by waves with only a minority of hearths retaining their compact shape.
Debitage is common on the surface of the redeposited sand. A few cores were noted as well, and one
spurred artifact or graver was found in a pile of flakes left by a recent artifact collector. A few other such
piles were noted across the site and indicate fairly heavy illicit surface collecting. The only artifact
collected for curation was an arrow point preform or possible triangular arrow point found at the north
end of the south lobe.
Fifty-seven burned rock clusters, most probably hearths, were recorded at 41LL527, although as stated
above many more probably lie buried in sand. On the north lobe, the majority of hearths (N=30) are
contained within an area slightly less than one acre in extent about 150 m north of the creek channel. Nine
of these hearths are classified as large, meaning they have a diameter greater than 1 m and are composed
of medium sized (15 cm) to very large (>30 cm) rocks. Interestingly, all the large hearths on the north
lobe are clustered within the east half of this area, whereas at other sites they tend to be spread out.
Between this area and the creek channel, the hearths appear less dense but many may be buried in sand
drifts. On the south lobe, all the visible hearths are located within a small area close to the creek channel.
This area also contains four large hearths.
Although the one shovel test placed in the site showed that the upper soil zone above clay had been
eroded away by waves, more shovel tests would be need to confirm that all areas of the site are similarly
eroded. Therefore, the SAL eligibility of the site is assessed as undetermined.

Blackrock /Granite Beach Survey Sector
This survey sector lies at the southwest corner of Lake Buchanan in areas over a mile from the river
channel (Figure 301). Site density appears unusually high considering the distance from the river and the
lack of perennial streams. Notably, some of the oldest artifacts collected during the shoreline survey and
by earlier archaeologists have come from this sector. This survey sector includes the shoreline in the
vicinity of the LCRAâs Black Rock Park, as well as lakeshore about a mile to the southeast in the Granite
Beach estuary; the total area surveyed in this sector comes to 110 acres.
The exposed lakebed around the Black Rock Park was surveyed in 2011 and the lakebed immediately to
the south was surveyed in 2012. Only two sites, 41LL531 and 41LL553, were recorded during these
surveys, although isolated artifacts and rock clusters resembling hearths were observed in areas not
formally designated as sites. The underlying bedrock is granite, and erosion is particularly severe leaving
a rocky landscape covered by patches of sand and gravels. With no major creeks present and the river
over a mile to the east, the area was marginal for habitation sites. Still, both formally designated sites are
campsites with multiple hearths suggesting that seeps or tinajas provided sufficient if temporary water.

Site 41LL531 will be discussed in greater detail in a following section. Site 41LL553 was only partially
exposed above the lake when recorded and its SAL eligibility is undetermined.
The small Granite Beach estuary, formed by the upper ends of small tributary creeks, contains sites with
large numbers of burned rock features, in particular large rock pavements often surrounded by satellite
rock clusters. Since 2000, LCRA Cultural Resources staff and the Llano Uplift Archaeological Society
have conducted jointly and separately a few small surveys of the shoreline along the south side of the
estuary south of the Granite Beach Site, 41LL2, a Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic site recorded by
Daymond Crawford in 1962 (Crawford 1965). The LCRA/LUAS surveys have resulted in the recording
of two sites, 41LL423 and 41LL508. The 1925 USGS topographic map shows a road passing through
these sites. Within this area is also found a site that A. T. Jackson visited in 1937, 41LL17, which
apparently lies immediately east of 41LL508 in an area that has remained under water.
The two previously recorded sites in this area, 41LL2 (Granite Beach) and 41LL423, have been formally
listed as SALs. Sites 41LL423, 508, and 531 are discussed in the following sections. The other sites
recorded in this sector, 41LL553 at Black Rock, and 41LL576 and 583 near Granite Beach, all represent
deflated prehistoric campsites. None of these sites appears to have been completely exposed when they
were recorded. Because of this and insufficient shovel testing, their SAL eligibility is considered
undetermined. The Granite Beach (41LL2) revisited and very little cultural material was seen in the area
even though the lake was at the same approximate location as when Crawford recorded it.

41LL423
This site, also known as the Dave Schaefer site after the adjacent landowner, was investigated by the
LCRAâs Cultural Resource Services staff and LUAS volunteers on several occasions in the late summer
of 2000. Interest in the site was heightened by the apparent identification of four features thought to be
the remains of prehistoric houses. These features were the type consisting of a circular stone pavement
surrounded by satellite rock clusters. In addition, numerous smaller rock pavement or hearths were also
observed.
The site is located on the west side of a cove about 20 m off the mainland. Several small creek branches
converge within the cove with the site spread out for 100 m along the westernmost channel. At the time of
the survey, the lake was at 2002 ft msl and the site area was freshly exposed with little vegetation
although possibly the eastern edge of the site was still under water.
Two areas of surface material were identified: Area A covering about 500 m2 at the south end of the site
area contains Features #1 and 2 while Area B, a larger area covering about 1100 sq m at the north end
contains Features #3 and 4. Each area contains two of the large circular features that were thought to be
house remains. Feature 1, one of the largest, has a central burned rock pavement that measures 150 by
170 cm. Around it are six unevenly-spaced satellite clusters that average 44 cm in diameter. Many of the
rocks in the surrounding clusters extend down below the current ground surface and are not visible. These
subsurface rocks are also beneath the top surface of the central hearth, thereby suggesting that he rocks

510

are in post holes. These satellite clusters are placed about 1 m out from the outer edge of the central
pavement. The entire feature has a diameter of about 5.8 m.
Feature #2, located about 8 m north-northwest of Feature #1, appears to be oblong in outline with a
diameter of 4.8 m on an east-west line by 3.9 m on a north-south line. There are four surrounding rock
clusters visible on ground surface. Subsurface probing with a sharpened stick indicated that there are
other buried rocks that around the peripheries of each of the four surrounding clusters.
Areas A and B are separated by a 25 m gap where the sandy topsoil either has not eroded as badly or
where sandy topsoil has washed downslope from areas upslope where new homes recently been
constructed. Feature #3 at the south end of Area B, has an overall diameter of 5.9 m and appears to have
evidences of five surrounding rock clusters. Feature #4 is located about 12.5 m north-northeast of the
center of Feature #3. It has a diameter of only about 3.75 m. Four surrounding satellite clusters are
partially visible.
Artifacts noted at the site are typical for prehistoric camps in the area and include debitage, manos,
metates, and burned rock. Points collected during the investigation include an untyped Paleoindian
proximal fragment, a Nolan stem, and a probable Pedernales stem. A collection of points said to come
from the site include a Wilson, a Nolan, a Nolan/Travis, a Martindale-like, and a probable Castroville
fragment.
The site was determined to cover an area measuring 105 m north to south by 40 m east to west. As with
nearly all the lakebed sites, 41LL423 is severely deflated. The large features at the site are fairly well
recorded but smaller ones (hearths) were not mapped or described. The site was formally designated as a
SAL by the THC in 2002.
41LL508
This site was recorded during a 2009 LUAS field trip. Initially, it was thought to be the Granite Beach
Site (41LL2), but after consulting Crawfordâs published map, it appears that the site is located a short
distance to the south of 41LL2. Also, LUAS recovered a Darl point in one of the shovel tests, a type not
reported by Crawford who found only Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic points. Still, in the number and
types of features, it resembles what Crawford reported and it is possible that this site represents the south
part of the Granite Beach Site.
Forty-one stone features were recorded, mostly circular stone pavements between 0.5 and 2 m across. The
larger ones probably representing deflated ovens. At least two of the hearths are surrounded by satellite
rock clusters (Figure 303). Other examples of this type of feature might be present but are hard to separate
from the palimpsest of hearths. There are two rock piles and one crescent-shaped rock scatter, both
features not commonly encountered in the region. A possible cache of 13 chert cobbles was located in the
northwest corner of site on top of the deflated sands amid scattered boulders.
A light surface scatter of chert debitage was noted across the site. Mano and metate fragments were fairly
common. Seven shovel tests were dug at the site, recovering small amounts of debitage and one Darl
point from loose sands in the upper 30 cm overlying sandy, gravelly clay. The shovel test wall profiles
511

and the fact that tree stump roots are exposed indicates that most of the upper soil zone has been eroded
away by wave action, a situation noted by Crawford at 41LL2 in 1962. It appears that the site extends to
the east under water, and perhaps more intact areas exist in that direction. Therefore, 41LL508âs SAL
eligibility remains undetermined.

41LL531
This prehistoric site is located about 450 m south of the entry station at LCRAâs Blackrock Park in an
area that is normally inundated by the Lake Buchanan conservation pool. The site covers an area
measuring about 130 m in diameter and it is situated on the tip of a small terrace that shows on the 1925
Burnet, Texas USGS map at an elevation ranging from 1000 to 1010 ft msl. That map indicates that the
head of a small unnamed tributary creek is located about 100 m northeast of the northeast edge of the site.
At the time that the site was first recorded, ground surface visibility was generally good. Granite
pegmatite seams were noted on the surface of the site leaving scattered fragments of quartz and feldspar
rocks exposed. The site surface was estimated to have been deflated by as much as 30 cm.
At least 12 hearths were seen exposed on ground surface with most of them being circular burned rock
pavements ranging from 50 to 150 cm in diameter. All of these features are thought to be deflated and the
rocks from these features have also been dispersed horizontally to various degrees due to wave action.
Artifacts seen on the surface of the site consist of burned rocks, complete and fragmentary chipped stone
tools, chipped stone debitage and ground stone mano and metate fragments. One Clovis blade fragment
was surface collected as was a complete dart point of the Darl type. The identification of the blade as a
Clovis era artifact was confirmed by Glenn Goode, a lithic specialist. During two subsequent visits to the
site no additional diagnostic artifacts were found, nor was any evidence of vandalism seen. Four shovel
tests were excavated during the last visit to the site. These tests were dug within the southern half of the
site where there were better indications that some topsoil might be present. All four tests showed a 40 to
60 cm thick deposit of mixed sandy loam, granitic grus, and fine and course sands. Only one shovel test,
which was located at the southeast edge of the site yielded any artifacts. Two tertiary flakes and one flake
fragment came from the upper 20 cm of deposits there. The SAL eligibility status of the site is
undetermined pending further shovel testing.
513

Lion Creek Survey Sector
The Lion Creek Survey Sector is located on the east side of the lake where a small dry stream called Lion
Creek enters from the northeast. Staff surveyed 22 acres, resulting in the recording of two prehistoric
campsites, 41BT476 and 41BT492 (Figure 304). These sites lie only about 600 m downstream from the
Lion Creek Site, 41BT105, where excavations by TxDOT archaeologists in the 1970s uncovered circular
stone features thought to be the remains of aboriginal houses (Johnson 1997). Lion Creek barely shows on
the modern USGS topographic map, but the archaeological remains along its bank are substantial and
indicate fairly intensive human activity. Site 41BT476 contains large circular rock features with satellite
clusters similar to those found at 41BT105.
41BT476
This prehistoric site is situated on a low hill on the north side of the Lion Creek channel. Since the area is
often under the waters of Lake Buchanan and has been badly eroded by waves leaving sand and gravel
drifts over bedrock. LCRA owns roughly the western half of the site, which contains the majority of the
burned rock features. The site is notable in having multiple circular features â large hearth pavements
surrounded by burned rock satellite clusters â very similar to the features excavated at Lion Creek
(41BT215) and Graham/Applegate (41LL419) (see Chapters 5 and 9). Informant testimony strongly
suggests that the site formed primarily during the Austin phase, dated to between AD 800 to AD 1300,
and the site is therefore the only one recorded during the shoreline survey that is known to belong
primarily to a single cultural group. The entire site area is underlain by granite bedrock but sandstone
outcrops a short distance away on the present-day mainland to the southeast. Granite outcrops are located
east of the main site area with small outcrops along the north and west edges of the site along the 997 ft
contour. Scattered cedar stumps are present.
There are two distinct areas (Areas A and B) of scattered burned granite rock in which hearths (circular to
oval granite pavements) can be discerned, in addition to isolated hearths outside these burned rock
scatters (Figure 306). At least four large hearths with satellite clusters are present. Two of these are
unusually large for the area: Feature 1 is 2.33 by 1.85 m and Feature 5 is circular and about 2 m across.
Another large hearth, Feature 2, is 2.42 by 2.6 m and is surrounded by loosely scattered burned rock but
no obvious satellite clusters. At least 18 smaller (1 m average diameter) hearths are present, some of
which might have one or two small satellite clusters.
During one of the visits to the site, a Scallorn arrow point was collected. Also noted but not collected
were 2 cores, 2 burned sandstone metate fragments and hundreds of pieces of debitage.
Small areas of this site might still lie beneath the water to the north. For this reason, and because the site
has not been shovel tested to see if intact buried cultural material is present, the siteâs SAL eligibility is
assessed as undetermined.

Figure 306. Map of 41BT476.

41BT492
This is an extensive prehistoric camp located on a broad point of land bordered by Lion Creek on the on
the east and a left tributary creek on the west. The 1925 USGS topo map shows Lion Creek making a
bend to the east about 200 m north of the part of the site exposed during the drought. The topographic
map shows the point of land rising 40 ft above the creek. Two small narrow peninsulas project out into
the lake from the northeast and northwest ends of the point, and these appear as projections on the 980 ft
contour of 1925 topo map. The northeast projection contains the densest exposed cultural deposits.
At the time of the survey in October, 2013, the site area was covered by dense Bermuda grass and
bequilla shrubs, except for a narrow 3 to 6 m wide zone along the shoreline. Granite outcrops are fairly
frequent on the point, especially near the north end, but deep gravelly soil and sand drifts predominate. A
shovel test placed at the neck of the northwest peninsula mentioned above encountered 25 cm-thick
surface deposits of sand and gravel over gravelly loam, suggesting that at least some of the upper soil
zone is still intact in that area.

516

Eight burned rock clusters (hearths) were noted during the survey. The best preserved is probably
representative of what the rest originally looked like before wave dispersal; it is a tight circular cluster of
granite rocks 85 cm in diameter, with rocks ranging in size between 10 and 15 cm in diameter. No
extremely large burned rock clusters over 120 cm were noted, such as those found across the Lion Creek
channel at 41BT476. In addition to these features, there is a fairly dense area of burned rock where looters
have been digging on a narrow peninsula at the northwest corner of the site. These rocks probably
represent at least four additional hearths.
Three projectile points were collected from the surface at the northwest end of the site. All three were too
fragmentary or reworked to identify the types. In addition, debitage covers most of the site areas with the
densest areas at the northwest corner of the site. Sandstone metate fragments are common in many of the
burned rock clusters. One cluster also has a sandstone mano. Thirty-two pieces of debitage were
recovered from the shovel test noted above, although nearly all these artifacts were recovered from the
redeposited sand and gravels.
The investigations at 41BT492 were not sufficient to determine the siteâs SAL eligibility. More shovel
testing would be needed across the site area to learn if intact buried cultural deposits are present. For this
reason, and because the site most likely extends northwards under the lake, the SAL eligibility is assessed
as undetermined.

CHAPTER 8: DISCUSSION OF PREHISTORIC SITES

Introduction
A total of 76 sites with prehistoric components were investigated during the survey. These sites consist of
66 campsites, 1 burned rock midden, 7 lithic scatters and 2 lithic procurement sites (Table 7).
Additionally, two of the sites listed as campsites also showed evidences of lithic procurement activities.
Except for three previously recorded sites that were revisited, all other sites with prehistoric components
are newly recorded ones. Collections made at the sites were mostly limited to diagnostic tools that would
aid in dating the occupations. Numerous burned rock features were recorded at the prehistoric sites, and
this data set will be the primary focus of analysis in three subsequent chapters.

Landform Settings of Prehistoric Sites
The vast majority of the sites investigated during the current survey are situated on upland terraces that
have been exposed by the ongoing drought. Previous work by Jackson during the original survey of the
reservoir area in the 1930s focused on the lower terraces closer to the river channel. Extremely few of
Jacksonâs sites have been exposed by the drought. In a sense, the current shoreline survey fills the gap in
terms of landform setting and has the potential to provide data on the overall settlement pattern on this
section of the Colorado River.
The shoreline survey data demonstrate the utilization of the upland terraces as temporary campsites and
other prehistoric activity areas. The use of burned rock features for cooking and heating features is
evident at almost all sites. Sizeable quantities of chert debitage, cores, and tools are also present at the
these sites as are ground stone artifacts of various available stone material types including sandstone,
limestone, quartzite, and granite.
Lithic Artifacts
Projectile points are the most commonly collected artifacts from the sites due to the chronological data
that these specimens provide. As of October 30, 2013, a total of 69 projectile points had been recovered
from sites during the shoreline survey of Lake Buchanan. Of these, 48 can be placed into recognized
types that are diagnostic of specific time periods while the remaining 19 are either too fragmentary to be
typed or do not align with any established types or do not have characteristics of certain time periods.
There is also one unique artifact, a Clovis blade that is diagnostic of a specific time period.
A sequence of chronological periods that borrows from sequences proposed by Johnson and Goode
(1994) and Prewitt (1981) is utilized for assessing the temporal placement of diagnostic projectile points
from Lake Buchanan. From earliest to latest in time, these chronological periods are as follows:
Paleoindian (pre 6500 B.C.), Early Archaic (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3500 to 2200 B.C.),
Late Archaic I (2200 to 50 B.C.), Late Archaic II (50 B.C. to A.D. 700), Austin (A.D. 700 to 1250),
Toyah (A.D. 1250 to 1700) and Historic Indian (A.D. 1700 to 1875).
Table 8 shows the numbers of projectile points and the unique Clovis blade that can be assigned to each
of these periods. At the early end of the spectrum, there are few examples. Diagnostic artifacts for each
time period are as follows: four Paleoindian, two Early Archaic,, five Middle Archaic, 15 Late Archaic I,
15 Late Archaic II, six Austin Phase, and two Toyah Phase. The majority of the projectile points date to
the Late Archaic I (n=15) and Late Archaic II (n=15) periods. It should be noted that one of Toyah
diagnostics is a Fresno arrow point that might actually date later than A.D. 1700 and thus could be
520

associated with Historic Indian groups. For the current study, the Fresno specimens are conservatively
placed in the Toyah Period.
The Late Archaic I and II diagnostics tie as the most commonly recognized diagnostic artifacts and
together constitute 61% of all recognizable diagnostic artifacts. Johnson and Goode (1994) have described
the two subdivisions for the Late Archaic in Central Texas with the first reflecting a population increase
and the second occurring later as local groups begin to utilize ceremonial rituals and follow a religious
ideology linked to Eastern Woodlands cultures. In earlier literature, Story (1981:146) had previously
suggested that there was a dramatic increase in human populations in the Late Archaic in East Texas.
Fields et al. (2000:17) have noted that Late Archaic components have the âdensest concentrations of
cultural materialsâ in sites along the northeast edge of Central Texas. Prikryl (1990:74) had also found
that Late Archaic diagnostic projectile points were predominant in his much larger collection of 1,273
dart points from sites on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River in north central Texas. There, 80 percent of all
typeable dart points from a sample of 1,273 dart points were assigned to the Late Archaic Period. Further,
the number of sites with Late Archaic diagnostics was three and one-half times greater than the preceding
Middle Archaic Period in Prikrylâs sample of 238 sites. In the Lake Buchanan sample, the number of Late
Archaic I artifacts is three times greater than that of the preceding Middle Archaic Period. If the Late
Archaic I and II specimens are combined, their number is six times greater than the Middle Archaic.
Although entire Late Archaic time period is twice as long as the Middle Archaic and three times as long
as the combined Late Prehistoric periods, the Lake Buchanan projectile point sample may reflect an actual
Late Archaic population increase. Such a population increase may have lead to more competition for food
resources and preferred campsite areas. Thus, some Late Archaic hunter-gatherers may have been led to
more heavily utilize upland terraces for temporary campsites and/or resource procurement areas when all
lowland terrace spaces were occupied or used by other groups. As previously stated, most of the current
shoreline survey of drought-exposed areas at Lake Buchanan consist of upland terraces.
Other prehistoric tools that were collected consist of complete and fragmentary bifaces, bifacial and
unifacial scrapers, perforators, edge modified flakes, spokeshaves, debitage, overshot flakes, cores,
manos, and notched stones. Aside from the debitage that was collected from shovel tests at two sites, the
artifact totals in these categories are small and do not provide meaningful data (see Table 8).

CHAPTER 9: SITE FORMATION PROCESS STUDY
By Andrew F. Malof
In April, 1994, Mike McGuirt, who was working with Bruce Nightengale at LCRA, began a hearth
documentation study at 41BT303. Working without the benefit of GPS, he triangulated from two large
oak trees to what he called Hearth 1, then using that as his study datum mapped in three additional
hearths. A metal spike was placed three meters upslope of each feature. All four hearths were
photodocumented. Although detailed feature descriptions were not made, McGuirt stated that they were
all relatively intact. The stated research design was to determine the long-term effects of fluctuating lake
levels with an assumption that the features would be moving, and presumably such movement could be
tracked by way of the individual feature datums. The four hearths were chosen for their locations either at
or immediately below normal pool elevation. Records at LCRA indicated the lake was at approximately
1012 msl through that month. It was hoped that these features would be visited annually and a
photographic record maintained. It was not until December 2012, that a formal attempt to relocate these
hearths was made.
Following on McGuirtâs example, in October, 2011, a similar project was started at 41LLL542, located
about 7 km south of 41BT303. In this case a large cypress stump had a large nail driven into it and was
also plotted with a GPS instrument with an accuracy of about 3 meters. Three hearth-like features were
then tied to this datum by way of a tape measure and compass bearings as well as individual coordinates.
Topographically, the two sites stand in stark contrast to each other. Site 41BT303 is located adjacent to
the modern Colorado River and in fact the georeferenced 1909 map shows the site on the opposite bank of
the river. More accurately, it is located about 180 m east of the river channel near the junction of the
unnamed, spring-fed tributary that helps form Willow Slough. Site 41LL542 appears to be on the north
bank of Campground Creek 1.5 km southwest from the nearest bank of the river and 3.8 km northwest
(upstream) of the junction of the creek and the river.
Site 41LL542 is sheltered from the river by the ridge system that comprises Shaw Island and that held the
road to Bluffton. Prior to dam construction, 41BT303 would likely have suffered direct impacts from
river flooding, while 41LL542 would be most directly impacted by flooding on the nearby creek. Site
41LL542 is about 470 horizontal m from the normal pool elevation while 41BT303 is basically at normal
pool. The two sites therefore would potentially have very different periods of impacts from wave action
and from fluctuating lake levels in recent times.
An analysis of almost 70 years of lake level data, from the time of reservoir completion to the present,
was conducted to better gauge potential recent impacts.
Figure 307 illustrates the average elevation during each of the twelve months between 1943 and 2012
(levels are only present from October through December of 1942). The bars indicate the elevation at the
end of January and December of each year, with black bars indicating a lower elevation at the end of the
year, and a white bar indicating a higher elevation. The lines represent the high and low elevations across
the entirety of the year. For example, in 1994 the beginning and elevations were very similar, however the

526

elevations ranged throughout the year from a low of 1011.38 in October and a high of 1017.96 in June.
Conversely, in 2005 the beginning and ending elevations contain the entire range of fluctuation. Any year
in question may have multiple fluctuations across an elevation that was present during that time, and that
can be determined by examining the underlying data. Included in the figure is a trendline clearly
illustrating the current drought, and the gray outlined box highlights the period between 1993, when the
features at 41BT303 were documented, and the present. Importantly, the figure also illustrates that at
elevations above 1010 msl there have been numerous fluctuations, while below 1000, and markedly
below 995 msl, there have been relatively few. This, of course, has implications for site integrity based
upon the siteâs location within the basin.
Fluctuation, in and of itself, does not necessarily create conditions severely detrimental to site
preservation. Other complicating factors include aspect (direction the site is facing), fetch (the area of
water traversed by wind), the slope of the land containing the site, the types of soils, wind direction and
speed, and resultant wave action (Ware, 1989; Ebert et al. 1989), and even the annual overturn of cool and
warm waters which can result in reposition of extremely fine sediments (Lenihan et al. 1981). While
Ebert et al. describe the state of physical disequilibrium encountered when a reservoir first fills, they also
tried to determine whether stability might be reached later in time. At three of the reservoir sites they
studied they use regression analysis to determine possible extinction dates, times at which the sites would
be completely destroyed, and life expectancies were limited to no more than 30 years.

Figure 307. Average lake levels (y-axis) for each full year (x-axis) between 1943 and 2012.

Given the clearly deflated nature of many of the archaeological sites on Lake Buchanan it seems clear that
wave action and lake fluctuations are largely responsible for removal of sediments that were present when
the lake was constructed. Even seemingly intact features are usually resting upon basal clays and the
numerous cypress stumps typically show 30-40 cm or more of soil removal since the time of cutting.
Using tools for ArcGIS developed by David Finlayson (2005, in Rohweder et al. 2008) and refined by a
team of USGS and USACE researchers (Rohweder et al. 2008), the fetch and bathymetric contours of
Lake Buchanan were used to calculate potential wave height based on seasonal wind speed and direction.
This was performed for two different lake levels, full (1020 msl) and 990 msl, in order to develop
predictive maps of locations in the basin that would be least affected by wave action, as well as to aid in
comparing the locations of 41BT303 and 41LL542.
Wind was approximated by using wind rose data available from the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality and compiled for Austin between 1984 and 1992 (TCEQ 2012) (Figure 308). This data clearly
shows the predominant winds as coming from the south and southeast with the strongest sustained winds
at usually no more than about 18 mph. While northerly winds are much less common, they are also more
likely to reach speeds as high as 25 mph. Based on this information, and in order to keep the model
simple, the northerly fetch was calculated at 10 degrees with a wave-inducing wind at 25 mph and the
southerly fetch was calculated at 170 degrees with a wind at 20 mph. Table 10 demonstrates that the
greater the fetch and the higher the wind speed, the higher the resultant wave, and that waves coming
from the north would be of greater magnitude, in general, than those coming from the south.

Figure 308. Austin, Texas wind rose data for 1984-1992

While this is certainly intuitive, a graphic representation (map) begins to show where highest waves are
likely to be present year round, and more importantly, illustrates where more sheltered areas are likely to
be found. By using weighted overlay tools available in ArcGIS, the wave heights were divided into five
equal classifications with north and south fetches combined for normal pool elevation (1020 msl) and 990
528

msl. Winter fetch was weighted at 60 percent and summer fetch at 40 percent. The process recalculates
cells in the representation (raster) and ranks them according to relative importance (in this case wave
height, 1 being lowest and 5 being highest). The result is a model than can be used to aid designing
survey strategies (Figure 309). Sites that are near the 1020 msl contour in protected areas can be targeted
for additional investigations. Likewise, those sites that are in the vicinity of the 990 msl contour are
largely sheltered from waves at higher elevations but become exposed when the lake recedes.
Additionally, the Shaw Island peninsula clearly provides a shadow effect to both the north and the south,
as to varying degrees do other smaller landforms both along the perimeter and within the body of the lake.

Site 41BT303 is located far upstream, is not affected by waves below about 1010 msl, and is in a second
order wave location. Site 41LL542, situated close the 990 elevation is in a third order wave category.
Complicating things, of course, is the greater amount of historical fluctuation around 1020 msl, compared
with relatively little fluctuation across the 990 contour. When comparing features between the two sites,
however, a greater degree of disruption is apparent at 41LL542, while at 41BT303 limited deposition may
be occurring.
At 41BT303 three of the four originally documented hearths (Features 1-3;Table 11) were relocated with
aid of triangulated tape measures and a metal detector which identified all three of the original datum
pins. These were all on the gently sloping north-facing shallow terrace of Willow Slough (Figure 310). A
fourth hearth apparently rested upon a rocky spine and no trace of it could be found. The three hearths
were all found partially buried in dense Bermuda grass and thin soil. It did not appear that they had
moved, but they had clearly been rearranged. Feature 2 was partially exposed (then reburied) in order to
more fully understand its level of preservation (Figure 311). While very difficult to compare directly
through photographs, it appears to have been buried rather than exposed over time, thus maintaining at
least some degree of integrity over almost 20 years.
Site 41LL542, while relatively sheltered from south-northerly waves, receives moderate wave impacts
from the south, according to the model. The site is located on one of a series of south-trending lobes that
tend to be rocky around the perimeters and sandy on top (
Figure 312). It is also easily accessible by nearby landowners, and vehicular traffic is not uncommon in
the area and at the site. The site, when first recorded was at an elevation of 989 msl to about 995 msl.
Three burned rock features (Features 819, 820 and 857, corresponding with GPS log numbers) were
photographed and described (Table 12). Four nondescript chert artifacts were added to Feature 819, both
within and around the feature (Figure 313).

Site 41LLL542 was recorded in October 2011. Examining monthly minimum elevations, it would have
been submerged between Jan 2010 to August 2011, re-covered in April 2012 then re-exposed in August
2012. In the time between initial recording and the revisit in December 2012, there was a six month
period where minimum water levels hovered between 996.41 and 994.37 during which the features likely
were partially exposed or covered only by a foot or so of water.
Feature 819 appeared to be largely intact, and been covered partially with sediments. Someone had drawn
a line in the sand around it which was a curious coincidence. The four artifacts could not be located and it
is suspected they were removed by collectors.
Feature 820, while maintaining much of its structural integrity, had deflated partially onto basal clays and
exposing rocks more fully. Close examination of the two pictures show rearrangement of certain rocks
into a seemingly less-random arrangement.
Feature 857 illustrates the complexity of the inundation problem. In 2011 an emergent, apparent small
hearth was documented about 1 m northwest of a larger, mostly exposed hearth. The 2012 revisit showed
532

the smaller feature at least 50 percent more exposed and somewhat redistributed. The large feature,
meanwhile, was more than 50 percent covered by sediments. However, a distinctive rock next to a
cypress stump had not moved or changed in position at all.
The comparison of sites 41BT303 and 41LL542 provide preliminary support for the wave model. Even
though the lake had moved across the features at 41BT303 with a predicted wave magnitude of 2 at least
six times since 1994 (and about 30 times in the last 70 years) they were still in (or very close to) their
regional positions. It should be noted that the feature datums â large galvanized spikes â were at various
angles from perpendicular, so wave forces had certainly been present.
At 41LL542, exposed with a predicted wave magnitude of 3 only seven times since dam construction,
(three in the last four years), there is clear evidence of internal feature redistribution. Human impacts
(traffic, collecting) have contributed, but wave magnitude is likely the primary causative factor and can
vary even across micro-relief topography.
Various surveys at differing locations may also support the model. At the southern end of the basin are
numerous sites that appear to contain intact rock features, yet have almost no soil associated with them,
and as noted elsewhere, in some instances an almost complete lack of artifacts, presumably washed away.
When soil is present it is often undeveloped sediment resting over clay (Figure 314). Wave magnitudes
are predicted at 3 and 4.
Meanwhile, survey along the 990 contour between White Bluff and Garrett island, where wave
magnitudes are predicted between 1 and 2, there are locations where there appears to be intact, developed
soils, sometimes in excess of 30-40 in depth (
Figure 315). Furthermore, no archaeological sites were identified in that area. Systematic subsurface
testing would be required.
The described model is a simplification of a simplification (Rohweder et al. 2008:11). In addition to wave
height, length of the wave (distance between crests), the period of the wave (time between wave crests),
the orbital velocity (which can suspend sediments) and shear stress (how much drag is created across the
bed surface) (Rohweder et al. 2008:14-15). Include the sediment load entering the lake from the Colorado
River and settling differentially based on particle size and flow rates and the number of factors could
expand exponentially. By focusing simply on the wave model, in part as a proxy for other aspects, a basic
exploratory framework can be explored and tested.

CHAPTER 10: PREHISTORIC BURNED ROCK FEATURES
By Charles A. Hixson

Burned rock clusters are a common feature in many of the prehistoric sites along the shoreline of Lake
Buchanan â over 700 were recorded during the shoreline survey (Table 13). Archaeologists working on
the Edwards Plateau have traditionally referred to these rock clusters as hearths (Black 2003: 377-378). In
recent years, much research has been directed towards understanding how these features might have
actually operated and the types of foods cooked in them (Ellis 1997, Black 2003). Black (2003: 378-379)
argues that most of the larger circular arrangements of rocks that occur at prehistoric sites in the region
are the remains of earth ovens. The rocks themselves are but one component of these ovens and the only
one that usually survives in archaeological sites. The rocks serve as thermal elements to store heat
generated by fires which could then be use used to cook food. Earth ovens, while in use, consist of
superimposed layers of thermal elements (usually rocks), food protected by packing materials such as
grass, and finally an earthen layer to seal in the heat (Black 2003:279).
The condition of the Lake Buchanan burned rock features varied considerably, from completely dispersed
to compact clusters. Presumably while in use, all, or nearly all, these features contained a tight cluster of
thermal elements (rocks), keeping in mind that some burned rock concentrations could represent oven
cleanouts. At 41LL527 on Redrock Creek, 16 of the 57 hearths recorded were dispersed with widely
scattered burned rocks, and another nine were slightly dispersed (Table 14). Only four hearths were found
to have tightly clustered rocks whose diameter could be accurately measured. Considering the upland
setting of these sites, dispersal of the thermal element probably began soon after abandonment of the
hearths and ovens because of exposure on the ground surface. However, the excavations at the
Graham/Applegate site (41LL419) have shown that upland hearths and ovens can be well preserved in
granitic soils, probably because of rapid burial by pedoturbation of sandy, gravelly soils (Hixson 2012).
These same sandy soils are also more prone to destabilization when inundated, and easily eroded by
waves. Therefore, dispersal of the burned rock features on the lakebed probably occurred after
impoundment of the reservoir.
While nearly all the Lake Buchanan hearths have been deflated and their rocks moved to various degrees
by the force of waves, their plan-view shapes have often been preserved. A few even appear to have some
vertical integrity, in that they retain a concave shape (Figure 316). Even if the shape of the features have
been distorted by waves, their mass can still be measured, which as mentioned earlier, can give an
indication of the kinds and amount of food cooked in the features (Black 2003). In a few examples,
charred plant material appears to be present among the hearth rocks. This material can in some instances
be the remains of the plants that were being cooked in the ovens, but are more likely to be charred wood
from the fuel used to heat the rocks. For example, at Graham/Applegate, live oak wood is the most
common carbonized plant species found in both ovens and hearths (Bush 2005). The only charred plant
materials from Graham/Applegate that could be considered to be food remains, are one small fragment of
wild onion and another of wild hyacinth (camas), both from the burned rock midden. Both plants have
been found in prehistoric burned rock features elsewhere in central Texas and probably constitute that

537

main type of food baked in earth ovens in the eastern part of the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998, Mauldin
et al 2003).
There does seem to be an important distinction between large hearths, which are defined as being greater
the 1 m in diameter, and small hearths, which are defined as being less than 1 m in diameter (Black
2003:384). Large hearths, because of the large mass of their thermal elements, are capable of storing the
amount of heat needed for long cooking periods, perhaps several days. This would make them suitable for
cooking geophytes and certain members of the Agavaceae family, providing enough heat over time for
the process of hydrolysis to break down long-change carbohydrates into more digestible sugars [Black
(2003) citing Wandsnider (1997)]. Smaller hearths were probably used to cook a wider variety of food
that only requires shorter cooking periods. Possible foods that might have been cooked in small hearths or
ovens include freshwater mussels and meat. At Graham/Applegate, mussel shells appear to particularly
numerous in Block A, which contains only small hearths. Small hearths may also have been used for
warmth, either within or outside of dwellings.(Black 2003).
At Graham/Applegate, eight of the 49 hearths are presumed to have functioned as large ovens, because of
their diameter and inferred weight. All of these oven-sized hearths measure 1 m or more in maximum
diameter.

Rock Types in Burned Rock Features
Small hearths are often composed of more than one type of rock, usually mirroring the types of rocks
available in the immediate area. In granite areas, small hearths are composed principally of granite
although a few large fragments of quartz (which is one of the minerals in granite) are not uncommon. In
some instances, as at 41LL557 on the north side of Campground Creek, some small hearths are composed
exclusively of quartz. In nearby sites, some small hearths are composed of chert clasts where extensive
cobbles beds are found. An interesting phenomenon seen at two sites, 41LL508 and 41LL537, consists of
an pair of adjacent hearths, one composed of quartz rocks and the other of granite (Figure 318). It is
possible that the quartz âhearthâ actually represents a culling pile, where unsuitable quartz rocks were
removed from an existing hearth, with only the granite rocks being reused in a new hearth.
All the Large Hearths recorded during the survey were composed of granite rocks. These features
occurred in areas where granite is the predominant bedrock, although quartz and in places chert would
have also been available. It might be that the large-sized rocks favored for ovens were only available as
granite, although thermal properties must be considered.
Large Hearths
Large hearths were recorded at 14 of the 85 prehistoric camps investigated during the shoreline survey.
They range in size from 1 m (the lower cutoff limit for this feature type) up to 2.4 by 2.6 m for the largest
(Feature 2 at 41BT476). Large hearths usually represent just a fraction of the hearths found at a particular
site, although one site, 41LL558, had two large hearths and no other discernible feature. Large features
were often found in sites (N=8) that lie along ephemeral drainages.

544

Figure 318. Two small hearths at 41LL508; the southern (upper) hearth is composed of granite rocks, the northern
one of quartz.

As will be discussed further in Chapter 11, large hearths probably functioned as ovens used to bake
certain types of plant foods that require long exposure to heat to render them edible. They essentially had
the same function as the âcircular featuresâ described below, but lack the surrounding clusters of burned
rocks that probably represent cleanout rock piles or stockpiled rocks. Because they lack these associated
features, it is possible that large hearths used only once or for a very limited number of cooking events.
Their presence in small campsites shows that these relatively elaborate cooking features were not limited
to long-term camps.
Burned Rock Middens
Only one site recorded during the shoreline survey contained any burned rock midden features. This site,
41BT465, is located in an area with sandstone outcrops, and the two middens at this site are composed of
this rock type. Both middens were exposed on the shoreline at the time of the site was first visited, and
were mostly under water during subsequent visits to the site. They appeared as flat pavements of firecracked sandstone rocks without any obvious relief. Because sand drifts covered portions of the middens,
and because both features were still partially under water when recorded, their exact dimensions are
undetermined. Also, no shovel testing was done in the middens to determine their thickness. The larger of
two is located on the south edge of the known site area and was estimated to measure about 20 meters
across. The smaller one is located about 80 meters to the northeast and was estimated to be about eight
meters across.
Importantly, no middens were recorded on areas of the shoreline underlain by granite. As mentioned
before in this report, burned rock middens are known to be rare in the granite areas of the Llano Uplift
region (Jackson n.d., Creel 1997, Black 2000). To my knowledge, only three sites with burned rock
545

middens composed primarily of granite rocks have been recorded. This does not include the so-called
sheet midden at 41BT106, which consists of a large one-rock-thick concentration of apparently unburned
granite rocks (Young 1985). One of the granite burned rock middens is found at 41BT60 in Inks Lake
State Park where test excavations exposed portions of dense burned granite deposits (Drake 1996).
Another site is 41LL359 on the south side of Lake LBJ, where in the early 1990s LCRA archaeologists
recorded two granite middens, one 15 m in diameter, the other slightly smaller.
The third site with a granite midden is Graham/Applegate, 41LL419, which is the only granite midden
that has been thoroughly investigated by excavation. The 41LL419 burned rock midden is annular in form
and slightly oval in plan, being 10.5 m in length north to south and 9.7 m east to west, and 40 cm in
maximum thickness. Before excavation, a thin layer of organic-rich gravelly soil and leaf litter obscured
the surface of the midden. This feature was discovered by a randomly-placed test pit, which encountered a
layer of burned granite rock a few centimeters below the ground surface. Once the test pit revealed the
presence of this feature, the surrounding area was carefully examined for any sign of a mound no matter
how slight, and for a depression that could mark the center of the midden. No mound was seen but a small
depression was noticed southeast of the test pit. This depression later turned out to be an old animal
burrow that lay outside the midden.
Because the 41LL419 midden was so inconspicuous, one explanation for the low number of recorded
granite middens might be their low visibility compared to middens in limestone areas. This could be a
consequence of the sandy and gravelly soils that typically develop over granite (or over grus). However,
the Lake Buchanan shoreline surveys of areas underlain by granite failed to locate any middens. In
contrast, two sandstone middens were found at 41BT465 at the north end of the lake, which is underlain
primarily by sandstone. Jackson (1938) recorded five âmoundâ sites (which include burned rock middens
â see discussion in Chapter 5 Previous Investigations) in the portion of the basin of Lake Buchanan
underlain by sedimentary rock but none in the granite areas (Figure 328). Taken all together, this would
seem to confirm Blackâs (2002) assertion that granite middens are in actuality rare compared to those of
limestone and sandstone and not simply under-represented. Still, low visibility must be a factor in the
near absence of recorded middens in the Llano Uplift because of the Graham/Applegate experience.
While granite middens might be rare, granite hearths including those of oven size - greater than 1 m in
diameter - are common. The Buchanan shoreline survey recorded one site, 41LL542, with over 40 granite
hearths, and 41BT476 and 41LL508 have numerous large oven-sized hearths of granite, so the contention
that prehistoric people tended to avoid granite as a cooking stone is not supported by the evidence. The
reason for the lack of granite middens probably has to do with the life-use of oven pits. In other words,
they were not reused enough times for a midden to form around them. An explanation for the limited use
of granite ovens by aboriginal people is given in Chapter 11.

Large Hearths with Satellite Rock Clusters (Circular Features)
A section here is devoted to these unusual features of which around 20 are known on the lakebed of Lake
Buchanan. Eight of these were recorded during the shoreline survey. They consist of a circular pavement
546

of rocks usually with a diameter greater than 1 m surrounded (or partially surrounded) by rock clusters of
various sizes and shapes. They were first identified in 1962 at three sites (41BT72, 41BT73, and 41LL58)
exposed by a severe drought (Tunnell 1962, Davis 1962). Tunnell (1962) called them âcircular features,â
a term that will be used here in this report (Figure 319).
Overall dimensions of the Lake Buchanan circular features range from a low of 3 m to the largest at 5.8 m
(Table 15). The average diameter of the central hearths is 1.6 m, with the largest measuring 1.9 by 2.4 m.
Most of the circular features recorded during the shoreline survey did not have discrete satellite clusters,
such as those recorded at the Lion Creek site, but instead were surrounded by a zone of scattered burned
rocks. Tunnell (1962) recorded four to eight satellite clusters for the features at 41BT72 and 41LL58. All
the features recorded during the shoreline survey, and probably those recorded by Tunnell as well, were
resting on eroded surfaces and no stained soil or charcoal was observed around the burned rocks.
Davis (1962) was the first to suggest that the circular features might be the remains of structures, but he
noted that the central burned rock features were so large in relation to the overall size of the structures
that there would be little space for occupants. He went on to say that perhaps these features functioned as
sweat lodges. Similar features were later uncovered by excavations at 41BT105, which lies 100 m east of
the full pool shoreline of Lake Buchanan on Lion Creek (Johnson 1997). Johnson concluded that a strong
case could be made that two of the three features at the Lion Creek Site were habitation structures. A
large example of this kind of feature, 6 m across, was also excavated at 41CC112, which lies 120 miles
upstream on the Colorado River in Concho County (Lintz et al. 1995). This feature was dated to the Early
Archaic and the excavators concluded that it represented the remains of a habitation structure. Other
examples of circular features in the state have been published as well (see Lintz et al. 1995), but for the
most part - considering the large number of hearth features studied in the state - relatively few examples
of this type of feature have been reported outside of the Lake Buchanan area.
It must be noted that many large hearths have one or two satellite burned rock clusters, or a light scatter
of burned rocks some distance out from the periphery of the central hearth. A few small hearths
(diameters less than 1 m) also had apparent satellite rock clusters. Such hearths were not classified as
circular features during the survey, but probably form from the same kinds of activities, as will discussed
in the following chapter.

CHAPTER 11: A NEW HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN THE LARGE BURNED ROCK
FEATURES WITH SATELLITE CLUSTERS
By Charles A. Hixson

From the time these stone circles were first identified as a specific feature type in 1962, they have
presented interpretive problems. Tunnel (1962) considered them to be a group of hearths or hearth-like
features but couldnât explain their peculiar arrangement (Figure 320; Figure 321). Davis (1962) was
perhaps the first to suggest that these features might be structures although he acknowledged that the large
central hearth severely limited the amount of living space unless, as he speculated, they were used as
sweat lodges. The excavations at 41BT105 and 41CC112 bolstered the interpretation that these features
might be the remains of structures and specifically houses.
It is not surprising that Davis thought these features could represent house floors. Stone rings are a
familiar archaeological feature in regions to the west of Lake Buchanan where they are usually interpreted
as houses or other structural remains. For example, stone circles similar in size to the Lake Buchanan
circular features are interpreted as âtipi ringsâ at sites belonging to the Infierno phase the Lower Pecos
region (Turpin and Bement 1989) and as âstone-based dwellingsâ in Cielo complex sites of the Big Bend
(Mallouf 1999). These features, the Lake Buchanan circular features and the stone rings in the Lower
Pecos and Big Bend, do share traits with house floors of hunter-gathers documented in the ethnographic
present who live in similar environments and with similar (semi-nomadic) mobility inferred for much of
Late Prehistoric Texas (Binford 1970). Analogy-based interpretation has always been an important part of
archaeological reasoning. Wylie (2002) points out that most, if not all, archaeological inference is based
on analogy. Analogy is basically the way humans impart meaning to objects never previously
experienced. But even before the New Archaeology of the 1960s, archaeologists were expressing
concerns about the unreliability of analogies, especially those based solely on formal similarities.
A formal analogy is a situation in which similarities between the archaeological subject and something
more familiar or more fully understood are used to infer further, undetermined similarities. In a purely
formal analogy, the similarities between the cultural and environmental context of the archaeological
manifestation or subject and that of the source of the analogy or analog, are not necessarily close. The
subject in our case is the circular feature and the source of the analogy or analog is the ethnographic
hunter-gatherer house (or archaeological house remains such as tipi rings). Because the archaeological
feature and the ethnographic house share a circular floor plan, sometimes outlined by stones and often
with a centrally-placed hearth, then the former might represent an example of the latter. One problem of
formal analogies is that multiple analogs can be found for the same archaeological subject: Tunnell and
Davis came up with separate interpretations based on different analogs. Other analogs are also possible,
as Youngblood (1998) points out in reviewing Johnson (1997), and offers as an alternative hypothesis that
the rock clusters at Lion Creek might have supported posts for a smoking or roasting rack. For this
present argument, only the house and oven interpretations will be considered, not so much to conclusively
prove one or the other, but to show that the oven analog is more convincing than the house analog.

Hodder (1982) lists several ways in which formal analogies can be strengthened. One is simply to
increase the number of attributes between the subject and source to the point where the connection is
nearly obvious. We can already see that the circular features share several traits with both competing
analogs and from a formal perspective neither provides a clear choice over the other. Another way to
strengthen the analogy is to look for modern or historic analogs in the subjectâs region, often referred to
as the direct historical approach or upstreaming (Fenton 2009), but for central Texas few if any such
records exist. A third way of strengthening analogies is to look for cross-cultural laws; this will be
discussed further in later paragraphs. The latter two approaches (upstreaming and cross-cultural laws) are
551

not strictly formal analogies in that they consider the relevance of comparing past and present contexts.
Hodder (1983) points out that there is continuum in analogical reasoning, with a purely formal analogy at
one end - for example of the kind von Daniken (1969) has used - and a strongly relational analogy at the
other end. Johnson (1997) and Lintz and his colleagues (1995) do not rely totally on formal comparisons,
in that they consider cultural and environmental similarities between source and analog.
While formal analogies are unreliable for interpreting the past due to the potential for multiple analogs
and accidental similarities, both Wylie (2002) and Hodder (1982) are optimistic about relational
analogies, which consider the relevance of comparisons and take into account the context of both the
archaeological subject and the analog source. Hodder points out that archaeologists have often considered
function in establishing relational analogies, but structural (cultural) factors play important roles in
creating the archaeological record. Because nearly all the circular features have been recorded within a
small geographic area within central Texas, they could be the product of a cultural tradition dictating the
form of houses (or ovens for that matter). While cultural factors must have played a role in the
construction of the circular features, we still must acknowledge a determining link between form and
function for both analogs. For example, the central hearth of a hut needs to provide heat for warmth and
cooking while being of a size that would not endanger the occupants. The houseâs stone ring would have
to somehow support the walls, but then the rock ring could also be a consequence of house construction
having no actual function in supporting the walls, such as clearing a space on a rock-strewn surface
(Binford 1983). Conversely, a large earth oven, if used to cook geophytes, agaves, or sotol, would need to
maintain a certain level of heat, governing the type of construction and the temperature imparted to the
rock heating elements (Black et al. 1997, Lucas and Frederick 1998).
Another, perhaps more significant reason for considering functional over structural interpretations is that
that these circular features have been reported from contexts widely separated by time: the
Graham/Applegate (41LL419) circular features range in age from 1050 to 1450 BP (Hixson 2012) while
the 41CC112 circular feature was securely dated to 8400 BP (Lintz et al. 1995). A cultural norm or
ideology strongly influencing the shape of a feature would probably not have persisted for 8000 years.
Therefore, some sort of functional, cross-cultural explanation appears appropriate. The following
paragraphs look at some of the functional aspects of the components of the two main interpretations,
house or oven, and how well the Lake Buchanan and Graham/Applegate evidence fits with each.
The central rock pavement of the feature can be interpreted either as the heating elements of a baking pit
or as the central hearth to a house. For a house hearth, it is unusual in its proportions in that it takes up so
much of the interior space. For example, at Graham/Applegate the central hearth takes up nearly 20
percent of the floor space of one circular feature (Large Feature 1) and even more, 24 percent, of another
circular feature (Large Feature 2) (Figure 322). I have not been able to find any modern analogs for such a
large hearth within such a small living area. If any exist, then they are extremely rare. The large hearth
and the lack of sufficient living space are the most obvious dissimilarities between the circular features
and ethnographic houses. This would be considered a negative analogy as opposed to the positive
analogies more commonly used by archaeologists.
To explain this negative aspect of the house analogy, Johnson (1997) puts forth the idea that these central
pavements are hearths in the original Anglo-Saxon sense of the term, large stone platforms used as
552

benches or tables with a small fire in the center. While there are ethnographic examples of boulders used
as tables by hunter-gatherers (Binford 1983), Johnsonâs analog derives from sources outside a huntergatherer context. Anglo-Saxon houses may have had such hearths but do they make sense in a huntergatherer shelter in a sub-tropical climate? Wylie (2002) contends that combining multiple analogs to
interpret archaeological subjects is a way to overcome the criticisms expressed by Gould (1980) that
analogical reasoning limits our understanding of the past to what we already know in the present, as well
as imposes the present onto the past. Johnson creative use of analogy has conceptualized a type of house
not encountered in the ethnographic literature. Johnson further states that the central part of the hearth
could have occasionally been used as a small earth oven, citing the multiple rock layers in House 1 at
Lion Creek.

To find more attributes that could support Johnsonâs hypothesis that the pavements were a combination of
workbench and fireplace, archaeomagnetic analysis was done by Wulf Gose of the Geology Department
of the University of Texas at Austin on three of the Graham/Applegate circular feature hearths (Gose
2003). Such an analysis of the magnetic properties can reveal a rockâs heating history and its change in
orientation between heating episodes. This is because high temperatures will reset a mineralâs magnetic
orientation to match that prevailing on the earthâs surface at the time and place of heating. In this case, the
main concern was the distribution of heating temperatures across the surface of these hearths. If these are

553

the kinds of hearths that Johnson proposed, then the outer or periphery stones would show little or no
evidence of heating while the inner stones would show evidence of low to moderate temperatures.
Goseâs findings do not seem to support Johnsonâs hypothesis in the sense of providing more positive
similarities between the circular featuresâ hearths and Old English hearths. All the rocks sampled from
both the outer edge and central portion of the hearth pavement were heated to about the same, relatively
high temperature of around 500 degrees centigrade (Gose 2003). Such temperatures are of the kind
normally attained in experimental earth ovens (Lucas and Frederick 1998) and in archaeological examples
(Takac 1998). Goseâs analysis purports that the rocks of all three hearths cooled in place, further
supporting the oven hypothesis and making it unlikely that oven stones were later recycled for a house
hearth. It is also clear that many of the rocks in the circular featuresâ hearths cracked in place, presumably
from high heat. Goseâs analysis does not necessarily disprove Johnsonâs hearth hypothesis since other
explanations for his findings could be posited - for example, the hut may have burned down thereby
heating all the hearth rocks to a high temperature - but it does increase the range of positive similarities
between the circular features and ovens (Wylie 2002).
Circular arrangements of rocks within certain diameter parameters are often interpreted by archaeologists
to be the remains of structures. Such rock patterns are encountered at archaeological sites across world,
even in pre-modern human contexts at Terra Amata in Nice, France
(http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/behavior/terra-amata-shelter). It would appear that in many
instances, these rocks are used as weights to pin or secure a sheet covering around the base of a
hypothesized framework. For heavier coverings such as thatch or brush, such weights would not be
necessary. In some interpretations, rocks were used to stabilize the vertical posts of the framework. A
recently investigated example of the latter approach is the paired stones that constitute the house rings at
41CX110 (Turpin 2011).
Many of the satellite clusters of nearly all the Lake Buchanan features are composed of relatively small
rocks (10 to 15 cm) that, like those in the central hearths, have cracked in place, presumably from heat.
The total weight of many clusters is small, and in any case a pile of small rocks would not be as effective
as one large boulder in holding down coverings in windy conditions. Larger rocks were clearly available
because they were used in the central hearths. In fact, at Graham/Applegate, the average size of the
central hearth rocks is greater than that of the satellite clusters in four of the five circular features where
data is available.
Use of rocks to stabilize posts appears to be rare ethnographically, probably because they are hardly ever
needed. Some researchers have seen gaps in the rock clusters that could be left by wooden posts (Lintz et
al. 1995). Considering the size of the posts that would be represented by the hollows in the satellite
clusters at 41CC112, which are 15 to 25 cm in diameter, the weight of the posts would be substantially
more than the rock pile supposedly used to stabilize it. Rock-free areas were also seen in places in the
some of the Graham/Applegate clusters, especially those around Large Feature1, but there was no other
collaborating evidence such as soil stains. Probably any shallow pile of rocks centuries old will have gaps,
either occurring by happenstance when they were first dumped, or later by tree growth, burrowing
animals, and other natural forces.

554

Large rocks greater than 30 cm in diameter do occasionally occur in satellite clusters. One circular feature
at 41LL508 is unusual in the number of large rocks surround the central hearth pavement (Figure 323).
However, this feature also has many smaller fire-cracked rocks in its satellite clusters, typical of the size
encountered in burned rock middens that are thought to accumulate from earth oven cleanouts (Black
2003).

Figure 323. Circular feature (Feature 1) at 41LL508 surrounded by large near-boulder-sixed rocks.

The Lake Buchanan circular features have been disturbed to various degrees by wave action, and details
of the pattern that once existed have been lost. Looking beyond the immediate Lake Buchanan area,
perhaps the best preserved of these circular features is Large Feature 1 at Graham/Applegate. The arcing
piles of rocks seen in the plan map of the feature do suggest they were piled up against the walls of some
kind of circular hut-like structure, perhaps to weight down a skin or mat covering. If so, the rock would
have been piled up on the interior of the wall, which would make little sense in that they would take up
even more of the limited interior space. The pattern also not what we would expect if the rocks were used
to stabilize the posts. Also, the weight of the covering is probably sufficient to prevent the framework
from moving, as demonstrated by the thatched hut on exhibit at the LCRA Nightengale Archaeological
Center in Kingsland (http://www.lcra.org/parks/natural_resource/nightengale.html).
Although satellite rock clusters are not normally thought of as a component of central Texas hearths, they
seem to be commonly depicted in plan maps of block excavations in some site reports. These clusters are
often given individual designations and considered to have functioned separately from the nearby larger
pavement. This is probably a safe approach since so many archaeological sites, especially in nonaggrading or slowly aggrading landforms are palimpsests (see Black 2003). Only when a relatively large
area is uncovered around these pavements and the satellite clusters are seen to form a partial or complete
555

ring, that the association becomes apparent. Such large areal excavations have only become common in
the last 30 years, which explains why these features were first identified on the eroded shoreline of Lake
Buchanan where wave action in effect has extensively excavated these sites. Satellite clusters have also
been documented for large hearths or ovens in non-aggrading sites in semi-arid areas of Texas, the large
oven at 41CX131 in Musk Hog Canyon being a particularly good example (Luke 1983). This feature has
four large satellite clusters of burned rock surrounding the pit oven (Figure 324). Luke (1983) considered
these satellite clusters to represent cleanouts from previous use of the oven, in effect they represent an
âincipient burned rock middenâ, and offered several scenarios of human activity that might explain this
pattern, and these will be discussed later in this section. The fact that the 41CX131 satellite clusters are
large compared to those seen in the Lake Buchanan examples, probably explains why Duke did not bring
up the house analog in his report. This example does show that when large areas around hearths and
ovens are visible, either through excavation or erosion, satellite clusters are sometimes present.

History (www.texasbeyondhistory.net).

Seven archaeomagnetic core samples were taken from the west satellite rock cluster of Large Feature 2 at
Graham/Applegate (Gose 2003). Several samples have complex magnetic signatures, which suggest
repeated heating in different positions (Gose 2003). Others have simpler signatures having cooled in place
from relatively low temperatures of 300 degrees C or below. The highest temperatures of the satellite
rocks are in excess of 500 degrees C, suggesting these particular ones were used in oven cooking. The
finding that some rocks cooled in place from a low temperature without earlier higher heating is curious,
556

although one possibility is that these are rocks that were never used in cooking but absorbed heat from
simply being in proximity to a large fire.
Archaeologists who have interpreted the circular features as dwellings stress that they were probably
winter houses, not only because of the large central hearth, but because the apparent effort that was put
into their construction would imply a longer intended stay at the site. If these structures were occupied for
many weeks, perhaps several months, a lot of occupational debris would have accumulated in and around
the structure. In particular, concentrations of flint chipping debris would be expected near the entrances,
since the knappers would have enough light to work and still be protected from the elements (Binford
1983). However, debitage counts are low at the presumed entrance to LF 1 where there is an obvious gap
in the outer satellite ring.
Why, then, is there a (mostly) rock-free space of 60 to 130 cm wide around the circular features? This
space has been interpreted by some as the living space within a structure but Binford, while involved in
ethno-archaeological fieldwork, observed similar spaces within large work areas that require standing. He
refers to this pattern as the âClassic feature centered pattern.â He describes an Aborigine baking pit with
a workspace around it, and beyond a ring of discarded material such as partially burned wood. A similar
pattern is also illustrated for a Nunamiut caribou butchering area, where the animal carcass lay in the
center and the workers walked counterclockwise around the animal while discarding bones to their right,
leaving a ring-shaped pattern.
An empty space might be expected around a baking pit so that the users can walk around its periphery
unhindered, but there may be another reason for its presence around the circular features. One important
component of baking pits is the layer of earth used to seal in not only the heat and also moisture (Black et
al 1997). Without it, the food would burn when the moisture had completely evaporated. The capping dirt
would have to be of sufficient quantity to cover the baking pit with a layer ten or more centimeters thick
and be within a convenient distance to quickly cover the food and its packing material. The most efficient
method of storing the dirt would be immediately outside the pit, scraped to the area outside the nearest
edge, creating a doughnut-shaped berm of earth around the oven. Such a berm would not often survive in
upland settings since erosion tends to smooth out irregularities, especially in sandy soils, or if they do
survive in alluvial formations will be hard for archaeologists to distinguish from the surrounding soil
matrix when excavating down onto the feature.
While this earthen berm is a hypothesized component of the central Texas earth ovens, one possible
example of such an earth oven is exposed in alluvial sediment 41BT336 on Double Horn Creek. When
recorded, the oven had been vertically bisected by floodwaters, providing one of the most informative
profiles of this kind of feature. On both sides of the oven bed, but best seen to the left in the photo (Figure
325), is a humped-up mound of lighter-colored earth. The base of the mound rests on sediments into
which the pit was dug, which are darker in color than the overlying sediments. Interestingly, rocks are
scattered on top of the mound, suggesting that they had been placed directly over the food before the oven
was sealed with earth. Such rocks would have provided heating from above the food to supplement the
main heating elements at the base of the oven.

557

Taphonomy, the alteration of the archaeological record by natural and artificial forces, has contributed to
the house floor-like appearance of the circular features at Lake Buchanan and elsewhere. If the oven
interpretation is correct, then the central hearth of a circular feature, when abandoned by its users, was a
shallow pit filled with rocks and surrounded by a doughnut-shaped mound of earth with satellite rock
clusters scattered further outwards. Well before the impoundment of the lake, this mound would have
flatten out (deflated) through centuries of pedoturbation leaving the rocks to rest at approximately the
same elevation a few centimeters below the surface. The primary agent of the pedoturbation in the granite
areas of Lake Buchanan has probably been the Llano pocket gopher (Geomys texensis). Their tunnels
average about 5 cm in width and are dug at a depth of between 15 and 20 cm below the ground surface, as
shown during the Graham/Applegate excavations. These tunnels could easily undermine the outer edges
of basin hearths, causing the rocks to sink into the ground. In addition, the backdirt from the tunnels
accumulates on the surface as is eventually spread out by erosion, contributing to the burial of these
features. Figure 326 shows graphically how two hypothetical oven types could become buried through
pedoturbation. For this example, Type 1 ovens acquire all the capping dirt from the excavation of the
baking pit, while Type 2 ovens supplement this dirt with addition fill from an outer encircling trench.
Considering the archaeological context of the circular features, and how their components would have
best functioned, it appears that the earth oven analog is the best fit. Looking at these features as ovens, the
Graham/Applegate data can be used to construct a model of how they were used to cook food and how
middens formed around them. Many if not most oven pits were reused because they were pre-dug, earthrich, and contained large rock that could be recycled as heating elements (Black and Creel 1997). The
finding of charred onion and wild hyacinth in the siteâs burned rock midden (Bush 2005) is in line with

558

other findings from the region (e.g., Collin 1998, Weston and Mauldin 2003) and indicates what foods
were probably cooked in the ovens in the Llano Uplift region.
During ancient use of these ovens, as the rocks fracture down to a certain size from repeated heating, they
would have been removed from the baking pit and replaced with larger ones for the next baking episode.
The probable scheduling for these cleanouts is when a new cooking episode is initiated, because for the
most efficient heat transfer, the existing rocks would have to be removed from the pit, a fire build in the
pit, and then the rocks placed on top of the fire (Lucas and Frederick 1998). Some researchers have
reported a sheet of burned rock adjacent to ovens thought to be cleanout debris (Black 1997). This pattern
might result when a person or persons walk over the oven bed, selecting the unsuitably small rocks, and
tossing them into a prescribed area to one side. But if all the rocks were removed, as is hypothesized here,
then it would appear more practical to dump the rocks in the nearest area outside the pit. One or more
persons would walk around the perimeter of the pit, removing rocks and placing them at the closest area
outside the pit. This would follow the pattern described by Binford (1983) for activities where people are
standing (as opposed to sitting).
This basic idea was first proposed by Luke (1983) for the 41CX131 feature discussed earlier in this
section. The satellite rock clusters around this feature were relatively large, that is, they each contained
more rocks covering larger areas at least 1.5 m in diameter, and therefore gave less an appearance of a
house floor. Luke (1983) proposes that these satellite clusters could be interpreted as (1) four separate
oven cleanout events; (2) four individuals working cooperatively to clean out the oven pit; or (3) a
combination of separate cleanout events involving multiple individuals. Dismantling an oven in this
fashion suggests anticipation of future use of the pit oven. Rocks large enough to be reused are kept close
to the pitâs edge, where other yet-to-be-used rocks are stockpiled. âPlanning depthâ a term used by
Binford (1987) as cited by Hard and Snyder (1997) is greater for large hearths and baking pits than for
small, domestic hearths.
Archaeologically, earth oven features do not end at the outer edge of the oven. Important parts of the oven
apparatus lie around the periphery of the oven pit, including an inner zone made up of the doughnutshaped mound of earth used to seal the oven during the cooking phase and another zone composed of
rocks removed during the cleanout, including rocks permanently taken out of use because of their size as
well as larger rocks stockpiled for later use. Theoretically, with repeated use of the oven, the average size
of the rocks composing this outer zone becomes smaller as more and more rocks fragment to a size
considered too small for oven heating. The total mass of the rocks in this outer zone will increase over
time with repeated oven use. At some point, enough small rocks will have accumulated around the oven
pit that archaeologists would recognize it as a burned rock midden.
It would appear that the more a particular oven pit is used, the satellite ring will grow larger â the number
of rock fragments increasing and the total weight of the clusters increasing â but the average size of the
rocks will decrease to a certain dimension before leveling off at around 10 cm. In the Graham/Applegate
midden, rocks less than about 10 cm in diameter make up the bulk of the outer ring material (Figure 327).
Presumably these rocks were deemed too small to reuse as thermal elements in the oven. The composition
of this midden ring is a consequence of the selection process, the decisions made by the users of the oven
concerning which rocks will be re-used for the next cooking episode. If too few sufficiently large rocks
559

are available in the midden ring, new rocks will be sought and stockpiled on the periphery of the oven.
Therefore, the pattern of the circular feature is not just a byproduct of human behavior but a purposeful
act of preparing for a future baking event showing greater planning depth than the small hearths.

Although the circular features seen at Lake Buchanan and beyond are probably not the remains of houses,
shelters of some sort must have been constructed at many if not most open campsites. Ethnographic work
has shown that dwellings are typically set up some distance from ovens and other types of work areas that
560

require large amounts of space (and are messy) and would interfere with daily activities (Yellen 1977,
Binford 1983, Hard and Snyder 1997). For this reason, remains of house structure would not necessarily
be in close proximity to the large circular features. The houses described by Cabeza de Vaca on the Texas
coast in 1520s probably would leave little archaeological signature even in the best of preserved sites
(Cabeza de Vaca 2012). He described a framework of four sapling arches, presumably intersecting in the
center, covered by woven mats. In any case, traces of such structures along Lake Buchanan shoreline
would have been obliterated by waves. The only type of aboriginal structure known for the region that
could withstand such forces and still be identifiable would be tipi rings, where large boulder-sized stones
outline the edges of the house and used to secure the covering to the ground. No such pattern was
recognized during the shoreline survey.
Circular features and burned rock middens
In the last section, the argument was made that the circular features seen at Lake Buchanan are the
remains of earth ovens with an incipient midden ring around them. For some reason, the burned rock
accumulations around many of these ovens, as well as many elsewhere in the Llano Uplift, were arrested
before a full-blown burned rock middens formed. Satellite clusters of discarded burned rock mixed with a
few larger stockpiled rocks encircling a hearth pavement can create the appearance of a hunter-gatherer
house floor as noted above. Such patterns seem more common in the upland areas of the Llano Uplift
region, although one is known from an alluvial setting (41CC112) a hundred miles upstream. In both
environments, archaeological material can disappear from the surface relatively quickly.
It is well known that sites on aggrading surfaces can become buried rapidly in flood sediments. Less
known is that surface features on granite soils can also be buried rapidly, not by soil deposition, but by
pedoturbation of the gravelly, sandy soils such as the Lou soil series that develop on lower slopes. Even
the 10.5-m diameter burned rock midden at Graham/Applegate was buried although it lies on a nonaggrading surface. At this site, two earlier ovens tentatively dated to the early Late Archaic II or Late
Archaic I appear to have no satellite clusters (and although neither feature was completely uncovered),
suggesting a single use and perhaps greater residential mobility. Towards the end of the Late Archaic II,
reuse of particular oven pits at Graham/Applegate occurred enough times for a small amount of midden
accumulation.
Perhaps longer sustained use of the Graham/Applegate site became more common at this time, a pattern
that persisted to the end of the Austin phase. Still, lengthy periods between visits meant that ovens
became buried and no longer visible to be reused. One oven at Graham/Applegate, apparently first used in
the Late Archaic II Period, continued to be used enough times for a moderate-sized burned rock midden
to form. This particular oven must have remained visible on the surface, either because time intervals
between visits were shorter or because the immediate soil or topographic conditions â it rests on a steeper
surface than the circular features â prevented rapid burial. Therefore, granite middens could develop
under certain circumstances, although they will tend to be smaller and less numerous across the landscape
than limestone middens.
Table 15 shows that circular features have been recorded at eight archaeological sites on the Lake
Buchanan lakebed. Five of these sites have multiple circular features, indicating that the same cooking
561

behaviors â repeated use of the same baking pit - occurred more than once at particular locations. If the
first baking pit at these locations had remained visible on the surface, then it probably would have been
used on subsequent occasions without the need to excavate new pits. Under such circumstances, a small
burned rock midden might have accumulated around the single pit, instead of the multiple circular
features found at these sites today.

CHAPTER 12: DISCUSSION OF HISTORIC PERIOD SITES
By Daniel J. Prikryl

A total of 18 historic period archaeological sites have been recorded on the Lake Buchanan property
(Table 16). Ten of these sites (41LL502-504, 41LL529, 41LL538, 41LL539, 41LL541, 41LL546,
41LL554 and 41LL571) are located in the Horseshoe Bend Survey Sector and are associated with the
Bluffton community. Three other sites, 41LL560, 41LL562 and 41LL569 are associated with a second
historic community called Tow. Both of the communities are among the earliest Euro-American
settlements in eastern Llano County with occupations starting in the 1850s and continuing until the areas
were inundated by the reservoir.
At the Bluffton community, site 41LL504 represents the actual second location of the Bluffton townsite.
The move of the town to this location occurred in1883 after much of the original townsite burned down.
Although there are no currently standing structures at this second townsite, the foundations of several
buildings are evident including the hotel, cotton gin and general store/gas station. Five of the other
Bluffton area sites are associated with three prominent families in the community. These are the Davis
(41LL503), Arnold (41LL502) and Maxwell (41LL529, 41LL538 and 41LL539) families. A sixth site,
41LL571, at Bluffton encompasses the areas of the former cemetery and adjacent former building that
was used as a church, a school and a lodge at various times.
Although all of the Bluffton sites are beneath the normal conservation pool, each of these sites has been
heavily disturbed by wave action due to fluctuating lake levels as well as artifact collecting. The history
of the Bluffton community has recently been described in a publication titled Old Bluffton Revisited by
William Hallmark (2009), a descendant of one of the Bluffton community families. The second Bluffton
townsite, 41LL504, is assessed as eligible for formal designation as a SAL due to the rich archival history
and the presence of features including the foundations of various businesses and artifact scatters
associated with former residences. Additionally, limited shovel testing indicates that there is still a
potential for subsurface deposits in some parts of the townsite. The SAL eligibility status of six of the
farmsteads located in the extended Bluffton community area, as well as the former church/ school/lodge
site area, are each assessed as undetermined because of incomplete data on the horizontal extent of each
site and the lack of information on the potential for subsurface deposits.
The Tow townsite was apparently smaller than Bluffton with only eight buildings and houses shown on
the old USGS topographic maps of 1909 and 1929. Sites 41LL560 and 41LL562 appear to be farmsteads
while 41LL569 is thought to represent one of the townâs businesses, perhaps the general store. The SAL
eligibility status of each of these sites is rated as undetermined. Additionally, work primarily consisting of
shovel testing and archival and deed/title research will be needed at each of these sites to determine SAL
ratings.
Two historic period sites, 41LL32 and 41LL507, were recorded and assessed in areas adjacent to LCRAâs
Cedar Point Recreation Area. At site 41LL32, there are actually two former houses separated by a
distance of 150 m. One of these homesteads, located within 180 m of the Colorado River, consists of a
563

massive chimney fall without associated well or cistern. A blue featheredge (shell edge) whiteware sherd
was found at the site, suggesting a pre-1860 date. The other homestead is located about 150 m to the
south closer to Cowan Creek. The foundations of this house are well-preserved with two opposing
chimney falls, having the appearance of âdog trot.â This house might be as old at the first but was
apparently occupied well into the twentieth century because machine-made bottles were collected during
the survey. Both of these sites may have research potential but additional work consisting of shovel
testing and deed/title research is needed in order to assess SAL eligibility.

Other historic sites include site 41BT455, a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead adjacent
to LCRAâs Canyon of the Eagles Park. The shovel testing and archival research which were completed at
this site lead to an assessment that this site is not SAL eligible. Another historic component is located at
site 41LL407 in the Redrock Creek Sector. However, the portion of the site containing the historic
component lies above the conservation pool on private property and was not revisited during the shoreline
survey. Thus, the SAL eligibility status of this component is undetermined. The last historic component is
an apparent trash dump that is located within 41LL575.

CHAPTER 13: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
By Daniel J. Prikryl
A total of 167 cultural resource sites have been recorded below the full pool elevation at Lake Buchanan.
Eighty-five sites were recorded or revisited during the current survey of the shoreline during the ongoing
drought. Most of the sites recorded during WPA-sponsored investigations prior to the completion of the
dam were not revisited during the current survey. Figure 249 shows that the WPA-era work concentrated
on recording archaeological sites at the lower elevations on lower terraces and the Colorado River
floodplain. Almost all of these sites lie in the reservoirâs deep-water zone and have not become exposed
by the various droughts.
The sites that have been recorded during the current survey lie in upland areas and provide data for a
better understanding of the overall settlement pattern, especially in prehistoric times. The available
evidence suggests that the most intensive use of these upland areas as campsites and other activity areas
occurred during the Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II periods. These upland areas constitute the majority
of a critical impact zone that occurs at many reservoirs as described by Lenihan et al. (1981:6). This is the
zone that is subjected to frequent shoreline fluctuation, and the fact that sandy loams and sandy silts
constitute the vast majority of the topsoils at Lake Buchanan has made the erosion problem in the critical
impact much worse than average. Many sites recorded during the current survey have no remaining
topsoil with the original context of most artifacts and stone-lined burned rock features lost as they lie on
the surface of the subsoil or geologic bedrock. While some sites may still have some remaining topsoil,
the upper topsoil deposits are typically gone.
As sites are subjected to cycles of erosion and deflation, they become highly visible targets of human
vandals. The first drought following the filling of the lake occurred in the 1950s was a bonanza to looters
with accounts of individuals literally carrying off bucket loads of arrowheads and other chipped stone
tools during casual visits to the shoreline. Human vandalism of the sites has increased through the years
as more people have constructed vacation and permanent homes near the lake property.
Seventy-seven sites with prehistoric components were recorded or revisited during the current shoreline
survey. These include 41LL2 and 41LL423, two previously recorded sites that have been formally
designated as SALs. The LCRA Cultural Resources team assesses five other prehistoric components as
not eligible for formal designation as SALs. These ineligible prehistoric components consist of 41LL561,
41BT460, 41BT477, 41LL539 and 41LL556. The SAL eligibility statuses of the remaining 70 prehistoric
components are undetermined at this time principally because portions of the sites are still inundated
and/or because of a lack of shovel testing to conclusively show that no intact subsurface deposits are still
present. The SAL eligibility status of each prehistoric component has been previously shown of Table 3.
It should be noted that regardless of the SAL eligibility issue, useful information has been derived from
the burned rock features exposed on eroded surfaces at many of the prehistoric sites for the discussion of
hearth sizes and functions as described in Chapters 10 and 11 of this report. This demonstrates that even
eroded/deflated sites still have ways of providing new and interesting data. Thus, careful consideration
should be given to writing off many of these sites as not SAL eligible at this time.

566

Twnty of the sites recorded or revisited during the current survey have historic components (see Table
11). One site, 41LL504, is proposed for designation as a SAL. This site is the second location of the
Bluffton townsite and it was in existence from 1883 to 1937. Although the site has suffered from
shoreline erosion and human vandalism, there are numerous features still present. These features are
primarily native stone, cement, and concrete foundations of four commercial structures and four
residences. Artifacts are still present on the surface and in some areas in subsurface contexts.
Additionally, two descendents of one of the families have published a book that provides historic
background information on the first and second Bluffton townsites and its citizens (Hallmark and Russell
2009). A second publication by Yarbrough (n.d.) provides additional information about Bluffton and
other communities and families in the Lake Buchanan area. These two publications in combination with
the archaeological remains at 41LL504 provide much useful data on rural community life in the Central
Texas Hill Country from the 1850s to the 1930s.
The SAL eligibility statuses of fourteen other historic components are undetermined at the time. These
historic components consist of 41LL32, 41LL407, 41LL502, 41LL503, 41LL507, 41LL538, 41LL541,
41LL546, 41LL554, 41LL560, 41LL562, 41LL569, 41LL571, and 41LL575. As with many of the
prehistoric components in this category, many of these sites extended below the waterline at the time they
were recorded so that undetermined areas of each of these sites could not be assessed. In these and other
cases, too, the lack of shovel testing to definitively show that the sites are totally eroded leads to
uncertainties in SAL assessment.
The last three historic components are assessed as not SAL eligible. These consist of 41BT455, 41LL529,
and 41LL539. At these sites, it is clear that the total site areas were exposed, and either the sites were
totally eroded with little remaining or in the case of 41BT455 dated to relatively recent times and was not
associated with historically important individuals or families.
