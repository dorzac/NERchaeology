Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100% pedestrian survey
supplemented with shovel testing and backhoe trenching along the proposed
alignment for the City of Pleasanton’s wastewater pipeline upgrade in Atascosa
County, Texas. Work was conducted under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act and the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC Permit #4417), in
accordance with 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the rules and
regulations for compliance. The proposed project area includes existing pipeline
right-of-way, expanded construction easements, and new pipeline alternatives
between the city’s wastewater treatment facility on Hunt Road and County Road
433, for a total distance of approximately 15,000 feet.
Surveyors had
permission to enter 100% of the project area, much of which is privately owned,
with the remainder falling within existing roadway rights-of-way or City of
Pleasanton property near the treatment facility. Investigators excavated 47
shovel tests and three backhoe trenches in support of the survey and
documented no new archeological sites. One historic age cemetery, the San
Ysidro Cemetery, is located adjacent to the proposed wastewater line. It was
determined by investigators that the pipeline route will have no effect on the San
Ysidro Cemetery, as there is little potential for unmarked graves within the
proposed alignment. Based on the results of this survey, it is recommended that
proposed wastewater pipeline construction will not have an adverse affect on
any archeological sites. No artifacts were collected during the survey, and all
project related documents and records will be permanently held at Hicks &
Company.

Introduction and Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In February 2007, Hicks & Company archeologists surveyed the proposed
wastewater pipeline alignment located in Pleasanton, Texas (Figure 1) under
TAC Permit #4417. The project is located in Atascosa County and is sponsored
the City of Pleasanton. The proposed pipeline is an upgrade of an existing line,
extending from the city’s wastewater treatment plant to County Road 433, a
total distance of approximately 15,000 feet. This includes replacement of
approximately 10,900 feet of existing pipeline between the treatment plant at the
northern terminus and Oakhaven Road, as well as 4,100 feet of new pipeline
routed from Oakhaven Road to CR 433 (Airport Road). A substantial portion of
the pipeline will be constructed within the previously excavated pipeline trench
if possible. However, permanent and construction easements extend beyond the
limits of the existing pipeline trench.
Generally, the permanent pipeline
easement will be 20 feet in width with an additional 20-foot construction
easement. Because construction plans had not been finalized at the time of
survey, two alternatives were evaluated for approximately 3,100 feet at the
western end of the alignment.
Archeological investigations included an initial archival search to identify all
previously recorded surveys, archeological sites, and historic structures near the
project area. Background research for this project was conducted at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). According to available data, there are no Official State Historical Markers
(OSHMs) located within the project area, nor are there any State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs), archeological sites, or sites listed on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). According to maps located at the THC, there have been
no previous archeological surveys conducted within the project area. Records at
TARL indicate that there are four previously recorded sites within one kilometer
of the project’s western terminus. These sites (41AT143, 41AT144, 41AT145,
and 41AT146) are recorded as prehistoric archeological sites, containing sparse
lithic debitage documented on the surface or shallowly buried, at depths of 10­
40 centimeters (15.7 inches) below the surface. One of these sites (41AT144)
was recorded based on the excavation of a Fairland-like dartpoint dating to the
transitional Archaic/Prehistoric period. Site 41AT146 is located immediately
adjacent to the proposed project area on the west side of County Road 433. All
four sites are believed to represent the remains of an open camp or a lithic
procurement area. These sites were recorded during a 1995 survey conducted
prior to expansion of the Pleasanton Airport. The currently proposed alignment
will have no affect on any of these sites.
Right-of-entry was available for 100% of the proposed alignment. The survey
involved intensive pedestrian inspection supplemented with shovel testing in all
undisturbed locations. In accordance with the THC’s minimum standards for

Introduction and Summary

linear archeological survey, shovel tests were excavated at 100-meter intervals
(16 per linear mile). Additional shovel tests were placed near the confluence of
Bonita Creek and the Atascosa River due to the increased likelihood for
encountering buried archeological sites. Three backhoe trenches were also
excavated in this area, where alluvial sediment extended beyond the maximum
depth able to be evaluated through shovel testing. No archeological sites were
recorded within the project area. Shovel tests were excavated in ten centimeter
levels to a depth of one meter below the surface, ancient or disturbed soils, or
until otherwise obstructed, and all sediment was screened through ¼-inch wire
mesh. Investigators recorded their observations and the results of shovel tests
through notes, standardized shovel test log forms, and photographs. All
disturbed areas that were not subject to subsurface testing were documented
through notes and photographs. A total of 47 shovel tests were excavated in
support of the project (Figures 2 and 3). None of these were positive for
cultural material.
It was determined by investigators that the San Ysidro Cemetery or any
associated interments, located on the north side of Coughran Road east of
Highway 281, will not be impacted by the proposed pipeline construction. The
historic portion of the cemetery is located on the north half of the cemetery,
approximately 325 feet north of the proposed alignment. The graves located
nearest the construction easement date to the 1960s through the 1990s. In
addition to the well-marked, modern burials located here, a high-pressure gas
pipeline was installed across the front of the cemetery within the fenced
boundaries sometime within the past 50 years, further limiting the potential for
unmarked graves to be located here (Steve Braune, personal communication
2007).
The survey was conducted between February 13 and February 16, 2007. Rachel
Feit functioned as the principal investigator. Staff Archeologists Matt Stotts,
Suzanne Smith, and Robert Lassen performed the survey. Report writing took
place in February of 2007, immediately following the conclusion of fieldwork.
Succeeding sections of the report include sections on Environmental Setting,
Cultural Background and Previous Investigations, Results of Field
Investigations, and Conclusions and Recommendations.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area lies within the Interior Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province of Texas. According to Wermund (2006), this region is characterized by
uncemented sandy ridges composed of eroded shale. Two faults follow the
coastline longitudinally through this region. The Bureau of Economic Geology
(1983) indicates that three geologic formations exist within the APE of the
Pleasanton sewer line. The two most common formations are Sparta Sand and
the Cook Mountain Formation, both made up of Eocene sandstones. The third
formation consists of Holocene alluvium and appears in the project area as a
thin band of sediment surrounding the confluence of the Atascosa River and
Bonita Creek. The project area exhibits very little topography, with only slight
slopes along the banks of the two drainages.
According to Dittmar and Stevens (1980), the soil of the project area is primarily
made up of three series. Poth loamy fine sand, on 0 to 3 percent slopes, occurs
in the western portion of the project area and is made up of 76 centimeters (30
inches) of brown loamy fine sand overlying 64 centimeters (25 inches) of
yellowish brown and strong brown sandy clay, and 33 centimeters (13 inches) of
reddish yellow sand clay loam.
The Nueces-Sarita association, gently
undulating group makes up the northern and central portions of the project
area. It consists of an upper 76 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches) of brown to
very pale brown sand, followed by 76 centimeters (30 inches) of mottled sandy
clay loam, with a 25 centimeter (10 inch) substratum of white sandy clay loam
in the Nueces series. Finally, frequently flooded Sinton soils occur adjacent to
the channels of the Atascosa River and Bonita Creek. The upper layer consists
of 30 centimeters (12 inches) of dark grayish brown to dark brown clay loam,
followed by 81 centimeters (32 inches) of brown sandy clay loam and 51
centimeters (20 inches) of brown loamy fine sand.
The project site lies within the South Texas Plains as described by Gould et al.
(1960). This area is characterized by rolling to level topography with soils that
include clay, loam, sand, and gravel. Vegetation physiognomy is a patchwork of
native and non-native grasses, interspersed with woody shrubs, brush, and
woods, with low to medium tall broad-leaved deciduous and evergreen shrubs
scattered singly, in groves or thickets or as broad extensive stands (Telfair
1999). Land-use changes have prompted a decline in many of the dominant
native prairie grasses and brush species.
Herbaceous plant species noted during a field evaluation on January 2007,
included bermuda grass, windmill grass, buffelgrass, silverleaf nightshade,
prickly pear, greenbriar, poison ivy, grape, hawthorne, retama, huisache, brasil,

interspersed with mesquite, hackberry, granjeno, lotebush, and whitebrush,
cedar elm, yaupon, black willow, and gum bumelia.
Vegetation associated with the Atascosa River and tributaries of Bonita Creek
includes hackberry and black willow as dominant overstory trees growing 30-40
feet in height with understory plants including greenbriar, yaupon, and poison
ivy. The diameter at breast height (dbh) of the largest trees within this riparian
corridor ranged from 8-14 inches with canopy cover ranging from 85-100
percent.
The riparian zone adjacent to Bonita Creek represents a travel corridor for
occurring wildlife by exhibiting a generally continuous vegetation community
that provides food, concealment, and escape cover. This corridor therefore,
contains the highest quality wildlife habitat within the project area. Remaining
habitat includes upland brush, some cropland and some developed land within
the project limits. Indigenous wildlife includes white-tailed deer, javelina,
turkey, fox squirrel, jackrabbits, foxes, ring-tailed cats, skunks, opossum,
bobcats, and coyotes; with seasonal migrations of ducks, cranes, and geese.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
SOUTH TEXAS PREHISTORIC ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The Pleasanton wastewater pipeline project area is located within the northern
portion of the south Texas plains region. This region is still little understood
archeologically, reflecting a paucity of systematic excavations as well as the
geomorphic characteristics of the landscape as they pertain to site formation
processes (Black 1989). Although the south Texas plains archeological region is
a distinct entity, much of what is known of the area is in part derived from
comparisons and extrapolation with adjacent areas that have been the subject of
more intensive investigation, particularly the central Texas archeological region.
Syntheses of the prehistory of south Texas plains archeological region have been
formulated by Hester (1980), Hall et al. (1986), and Black (1989). More recently,
Hester (1995) has refined these syntheses in a general overview of the cultural
history of the region.
These syntheses provide an outline of the basic
chronological divisions. This sequence, adapted from Black (1989) and Hester
(1995), is based on four prehistoric time periods roughly parallel to those found
in central Texas. These time periods include: Paleoindian (11,200-8,000 B.P.),
Archaic (8,000-1,200 B.P.), Late Prehistoric (1,200-400 B.P.), and Protohistoric
(400-300 B.P.). Similar to the cultural chronology provided for the central Texas
archeological region, these divisions represent contrived temporal categories, but
they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and
are reflected in changes in lithic and other technologies. These technological
changes further reflect changes in broader patterns of the environment and
culture.
The most commonly recorded sites in south Texas are open occupation sites. In
some cases, meaningful excavation of these sites has proven to be a challenge to
archeologists (Hester 1995). This vexing situation stems from the exclusively
horizontal patterning of many open occupation sites in the region. These sites
tend to exist as laterally extensive occupation areas where temporally separated
components occur on a single surface without overlapping (Hester 1995). Other
open occupation sites, especially in upland settings, occur on stable ancient
surfaces with very shallow or deflated cultural deposits that are sometimes
impossible to conclusively attribute to a particular time period. Comparatively
few deeply stratified occupation sites have been excavated in south Texas. Black
posits that this is a result of both settlement patterning and depositional context
(Black 1989).
Other site types present in south Texas include lithic
procurement and reduction sites, rockshelters, artifact caches, and burials.
Lithic procurement and reduction sites are somewhat common and are typically

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

found in upland areas where chert resources in the form of Uvalde gravels
occur.
Much of the prehistoric data on south Texas derive from Choke Canyon. There,
archeologists found sites spanning the entire spectrum of south Texas
prehistory. Only a handful of Paleoindian sites have been recorded at Choke
Canyon, and these were found as shallow surface manifestations (Hall et al.
1986) suggesting that indigenous groups inhabited this region only briefly as
they passed through. Hester (1987) has suggested that another explanation for
the paucity of Paleoindian sites is that erosion and shifting river channels have
caused massive destruction of these already ephemeral remains. The Early
Archaic is likewise poorly represented at Choke Canyon, though data collected
from two carefully built stone hearths indicate that native peoples may have
relied heavily on aquatic resources. This idea is further supported by a
noticeable dearth of projectile points, which would otherwise indicate a strong
reliance on hunting (Hall et al. 1986). The archeology of Choke Canyon suggests
that during the Middle Archaic to Late Archaic periods, the population began to
steadily increase. Site types and artifacts increasingly demonstrate a reliance
on plant foods and small mammal consumption. The incidences of burned rock
middens increase (though these occur more commonly in central Texas), as well
as ground stone, flake tools, and distally beveled gouges (Hall et al. 1986). As in
other parts of Texas, sites of the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods in
south Texas demonstrate a radical shift in technology with the abandonment of
the typical dart point and gouge tool kit and adoption of arrow points and
ceramic technology. Sites tend to be more closely clustered around creeks,
rather than dispersed along other landforms.
Families of European descent began migrating northward from Mexico into the
Atascosa County area and establishing ranches during the mid-eighteenth
century. According to Peterson (1996), they named the area “Atascosa” based
on the boggy conditions they encountered in the region. After the Texas
Revolution, the Mexican ranches were broken up, and Anglo immigrants
eventually settled the area starting in the late 1840s. In 1856, the area was
separated from Bexar County and officially named Atascosa County, with the
county seat in Navatasco. However, the county seat was moved to Pleasanton in
1858.
In the early years, the population of Atascosa County remained low as a result of
isolation due to poor roads and the threat of Indian attacks. However, the
population began to steadily increase following the Civil War due to new waves
of European and Mexican immigration and the extension of the Great Northern
Railway across the northern tip of the county (Peterson 1996). Cattle ranching
sharply increased from the 1860s to the 1870s followed by agriculture
(particularly cotton) towards the end of the nineteenth century.

Archeological Survey –Pleasanton Sewer Pipeline – July 2007

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

The early twentieth century saw a dramatic increase in the amount of rail lines
spanning Atascosa County, and the increased transportation enabled the
establishment of new towns. In 1910, the county seat was moved out of
Pleasanton and into Jourdanton. Extraction of oil, coal, and natural gas in
Atascosa County began in the early twentieth century and helped reduce the
impact of the Great Depression. Agriculture, ranching, and fossil fuels continue
to be leading sources for income in the county to this day (Peterson 1996).
The city of Pleasanton itself was founded in 1858 when nearby Indian attacks
forced the residents of Atascosa County to move their county seat. Pleasanton
was settled at the mouth of Bonita Creek and named after John Pleasant, one of
the original settlers. Although the county seat was removed from Pleasanton in
1910, the town continued to experience growth due to the influx of railroads in
the area. By 1917, Pleasanton had become a staging point for cattle drives
leading northward into Kansas. The city made a name for itself as “the
birthplace of the cowboy,” and it held its first cowboy homecoming festival in
1966. The city has grown steadily and in 1994 reached a population of 8,042
(Dutton 1996).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Archival research for this project was conducted at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission. According to
available data, there are no Official State Historical Markers (OSHMs) located
within the project area, nor are there any State Archeological Landmarks (SALs),
archeological sites or sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The San Ysidro Cemetery, however is located directly adjacent to the
proposed line which bypasses the cemetery boundary on its south side along
Coughran Road. The city’s first cemetery is contained within the San Ysidro
Cemetery, approximately 325 feet north of the proposed alignment. According to
maps located at the THC, there have been no archeological surveys conducted
within the project area.
Although there are no previously recorded cultural resources within the
proposed project area, four previously recorded archeological sites are located
adjacent to the project’s western terminus. These sites (41AT143, 41AT144,
41AT145, and 41AT146) are recorded as prehistoric archeological sites,
containing sparse lithic debitage documented on the surface or shallowly buried,
at depths of 10 to 40 centimeters (4 to 16 inches) below the surface. One of
these sites (41AT144) was recorded based on the excavation of a Fairland-like
dartpoint dating to the transitional Archaic/Prehistoric period. Site 41AT146 is
located immediately adjacent to the proposed project area on the west side of

County Road 433. All four sites are believed to represent the remains of an open
camp or a lithic procurement area. These sites were recorded during a 1995
survey conducted prior to expansion of the Pleasanton Airport. Research for
this project was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a pedestrian archeological survey
supplemented with shovel tests and backhoe trenching for the proposed
Pleasanton wastewater pipeline project, from the city’s wastewater treatment
facility to CR 433 (Airport Road), in Atascosa County, Texas (Figure 1). Hicks &
Company’s intensive survey of the project area was designed and performed in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum survey standards
for linear projects, which requires 16 shovel tests per mile, per 100 feet of width.
Additionally, three backhoe trenches were excavated near the confluence of
Bonita Creek and the Atascosa River, where alluvial sediment extended beyond
the maximum depth able to be evaluated through shovel testing. All excavated
soil was screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. Each shovel test was recorded in
10-centimeter levels on standardized forms and plotted on an aerial photograph
of the project area. Once this data was recorded, all of the shovel tests were
backfilled.
The results of each shovel test were documented through
standardized forms, field notes, and photographs. Areas of disturbance were
documented through notes and photographs.
No cultural material was
encountered as a result of survey investigations, and all project related
documents and records will be permanently curated at TARL.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY AND SHOVEL TESTING
The investigators were granted right-of-entry for 100% of the project area
(Figures 2 and 3). Although right-of-entry was obtained for the entire project
area, approximately 1/3 of the total length of the proposed alignment was
located beneath existing roadway, or immediately adjacent to it in disturbed or
low probability contexts (Figures 4, 5, and 6). The ground surface of these
properties was inspected visually and documented photographically. Of the 47
shovel tests excavated, none were positive for cultural material. Investigation
documented several areas containing modern and natural disturbance within
the project area.
The field survey began at the western terminus of the project area, at CR 433
(Airport Road). Archeologists surveyed two proposed alignment alternatives for
approximately 3,100 feet. Ten shovel tests were excavated on each alternative,
revealing shallow sandy loam over ancient clayey soil, ranging from 50 to 100
centimeters (20 to 40 inches) in depth.
The two alternatives merge
approximately 1,000 feet west of Oakhaven Road, and continue eastward as a
single alignment. Three shovel tests were excavated on this portion of the new
alignment.

The remaining 10,900 feet of the proposed alignment, between Oakhaven Road
and the city wastewater treatment facility, follows an existing wastewater
pipeline. This pipeline is generally routed alongside Bonita Creek, moving in a
northeastward direction to its confluence with the Atascosa River. Between
Oakhaven Road and the area around Highway 97, a large amount of modern
disturbance was documented due to current construction (Figure 7), existing
roadways (Figures 8 and 9), and relatively recent commercial and private
construction (Figures 10, 11 and 12). Within this portion of the alignment, five
shovel tests were excavated through what was generally a brown to yellowish
brown sandy clay loam over yellowish brown to reddish, compact clay. This
ancient soil was encountered between 45 and 100 centimeters (18 and 40
inches) below the surface. Disturbed soils were characterized by mottled clays
with variable amounts of an intermixed, sandy matrix.

Results of Field Investigations

The following 3,300 feet was surveyed through open pastureland that had been
recently plowed (Figure 13), or beneath transmission lines (Figure 14), which
lead directly towards the end of Coughran Road (Old Christine Road, Humble
Camp Road). Eleven shovel tests were excavated within this portion of the
project area. Soils were increasingly shallow near Bonita Creek, terminated at
compact, ancient soil that was encountered at 50 and 60 centimeters (20 and 24
inches) below the surface on opposite banks of the creek. A small drainage was
traversed on the south side of Bonita Creek, where modern dumping was evident
(Figure 15). Throughout the portion of the proposed alignment between Bonita
Creek and Coughran Road, the existing pipeline is visible at drainage crossings
and eroding out of the ground surface. Further modern dumping was observed
on the surface immediately south of the existing pipeline near the west end of
Coughran Road.

Results of Field Investigations

Pedestrian survey was conducted for approximately 3,150 feet, where the
proposed alignment passes beneath or immediately adjacent to Coughran Road
and Martinez Street (see Figures 4, 5, and 6). Because of the visibly disturbed
context, no subsurface investigation was conducted.
The remaining 1,800 feet of the proposed alignment follows the existing pipeline
route along the southern bank of Bonita Creek, across the Atascosa River to the
city’s wastewater treatment plant on Hunt Road. Because the more active
alluvial environment in this area presented the greatest potential to contain
buried cultural remains, shovel tests were excavated at 50-meter intervals. With
the exception of the first shovel test, excavated on the upper terrace immediately
north of Martinez Street, all of these shovel tests were excavated to a depth of
one meter below the surface.
A fairly uniform, brown clay loam was
encountered in all shovel tests, and no cultural material was recovered. The
shallowly buried pipeline was also visible in this area at drainage crossings
(Figure 16) and through a manhole that was opened while evaluating the
project alignment with the CEC project engineer. The small portion of the
alignment on the north side of the Atascosa River was not shovel tested due to
extensive disturbance related to activity at the wastewater treatment facility
(Figure 17).

SAN YSIDRO CEMETERY
The San Ysidro Cemetery is located directly adjacent to the proposed line, which
skirts the cemetery boundary on its south side along Coughran Road (see
Figure 5). The city’s first cemetery is contained within the San Ysidro Cemetery,
according to the Texas Historical Commission online site’s Atlas. This portion of
the cemetery, which has the greatest potential to contain unmarked graves, is
located approximately 325 feet north of the proposed pipeline alignment. Most
of the graves in the old part of the cemetery, date to the 1860s or later (Figures
18, 19, and 20). Nearest the proposed alignment and Coughran Road, in the
southern portion of the cemetery, all graves are marked with dates ranging from
the 1960s to 1990s (Figure 21). In addition to these recent interments, many of
the plots in this area belong to individuals who have not yet passed away. A
high-pressure gas pipeline was routed across the front edge of the San Ysidro
Cemetery sometime within the past 50 years (Steve Braune, personal
communication 2007), severely limiting the potential for unmarked graves to be
encountered in this area. The existing wastewater pipeline is routed beneath the
paved roadway, approximately 30 feet south of the well-marked gas line (Figure
22). Due to the fact that the most recent graves were located near the southern
edge of the cemetery, the presence of a gas line within the cemetery boundary,
and the existing line within the Coughran Road right-of-way, investigators judge
the potential for unmarked burials outside of the south cemetery boundary to be
very low. Consequently, no shovel tests or backhoe scraping was conducted
there.

BACKHOE TRENCHES
In addition to the pedestrian survey and shovel testing conducted between
Martinez Street and the Atascosa River, three backhoe trenches were excavated
to explore the potential for deeply buried cultural material (see Figures 2 and
3). No evidence of cultural activity was observed in any of the trenches.
Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated at the confluence of Bonita Creek and the
Atascosa River (Figure 23). Soils in this trench consisted of a dark brown silty
clay loam from 0 to 73 centimeters (29 inches) below the surface, followed by
approximately 70 centimeters (28 inches) of alternating bands of sand and silty
clay loam.
Below these thin bands of rapidly deposited sediment was
approximately 1.6 meters (5.25 feet) of relatively homogenous sand, underlain
by mottled and damp clay at around 3.7 meters (12 feet) below the surface. This
trench was terminated at sterile soil near the water table and the maximum
reach of the backhoe (Figure 24).

Results of Field Investigations

Backhoe Trenches 2 and 3 were excavated in a cleared area of the Bonita Creek
floodplain, approximately 1,200 feet southeast of the Atascosa River. The soil
profile in these trenches was similar to that of Backhoe Trench 1, with
approximately 80 centimeters (31 inches) of silty clay loam over compact sandy
clay. Sandstone bedrock was encountered at 3.3 meters (11 feet) below the
surface in Backhoe Trench 2, thus terminating the excavation (Figure 25).
Backhoe Trench 3 was terminated due to sterile, course, sandy clay and the
maximum reach of the backhoe at 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) below the surface
(Figure 26). At this depth, as in Backhoe Trench 1, the soil was very wet and
approaching the water table. No cultural material was recovered in either of
these trenches. Following the completion of excavation, the data from all
trenches were recorded on standardized Backhoe Trench forms, the general area
and trench profiles were photographed, and the trenches were immediately filled
and packed.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists surveyed approximately 15,000 feet of pipeline
right-of-way for the proposed City of Pleasanton wastewater pipeline upgrade
project. The survey involved pedestrian survey supplemented with 47 shovel
tests and three backhoe trenches. No cultural material was encountered on the
surface or within any of the subsurface tests. Existing roadway rights-of-way
and other disturbed contexts were visually inspected and documented through
notes and photographs. Surveyors documented slightly rolling to relatively flat
topography, characterized by thin sandy soils consisting of loams and clay
loams. Deeper alluvial soils were only encountered near the confluence of
Bonita Creek and the Atascosa River.
The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4417 and in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National
Historical Preservation Act. All work conformed to 36 CFR 800, outlining the
guidelines for implementing Section 106, and the Texas Historical Commission’s
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas under 13 TAC
26. No archeological sites were recorded.
Based on the results of investigations, the proposed wastewater pipeline
construction will have no impact on any archeological resources.
It is
recommended that the proposed alignment within all properties investigated as
part of this survey (see Figures 2 and 3) should be allowed to proceed to
construction, relative to the requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA and
the Antiquities Code of Texas.
