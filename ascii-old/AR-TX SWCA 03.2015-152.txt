ABSTRACT
On behalf of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and Terracon, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted archaeological monitoring of portions of the District Heating and Cooling
Project (DHCP) construction in Galveston County, Texas. The work was conducted in compliance with a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between UTMB, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the Texas Division of Emergency Management
(TDEM). Under that agreement, FEMA, through TDEM, provided UTMB assistance for the replacement
of a campus-wide heating and cooling pipeline network damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008.
The MOA required monitoring of ground disturbing activities connected to open cut utility trenches, boring
pits, the East Plant floodwall, and thermal water storage tanks. SWCA conducted this monitoring in
accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code
[USC] 470) and its implementing regulations, 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800, and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6482.
Additionally, the MOA required UTMB to document historic resources in the project area that would be
affected by the project, including the dormitories, Morgan Hall, and Nolan Hall, scheduled for demolition
for the East Plant construction. Terracon completed this documentation in a separate investigation, not
included within this investigation or report.
The current investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review along with
monitoring of excavation areas during the course of construction on an extensive, deeply buried utilities
pipeline. In cases where unanticipated features or artifacts were encountered, work in the area stopped
immediately while an SWCA archaeologist documented these finds. Findings were then relayed to THC
and FEMA archaeologists, who assisted in determinations of significance and the future course of action.
Between April 4, 2013, and February 14, 2014, a Secretary of the Interior Qualified Archaeologist (as
defined by 36 CFR 61) from SWCA monitored all excavations associated with construction of the DHCP.
After that point, FEMA clarified the demands of the MOA, such that UTMB was only required to monitor
certain, limited ground disturbing activities. As such, monitoring was conducted sporadically between April
7 and October 17, 2014, though SWCA remained on-call in case the project encountered any previously
unrecorded discoveries.
Historic archaeological deposits and features were encountered within the sub-street excavations associated
with the DHCP. No prehistoric cultural resources were identified during excavation. Historic deposits
included isolated artifacts, portions of historic-period street surfacing, and portions of historic
utilities/infrastructure. These archaeological deposits constituted only a portion of the extensive historic
street network of Galveston, which stretches across much of the eastern end of Galveston Island. Similar
features have been encountered in street excavations across the island and appear to be ubiquitous and
unexceptional. They embodied no distinctive characteristics, had no known association with significant
historic individuals, and were unlikely to yield further information about the history of the area. In
consultation with the THC and FEMA archaeologists, these features and deposits were considered as
isolated finds NOT ELIGIBLE for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and no further work
is recommended.
In addition, the DHCP route crossed a portion of the NRHP-listed 1904 Galveston Seawall. A buried portion
of the wall was identified during excavation. SWCA archaeologists undertook an extensive documentation
of the exposed portion of the seawall and monitored and documented the demolition of a small portion of
the wall in accordance with the MOA. In consultation with THC and FEMA archaeologists, no further work
is recommended within this area of the 1904 Galveston Seawall at this time.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Project Title. Archaeological Monitoring of Portions of the University of Texas Medical Branch District
Heating and Cooling Project, Galveston County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 25926
Project Description. The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) is constructing a District
Heating and Cooling Project (DHCP) network replacing a system damaged during Hurricane Ike. The
project, which is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), involves the placement
of a series of pipes around the UTMB campus. These were constructed through both open excavation and
deep directional boring. As excavation areas were usually located within the street network of the City of
Galveston and impacts were deep, a preliminary survey of cultural resources in the area was impossible.
Instead, archaeological monitors were on-site during excavation in order to identify and document any
intact historic or prehistoric cultural resources.
Location. The DHCP is located in and around the UTMB campus on the eastern end of Galveston Island,
in Galveston County, Texas. The approximate boundaries for the project area are 12th Street on the west,
Market Street on the South, 4th Street on the East, and Harborside Drive on the North. Monitored excavation
areas were located on 12th Street between the Strand and Mechanic Street, Mechanic Street between 12th
and 11th Streets, 11th Street between Mechanic and Market Streets, Market Street between 11th and 4th
Street, the lot on the northwest corner of the intersection of 11th Street and the Strand, and the lot at the
southwest corner of the intersection of Harborside Drive and 4th Street.
Number of Acres Monitored. 1.27 acres
Principal Investigator. Todd Butler
Purpose of Work. Archaeological monitoring was conducted in accordance with a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) between UTMB, FEMA, the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the Texas
Division of Emergency Management (TDEM). In order to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing
regulations (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800), the MOA required that a Secretary of the Interior
Qualified Archaeologist monitor all ground disturbing activities associated with the DHCP.
Number of Sites. Historic archaeological remains were encountered within all excavation areas, and
included isolated historic artifacts and a number of archaeological features associated with nineteenth
century streetscape. This included historic paving and street preparations, utilities, drainage canals and
conduits, curbs, and sidewalks. Excavation also uncovered a buried portion of the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP)-listed 1904 Galveston Seawall.
Eligibility. In consultation with the THC and FEMA archaeologists, these isolated features and deposits
were considered as isolated finds NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP, and no further work is recommended for
these features/deposits.
In addition, the DHCP route crossed a portion of the NRHP-listed 1904 Galveston Seawall. A buried portion
of the wall was identified during excavation. SWCA archaeologists undertook an extensive documentation
of the exposed portion of the seawall and monitored and documented the demolition of a small portion of
the wall, in accordance with the MOA. In consultation with THC and FEMA archaeologists, no further
work is recommended within this area of the 1904 Galveston Seawall.

Curation. No artifacts were collected over the course of monitoring. Identified artifacts were tabulated,
analyzed, and documented in field and not collected.
Comments. In accordance with the MOA, Section 106 of the NHPA, and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
SWCA has completed archaeological monitoring of construction activities associated with the UTMB
DHCP and fully documented the demolition of a portion of the NRHP-listed 1904 Galveston Seawall. As
such, SWCA recommends that no further archaeological work is necessary at this time.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
On behalf of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and Terracon, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted archaeological monitoring of portions of the District Heating and Cooling
Project (DHCP) construction in Galveston County, Texas. The work was conducted in compliance with a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between UTMB, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the Texas Division of Emergency Management
(TDEM). Under that agreement, FEMA, through TDEM, provided UTMB assistance for the replacement
of a campus-wide heating and cooling pipeline network damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008.
The MOA required monitoring of ground disturbing activities connected to open cut utility trenches, boring
pits, the East Plant floodwall, and thermal water storage tanks. SWCA conducted this monitoring in
accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code
[USC] 470) and its implementing regulations, 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800, and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6482.
Additionally, the MOA required UTMB to document historic resources in the project area that would be
affected by the project, including the dormitories, Morgan Hall, and Nolan Hall, scheduled for demolition
for the East Plant construction. Terracon completed this documentation in a separate investigation, not
included within this investigation or report.
The current investigation included an archaeological background literature review and monitoring of
construction activities. In cases where unanticipated features or artifacts were encountered, work in the area
stopped immediately while a SWCA archaeologist documented these finds. Findings were then relayed to
THC and FEMA archaeologists who assisted in determinations of significance and the future course of
action.
Between April 4, 2013, and February 14, 2014, a Secretary of the Interior Qualified Archaeologist (as
defined by 36 CFR 61) from SWCA monitored all excavations associated with construction of the DHCP.
After that point, FEMA clarified the demands of the MOA, such that UTMB was only required to monitor
certain, limited ground disturbing activities. As such, monitoring was conducted sporadically between April
7 and October 17, 2014, though SWCA remained on-call in case the project encountered any previously
unrecorded discoveries or developed unanticipated effects.
Todd Butler served as Principal Investigator for the investigation. Monitoring was conducted by several
archaeologists over the course of the project, including Wesley Mattox, Todd Butler, and Lindsay Smith.

Project Description and Definition of Study Area
The DHCP project area is located within Galveston County, on the eastern end of Galveston Island, within
the urban area of the City of Galveston (Figure 1). After the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Ike in
2008, UTMB sought to create a unified hot and cold water distribution network to serve the UTMB campus.
This network included both above and belowground pipes, as well as the construction of a new facility on
the east side of campus. Aboveground pipes were to be placed on bridges and the belowground pipes would
be placed within open cut trenches or utilizing a horizontal boring. To create the bored sections of the
pipeline, several access pits were placed across campus. Most of the required excavation was located within
the existing street network of Galveston Island.

The project route begins at the intersection of 12th Street and the Strand (Avenue B), runs south to the
corner of 12th and Mechanic Streets, east to the intersection of Mechanic and 11th Streets, turns south to
the intersection of 11th and Market Streets, then east to the intersection of Market and 5th Street. At that
point, the pipeline runs north along 5th Street and terminates on the north side of the intersection of 5th
Street and Avenue B (Strand). The sections along 12th and Mechanic Streets, as well as a small section at
the intersection of Market and 6th Streets, were constructed in open cut trenches; the rest of the pipe was
constructed through boring. An additional open cut excavation was constructed at the East Plant location
and the location of Bridge A at the intersection of 11th Street and the Strand. Bore pit locations were spaced
across the length of the bore route. Open cut excavations were generally shallow, approximately 12 to 14
feet deep; the boring operation was as deep as 22 feet below the surface. The project alignment was rerouted
after monitoring was completed at Bore Pits 12 and 13. Bore Pits 12 and 13 are now located outside of the
project route.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The UTMB DHCP area is located within the urban environment of modern Galveston, Texas. As such, the
environmental setting has been heavily modified from the original environmental context. Most of the
project area is located within the street network of Galveston and is paved. Areas outside of the streets were
located within the facilities of UTMB and consisted of either building footprints or manicured lawns.

Geology
Bureau of Economic Geology maps (Barnes 1982) provide a background for understanding the formation
of Galveston Island. Galveston Island is one of numerous barrier islands along the Texas coast and is
comprised of Holocene-age deposits of sands, silts, and clays on barrier ridges and barrier flats. These 20to 40-foot-deep deposits were laid down by wind, wave, and currents along the coast. Other portions of
Galveston Island are mapped as Holocene-age fill and spoil deposits; anthropogenic layers of dredge fill
from offshore deposits placed on the island to raise or grade the ground surface. These layers are comprised
of varying quantities of mud, silt, sand, and shell.

Soils
The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey provides maps of soil formation on
Galveston Island. The area around UTMB is mapped as a combination of Galveston, Mustang, and Urban
series soils (NRCS 2014).
The Galveston series consists of soils formed in deep, sandy sediments on level to 5 to 12 percent sloped
barrier islands and may be occasionally flooded with salt water. A thin A horizon, characterized by 6 inches
of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand, overlays parent material composed of pale brown to very pale
brown (10YR 6/3 to 10YR 7/3) fine sands.
Mustang series soils consist of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on 0 to 1 percent slopes
that pond after periods of rain. A thin A horizon of 11 inches of brown to pale brown (10YR 5/3 to 10YR
6/3) fine sand overlays parent material composed of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) to gray (5Y 5/1) fine
sands to at least 6.5 feet below the surface.
The Urban series consists of material that has been changed or disturbed by human activities in an urban
context, including the addition of anthropogenic fill, the introduction of concrete or other stabilizing agents,
intensive construction, and other activities that affect the chemical and sedimentary composition of the soil.

Houston-PALM
The Houston-Potential Archaeological Liability Map (PALM), created by the Texas Department of
Transportation, maps the geoarchaeological potential of different landforms within the Houston area. Deep
and new soils have a higher potential of harboring deeply buried and protected archaeological sites. Both
the mapped soils within the project area, the Mustang and Galveston series, are considered to have high
potential for deeply buried cultural strata (Abbott 2001:21). The Houston-PALM also presents
recommended levels of surveys for different environments. The project area is recorded as Map Unit 3 and
3a, suggesting deep reconnaissance, if deep impacts are expected (Abbott 2001:156).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL SETTING
This chapter presents a summary of human occupation on Galveston Island and the surrounding area in
order to provide context for any archaeological findings encountered during monitoring. The chapter is
divided into the prehistoric and historic sections, divided based on the appearance of Europeans in Texas
in 1528. However, during a significant portion of the historic period, between 1528 and approximately
1800, Texas was largely distant from European influence, and Native American lifeways predominated.
Evidence of Native American occupation during this protohistoric period is included under the prehistoric
section.

Prehistoric Cultural Setting
Occupation of the North American continent has been documented for at least 11,500 years. Although there
is some scant evidence that human occupation of the western hemisphere may date even earlier, clear
evidence indicates that Native Americans were well established in Texas by around 9500 B.C. (Adovasio et
al. 1990; Bousman et al. 2004). Human responses to the varying challenges of life have varied across both
space and time, resulting in distinct patterns of occupation, subsistence, and technology. These differences
have necessitated that archaeologists divide the archaeological record geographically into similarly-related
cultural areas. The current project lies within the Southeast Texas archaeological zone, as described by
Perttula (2004). Similarly, changes in past behavior have been used to further delineate archaeologically
observed periods. In Southeast Texas, the most common temporal divisions are the Paleoindian, the
Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric/Ceramic periods (Perttula 2004). Archaeology in coastal Texas is
complicated by a complex geological environment. Rising sea levels following the end of the last ice age
flooded up to 50 miles of land which now lies under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Aten 1983). This
process ended approximately 3,000 years ago, at which point the system of barrier islands and bays began
to be established (Aten 1983:157).

Paleoindian Period
The earliest documented occupation in Southeast Texas occurred during the Paleoindian period (ca. 9500
to 6000 B.C.). Paleoindian sites are extremely rare in the region, and artifacts occur almost exclusively in
isolated contexts. Paleoindian artifacts include a series of lanceolate projectile points including Clovis,
Folsom, and Scottsbluff points (Story 1990). Few sites in Southeast Texas have large Paleoindian
components. The best documented Paleoindian site in the area is the McFaddin Beach site, located in
Jefferson County, northeast of Galveston. Over the years, a large number of Paleoindian projectile points,
including Clovis and Folsom points, have washed ashore in the area (Turner and Tanner 1994). While these
artifacts are clearly out of their original context, the high quantity suggests an extensive Paleoindian site
exists just off the coast. Nearer to Galveston, one Clovis point has been recorded washed up on Crystal
Beach on the Bolivar Peninsula, suggesting that submerged sites may exist off the coast in the vicinity of
Galveston, and at least 21 Paleoindian sites have been recorded in Harris County (Bousman et al. 2004:64).
Paleoindian sites have most often been associated with big-game hunting of species such as mammoth and
bison, though continued research has suggested that Paleoindian groups employed broad-ranged
subsistence strategies (Bousman et al. 2004:75).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C. to A.D. 1) is generally limited to the time between the end of the
Wisconsin glaciation and the appearance of ceramics and bow and arrow technology in the archaeological
record. The inhabitants of the coastal plain at this time were largely hunters and gatherers (Story 1985;
Perttula 2004). The Archaic period is usually divided into three periods roughly corresponding to large
scale climatic changes (Johnson and Goode 1994; Perttula 2004).

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic period dates between 6000 and 4000 B.C. and is a generally warmer period following
the end of the last glacial maximum. This period is poorly represented in the archaeological record of the
Texas coast. This is likely due, in part, to sea level rise, which would wipe out sites near water bodies, a
common location for Archaic-period occupations (Newcomb 2004). Known coastal archaeological sites
occur on slightly higher locations outside of the areas affected by sea level rise (Ricklis 2004: 187).
Galveston Island, by all appearances, would seem to be one such location, but in actuality, Galveston
formed as a barrier island (as opposed to an older upland inundated during sea level rise), and was not
formed until sea levels stabilized (Ricklis 1994: 5). Coastal sites with dense and stratified Early Archaic
occupations include a site on Dickinson Bayou near Friendswood, Texas, and the Eagleâs Ridge site at the
mouth of the Trinity River (Ensor and Ricklis 1998; Ricklis 2004; Hines 1992). Shell middens at these sites
suggest that patterns of shellfish use were established early in the Archaic period, even as sea levels had
not yet stabilized (Aten 1983). In fact, these patterns appear to be interrupted by several long hiatuses as
sea levels changed rapidly, destroying productive estuarine environments (Ricklis 2004: 187). Settlement
research elsewhere suggests that Early Archaic population density was relatively low (Story 1985:34). In
terms of chipped stone tools, the side- and corner-notched projectile point traditions found in the rest of
Texas are not present in Southeast Texas; instead, a series of points, including the Neches River and Trinity
points, are found (Hester 1995; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990).

MIDDLE ARCHAIC
The Middle Archaic dates between 4000 and 1000 B.C., and roughly corresponds to the peak warm and dry
period of the middle Holocene. Data on Middle Archaic sites are as sparse as Early Archaic sites, possibly
in part due a rapid sea level rise which affected estuarine resources between approximately 2200 and 1100
B.C., and possibly led to a decline in coastal resource exploitation (Ricklis 2004:187; Aten 1983:154-157).
Projectile point types in the Middle Archaic period include Yarbrough, Bulverde, and Travis points (Ricklis
2004). Middens from the Harris County Boys School site on Galveston Bay suggest that coastal sites were
seasonally occupied in order to take advantage of shellfish resources (Aten 1983:157). Little subsistence
data has been identified outside the coastal zone, however, so only a partial picture of Archaic subsistence
is available (Ricklis 2004:185). It is likely that Native American groups utilized large territories oriented
along major drainages, providing access to resources from a number of different areas (Anderson and
Sassaman 2004; Sassaman and Anderson 2004). Other cultural patterns that appear more commonly in the
Middle Archaic are the presence of large cemeteries, such as at the Ernest Witte site in the Brazos River
valley and the Harris County Boys School site (Ricklis 2004; Taylor 2001; Aten 1983).

LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic dates to between 1000 B.C. and approximately A.D. 1, a period of warmer, wetter climate
comparable to the present, and ends with the introduction of ceramics in Southeast Texas. This period
features a general continuation of patterns established during the Middle Archaic, though sites are more
common and easier to identify in the area around Galveston Bay as the sea level stabilized during the last
millennia B.C. (Aten 1983:124). With the stabilization of the coastline, Galveston Island appears to have
begun to develop during this period (Ricklis 2004:5). Projectile point types common in Southeast Texas at
this point include Kent and Gary points (Ricklis 2004). Other lithic artifacts include boatstones, gorgets,
plummets, and distinctive corner-tang bifaces (Story 1990:221). Subsistence patterns appear to continue
relatively unchanged from the Middle Archaic, with large shell middens along the coast. Populations appear
to have grown fairly substantially in this period; cemeteries are often much larger, and sites are more
common (Story 1990; Ricklis 2004).

Late Prehistoric/Ceramic Period
The Late Prehistoric period in Southeast Texas dates from approximately A.D. 1 to 1528, and corresponds
with the introduction of ceramics and the bow and arrow into the archaeological record. Ceramics appear
around 70 B.C. in the area closer to the Louisiana border, and around A.D. 100 in the Galveston Bay area
(Aten 1983). These earliest ceramics contain low concentrations of temper and were often poorly wedged;
they appear to be similar to Tchefuncte ceramics of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Ricklis 2004). The
cultures of Southeast Texas have been collectively referred to as the Mossy Grove culture, as they share
technological and subsistence adaptations distinct from, but similar to, Woodland cultures of the rest of the
American Southeast (Story 1990:256). Over a short period of time, the Mossy Grove culture appears to
develop its own, distinct form of ceramic technology, utilizing dense, sandy pastes in thinner ceramics
called Goose Creek. These ceramic are sometimes decorated with a simple set of incised lines and stamping;
however, the most common varieties are plain (Aten 1983).
The bow and arrow is generally represented archaeologically by small projectile points. Larger Late Archaic
Gary dart points continued through the first part of the Late Prehistoric period, until approximately A.D.
700 (Ricklis 2004:194). Afterwards, the appearance of smaller points, including Alba, Catahoula, and
Scallorn types, signals the introduction of the bow and arrow (Turner and Hester 1999).
In the later portion of the Late Prehistoric period, the Perdiz point, often associated with both the Toyah
and Rockport phases of the Texas interior and central coast, respectively, appears in the archaeological
record, possibly suggesting a shift towards hunting adaptations including the exploitation of large game
(Ricklis 1994, 2004). The Rockport phase of the central coast has been tied to the Karankawa tribes that
were documented on the coastal plain in the historic period, suggesting that adaptations established in the
Late Prehistoric were still in effect in the early historic period (Ricklis 1996:27). The characteristic
asphaltum-decorated ceramics of the Rockport phase were not encountered on Galveston Island, and only
appear further down the coast (Ricklis 1994; Aten 1983). Instead, the later parts of the Late Prehistoric in
the Galveston Bay area feature grog-tempered pottery, including Baytown Plain and San Jacinto wares,
likely influenced by technological changes introduced in Louisiana and the Mississippi Valley (Aten 1983;
Ricklis 2004).
Cemeteries continue to appear in the Late Prehistoric period, both inland and along the coast. Burials
continued at the Ernest Witte site on the Brazos River (Story 1990:238). At Blue Bayou on Matagorda Bay,
a study of at least 40 individuals found that overall population health appeared good during the early part
of the late historic period (Comuzzie 1987). At the Mitchell Ridge site on Galveston Island, excavations
encountered burials dating from the Late Archaic until the historic period, suggesting long-term
reoccupation of the site, as well as possible indications of group continuity through time (Ricklis 1994).

In terms of subsistence, it is unlikely that Mossy Grove cultures developed any type of horticulture. As in
earlier periods, groups continued to maintain a more dispersed settlement pattern that included seasonal
migrations. Spring and summer was spent along the coast, with the rest of the years spent inland (Story
1990:258). Excavations within the area of Addicks Reservoir and at Eagleâs Ridge on the Trinity River
suggest that more inland settlements and/or groups exploited large mammals, including buffalo and whitetailed deer (Wheat 1953; Ricklis 2004:187).

Protohistoric Period
Native groups in the Galveston Bay area, due to their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, had some of the
earliest contact with European explorers and colonists in the history of Texas. However, this contact was
not sustained or formalized, and Native American lifeways predominated in the area until the late eighteenth
to early nineteenth centuries. The Protohistoric period (A.D. 1528 to 1810) began with several sixteenthcentury expeditions to the area, most notably Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca's travels stemming from the
failed Panfilo de Narvaez expedition in 1527. Although it is not completely certain where Cabeza de Vaca
landed, evidence points to Galveston Island (Ricklis 1996:107).
The identity of the inhabitants of Galveston at that time is unclear; called the Capoques, they appear to have
been a Karankawa tribe (Newcomb 2004). The normal range given to the northernmost Karankawa tribe,
the Cocos, generally does not extend past the Brazos River valley (Ricklis 1996:6). Definitive Karankawa
settlement on Galveston Island did not occur until well into the historic period, likely in the mid-1700s
(Ricklis 1996:7). The eastern side of Galveston Bay was inhabited by a number of Atakapan-speaking
groups, including the Atakapans (proper) and the Akokisa (Newcomb 2004). Galveston Bay may have been
a dividing line between these cultures, with settlements around the bay shifting and levels of interaction
changing over time.
Archaeological sites from this period are characterized by a near-disappearance of native-made pottery,
except for Goose Creek Plain (Story 1990:260). Sites 41CH110 and 41CH32 in Chambers County, in the
Trinity River area, both appear to date to this period (Aten 1983:283). At Mitchell Ridge, groups continued
to bury their dead on Galveston Island throughout the Protohistoric period, suggesting little change in
lifeways throughout the period. Conclusively-dated European artifacts do not appear at Mitchell Ridge until
the middle of the eighteenth century (Ricklis 1994:470). Subsistence did not change much during this
period. Hunting, gathering, and fishing still provided the main source of sustenance; however, the
Atakapans and Akokisa appear to have slowly begun to incorporate horticulture into their subsistence
patterns (Newcomb 2004:661).

Historic Cultural Setting
European Exploration and Expansion
European documentation, control, and exploitation of Texas grew slowly after initial contact in 1528. As
noted, Cabeza de Vaca was shipwrecked near Galveston Bay in 1528, and began a years-long odyssey
living among and documenting the Native American groups of Texas (Hester 1999). Soon afterwards,
remnants of the Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, crossed through central
Texas in 1542, but found the country âuninvitingâ (Hudson 1997). As such, there was little interest or
pressure for colonization and Europeans largely avoided the area.

For approximately 150 years, contact between Native American groups and Europeans was sporadic, until
the French began to make incursions into the western Gulf of Mexico. French explorer Robert Sieur de La
Salle wrecked in Matagorda Bay in 1685, during an attempt to colonize the area (Weddle 2010). This
earliest French presence in Texas proved short-lived, as La Salleâs settlement in Matagorda Bay was
attacked and destroyed, likely by the Karankawa, in 1688. The French incursion into the region provoked
Spanish retaliation, resulting in the spread of the Spanish mission system into South Texas (Weddle 2010).
Spanish attempts to establish missions and forts to convert and pacify the native populations along the
coastal plain continued through the 1700s. These included Mission EspÃ­ritu Santo de Zuniga, established
in 1722 in near Matagorda Bay and then moved to Victoria County in 1726 (Walter 1999), Presidio La
Bahia and Mission Rosario, established in 1749 and 1754, respectively, in Goliad County (Ricklis 1999),
and Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Refugio, which was built on the mouth of the Mission River and lasted until
1828 (Newcomb 1961:63). Missions located on the San Gabriel River, near present-day Rockdale, Texas,
attracted some of the displaced Atakapan inhabitants of the Galveston Bay area.
In response to increasing French fur-trading expeditions west from the Louisiana Territory, the Spanish
established a small mission and presidio at San AgustÃ­n de Ahumada, near the village of El Orcoquisac (on
the Trinity River just north of Galveston Bay) between 1756 and 1771 (Newcomb 2004). Though the
missions continued operating throughout the Spanish Colonial period, they were often impermanent, due
to consistent antagonism between the missions and local populations, as well as often receiving poor
support from the far-removed colonial government (Ricklis 1999; Newcomb 2004; Carlson and Corbin
1999). Though the Spanish claimed the area, the Texas coastal plain would remain mostly native until the
Mexican revolution and the enticement of empresarios and colonists to the area.

Mexican Interest and Colonization
Between 1810 and 1821, Mexico, including the state of Texas and Coahuila, fought Spain for the right of
local control. Little action occurred in the sparsely-populated and poorly-integrated parts of eastern Texas.
In 1816, Louis Michel Aury, a French privateer with ambitions to raise troops to support the Mexican cause,
established a base on Galveston Island (Warren 2010). The privateer and pirate Jean Laffite, then in the
employ of Spanish intelligence services, was sent to Galveston to wrest control from Aury. He did so,
subsequently converting the settlement into a base for his own continued campaign of piracy and
smuggling, until it was pushed from the island by an American task force in 1820 (Warren 2010).
After the end of the Spanish control of Texas, Mexico attempted to create a more populated buffer state in
Texas, in an effort to protect against encroachments by the nascent United States of America. To this end,
Mexican officials invited colonization of Texas, doling out land to farmers and ranchers and deferring
payment for several years (Henderson 1928). These policies also continued the Spanish system of
empresarios, by which land agents could obtain large grants of lands, which could then be separately
divided, instead of individual families petitioning the Mexican authorities. The Mexican government
maintained control of a strip of land along the border and coast for Mexican settlement only, thus,
empresario settlement was not completed on Galveston Island, though a custom house was established on
the east end of the island in 1830. A majority of the empresarios and colonists were Anglo-American settlers
(Henderson 1928). Slavery was allowed within Mexico, until banned by President Guerrero in 1829;
however, Texas was specifically exempted (De LeÃ³n 2010). Despite this favorable treatment, suspicions of
the increasingly Anglo-American character of Texas and the increasing power and autonomy of AngloAmericans in Texas led to pushes by the Mexican central authorities under General Santa Anna to revoke
the colonization laws and promote a general trend of de-federalization of political control (De LeÃ³n 2010).
Viewing these capricious changes to law as tyranny, a number of Texans, including a several former
empresarios, convened and declared independence for the Republic of Texas on March 2, 1836 (De LeÃ³n
2010).

Texas Republic and Early Statehood
Upon defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto, April 21, 1836, General Santa Anna was returned to Velasco,
where he signed the Treaty of Velasco, freeing Texas from Mexican authority. The Constitution of the
Republic of Texas set up a government similar in character to that of the United States, with Sam Houston
elected as the first president of the Texas Republic in September of 1836 (Kreneck 2014). In the same year,
Michael B. Menard formed the Galveston City Company to promote the growth of the port (McComb
1986). Land sales began in 1838, and by the end of that year the town was comprised of more than 100
buildings; by 1839, the Texas Congress granted incorporation of the city (McComb 1986:43).
The new constitution explicitly protected slavery within the new nation, allowing the slave trade to continue
with the United States (Campbell 2013). During the first years of the Texas Republic, the general focus was
on paying the debts incurred during the revolution, along with defining and protecting the new boundaries
of the country, especially through continued settlement of the interior (Nance 2010). Even up to 1842,
Mexican incursions into southern Texas threatened the sovereignty of the new nation (Richardson 1958).
For a new, small, and relatively poor nation, protection and recognition by foreign nations was vitally
important. Annexation by the United States had always been one distinct possibility for Texas, and one that
was promoted by Sam Houston during his first term as president (Nance 2010). By the 1844 United States
presidential election, the question of Texas annexation was also on the front of the United Statesâ national
mind. The election of expansionist President James K. Polk was taken as a good sign of the desire of the
United States to include another slave state in the nation and Texas President Anson Jones pushed for
Texans to vote on the issue (Nance 2010). On October 13, 1845, annexation and the new Texas State
Constitution were accepted by overwhelming popular vote, and Texas became a part of the United States
on December 29, 1845 (Nance 2010).
The subsequent years leading up to the Civil War were generally a time of expansion and consolidation of
the primarily plantation-based farming economy, especially within the coastal plain region. Cotton
production increased over 600 percent between 1849 and 1859 (Britton et al. 2010). Galveston, as the only
deep water port in the state, was integral in shipping that produce to the factories in the rest of the world,
as well as importing many of the goods that the growing population of Texas demanded. In the years prior
to the Civil War, exports were valued at twenty times higher than imports (McComb 1986:47). Concomitant
with that explosive growth in trade, Galveston mushroomed. In just over 10 years, Galveston had already
surpassed San Antonio to become the largest city in the state, with a population of more than 4,000; she
would again take that position in the 1870s and 1880s, until eclipsed by Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio
around the turn of the twentieth century (McComb 1986:66).
Slavery also expanded at an astounding rate. Between 1850 and 1860, the overall number of slaves
increased by 130,000, expanding from 27 percent of the population to 30 percent of the population in the
years just before the Civil War (Campbell 2013). At the same time, other industries grew slowly, possibly
due to the overwhelming reliance on âKing Cotton.â Only five percent of Texans were involved in
commercial activity and only one percent involved in manufacturing (Campbell 2013). The only area of
concerted industrial development in Texas during the Antebellum period was in transportation. The Buffalo
Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway extended out of Houston in 1856, and a rail line connected Galveston
to the mainland on a bridge across the bay by 1860 (McComb 1986:50).

Civil War Era, Reconstruction, and Post-Reconstruction
Although Governor Sam Houston opposed any step that might lead Texas to break from the Union that he
had fought so hard to join, Texans voted to secede from the United States in February of 1861 (Wooster
2010). Up to 90,000 Texans served in the Confederate forces, mostly fighting outside the state boundaries.
Only the seacoast saw significant fighting during the war and most action focused on Galveston (Wooster
2010). The Confederates built several gun emplacements across the island and succeeded in defending the
island for a time, but the U.S. Navy imposed a blockade of shipping to the port, effectively draining the
lifeblood of the city in relatively short order (McComb 1986:73). By 1862, Union ships sailed into
Galveston harbor demanding surrender; Confederate troops retreated and the island was taken with little
bloodshed. The situation remained tense, as the Union barely had troops enough to hold the city, and it fell
back into Confederate hands on New Yearâs Day 1863 (McComb 1986:75). It remained so until early June
1865, when, upon learning of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, the Confederate commander of the city
surrendered as well. Federal troops would remain stationed in Galveston until 1870, though trade resumed
relatively quickly and the city began to prosper soon after the end of the war (McComb 1986:83).
Reconstruction brought massive changes to the economic and cultural systems of Texas. Many of the
former agricultural elites lost much of their wealth as a result of the abolition of slavery (Moneyhon 2010).
At the same time, former slaves, now emancipated, were provided with little support from their former
masters. Blacks flocked to Galveston looking for work, and a freedmenâs camp was established on the east
end of the island (McComb 1986:87). Segregated schools were built by the Freedmenâs Bureau before
being taken over by the City of Galveston in the early 1880s (McComb 1986:90).
Outside money and human capital allowed the Texas economy to slowly recover and expand during the
second half of the nineteenth century, and Galveston shared in this expansion. A large amount of work was
given over to expansion and maintenance of the harbor. Cotton remained central to the cityâs trade, with
Galveston as the third largest cotton port in 1878, and fifth largest in 1882 (McComb 1986:47). In the early
1870s, Galveston citizens, with help from the federal government, set a series of pilings along the margins
of the Bolivar Roads in order to increase the flow of water and scour away the sand bars that accumulated
at the mouth of the harbor. By 1874, the U.S. Army Corps Engineers sought to build two jetties out into the
gulf to encourage the same result. The project, hampered by poor engineering and lack of money,
languished until the U.S. Senate finally passed a bill funding an improved jetty system that eventually made
Galveston the largest cotton port in the country by the end of the century (McComb 1986:61).
To some extent, the late nineteenth century saw Galveston develop away from shipping and the cotton
industry. In 1881, the Galveston City Railway Company built the massive Galveston Beach Pavilion, a
dance hall and performance space featuring the first electric lights in Texas. The next year saw the
construction of the Galveston Beach Hotel on the gulf side of the island. Both structures were designed by
Nicholas Clayton, a noted architect who created a number of the Victorian structures characterizing the
wealth and influence of Galveston in its heyday, though both massive wood structures burnt down soon
after construction (McComb 1986:64). Still, the trend establishing Galveston as an entertainment
destination was well underway.
The next decade saw the founding of UTMB on the east end of the island. Galveston had been home to
several medical schools throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, including a City Hospital, St.
Maryâs Infirmary, and the Soule University Galveston Medical College (Mod et al. 2012). In 1881, the
Texas legislature voted to establish a new medical college, affiliated with the University of Texas, in
Galveston. The first class matriculated in 1891, in the newly-built John Sealy Hospital and Medical College
Building (now known as the Ashbel Smith building or âOld Redâ), both designed by Nicholas Clayton
(Mod et al. 2012). The college, which opened with only 23 students in the first class, became a significant
draw for Galveston, diversifying the islandâs offerings beyond commerce and tourism.

The Twentieth Century
At the dawn of the twentieth century, the future for Galveston was not all roses; the rising prominence of
Houston and railroad shipping threatened the economic livelihood of the city, though the deep water
extensions of the Galveston Harbor provided a possibility of salvation in the face of the threat of rail
(McComb 1986:48, 61). In 1900, the cityâs precarious position on the edge of the Gulf brought disaster,
upending the course of the cityâs development.
On September 8, 1900, a massive hurricane struck the island, bringing with it a storm tide of at least 15 feet
above normal and winds of at least 84 miles per hour (before the wind gauge broke), and likely as high as
120 miles per hour (McComb 1986:122). The storm wiped out a huge swath of buildings along the gulf
side of the island, and is known to have killed at least 4,263 identified dead, though estimates for total
deaths range as high as 10,000 to 12,000 (McComb 1986:122). The physical destruction of the city was as
great as the death-toll; at least two thirds of the cityâs buildings were destroyed, the jetties had been
breached, and a wall of debris 2 stories tall and 3 miles long had been pushed inland and left intertwined
with the wreckage of streetcar lines, ships, and innumerable houses (Wright-Gidley and Marines 2008:11).
Yet, in the face of this destruction, Galvestonâs residents were not defeated, and nearly immediately began
plans to rebuild the city, along with a method for protecting the island from another similar disaster
(McComb 1986:137). Within a year and a half of the storm, a board of engineers appointed by the City and
County of Galveston recommended a number of solutions to help prevent another catastrophe of similar
proportions. The plan consisted of constructing a concrete seawall at least 3 miles long along the seaward
side of the island, running from 39th Street down to 6th Street, then turning northwest and wrapping around
the eastern edge of the main settled portion of the island (Davis 1981). The wall would be 17 feet tall and
would be curved on the eastern face to displace the intense forces of storm waves. The wall was set on
wooden pilings driven deep below the surface and protected from undermining by rip-rap extending out
from the base of the wall towards the Gulf. Completed in July 1904, the wall eventually cost Galveston
County $1,581,673.30, about 1/5 the cost of the earlier harbor jetties constructed in the 1890s (Davis
1981:7; McComb 1986:61). Several extensions throughout the twentieth century brought the final length
to over 10 miles (McComb 1986:140).

Library of Congress, Washington DC, cited in Bixel and Turner 2000:Fig. 3.6).

A wall alone would only prevent the force of an incoming storm surge from washing away parts of the
island, but would not prevent the city from drowning, as it had during the storm. To solve this problem, the
City of Galveston adopted an ambitious plan to raise a large portion of the island, with the area behind the
seawall raised to 18 feet above sea level, and then sloping down to 8 feet above sea level on the harbor side
of the island (Davis 1981:24). To complete this project, engineers dug a 3-mile-long canal along the back
side of the seawall, the spoils from which were pumped by dredging ships into the city (Wright-Gidley and
Marines 2008). Dredges then transported dredge spoils from the harbor and ship channel into the city, where
they were pumped through pipes into areas to be filled.
During this process, many of the remaining houses on the island needed to be lifted as the grade-raising
project was completed. Over two thousand structures were elevated in anticipation of the flood of sand and
muddy water. Sewers, street-car lines, fences, and telephones poles had to be raised, as well. The project
took years to complete, but by 1911, approximately 16,300,000 cubic yards of sand (equivalent to
approximately two million dump-truck-loads or five times the volume of the Great Pyramid of Giza) had
been sluiced into the city (McComb 1986:143).
The new defenses worked relatively well. Hurricanes in 1909, 1915, 1919, 1932, 1943, 1949, 1957, 1961,
1983, 1989, and 2008 battered the wall, but the loss of life was orders of magnitude lower than the 1900
storm (Davis 1981; McComb 1986:149; Richburg et al. 2008). The downtown portion of the city was still
flooded during the 1915 storm, as the level of the bay was 27 feet above normal tide. However, the force
of the storm, though comparable to the 1900 storm, was prevented from causing significant damage within
the protected part of the city. Flooding was seen again in 1961, during Hurricane Carla, and in 2008 during
Hurricane Ike, as storm surges swamped the bay side of the island; though damaging and sometimes deadly,
these floods did not cause the wholesale devastation of the 1900 storm (Davis 1981; Richburg et al. 2008).

Even with these superlative improvements, Galveston would never recover its position as the pre-eminent
city of Texas. Even as early as the 1890s, Dallas and San Antonio were larger than Galveston, and in the
census of 1900, Houston was also larger (McComb 1986:66). While Galveston had struggled to construct
deeper and deeper harbors, Houston leaders had not sat by idly. By 1897, Congress had approved funding
for dredging the Houston Ship Channel to a depth of 25 feet, thus rivaling Galvestonâs depth (Sibley 2010).
By 1919, blue-water ships could sail directly to Houston, bypassing Galveston and signaling the ascendancy
of Houston over its older sister (Sibley 2010). The explosion of the oil industry along the Ship Channel
only added to this decline in fortunes (McComb 1986: 48).
Galveston survived the twentieth century in other ways: tourism flourished and the magnificent Galvez
Hotel opened on the seawall in 1911 (McComb 1986:171). The Hollywood Dinner Club, one of the premier
night clubs on the gulf coast, opened in 1926, and the Balinese Room bar opened (under the name Maceoâs
Grotto) in 1929 (McComb 1986). These two establishments were operated by the infamous Maceo brothers,
and became centers of gambling and illegal drinking during Prohibition. However, the high times did not
last, as a concerted effort by the government in the 1950s closed down gambling in Galveston, bringing the
boom to an end (McComb 1986:186). Tourism remained an important business, but was again surpassed
by cities like Las Vegas. The beach remained, however, and the port continued to operate, though still
overshadowed by Houston. Several cruise ships have called Galveston Harbor home, and restaurants, bars,
and hotels dot the seawall. In addition, UTMB has continued to flourish throughout the second half of the
twentieth century, becoming one of the largest employers on the island (McComb 1986:191).

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
SWCA conducted a background review of the DHCP project area. SWCA also monitored excavation areas
during the course of construction of an extensive, deeply buried utilities pipeline. In cases where
unanticipated features or artifacts were encountered, work in the area stopped immediately while an SWCA
archaeologist documented these finds. Findings were then relayed to THC and FEMA archaeologists, who
assisted in determinations of significance and the future course of action.

Background Review
The background review consisted of a search of the cultural resources and historical literature about the
project area. An SWCA archaeologist reviewed the corresponding U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5minute topographic quadrangle maps on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) online database for
any previously recorded archaeological surveys, historic structure records, or archaeological sites located
in or near the project area. Site files, sketch maps, NRHP, Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas
Historic Landmarks, Neighborhood Surveys, and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) listings were
examined. Aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology maps, Sanborn Insurance maps, historic
topographic maps, and the NRCS Web Soil Survey were also examined for historical and environmental
information related to the project area. In addition, an SWCA archaeologist visited Galveston and the Texas
History Center of the Rosenberg Library to conduct archival research on Galveston history.

Archaeological Monitoring
SWCA conducted archaeological monitoring during excavation associated with the construction of the
DHCP. The project, consisting of the installation of a number of large water pipes, was built utilizing a
number of different methods, but is generally divided between open cut and boring excavations.
The first steps in both the open cut and the boring excavations were the same. First, construction crews
broke the asphalt or concrete overlaying the excavation locations, usually with a backhoe mounted
jackhammer, but at times employing concrete saws or handheld jackhammers. A backhoe was then used to
remove the broken asphalt and concrete, which was taken away. Excavators took care not to disturb the soil
during this operation, as unmarked utilities were potentially present.
Next, the construction crews prepared the area for the installation of shoring. This process was called predig, and involved carefully excavating around the entire area to be shored, in order to identify the exact
location of known utilities and obstructions, and to search for unmarked utilities. Crews usually utilized a
small backhoe equipped with a 1.5- to 2-foot-wide bucket to excavate down to approximately 6 to 8 feet
below the surface. Depths varied based on the depth of the water table, the potential for buried utilities, the
structural stability of the surrounding soil, and the capabilities of the construction crew excavator. The
trench was not always of a uniform depth; exploratory excavations usually extended deeper at the intended
shoring locations. In some cases, crews utilized a different method, called hydro-excavation, to conduct
pre-dig. In hydro-excavation, crews used high pressure water and a large vacuum to remove the water and
soil slurry, exposing utilities without damaging them.
After completing pre-dig, a vibratory pile driver was used to place 20- to 30-foot-long steel I-beams into
the ground at regular intervals. These pilings would support the wood and steel plate shoring while the pit
was open. From this point, the methods for excavation diverged.

In the open cut excavations, a series of de-watering wells were drilled into place at intervals around the
excavation area. Once the ground was dry enough to excavate, construction crews used a large trackhoe
with a 5- to 6-foot-wide bucket to remove large quantities of soil at a time. Crews followed this excavation,
clearing out the spaces between the I-beam piers by hand and placing wooden beams and steel sheet plate
within the beams to shore the pit. Excavation beneath existing utilities and within tight spaces was
conducted by hand. Open cut excavations were shallow, terminating at 11 to 13 feet below the surface, and
were thus easier to monitor from the surface. Open cut excavation was utilized on 12th Street between
Strand and Mechanic Streets, on Mechanic Street between 12th and 11th Streets, and at the intersection of
6th Street and Market Street, where the pipelines crossed the 1904 Galveston Seawall. The same
methodology was utilized at the East Plant excavation area.
The boring operation was a more complicated process. The boring operation utilized a series of small bore
pits along the full pipeline route. Pits were usually around 400 square feet in size, and extended to 22 feet
below the surface. A total of 10 pits were located between the east end of Mechanic Street and the location
where the pipeline would cross the 1904 Galveston Seawall at the corner of 6th Street and Market Street.
A boring machine was then utilized to push a pipe casing from one pit to the next. As the boring operation
was conducted much deeper than the open cut operation, normal de-watering wells could not be utilized.
Instead, after placing the I-beam piers, a second construction crew used a process called jet-grouting to
create a water-tight casing around the area to be excavated. This crew drilled down to approximately 28
feet below the surface and then injected cement slurry horizontally into the ground at high pressure. This
process created subterranean concrete columns approximately 4 to 5 feet in diameter around the outside of
the excavation area. Through this process, the crew was also able to create floors by terminating the columns
after only 6 feet. However, this meant that the entire area around the margin of the pit, as well as parts of
the interior of the pits, were disturbed prior to excavation.
Once the concrete cured, a large excavator with a 5- to 6-foot bucket was used to excavate the majority of
the soil. Construction crews followed this excavation, cleaning out the spaces between the I-beams by hand
or with jackhammers. Once the walls had been shored, the boring crew could lower their equipment into
the pit and begin tunneling from one pit to the next. The excavation of the bore pit was monitored from the
surface, although as the depth increased, visibility decreased. No monitoring of tunneling operations was
required by the MOA or conducted.
For all excavation techniques, the methodology was the same when construction crews encountered
unanticipated artifacts or archaeological features. In that case, work was immediately halted in the area of
the find while an archaeologist documented the find to assess its significance.
Maps of excavation areas were provided by UTMB and these were utilized to create sketch maps of all
artifacts and features identified in-situ during excavations. Features and artifacts were photographed from
the surface, and, if shallow, could be measured and mapped directly by archaeologists. Deep artifacts and
features were not directly accessible due to safety restrictions concerning open and unshored excavations.
In these cases, when available, measurements were provided by construction crew members. Cardinal
orientations throughout this report are recorded according to the Galveston street grid; north is 17 degrees
west of true north (343 degrees), unless otherwise noted.
As SWCA conducted non-collection monitoring, artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the
field, but not collected. Data was communicated to THC and FEMA archaeologists, who helped assess the
significance of the findings and determine a course of action for future work in each area.

Additionally, in accordance with the MOA, a special recordation program was completed for the findings
associated with the 1904 Galveston Seawall, identified within an open cut excavation at the intersection of
6th and Market Streets. The fill to the east and west of the seawall was investigated and the portion to be
demolished was fully cleaned prior to demolition, allowing photographs and drawings to be made to
identify any structural features within the seawall, completing the requirements of the MOA.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS OF BACKGROUND REVIEW
Background research into the project area revealed that archaeological and historical research have been
conducted in or near the survey area for at least 25 years, though a large body of this work is poorly
documented. Additionally, a few cultural resources have been identified within 0.5 mile of the project area.

Previous Investigations
At least five previous archaeological projects or studies have been conducted within 1 mile of the DHCP
project area, though only two previous archaeological investigations are recorded on TASA. The first was
conducted in 1976 and covers a one-block area southeast of the corner of 12th Street and Avenue M-Â½,
0.65 mile south of the project area. The second was conducted in 1978 and covers an area of at least 14 city
blocks in downtown Galveston, 0.57 mile west of the project area. Neither of the two projects recorded on
TASA has significant information recorded as to the type, extent, content, or character of investigations
which occurred in their respective locations.
In 1991, Prewitt and Associates conducted a background literature review and historic structure survey of
the Fort San Jacinto/Fort Point site (41GV119), 0.36 mile east of the project area (Freeman and Hannum
1991). The survey used historical documents to identify the locations and history of the military resources
on the east end of Galveston Island, including a number of still extant WWI and WWII era fortifications.
Their research did not include archaeological testing of the identified resources.
At least two projects in Galveston have consisted of archaeological monitoring of streetscape construction.
Between 1984 and 1999, Moore Archaeological Consulting conducted test excavations and construction
monitoring for the Galveston Trolley system. This work documented the different historical fill events that
form parts of the Galveston streetscape, including some historic features, but did not identify any properties
eligible for the NRHP (Moore 1985, 1999). Another project was conducted on 25th Street as it runs through
downtown Galveston. This project, conducted by the Center for Archaeological Research at the University
of Texas at San Antonio, identified historic artifacts and street features, including wood and brick pavers,
but found none to be significant (Meissner 2000:7).

Previously Identified Resources
Archaeological background review identified 5 archaeological sites, 26 historical markers, 55 historic
structures, 3 shipwrecks, 4 NRHP-listed places (2 of which are also recorded as SALs), and 1 NRHP District
located within 0.5 mile of the DHCP project area. All pertain to the historic period occupation of the island.
As the number of historic structures and markers is high, only those located within 0.1 mile of the DHCP
project area are discussed in detail.

Archaeological Sites
Archaeological and historical surveys have recorded five archaeological sites within 0.5 mile of the project
area. All are recorded as historic sites; no prehistoric sites have been recorded anywhere on the eastern end
of Galveston Island. In some cases, historic structures have been recorded as archaeological sites, even if
no excavation has been conducted at the site. This may be a distinction without a difference; after 200 years
of near continuous occupation, most of the east end of Galveston Island is likely to harbor historic era refuse
of some kind.

Prehistoric remains have not been recorded within the main urban area of Galveston, but have been found
in surrounding areas of Galveston Island and Galveston Bay. It is possible that the nearly 200 years of
historic occupation have erased most traces of prehistoric life within the city. The closest prehistoric sites
have been located on Bolivar Peninsula to the north (41GV132), more than 6 miles from the project area,
and at the base of the Galveston Causeway (41GV133), less than 6 miles to the west; both sites are shell
middens on the bay side of the barrier islands (TASA 2014). The best excavated prehistoric site on
Galveston Island is the Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66), located 11 miles southwest, on Eckert Bayou. There,
excavations between 1974 and 1992 uncovered a large campsite with a number of discrete cemeteries dating
between A.D. 100 and 1700 (Ricklis 1994).
Site 41GV45. Located at 1402 Broadway, site 41GV45 has also been recorded as the Bishopâs Palace or
the Gresham House. The site has been listed in the NRHP (#70000746). A search of report abstracts in
TASA does not return any record of archaeological work conducted at the site (TASA 2014).
Site 41GV94. Located at the corner of 15th Street and Post Office Avenue, 41GV94 is the location of the
former Cordray Drugstore, which, according to a historical marker for the location, was built in 1918. The
Galveston Archaeological Society conducted test unit excavation on the site in 1986, encountering ceramics
and glass. The building, which sat approximately 0.26 mile southwest of the project area, was razed some
time earlier. According to a historical marker for the site, a slave market was once located nearby (TASA
2014).
Site 41GV98. Located at the corner of 15th Street and Church Avenue, 41GV98 is the former location of
the Darragh House, a Greek revival structure dating to 1886. The Galveston Archaeological Society and
Houston Archaeological Society conducted some excavation on the site in 1987. The structure is no longer
extant, and a park now sits at its location (TASA 2014).
Site 41GV119. Located on the east end of Galveston Island between Seawall Boulevard and Highway 168
on the Fort San Jacinto Military Reservation, 41GV119 is the location of a number of forts between 1816
and 1959 (Freeman and Hannum 1991). A number of WWI and WWII era fortifications are still extant on
the far eastern end of the area, closest to the Bolivar Roads, though earlier fortifications were located on
earlier coastlines and high areas of land on western parts of the reservation (Freeman and Hannum
1991:101).
Site 41GV140. Located at 1417 Harborside Drive (Avenue A), this location has been identified as the
location of the home of the pirate, Jean Lafitte. A Texas Historical Marker is also located near this site and
describes the location as that of Lafitteâs âMaison Rouge,â his base for operations between 1817 and 1820.
A set of arched concrete foundations now standing on the site belong to an 1885 structure built by J. W.
Hendricks (Widmer and Sullivan 1984). Excavations at the site encountered buried horizons and earlynineteenth century artifacts that may have pertained to either Lafitteâs, Louis Michel Auryâs, Mexican, or
early Texan occupation at Galveston Island (Widmer and Sullivan 1984:18).

Texas Historical Markers and Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks
A total of 26 Texas Historical Markers are located within 0.5 mile of the project area. In general, these mark
historic homes within the East End neighborhood, but also identify churches, convents, businesses, and
historic personages important to the area. Four markers are located within 0.1 mile of the project area.
St. Maryâs Hospital. A plaque at 404 8th Street marks the location of St. Maryâs Hospital, the first private
hospital organized in the state of Texas. Founded in 1866 by three French Catholic nuns, the hospital played
a vital role in caring for the wounded during the 1900 Galveston hurricane and the 1947 Texas City disaster
(TASA 2014).

Henry Rosenberg House. A marker at 1306 Market Street marks the location of the Henry Rosenberg
House. Built in 1859 for the prominent businessman and philanthropist, Henry Rosenberg, the structure
features a plaster over brick exterior, eight marble fireplaces, and rosewood interiors. The structure was
made a Recorded Texas Historical Landmark in 1962 (TASA 2014).
Galveston Medical College. The marker located at 900 Strand Street commemorates the Galveston
Medical College, the first medical school in Texas (TASA 2014). Opened in 1865, the school was affiliated
with the Methodist Soule University at Chappell Hill, Texas. By 1873, with a total enrollment of 46
students, the school reformed as the Texas Medical College and Hospital under Dr. Ashbel Smith. In 1891,
the school became part of the University of Texas system as the University of Texas Medical Branch.
Ashbel Smith Building. Another marker is located at the same location as the Galveston Medical College
plaque, and recognizes the Ashbel Smith Building, also known as âOld Red.â Designed by Galveston
architect Nicholas Clayton, the brick Romanesque Revival structure was the only building on the UTMB
campus when it first opened. Constructed in 1891, it was renamed for Dr. Ashbel Smith in 1949. The Ashbel
Smith Building is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark and is also listed in the NRHP.

Historic Structures (Neighborhood Survey Points)
Surveys of historic structures in the area within 0.5 mile of the project area have identified a number of
historic standing structures. These are recorded in TASA as Neighborhood Survey Points. A total of 55
Neighborhood Survey Points are located in the vicinity of the project. Six of these are located within 0.1
mile of the project area (Table 1) (TASA 2014).

Ashbel Smith Building (NRHP #69000203). Also known as âOld Red,â this building is a three-story,
brick, Romanesque-Revival structure associated with the earliest incarnations of UTMB and is located at
916 Strand Street. Noted Galveston architect Nicholas Clayton designed the structure after touring medical
facilities across the United States, and the construction was completed in 1891 (Bell and Kennedy 1969).
The structure was listed in the NRHP in 1969, with national significance in science and architecture, and
designated as a SAL in 1981.
Galveston Seawall (NRHP #77001443). This structure is a concrete and steel seawall located on the Gulf
side of Galveston Island (Hutchison 1977). The structure, which originally wrapped around the east end of
the island, near modern day 6th Street, was over 3 miles long, though extensions and augmentations in the
first quarter of the twentieth century have added another approximately 7 miles to its length. Designed and
built between 1902 and 1904, after the terrible devastation of the 1900 Galveston hurricane, the 17-foottall wall serves to protect the city from another storm by dissipating the force of waves and storm surges.
The Galveston Seawall was listed in the NRHP in 1977, for national significance in community planning,
conservation, engineering, and politics/government. In addition, it was designated as a SAL in 1981.
Bishopâs Palace (NRHP #70000746). Also known as the Gresham House and site 41GV45, this is a three
story, rusticated stone mansion located at 1402 Broadway and represents âthe exuberance of the eclectic
late-Victorian taste in Americaâ (Texas State Historical Survey 1970). Designed by noted Galveston
architect Nicholas Clayton, the structure features numerous towers, bays, balconies, veranda, and soaring
chimneys. Built between 1887 and 1893, the home was owned by Walter Gresham, a prominent lawyer and
national legislator. In the 1920s, the house was sold to the Galveston-Houston Diocese of the Catholic
Church and served as parsonage for at least two bishops before it was opened as a museum in the 1960s.
The building was listed in the NRHP in 1970, with national significance in architecture, politics, and
religion.
McKinney-McDonald House (NRHP #76002030). This building is located at 926 Winnie Street and is a
two-story Victorian house built circa 1889, for Liberty McKinney, a wholesale grocer (Landon and
Williams 1975). The structure, which features an off-set gallery, molded and carved friezes in the bays, a
widowâs walk, and an elaborately molded and decorated brick chimney, survived the 1900 Galveston
Hurricane and subsequent grade raising intact. The structure is listed in the NRHP for local significance in
architecture.
East End Historic District (NRHP # 75001979). This district skirts the south side of the project area and
includes the north side of Market Street west of 14th Street and the north side of Post Office Street to 11th
Street (Pitts 1976). The district, which is generally residential in character, contains structures pertaining to
many different architectural periods in the history of Galveston, including Greek Revival (1840-1870),
Victorian (1870-1900), and early twentieth century styles (1900-1910). The architecture of Nicolas Clayton
is well represented, and a number of houses pertaining to prominent local and national leaders are present
in the district, including houses of congressmen, mayors, shipping magnates, and businessmen. The East
End Historic District was listed in the NRHP in 1976, within national significance in architecture and
outstanding community leaders.

CHAPTER 6: RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
SWCA conducted archaeological monitoring of all excavation activities associated with the UTMB DHCP
between April 4, 2013, and February 14, 2014. During this time, construction crews completed some
excavation on a majority of 12th Street, portions of Mechanic Street, the Bridge A Open Cut, and Bore Pits
1 through 13. After that time, changes in the monitoring plan determined that daily monitoring of
construction was not necessary and that monitoring was only required for certain, limited ground disturbing
activities. Monitoring resumed between April 7 and May 8, 2014, in the East Plant excavation area. SWCA
archaeologists were on-site of the DHCP sporadically from July 9 through October 17, 2014, as construction
crews completed the 6th Street Open Cut and demolition of a portion of the 1904 Galveston Seawall.
Archaeological monitoring identified a number of intact archaeological features and historic artifacts. These
finds are described in detail below, within their respective excavation areas. The majority of these finds
were related to streetscape architecture from the late nineteenth century. Other historic deposits included
domestic middens, generalized trash middens, and a few posts. In addition, excavations near 6th Street
encountered remains of the 1904 Galveston Seawall and evidence of the 19031911 grade raising. Apart
from this, no evidence of nineteenth-century structures was encountered. Areas within the Bridge A and
East Plan open cut excavations contained evidence for early-to-mid-twentieth-century structures in the form
of concrete foundation blocks. No prehistoric artifacts or features were recognized during excavation.

12th Street Open Cut
The open cut excavations on 12th Street were located between the south side of the intersection of 12th and
Strand Streets and the center of the intersection of 12th and Mechanic Streets, before turning east and
entering Mechanic Street on the north side of the street (Figure 4). All features found within the intersection
of 12th and Mechanic Streets are described in this section. The main body of the 12th Street Open Cut ran
north-south for approximately 282 feet and 23 feet wide, with the west side of the excavation adjacent to
the modern 12th Street curb (Figure 3). A small excavation area was extended west of the intersection at
Mechanic Street, covering an area 14 feet north-south by 7 feet east-west. These main excavation areas
extended to 12 feet below the surface. A temporary 4-foot-wide by 4-foot-deep waterline trench began at
the southwest corner of the intersection of 12th and Mechanic Streets and ran east, approximately 377 feet,
to the intersection of 11th and Mechanic Streets.

Figure 3. Main excavation area of 12th Street Open Cut during shoring construction,
facing northeast.

The main excavations on the 12th Street Open Cut were monitored between April 4 and June 5, 2013,
though pre-dig excavation had begun along the western side of the excavation block prior to the start of
monitoring. In addition to the main excavation areas, several auxiliary excavations were conducted during
emergency situations.
On April 4, 2013, excavations of approximately 2 x 2 feet and 2 feet deep were placed 13 feet east of the
excavation block in line with the 8-inch water line. On April 18, 2013, two small, posthole-sized
excavations were hand-excavated by construction crews southwest of the main block excavation on the
corner of 12th and Mechanic Streets.

After a sewer line was broken, excavations on April 22â23, 2013, expanded a circular area 5 to 7 feet in
diameter and 4 to 5 feet deep around a manhole just north of the northeast corner of the main excavation
block. A second 7- to 8-foot-diameter circular excavation was also opened adjacent to the location where
the sewer line entered the block from the south. On May 20, 2013, crews completed several small
excavations using hydro-excavation to look for buried utilities north of Strand Street.
After the main excavation of the pit was completed on June 5, 2013, construction crews conducted
excavation on a tunnel running beneath Strand Street. These excavations could not be directly monitored
and construction crews did not report any cultural resources identified below Strand Street.
On August 29, 2013, after a water main break caused by tunnel excavation underneath Strand Street, City
of Galveston crews excavated and cleaned a large area, measuring 29.5 feet north-south by 11.5 feet eastwest, north of the main excavation. As this excavation was not directly part of the DHCP and was conducted
on an emergency basis by the City of Galveston, SWCA archaeologists did not monitor it closely, but
cursory examinations of the area showed it was heavily impacted by utility construction.
A second sewer leak on October 28, 2013, required construction crews to re-excavate the manhole north of
the main excavation block where they had excavated during the first sewer leak, as well as expand the
trench approximately 23 feet to the north. As this excavation was also not directly part of the DHCP and
was conducted on an emergency basis by the City of Galveston, SWCA archaeologists did not monitor it
closely, but cursory examinations of the area showed it was heavily impacted by utility construction.

Soils at the 12th Street Open Cut were similar to those encountered at other excavation areas. Stratum 1
consisted of approximately between 1.5 and 4 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy
lamina (Figure 5). Stratum 1 thickened towards the center of 12th Street and towards the intersection of
Mechanic Street. Stratum 1 was likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during
the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 1 foot of
gray (10YR 6/1) sand. The color and texture of this sand appears to conform much more closely to the
native Mustang soils found elsewhere on Galveston Island, suggesting that this may be buried ground
surface (NRCS 2014). Below this, sands varied from dark gray (10YR 4/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3)
to white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist.

Figure 5. Soil Profile on 12th Street, facing southeast.

A number of modern disturbances were recorded on 12th Street. A concrete duct bank, measuring 11 feet
5 inches wide and 2.5 to 3 feet deep, crossed the main excavation area 17.5 feet from the north profile. A
sewer line ran along the eastern side of the main excavation area, crossing into the block 49 feet from the
north end of the block and 3 to 5 feet below the surface. A second sewer line crossed the main excavation
block approximately 112 feet from the north profile and at the same depth. An 8-inch water line crosses the
block 6.5 feet south of the sewer line. This line is located near the historic location of similar water lines,
so this may be a historic feature (Sanborn Map Company [Sanborn] 1912).

At the south end of the block, a gas line was encountered at 5 feet 6 inches below the surface. The line then
surfaced by 1 foot and ran east across the block. Another gas line ran north-south along the east side of the
intersection between 12th Street and Mechanic Street, and another water line ran 3 feet west of that. Finally,
on the south side of the excavation block, crews encountered a concrete cistern measuring 4 feet wide and
extending into the excavation block 2 feet. This cistern is associated with a storm sewer manhole located
south of the excavation block.
Excavations at the 12th Street Open Cut encountered a number of streetscape features, including evidence
for earlier paving systems on the street. A small excavation area on top of an existing 8-inch waterline, 13
feet of the main excavation block revealed evidence of a few bricks, which, though limited in scope,
appeared in situ below Stratum 1. Loose bricks were sometimes found within Stratum 2, but were otherwise
not identified in place. These may be the remains of brick street surfacing, which is common at other
locations in Galveston (Meissner 2000; Moore 1999; McComb 1986:104).

Pit Feature 1
Along the eastern side of the excavation area, pre-dig excavation pits from the 8-inch waterline to
approximately 43 feet north uncovered a few blocks of cypress wood covered in creosote. At 36 feet north
of the water line, these developed into a dense, 1- to 2-foot-deep pit (Pit Feature 1), measuring 3 to 4 feet
in diameter, buried beneath Stratum 1 (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Evidence of street surfacing on 12th Street. Left, Pit Feature 1 with creosote and wood block
paving, facing east; Right, bricks in profile of a waterline access trench, facing west.

These blocks appear to be a type of paving that was popular in Galveston from the early 1870s until the
turn of the century (McComb 1986:104; Moore 1999:37). The pit-like feature, however, does not appear to
be in situ, drawing to mind the destruction of the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, when whole sections of the
buoyant roadway floated away like âa carpet of corksâ on the storm surge (McComb 1986:124).

Plank Feature 1
Another streetscape feature was identified during pre-dig operations along the western side of the
excavation area. A series of wood planks (identified as Plank Feature 1) had been found adjacent to the
modern curb. The base of the planking was composed of three planks, laid on their faces, each
approximately 11 inches wide and set 2 feet 3 inches below the modern street surface (and 8 inches below
the base of Stratum 1) (Figure 7). These planks were 1 to 2 inches thick and at least 10 to 11 feet long. Each
was affixed with a single square spike every 6 feet to a 6 x 3.5 x 42-inch beam, laid perpendicular to the
planks. Along the margins of the planks, a second set of planking, 6 inches tall by 1 inch thick, was turned
on edge, forming a lip or curb to the lower planks.

Figure 7. Plank trough (Plank Feature 1) on west side of 12th Street. Left, main body of the trench, facing
west; Right, âstepâ after trough narrows, facing south.

The planks were first documented by construction crews at the north end of the open cut excavation, but
archaeologists were not initially alerted. Once SWCA monitors were on-site, sections of the feature were
documented for the last 108 feet along the western side of the excavation area.
At first, it was assumed that these planks composed a portion of the extensive wood sidewalks which dotted
the city during 1903â1911 grade raising (Wright-Gidley and Marines 2008); however, these features do not
appear to conform to any type of sidewalk. At approximately 16.5 feet north of the intersection of 12th and
Mechanic Streets, the eastern sidewall abruptly âsteppedâ inward, narrowing the open base to only 2.5 feet
wide. At the same point, the sidewall also abruptly increased in height to 2.5 feet from the plank base.
Moving south, a second level of base planking was located at the intersection of 12th and Mechanic Streets.
The second level stepped up 6 inches from the earlier level, and a new set of sidewalls, also 6 inches tall,
was located above this second level. The planks on this second step, while still laid on their face, were set
perpendicular to the lower level and were each only 3 feet long. At the same time, the ground level increased
in height and both Strata 1 and 2 thickened, such that the lower planking at this point was 4.5 feet below
the surface.
If Plank Feature 1 had actually been sidewalks or boardwalks, portions of them would be simply too narrow
to function well. With a sidewall stretching above an adultâs knees and only 2.5 feet of floor space, that
section of a sidewalk would be extremely restricting. Second, the tan, laminated sands of Stratum 1 have
been interpreted as representing the fill event associated with the 1903â1911 grade raising, yet the plank
features are buried below that fill, as well as below soils of Stratum 2. This suggests that they were buried
before the historical fill event and could not have been used to traverse the area as it was being filled.

The presence of the feature below the original soil level is also problematic. Most of the historic streetscape
features appear to be capped by a small amount of grey sand (see Mechanic Street shell roadbed); however,
the layer of sand over the surface of Plank Feature 1 is much thicker. This may suggest that it was lower
than other parts of the road surface during this earlier deposition event. Such a location would not be
conducive to its use as a sidewalk, as any feature there might collect water and mud. Instead, it appears that
these features represent a type of constructed drain or conduit. While poorly documented, wood-lined drains
were likely present across much of the island prior to the construction of belowground sewer systems in the
late nineteenth century (McComb 1986:100).

Plank Feature 2
In the east side of the pre-dig trench, crews encountered another wooden feature, Plank Feature 2, which
also appears to be part of a drainage network (Figure 8). The feature, located 2 feet below the surface,
appeared to be a wooden conduit measuring 1 foot 10 inches by 1 foot 5 inches, constructed with 2-inchthick planks. The western edge of the feature protruded over Plank Feature 1 in the area where the sidewalls
of Plank Feature 1 stepped up to 2.5 feet tall.

Streets. Left, west end of the conduit at intersection with Plank Feature 1, facing east; Right, upper
surface of the conduit within the main excavation block, facing east.

Subsequent excavations towards the east encountered the full extent of the feature as it crossed the entire
width of 12th Street. The interface of this feature with another plank feature on the east side of 12th Street
(see Mechanic Street Plank Feature 3) was not observed, as it was below an as-yet-unremoved concrete
drain. It appears that this structure represents a portion of a second style of drain allowing water to move
between opposite sides of the street, perhaps in overflow situations. Similar constructions have been
documented elsewhere on the island, and were described as relatively common (Moore 1999:58).

Plank Feature 3
Along the south side of the 12th Street Open Cut, after the excavation had turned the corner and began
moving east-west, excavation encountered two deeply-buried sections of planking in the south profile of
the pre-dig trenches. Identified as Plank Feature 3 (Figure 9), these sections of planking were too deep to
directly measure safely, as both were located between 5 and 6 feet below the surface. The western section
of planking consisted of three planks, one on top of the other, forming a wall running north-south, 3 feet
east of the modern concrete cistern. The second section of planking was just visible in the south profile of
the excavation, but was not disturbed by the current excavation. The 1889 Sanborn map of the area shows
an approximately 10-foot-diameter well located 6 feet south of the south side of the excavations (Sanborn
1889). These deeply buried planks may be a part of that early well. The well does not appear on the 1899
Sanborn map of the area, suggesting it was filled during the interim.

12th Street Artifacts
Historic artifacts were recovered sporadically from Strata 1 and 2 through the 12th Street Open Cut (Figure
10). None of the artifacts were recovered in situ, so exact details of the artifact distribution were
unobtainable. Artifacts encountered within the 12th Street Open Cut included glass electrical insulators,
mold-blown glass bottles, ironstone ceramics, portions of a stoneware bottle, bone, brick, and wood
fragments. All identifiable artifacts date between the mid- to late-nineteenth century and the early twentieth
century.

Mechanic Street Open Cut
The open cut excavations for Mechanic Street were located from the east side of the intersection of 12th
Street and extended to the west side of the intersection with 11th Street (Figure 12). The main body of the
open cut measured 334 feet east-west by 13 feet north-south, with the north side of the trench adjacent to
the modern curb of Mechanic Street. In addition, construction crews excavated a trench, 3 to 4 feet wide
and 3 to 4 feet deep, to house a temporary water pipe running generally along the south side of Mechanic
Street, but angled to cut around the north side of Bore Pit 1.
Excavation at the Mechanic Street Open Cut was monitored between April 5 and 26, 2013, and from
December 4, 2013 through February 13, 2014. Excavation continued after this point, but SWCA
archaeologists were not present due to changes in the monitoring plan after mid-February 2014. The first
monitoring period followed the jet-grout crew as they tested their equipment. These early tests entailed
drilling a number of columns throughout the area and then pumping the grout spoils out across the block.
This resulted in varying levels of disturbance to the first 2 to 3 feet of soil in the western half of Mechanic
Street (Figure 11). After the test columns were completed, the area around the columns was excavated down
to 22 feet below the surface to observe the results.

Figure 11. Removing grout spoils on Mechanic Street Open Cut, facing west.

During the second period of monitoring, construction crews began by relocating a buried waterline which
ran along the north side of the street. This task also encompassed the excavation of a large area (15 x 15
feet) north of Bore Pit 1 that had been previously excavated to approximately 5 feet and filled with stabilized
sand (a dry sand and concrete mixture). A temporary waterline trench was then excavated along the south
side of Mechanic Street and the intersection of Mechanic and 12th Streets. Pre-dig excavations were
conducted along the north side of the street, adjacent to the modern curb, for placing de-watering well
points.

Construction crews then conducted pre-dig excavations along the south side of the intended Mechanic
Street Open Cut. One pier pit, 98 feet east of the intersection of 12th and Mechanic Streets, was excavated
down to 13 feet below surface to test the extent of dewatering in the area. After completing half of the south
side pre-dig operation, construction crews began removing the original water line and a gas line on February
13, 2014, the last day of monitored excavations. Only the south side pre-dig was conducted prior to the end
of archaeological monitoring.
Soils at the Mechanic Street Open Cut were similar to those encountered at the other excavations. Stratum
1 consisted of approximately between 1.5 to 2.5 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2)
sandy lamina (Figure 13). Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island
during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 1
foot of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. The color and texture of this sand appears to conform much more closely to
the native Mustang soils found elsewhere on Galveston Island, suggesting that this may be buried ground
surface (NRCS 2014). Within Stratum 2, excavation sometimes encountered a 4- to 6-inch-thick layer of
crushed shell. This shell layer was not uniform; it was identified approximately 10 feet south of the modern
day Mechanic Street curb, and did not appear to run into 12th Street. In addition, it often had a thin
(approximately 0.5 inch) layer of gray (10YR 6/1) sand above it. Below Stratum 2, Stratum 3 consisted of
approximately 1 foot of dark gray (10YR 4/1) sand. Deeper sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish
brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist.

As noted above, streetscaping was identified during Mechanic Street excavations in the form of a thick
layer of shell, though this did not extend across the entirety of the street. Shell paving, along with wood
block paving, was a common occurrence on Galveston streets in the late 1800s, though shell was less
effective than the wood (McComb 1986:104). In addition, a number of plank features were recorded within
the Mechanic Street excavations.

Plank Features 1 and 2
Single wood planks were identified along the north and south margins of Mechanic Street, adjacent to the
modern curb (Figure 14). These planks, measuring 4 to 6 inches wide and 1 inch thick, had been placed on
edge. These were identified in pre-dig excavations for both the jet-grout and de-watering wells (Plank
Feature 1), as well as in the west end of the new waterline trench (Plank Feature 2).

Figure 14. Planks on Mechanic Street. Left, Plank Feature 1, a single plank adjacent to the north curb of
Mechanic Street, facing north; Right, Plank Feature 2, a single plank north of the south curb of Mechanic
Street, facing south.

Plank Feature 1 ran east-west 2.5 feet from the northern modern curb of Mechanic Street at approximately
1 foot below the original street surface. Plank Feature 2 was identified only in the profile of the temporary
waterline trench, and ran for 8 feet, east-west, 2.8 feet north of the southern modern day curb of Mechanic
Street and 2 feet below the modern surface of the curb.
As in locations on Market Street, these features appear to be simple curbs or property markers, delimiting
the roadway from the lots and possibly maintaining shallow ditches along the road margins. These simple
curbs were integrated into the more substantial system represented by the wood-lined drainage ditches (see
Mechanic Street Plank Feature 3, 12th Street Plank Feature 1, and Bore Pit 2 Plank Feature 2).

Plank Feature 3
The only other historic feature identified on Mechanic Street was a second set of planking (Plank Feature
3), which appears to correspond to a wooden trench on 12th Street (12th Street Plank Feature 1). Plank
Feature 3 (Figure 15), which was identified during excavation of the replacement waterline trench and the
old waterline removal trench, was only partially exposed in the area east of a modern concrete conduit
which crosses the intersection at the east side of the intersection of 12th and Mechanic Streets. The 46-inchwide portion of the feature uncovered in the replacement waterline trench was fully removed, but the section
within the waterline removal trench was only exposed, so the underlying construction was not directly
investigated.
The southern section of Plank Feature 3, within the replacement waterline trench, consisted of a trough, 28
inches wide with 10-inch-high sidewalls, the upper surface of which was 21 inches below the surface. At
the north side of the replacement waterline trench, an upper surface of the plank feature, creating a conduit,
was identified, but was not investigated past the edge of the trench. A second set of sidewalls was not
present above the first set. The base of the feature was comprised of three layers of planks measuring 28 to
30 inches long, each 1 inch thick, each laid parallel to Mechanic Street, and each laid directly on top of the
last layer. These were not attached to any supports, and could be simply pulled out by hand.

Within the original waterline trench excavation, the northern section of wood planking adjacent to the north
curb appeared to have been previously disturbed, as only the base wood planks (running parallel to
Mechanic Street) were present. An intact section was located 31 inches below the street surface and
measured at least 25 inches wide (the western portion was buried beneath the modern concrete conduit).
For this section, the sidewalls measured only 8 inches, but varied in height. As the center of the modern
roadway is approximately 6 inches higher than the curb, it appears that this base of this second section is at
approximately the same depth as the base of the first exposed portion. Thus, there was no evidence to
suggest that the upper plank surface suggested in the north profile of the waterline replacement trench
extended across the entire feature. It may have been present and removed; a 12-inch-wide by 1-inch-deep
notch was carved in the upper edge of the sidewall, possibly suggesting another plank once fit in that spot
but had been removed. The two exposed sections of Plank Feature 3 correspond well to the plank troughs
and conduits observed at other locations in the project area (see 12th Street Plank Feature 1, Bore Pit 1
Plank Feature 1, and Bore Pit 2 Plank Feature 2).

Bridge A Open Cut
The open cut excavations for Bridge A were located on the northwest corner of 11th Street and Strand Street
(Avenue B) (Figure 16). The excavation area, which was irregularly shaped, started in the corner formed
by Building 17 and Building 20, ran east towards 11th Street for 180 feet, and then turned south, paralleling
11th Street for 82 feet. The trench ranged from approximately 11 to 21 feet wide. Three additional 15 x 15foot excavation areas were located on the opposite side of 11th Street. One was located 44 feet north of the
corner of 11th and Strand Streets, and the other two were located on either side of Strand Street, 33 feet
east of the intersection with 11th Street.
Excavation for Bridge A was conducted between September 24 and October 18, 2014. No pre-dig or dewatering operation was conducted, and no shoring was placed in the trench. Instead, construction crews
sloped and benched the trench, where necessary. The portion of the trench west of 11th Street was excavated
using a trackhoe, and the pier locations on the east side of 11th Street were hydro-excavated. The area south
of the main open trench was previously disturbed by the demolition of Building 18; SWCA did not monitor
demolition or excavation there, as it was not associated with the DHCP.
Excavations at the open cut excavation at Bridge A were not deep, only extending approximately 4 to 6 feet
below the surface. After completing excavations, the open area was immediately backfilled with stabilized
sand. Soils at Bridge A were slightly different from the strata encountered at the other excavations (Figure
17). Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 2.5 feet of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand. Stratum 2, consisted of
approximately 1 foot of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sand mixed with large quantities of shell, broken asphalt,
and some brick fragments. Stratum 3 contained approximately 1 foot of pinkish gray to brown (7.5YR 6/2
to 7.5YR 4/4) sandy lamina. Stratum 3 appears to correspond to the first stratum encountered at the 12th
and Mechanic Streets open cuts and on the Market Street bore pits. This stratum is likely the remains of the
historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981).
Below this, excavation encountered very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) sandy loam to the base of excavation. Along
the eastern side of the block, closer to 11th Street, Strata 1 through 3 were thin, with Stratum 4 identified
at approximately 1 foot below surface.

Figure 17. Soil Profile of the Bridge A Open Cut, facing east.

As noted, portions of the excavation area had been previously disturbed by both construction and demolition
of earlier structures. The north side of the excavation area abutted the foundations of Building 17, and
modern construction debris was identified in the fill near the edge of the structure. Building 18, a research
building demolished prior to beginning the open cut excavation, was located on the south side of the Bridge
A Open Cut, and covered approximately 8 to 10 feet along the south side of the excavation area. The Bridge
A Open Cut excavation encountered a number of features associated with that building, including glass
pipes used to safely dispose of acid waste. These were generally buried in the first 2.5 feet of soil. A water
pipe and concrete duct bank sat on the west side of the excavation area, running north-south and located
2.7 feet and 10.5 feet east of Building 20, respectively. The duct bank was located from 1 to 2.5 feet below
the surface, and the water pipe was located between 2.7 feet to 3 feet below the surface.

Concrete Footing Features
Possible historic-age features were associated with Stratum 2. Excavation encountered at least seven
concrete footings, each measuring approximately 22 x 22 inches and having a 4- to 5-inch recessed square
in the center and a piece of rebar set in the surface (Figure 18). Three of these were recognized in situ,
forming a line running east-west approximately 5 feet south of the north profile of the pit and beginning
approximately 31 feet east of the west profile. Others were removed from the excavation area at least 23
feet farther west. These features were wholly within Stratum 2, with their upper surfaces corresponding to
the base upper stratum. These appear to be footings for some sort of structure, though it is not clear what
type of structure it was or to when it might date. Sanborn maps of the area from 1912 show domestic
structures in the area, and these foundations may pertain to these, or other later structures (Sanborn 1912).

Figure 18. Concrete footing at the Bridge A Open Cut, facing east.

Brick Feature 1
Historic brick pavement was documented at the interface of Stratum 3 and 4, approximately 4.5 feet below
the surface. The pavement, identified as Brick Feature 1, was composed of stretchers laid north-south and
featured a low curb composed of bricks laid on edge along the eastern side (Figure 19). The pavement
featured a north-south leg, running from the southern margin of excavations 20 feet to the north profile,
then turning west and running another 21 feet. The north-south leg measured 5 feet wide, and the east-west
section measured at least 4.5 feet wide. The western margin of the north-south leg and southern margin of
the east-west leg were not finished, or had been historically disturbed, as bricks were tumbled from place.
Unarranged bricks were also identified east of the pavement.

The east-west portion of this feature may be a portion of road paving associated with the alleyway that
would have originally run along the middle of each of the Galveston city blocks (Sanborn 1899). Based on
the position of this feature beneath the sandy historic fill associated with the 1903â1911 grade raising, this
feature may be associated with domestic structures that existed on this block around the turn of the century
(Sanborn 1899, 1912).

Figure 19. Brick Feature 1 at the Bridge A Open Cut, facing north.

Post Features 1, 2, and 3
Excavation at Bridge A also encountered three post features. Post Feature 1 measured 4 x 4 inches and was
located on the west side of the excavation block, 4.5 feet below the surface, within Stratum 4 (Figure 20).
The post, which was located 6 inches east of the west profile and 10 feet south of the north profile, was
sheared off during the construction excavation, so the exact upper surface was not identifiable.

Feature 2, facing south.

Post Feature 2 included a wood post and post mold which were identified in the south profile of the
excavation block, approximately 42 feet east of the west profile (see Figure 20). The upper surface of the
feature was located at the base of Stratum 3, meaning that the feature was excavated prior the general fill
event associated with Stratum 3. The post and mold extended at least 2 feet deep, measured at least 2 feet
across in profile, and contained fragments of wood and a fill of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy lamina.
Post Feature 3, measuring 2 x 2 inches, was located 6 feet south of Building 17 and 82 feet east of the west
profile of the excavation block. This wood post was also identified 4 feet below the surface, within Stratum
4, but was removed by the first pass of the backhoe prior to documentation.
None of the identified posts appear to be associated with any of the other features and none form any kind
of clear pattern. As such, it is not clear what purpose these features served or to what time period they date.

Plank Features 1 and 2
Two wooden drainage features were recognized on the eastern side of Bridge A excavation near 11th Street.
Both of these features may be portions of residential sewage or drainage tie-ins to open sewers and drainage
ditches that once lined Galveston streets (McComb 1986:100).

Plank Feature 1 was identified during excavation to uncover the water main running on the eastern side of
the site. Located 65 feet north of the intersection of 11th Street and Strand Street, the feature consisted of a
wooden trough composed of a top plank, one side plank, and a base blank and measured 11 x 6 inches in
cross-section (Figure 21). The planks were oriented at approximately 25 degrees and thus did not run
parallel to the Galveston street grid. Only a small, 2-foot-long section was exposed in the area around the
water main, and was identified approximately 3 feet below the surface. The soil in the area appeared
disturbed, likely from the construction of the water main, which also appeared to have destroyed a portion
of the feature.

Figure 21. Plank Feature 1 in Bridge A Open Cut, facing west.

Plank Feature 2 was identified during excavation of the north-south leg of the main excavation area. The
feature was comprised of three small planks, each 1 inch thick, 4 to 6 inches wide, and at least 4 feet long
(Figure 22). The feature ran east-west just above the interface of Strata 3 and 4, approximately 20 feet north
of the first wooden drainage feature.

Pit Features 1 through 5
At least five possible pit features were identified during the Bridge A Open Cut excavation. Three were
identified below the historic fill sand of Stratum 3. The other two were located within Stratum 3, suggesting
that they were excavated after the 1903-1911 fill event.
Pit Feature 1 was located 8 feet from the north profile and approximately 55 feet from the east profile within
the east-west section of the trench. Located approximately 4 feet below the surface, the feature was shallow
(1-2 inches deep), bowl shaped, 1 foot in diameter, and contained one cow bone, ironstone ceramic
fragments, and a mold-blown aqua-colored glass bottle. The initial pass of the excavator damaged too much
of the feature to provide significant detail.
Pit Feature 2 was located 5 feet east of Pit Feature 1. The feature, which appeared at approximately 4 feet
below the surface, measured 2 x 2.1 feet and 4 inches deep. The edges of the feature were lined by a single
plank on each side, laid on edge, but without other supports. Feature fill was composed of almost entirely
brown (7.5YR 4/4) rusty sand which faded out after approximately 4 inches; no clear base was present. Pit
Feature 2 contained a large amount of unidentified ferrous debris as well as milkglass and colorless glass.
Mold blown bottles from the pit included a bottle embossed DR. C F BROWNS/ YOUNG / AMERICAN /
LINIMENT / NEW YORK, and another embossed DR S PITCHERS / CASTORIA. The second bottle likely dates to
around the late 1890s to early 1900s (Lockhart et al. 2014).
Pit Feature 3, like Pit Feature 2, was a square feature lined with planks along the edges. Pit Feature 3
measured 3.8 x 4 feet and was identified approximately 6 feet below the surface. As that was the base of
excavations and the feature would not be further disturbed, it was documented and backfilled with stabilized
sand.

Pit Feature 4 was identified approximately 6.5 feet from the west profile of the east-west leg of the
excavation block and approximately 14 feet from the north side of the excavation block. Unlike Pit Features
1 through 3, Pit Feature 4 was wholly contained within Stratum 3. The feature, which was only identified
in a deep trench profile, measured approximately 1 foot across and 1 foot deep and contained a large amount
of fragmentary ferrous debris, a milkglass cold cream jar, large mammal bone, and bird bone.
Pit Feature 5 was also identified within Stratum 3 of the excavation location. Located at the inside corner
of the open cut, the feature appeared to have been previously disturbed by construction and/or demolition
of Building 18. Pit Feature 5 did not have a defined boundary, but instead appeared as a concentration of
bricks, a large (approximately 24-inch-diameter) terra cotta pipe, glass, and the skeletal remains of a small
animal, likely a dog. This concentration measured approximately 2 feet in diameter and approximately 1
foot deep.

Bridge A Artifacts
Apart from the number of scattered features identified at the Bridge A Open Cut excavation, a number of
isolated artifacts were also recovered. Most artifacts were recovered from the spoil pile from the excavation,
and thus had no provenience data. A few artifacts were recovered during hand excavation and could
conclusively be defined to specific strata (Figure 23, Figure 24). Unfortunately, even with controlled
stratigraphic information, tight dating of the different strata was elusive. Identifiable artifacts from Stratum
3 temporally overlapped artifacts from Stratum 4, suggesting that both strata date to the late nineteenth to
early twentieth centuries.

Bore Pit 1, 11th Street
Bore Pit 1 was located 5 feet south of the center of the intersection of 11th Street and Mechanic Street
(Figure 26). The pit measured 31 feet north-south by 14 feet east-west. An additional area 6.5 feet south of
the south side of the block was also disturbed as crews re-routed utilities around the bore pit location. The
initial excavation at Bore Pit 1 was conducted to remove a palm tree south of the excavation block and reroute utility lines around the south side of the area. These excavations occurred on April 18 and 19, 2013.
Pre-dig excavations around the pit occurred from April 22 to 29, 2013. After jet-grout work was completed,
crews began excavation of the main block. Because of numerous leaks, this took between June 10 and
August 23, 2013.
Soils at Bore Pit 1 were similar to those encountered at the other excavations. Stratum 1 consisted of
approximately 2 to 4 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina (Figure 25).
Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade
raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1)
sandy clay with large mottles of dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. The color and texture of this sand appears
to conform much more closely to the native Mustang soils found elsewhere on Galveston Island, suggesting
that this may be buried ground surface (NRCS 2014). Below this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to
yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist.

Brick Feature 1
Within the utility easement around the south side of the pit, excavations uncovered a 30-inch north-south
by 38-inch east-west section of non-mortared brick paving 23 inches below the modern sidewalk and a
uniform stratum of light brown (7.5YR 6/3) sand. The area to the north and south of the feature remained
unexcavated, but the eastern and western edges of the brick paving were uncovered (Figure 27). The bricks,
identified as Brick Feature 1, appeared to have been salvaged from another construction, as mortar was
sometimes present on the upper surfaces of the paving. Excavation further north within Bore Pit 1
uncovered scattered bricks within the fill at the same depth as this paving. However, a shovel test located
13 feet south of Mechanic Street, and directly in line with the paving, showed that it did not continue there.
The paving may have turned to the west in the southwest corner of Bore Pit 1 or been disturbed prior to the
current project.

Figure 27. Brick Feature 1 in utility trench southwest of Bore Pit 1, facing north.

Brick Feature 2
Within the main portion of Bore Pit 1, crews encountered a brick feature that appears to be an earlier curb
(Figure 28). The feature, labeled Brick Feature 2, consisted of one to three courses of mortared bricks which
ran north-south 2.5 feet from the east profile, 15 feet from the north profile, and at approximately 3.5 feet
below the surface. Depth measurements were difficult within the block, as the ground surface had been
dramatically disturbed by jet-grout operations. The feature then ran north, forming a curve, before aligning
with the modern day Mechanic Street curb. The bricks ended at 2.5 feet from the west profile of the
excavation area. The western stretch of brick was in situ, but tumbled, as if it had already collapsed when
it was buried.

in western portion of the brick curb, facing north.

A single metal artifact was mortared into the brick approximately 5.2 feet from the west profile, but was
possibly a bolt or some type of reinforcement (see Figure 28). Excavation on the north side of the curb
encountered scattered shell within the soil matrix 2 inches below the upper surface of the brick. No evidence
of shell was encountered south of the feature, though scattered brick and wood fragments were encountered
to the south.

Plank Feature 1
Along the eastern side of the excavation area, excavation encountered a wooden plank (trough) similar to
that found on 12th and Mechanic Streets (Figure 29). This feature, labeled Plank Feature 1, consisted of a
wooden trough with the base approximately 33 inches wide and the sidewalls 6 inches tall. The sidewalls
consisted of a single plank set on edge, and the base of the trough was composed of planks laid on their
face, running north-south. The western side of this feature was not directly observed, except along the north
end, as it was beneath the portions of the trench-shoring architecture and was disturbed by the jet-grout
operation. Furthermore, the initial excavation of this feature was conducted during pre-dig, and thus only a
small, 18- to 24-inch trench was excavated. The eastern sidewall was identified during pre-dig
approximately 1.5 to 2 feet below the original surface. The sidewall was only identified in the northernmost
9 feet of the excavation area. Some evidence for an upper surface was present in the profile of the pre-dig
trench, but was beneath part of the shoring equipment and was not directly visible.

Figure 29. Plank Feature 1 in Bore Pit 1 eastern pier trench. Left â first level base planking, facing south;
Right â displaced second level base planking (perpendicular planking), facing west.

Four feet from the south profile, the base planks were missing for approximately 3.7 feet. This corresponded
with the location of a modern storm sewer drain and sub-street conduit identified during the excavation of
the utility easement. Hand excavation to the side of the north end of the feature found a second sidewall
below the initial set of planks, extending down to another 14 inches below the base of the upper sidewall.
Careful excavation of this layer was not possible, as this was too deep to enter the un-shored trench.
Excavation revealed a possible floor to the second sidewall, as several short planks fell from the trench
profile during excavation. These appear to correspond to the perpendicular planking seen elsewhere (see
12th Street, Mechanic Street, and Bore Pit 2); however, this arrangement does not seem conducive to water
flow. The feature formed by the upper sidewalls would allow water to cross the intersection, either as an
open trench or as a conduit, if an upper surface existed, but the box formed by the lower sidewalls was
short, limited to only the northernmost 6 feet of the pit, and no extension of lower wooden trench to the
south was in evidence. It is possible this lower feature was an earlier conduit that existed only at the
intersection of 11th Street and Mechanic Street and was incorporated as a foundation for a later feature.

Post Feature 1
A single wood post 8 to 9 inches in diameter was located 6 inches behind the center of the brick curve, and
identified at 3 inches below the surface highest brick course (Figure 30). The post was at least 3 feet long
and appeared to have been cut off at the surface. This may have been a utility pole dating to the period prior
to the placement of the superimposed fill. Another much smaller post was located along the western side
of the excavation area, 8 feet from the south profile and 3 feet from the west profile and 3 feet below the
surface. This post also had not appeared in the upper layers of soil, suggesting it had been cut off at or
around the level of the superimposed fill.

Bore Pit 1A, 11th Street
Bore Pit 1A was located approximately 69 feet north of the intersection of 11th Street and Market Street
(Figure 32). The pit was an 8-foot-diameter circle, with the eastern side of the pit located at the 11th Street
curb. Crews began excavation of Bore Pit 1A on December 4, 2013, in order to fix a kink in the bore
between pits 1 and 2. Monitoring of the pit stopped on February 14, 2014, due to changes in the monitoring
plan.
The pre-dig excavation at Bore Pit 1A encountered two gas lines and an AT&T utility in the first 2 feet
below surface within the center of the pit. Construction crews halted excavation until the utilities could be
avoided. Excavation resumed on February 13, 2014. The western edge of the excavation area was beneath
the modern day sidewalk. The center of the pit was impacted by the earlier utility lines, as well as by a
power pole located in the northern side of the pit. The eastern side of the pit cut across the modern curb and
was impacted by the construction down to approximately 2 feet below the surface (Figure 31).

Figure 31. Bore Pit 1A during preliminary excavation, facing east.

Along the western side of the pit, beneath the modern sidewall, the soil profile was relatively intact. The
sidewalk was 6 inches thick, and Stratum 1 below it consisted of 1.5 feet of very pale brown (7.5YR 7/3 )
sand. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston
grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Farther down, Stratum 2 contained 3 inches of crushed shell,
which may represent an earlier sidewalk. Stratum 3 appeared to be a buried A horizon, containing another
3 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) sand. Stratum 4 was similar to Stratum 1, featuring another 10 inches of very
pale brown (7.5YR 7/3) sand. Below this, Stratum 5 contained grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sand down to the
base of excavations at 8 feet below the surface.

Feature 1
Apart from the layer of crushed shell on the western side of the excavation area, only one other feature was
encountered. Two bricks were identified embedded side by side in the northwest quarter of the profile of
Stratum 2, further bolstering the interpretation of this layer as a pavement or sidewalk. No artifacts were
identified in the first 6 feet of excavations, but several artifacts were identified in the northeast quarter of
the excavation area at 7 to 8 feet below the surface. These included an unidentified metal object, three
pieces of large mammal bone (two ribs and one clavicle), whiteware, three pieces of a Rockingham spittoon,
and decorative glass (Figure 33). None of the artifacts provided tight temporal control, generally dating to
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, though stylistically, the artifacts appear to date to the late nineteenth
to early twentieth century.

spittoon; Bottom â decorative glassware pedestal base and teapot.

The area around these artifacts appeared to show faint lamina of soil, possibly suggesting that this was an
open pit and sediment washed in. These artifacts appear much farther below the surface than other artifacts
found during the project. It is unclear how these artifacts were buried so deeply, though it may be
disturbance from construction of the modern curb or the nearby power pole. Excavation was not monitored
after February 14, 2014, due to clarification of the MOA, though the excavation crews intended to excavate
down to 20 feet below the surface.

Bore Pit 2, Market Street
Bore Pit 2 was located at the intersection of 11th Street and Market Street (see Figure 32). The pit measured
14 feet east-west by 13 feet north-south. The northern edge of the pit was located at approximately 2.5 feet
north of the edge of the Market Street curb and the western edge was 9.5 feet west of the edge of the 11th
Street curb. Construction crews began excavating Bore Pit 2 on April 23, 2013 and halted excavations after
October 8, 2013.
During the initial concrete removal on Bore Pit 2 on April 23, 2013, crews encountered a rail line directly
beneath the modern asphalt surface, running east-west 11 feet 8 inches south of the Market Street curb. No
rail line is present on the 1899 or 1912 Sanborn Maps of the area, but the 1930 topographic map of the city
does show rail lines on Market Street (Sanborn 1912, 1899; USGS 1930). The Galveston Electric Company
operated a trolley service in the city between 1905 and 1938, likely dating this rail line to the early twentieth
century (Vandervoort 2014).
Pre-dig on Bore Pit 2 began on May 8, 2013, with a small excavation to search for a buried AT&T cable.
Soils at Bore Pit 3 were similar to other nearby bore pits. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5 feet and
2.7 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina (Figure 34). Stratum 1 is likely
the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â
1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large
mottles of dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of approximately 2.7 feet s of gray (10YR
5/1) compact sand. The color and texture of this sand appears to conform much more closely to the native
Mustang soils found elsewhere on Galveston Island, suggesting that this may be buried ground surface
(NRCS 2014). Below this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white
(10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist.

A number of areas of modern disturbance were present within Bore Pit 2. Along the south side of the pit,
the foundations for the rail line extended to 2 feet below the surface. Just to the north of the rail line, a gas
line was buried 4 feet below the surface, and two tie-in lines ran north-south midway across the block, 2
feet below the surface. The AT&T data cable ran just east of these tie-in lines, 2.5 to 3 feet below the
surface. A concrete drainage feature or duct bank ran perpendicular beneath the rail line in the southeast
corner of the pit.

Plank Features 1 and 2
Excavation encountered wood planking along the north and east sides of Bore Pit 2. On the north side, a
single 1 by 12-inch plank, set on edge, was encountered between 4 inches and 2 feet below the surface of
the modern curb. Identified as Plank Feature 1 (see Figure 34), the plank ran east-west, 3 inches north of
the modern curb location, and extended east past the end of the curb. Shovel tests excavated to the north
and south of this plank encountered a layer of shell on the south side of the plank, 6 inches below the
surface, possibly indicating a roadway surface.
A second plank feature ran north-south along the east side of the excavation block (Figure 35). Like the
plank features at 12th Street, Mechanic Street, and Bore Pit 1, Plank Feature 2 consisted of a 1-foot-wide
wooden conduit, with a base 3 feet 4 inches below the surface. The sidewalls were 9 inches tall. A post was
documented on the east side of the planking at the same depth, and a single plank ran along the upper
surface of the conduit. The base planks, which ran perpendicular to the sidewalls and roof plank, were
another 8 inches wider than the upper surface and extended out on the west side of the base.

Excavations on the northern end uncovered the interface between Plank Features 1 and 2. There, the eastern
sidewall of Plank Feature 2 was not visible; the base planks were also not visible at this point. A notch in
the upper surface of the western sidewall of Plank Feature 2 was identified 5 inches south of the intersection
of the two planks. Neither plank appeared to be bonded to the other. Plank Feature 1 appeared only 1 inch
taller than the sidewall of Plank Feature 2. As such, it is not clear how water in ditches on Market Street
might flow into Plank Feature 2.

Bore Pit 3, Market Street
Bore Pit 3 was located 85 feet east of the intersection of 11th Street and Market Street (see Figure 32). The
pit measured approximately 25.5 feet east-west by 7.7 feet north-south. The northern edge of the pit was
located 14 inches north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Crews began excavating Bore Pit 3 on May
16, 2013, and halted excavations after September 23, 2013.
Pre-dig on Bore Pit 3 began on May 16, 2013. Soils at Bore Pit 3 were similar to other nearby bore pits.
Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy
lamina. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston
grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR
6/1) sandy clay with large mottles of dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of approximately
4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand, and Stratum 4 featured 6 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand.
Stratum 5 consisted of approximately 2 feet of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below this, sands varied from gray
(10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the
archaeologist.
Crews excavated shoring trenches down to 8 feet below the surface at Bore Pit 3 between July 1 and 3,
2013, and then excavated the entire block down to 5 feet below the surface on July 18, 2013. Finally, on
September 23, 2013, crews quickly excavated the entire pit down to 22 feet below the surface, scraping the
jet-grouted floor. No cultural resources were identified below 3 feet below the surface.

Rail Line Feature
Pre-dig excavations at Bore Pit 3 uncovered several possible streetscape features. Along the south profile
of the block, just below the modern surface, excavations encountered the concrete base and wooden ties for
an earlier rail line (Figure 36). However, the rail itself was not uncovered.

No rail line is present on the 1899 or 1912 Sanborn Maps of the area, but the 1930 topographic map of the
city does show rail lines on Market Street (Sanborn 1912, 1899; USGS 1930). The Galveston Electric
Company operated trolley service in the city between 1905 and 1938, likely dating this rail line to the early
twentieth century (Vandervoort 2014). The south side of Bore Pit 3 also contained a large number of brick
fragments at the interface between Strata 1 and 2. This brick was mixed with a small amount of shell and
may represent a semi-prepared or ad hoc road surface.

Brick Feature 1
On the northern side of the pit, excavations found an area of both disturbed and undisturbed brick beneath
the modern curb which likely represents an earlier curb. The brick, identified as Brick Feature 1, laid edgeto-edge 1 foot 4 inches below the surface of the modern sidewalk, was intact for 9 feet between 9 and 18
feet east of the west profile (Figure 37). Other areas show crushed brick separating a soil color change, with
soils of Stratum 1 south of the brick and soils of Stratum 2 north of the brick. This brick appears to be an
earlier curb, likely dating before the 1903â1911 Galveston grade raising.

Plank Feature 1
Below and just south of the brick, at 2 feet below the modern sidewalk, a 3-inch-tall by 0.5-inch-wide board
ran across the entire width of the pit. One 2 x 6-inch post was identified 4 feet from the western profile of
the block. This plank feature (Plank Feature 1) may represent an earlier street edge marker or drainage
feature (Figure 38).

Bore Pit 4, Market Street
Bore Pit 4 was located 88 feet west of the center of the intersection of 10th Street and Market Street (Figure
41). The pit measured approximately 25 feet east-west by 13.5 feet north-south. The northern edge of the
pit was located 1.7 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore Pit 4 began on May
8, 2013 and ended after October 2, 2013.
Pre-dig on Bore Pit 4 found soils similar to those encountered elsewhere. Stratum 1 consisted of
approximately 1.5 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina. Stratum 1 is likely
the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â
1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large
mottles of dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of 4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand,
and Stratum 4 featured 6 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand. Stratum 5 consisted of approximately 2 feet of
gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to
white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist.
The pre-dig excavation identified two features within the upper 3 feet below surface. On August 21, 2013,
the pit was excavated down to 6 feet below the surface in order to use the space for spoils from the jet-grout
operations (Figure 39). On October 2, 2013, crews used a large excavator to quickly excavate down to
approximately 22 feet below the surface. Leaks continually brought wet sand in from outside the block,
obscuring and mixing contexts, but no cultural resources were identified after the first 3 feet below the
surface.

Post Feature 1
Pre-dig excavations uncovered one small post in the north profile of the trench, 1.7 feet west of the east
profile and 2 feet below the surface. This post was not associated with any other materials and its function
was unclear. This post was not removed.

Brick Feature 1
Excavations along the north side of the pit also revealed an alignment of intact brick, identified as Brick
Feature 1, located 1.3 feet below the modern curb surface. This brick was mortared edge to edge in a line
directly below the modern curb, starting at the west profile of the excavation area and running for 7 feet
(Figure 40).

Bore Pit 5, Market Street
Bore Pit 5 was located 82 feet east of the center of the intersection of 10th Street and Market Street (see
Figure 41). The pit measured approximately 25.5 feet east-west by 13 feet north-south. The northern edge
of the pit was located 2 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavation at Bore Pit 5 began on
April 15, 2013, and ended after December 12, 2013.
Pre-dig on Bore Pit 5 began on May 16, 2013. Soils at Bore Pit 5 were similar to those encountered
elsewhere. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to
6/2) sandy lamina. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill sand place across the island during the
Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray
(10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large mottles of dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of
approximately 4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand, and Stratum 4 featured approximately 6 inches
of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand. Stratum 5 consisted of approximately 2 feet of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below
this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white (10YR 8/1), but were
beyond the reach of the archaeologist.
Excavations for pre-dig along the south side of the pit found no historic features except for a cast iron gas
pipe of unknown age. Pre-dig excavations on the northern portion identified three plank features. Bore Pit
5 was excavated down to 5 feet below the surface on September 4, 2013. Due to a miscommunication,
subsequent excavation of the pit, on or around December 9, 2013, was not monitored. Excavation was
completed down to 22 feet below the surface across most of the pit. Further excavation on December 1012, 2013, was monitored and no further cultural resources were identified within the area.

Plank Features 1, 2, and 3
Excavations on the north side of the pit encountered a single 2 x 0.5-inch plank, identified as Plank Feature
1, beneath the modern day curb, approximately 6 inches below the surface (Figure 42). The soil north of
the plank differed from the soil to the south; north of the feature, the soil was brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand. The
planking was not solid, and did not extend for the full length of the pit. It appears that it was previously
disturbed. Crushed shell was identified adjacent to the planking beneath Stratum 1, 6 inches below the
surface, but not within the area of brown sand. This shell was likely the remains of older road surfaces
(McComb 1986:104).
When excavation resumed on Bore Pit 5 on August 1, 2013, a second plank was encountered in the
northwest corner of the pit, 1.7 feet below the surface and 3 feet south of the north side of the pit, in line
with the modern curb. The plank was 4 feet long and ran west beneath the unexcavated part of the street. A
third plank was also identified in the west profile of the pit, 1.7 feet below the surface. This plank ran northsouth for at least 3 feet, but was not fully investigated as it was not in the excavated area. The presence of
the first and second planks directly adjacent to and aligned with the modern curb suggests that these features
may have been an earlier curb or small scale drainage features. It is not clear what the third plank may be,
but it does not appear to conform to the pattern seen in other Market Street pits.

Bore Pit 6, Market Street
Bore Pit 6 was located 82 feet west of the center of the intersection of 9th Street and Market Street (Figure
44). The pit measured 45 feet east-west by 13 feet north-south. The northern edge of the pit was located 4
feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore Pit 6 began on April 16, 2013, and
ended November 21, 2013.
Pre-dig on Bore Pit 6 began on May 2, 2013 (Figure 43). Pre-dig trenches at Bore Pit 6 were twice as wide
as the other pits because the trench was moved 1 foot south of its original location to avoid a gas pipeline
of unknown age located approximately 1.5 feet below the surface.

Figure 43. Pre-dig excavations at Bore Pit 6, facing northwest.

Soils at Bore Pit 6 were similar to those encountered elsewhere. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5
feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the
historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981).
Stratum 2 consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large mottles of dark
brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of 4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand, and Stratum 4
featured approximately 6 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand. Stratum 5 consisted of approximately 2 feet
of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to
white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond the reach of the archaeologist. On the south side of the pit, Stratum 1
measured approximately 2 feet 5 inches deep, whereas it sloped to only 1 foot deep on the north side of the
block.

Crushed brick was encountered in the first inch of Stratum 2 in the south side of the block. This may have
been ad hoc paving or the remains of a demolished building. On the north side of the block, one plank was
identified. After pre-dig, crews excavated a portion of the center of the pit for a reservoir during an
unsuccessful attempt to use water to force shoring between the I-beam piers from the surface. The presence
of water in the pit during the excavation made monitoring impossible. After August 1, 2013, crews began
the main excavation. Stymied by constant leaks from the concrete shoring walls, excavation was slow and
not completed down to 20 feet below the surface until November 21, 2013. No new cultural features were
identified below the first 3 feet of excavation.

Plank Feature 1
On the north side of the block, one plank (identified as Plank Feature 1) was encountered 1 foot below the
surface, running east-west directly in front of the modern curb (Figure 45). The plank, measuring
approximately 4 inches tall by 0.5 inch thick, was at least 10 feet long. The segment encountered in the
profile of the pre-dig trench and was not removed during pre-dig. Two posts, each measuring approximately
2 x 2 inches, also appeared on the north side of the plank approximately 26 feet from the west profile. These
appear to have been supports for the plank. The presence of the single unsubstantial plank and supports
directly adjacent to the modern curb suggests that this feature may have been an earlier curb or small scale
drainage feature.

Bore Pit 7, Market Street
Bore Pit 7 was located 203 feet west of the center of the intersection of 8th Street and Market Street (see
Figure 44). The pit measured approximately 29 feet east-west and 12 feet north-south. The northern edge
of the pit was located approximately 3.8 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at
Bore Pit 7 began on May 23, 2013.
Soils in the pit were the same as soils elsewhere. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5 feet of strong
brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill
sand place across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2
consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large mottles of dark brown (7.5YR
3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of approximately 4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand, and Stratum 4
featured 6 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand. The color and texture of this sand appears to conform closely
to the native Mustang soils found elsewhere on Galveston Island, suggesting that this may be buried ground
surface (NRCS 2014). Stratum 4 consisted of approximately 2 feet of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below this,
sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to white (10YR 8/1), but were beyond
the reach of the archaeologist.
Pre-dig along the north side of the pit encountered the fragmented remains of a wooden plank feature. On
July 15 and 16, 2013, excavation was continued down to 10 feet below surface across the pit, though the
soils often collapsed from the side, preventing careful excavation. The pit was excavated to 18 feet below
the surface on December 18, 2013, and then fully excavated to 22 feet below surface on January 6, 2014
(Figure 46). No other cultural features were identified in this excavation.

Plank Feature 1
The feature consisted of a single 2 by 0.5-inch plank, laid on edge, running east-west 1.5 feet south of the
north profile of the block, approximately 8 inches below the ground surface. The plank ran for
approximately 5 feet west of the east profile of the pit. At its western end, a single, small (2 x 2 inch) post
was located on the north side of the plank. The area was encased in the root ball of a palm tree, and the
removal of this root caused the feature to disintegrate. Plank Feature 1 appears to be the remnants of
curbside features or small drainages.

Pit 7A, Market Street
Pit 7A was located 38 feet west of Bore Pit 7 (see Figure 44). Excavations on Bore Pit 7A occurred between
September 13 and 17, 2013, and were conducted to create a reservoir for spoils from the jet-grout operation
at Pit 7. The pit measured approximately 20.5 feet east-west by 10.7 feet north-south. The northern edge of
the pit was located at the edge of the modern curb. Excavations extended down to 5 feet below the street
surface and utilized a trench box to shore the walls (Figure 47). No cultural features were identified in this
excavation.

facing southwest.

Soils in this pit were similar to soils elsewhere. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 1.5 feet of strong
brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina. Stratum 1 is likely the remains of the historic fill
sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising in 1903â1911 (Davis 1981). Stratum 2
consisted of approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay with large mottles of dark brown (7.5YR
3/4) sand. Stratum 3 consisted of approximately 4 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) compact sand, and Stratum 4
featured approximately 6 inches of brown (7.5YR 5/3) sand. Stratum 5 consisted of approximately 2 feet
of gray (10YR 6/1) sand. Below this, sands varied from gray (10YR 6/1) to yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) to

Bore Pit 8, Market Street
Bore Pit 8 was located 121 feet east of the center of the intersection of 8th Street and Market Street (Figure
50). The pit measured approximately 25.5 feet east-west and 13.5 feet north-south. The northern edge of
the pit was located 4.1 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore Pit 8 began on
May 24, 2013.
During concrete removal at Bore Pit 8, one small stick, measuring less than 0.5 inch wide, was recorded
from 5.9 feet to 9.9 feet east of the west pit profile and 4.7 feet south of the north profile, just below the
concrete surface. The orientation of this wood was similar to the wooden features found in Bore Pits 6 and
7, but was much less substantial than those features and was mostly destroyed by concrete removal (Figure
48).

Figure 48. Small wood fragments encountered during concrete
removal at Bore Pit 8, facing southwest.

Pre-dig for Bore Pit 8 was completed on May 30 and 31, 2014, and found that the soil in this area was
different from earlier bore pits. Below the street surface, approximately 6 inches of light brown (7.5YR 6/4)
sand overlaid mottled light brownish gray and gray (2.5Y 6/2 and 6/1) sand down to 6 to 7 feet below the
surface.

Excavation continued at Bore Pit 8 between June 19 and 28, 2013, as crews attempted to place shoring
between the shoring piers from the surface, but no new cultural resources were identified. A 2-feet-deep,
1-foot-wide trench was excavated along the north edge of the block to place a drainage pipe.
On January 17 and 18, 2014, the pit was excavated down to 23 feet below the surface, exposing the concrete
floor of the pit (Figure 49). Soils appeared similar to other pits, with alternating layers of light and dark
grey and pale brown (2.5Y 3/1 to 7/1 and 2.5Y 7/3) dense sands down to depth. No cultural resources were
identified during the rest of excavation (Figure 49).

Bore Pit 9, Market Street
Bore Pit 9 was located 357 feet east of the center of the intersection of 8th Street and Market Street. The pit
measured approximately 19 feet east-west and 13.5 feet north-south (see Figure 50). The northern edge of
the pit was located 1.9 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore Pit 9 began on
October 16, 2013.
Pre-dig excavations were conducted around the margin of the pit. Soil in the area was the same as beneath
Bore Pit 8. Below the street surface, 6 inches of light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand lay over mottled light
brownish gray and gray (2.5Y 6/2 and 6/1) sand. The water table was reached at approximately 4 feet below
the surface. Crews used a probe to check for features below this. A gas pipe was identified along the eastern
and southern side of the block, but no historic features were identified during pre-dig. Subsequent work on
Bore Pit 9 was not monitored, due to changes in the monitoring plan after mid-February 2014.

Plank Feature 1
On May 8, 2014, SWCA was contacted by UTMB after excavation encountered an unexpected discovery
at Bore Pit 9. The construction crew found a set of approximately 1.5-inch-thick planks at approximately 8
feet below the ground surface (Figure 51).

Figure 51. Plank Feature 1 in Bore Pit 9, facing south

SWCA archaeologists were not onsite to monitor the excavation of these planks or the surrounding area.
The excavation crew initially thought the planks pertained to a modern duct bank or pipe shoring and
excavated on the eastern side in order to find the opposing face of the trench. Excavating by hand, they
identified a few historic artifacts, including roofing slate and colorless bottle glass, but did not identify
another plank feature.

SWCA Environmental Consultants

77

Revised August 2016

Archaeological Monitoring of Portions of the UTMB District Heating and Cooling Project, Galveston County, Texas

The planks, identified as Plank Feature 1, were set on end vertically and laid edge-to-edge, creating a line
across the pit at approximately 338 degrees. The upper ends of the planks had been disturbed by the
construction equipment, though the extent of the disturbance was unknown, and several of the planks within
the center of the pit had already been broken off. Planks remained at the northern and southern edges of the
pit, embedded within the jet grout shoring. The construction crew reported that the bases of the planks were
still intact, but the bottom of the pit was flooded and the planks could not be observed. The visible portion
of the planks within the north and south walls was 2.5 feet tall. No other support architecture, posts, or
backing was observed.
The construction crew provided one other clue to the possible identification of the feature; during their
excavation east of the pit (between Bore Pits 9 and 10), the bore began to return a large quantity of wood
and fragmentary historic debris approximately 180 feet west of Bore Pit 10 (approximately 80 feet east of
this planking feature). The presence of two sets of wood planks approximately 80 feet apart running roughly
North-South at this location appears to conform to the dimensions and character of the shoring of the
Galveston grade raising canals constructed during the 1903â1911 grade raising (Davis 1981).
In the attempt to raise the grade of the island several feet after the 1900 Galveston Hurricane, engineers
constructed a canal on the back side of the Galveston Seawall extending from Galveston Harbor to a turning
basin near the intersection of 33rd Street and Avenue P-Â½ (McComb 1986:143). Most sources report that
the canal was 200 feet wide (McComb 1986; Wright-Gidley and Marines 2008:52); however, photographs
of the canal near the entrance from the harbor appear to suggest that the canal was narrower on the eastern
end (Figure 52).

Figure 52. North end of the grade raising canal, facing south, showing shoring and the
relative narrowness of the canal along the east side of the island. The dredge Holm was 30

Some portions of the canal banks were not supported, but areas along the eastern end, where the canal
approached very close to the seawall, required wooden levees alongside the canal (Wright-Gidley and
Marines 2008:62). As the canal remained open for almost eight years, historical debris from this time period
would also likely occur within the canal, which might explain the artifacts encountered during hand
excavation and returned during the boring operation.

Bore Pit 10, Market Street
Bore Pit 10 was located 95 feet west of the center of the intersection of 6th Street and Market Street (Figure
54). The pit measured approximately 33.8 feet east-west and 14.5 feet north-south. The northern edge of
the pit was located approximately 2.3 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore
Pit 10 began on October 15, 2013.
During the initial pre-dig, crews encountered a large concrete duct bank along the eastern side of the block.
Because the size and arrangement of this duct bank would preclude the excavation of the bore pit, crews
moved the pit 6 feet to the west.
Pre-dig excavations encountered very different soils in this pit compared to Bore Pits 1 through 9. At Bore
Pit 10, excavations encountered very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sand to 7 feet below the surface. This sand
was interspersed with dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay nodules, along with bits of plant material. This
sand is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island during the Galveston grade raising
in 1903â1911, but which reached depths of up to 12 feet near the seawall (Davis 1981).

Concrete Footing Feature
North of the modern curb, approximately 4.7 feet east of the west profile of the block, excavations
encountered a large concrete block with four pieces of rebar extending from the upper surface in a square
pattern (Figure 53). The block measured approximately 1 x 1 foot, and was approximately 1.5 feet tall. The
presence of the block in proximity to the road and the rebar posts suggest that this was the base for a light
pole or other street feature.

Wooden Conduit Feature
Just below the concrete block feature, and extending south across the width of the block, excavations
encountered a wooden conduit (Figure 55). This feature was encountered approximately 2.5 inches below
the base of the modern day concrete street, but had not been disturbed by previous construction. The feature
consisted of a tube constructed of 6 x 1-inch planks that extended across Bore Pit 10 at 317 degrees. The
interior of the tube was filled with coal tar surrounding a 1-inch-diameter lead pipe. The pipe carried a
single copper wire wrapped in fabric. Similar wooden conduits appear to date to around the turn of the
twentieth century (England 1909:38). The orientation of this conduit appears to follow the original
orientation of Seawall Boulevard (Sanborn 1912). This may suggest that this was a conduit associated with
street features built around Seawall Boulevard in the early part of the twentieth century.

6th Street Open Cut
The 6th Street Open Cut excavation was located east of Bore Pit 10 and extended east to the center of the
intersection of 6th and Market Streets for a total of 105 feet (see Figure 54). The open cut excavation
measured 8 feet wide and sits 6 inches south of the Market Street curb. Excavation began on October 15,
2013. Monitoring of the pit ended on October 17, 2014, but excavation continued after this date.
Pre-dig on the western end of the pit began during the excavation of Bore Pit 10. As the pit was later moved
6 feet west of its planned location, the first 6 feet of the 6th Street Open Cut were excavated for pre-dig of
Bore Pit 10. After excavating Bore Pit 10, boring between the pits, and pipe-laying, construction crews
resumed excavation at the 6th Street Open Cut on July 10, 2014.
Moving east, the construction crews encountered an existing modern duct bank and water pipe before
placing trench boxes and excavating down to 8.5 feet below the surface. Soils consisted of 8.5 feet of very
pale brown (7.5YR 7/3) sand. This sand is likely the remains of the historic fill sand placed across the island
during the Galveston grade raising of 1903â1911, but which reached depths of up to 12 feet near the seawall
(Davis 1981). Excavation of the western half of the trench was completed on July 21, 2014.
Once the pipe had been laid in the first half of the trench, construction crews back-filled the open section
and prepared to excavate the eastern half. They saw-cut the concrete and began breaking the modern road
surface on August 6, 2014.

1904 Galveston Seawall Section
On August 7, during the removal of the concrete rubble, a large section of concrete remained intact below
the modern road surface in a location close to the expected location of the 1904 Galveston Seawall.
Construction crews uncovered and cleaned this concrete alignment, revealing that it measured
approximately 6 feet wide and was located 8 feet west of the southeast corner of the 6th Street Open Cut
(Figure 56). The concrete feature ran at 316 degrees.

In accordance with the MOA between UTMB, FEMA, THC, and TDEM, archaeologists undertook a
project of documentation in order to mitigate the effects of the demolition of a portion of the seawall
(Appendix A). The fill to the east and west of the seawall were investigated and the portion to be demolished
was fully cleaned prior to demolition, allowing photographs and drawings to be made of the order to identify
any structural features within the seawall, completing the requirements of the MOA.
The upper surface of the seawall was not uniform; parts appeared to have been broken in the past, and some
had been recently disturbed during the removal of the modern road surface. These breaks revealed some of
the composition of the structure, showing a pinkish-colored granite aggregate. Further excavation of the
feature showed that the eastern face was curved, such that the base was much wider than the top, and that
the western face was flat (Figure 57). These features all appear to correspond to the details of the
construction of the 1904 Galveston Seawall.

Figure 57. Eastern face of a portion of the 1904 Galveston Seawall, facing west.

Eastern Side of the 1904 Galveston Seawall
East of the concrete feature, the soil changed from the very pale brown sand to a brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand
with inclusions of asphalt and gravel. Further excavation and cleaning of the seawall revealed several
features. On the eastern side of the seawall, several locations appeared as rusty concretions extending from
the face of the seawall. It is unclear if these were exterior parts of the original construction that rusted;
interior construction features, such as rebar, that created rust on the exterior of the seawall; or concretions
formed from contact of other historic materials with the seawall surface.

One large concentration of rusty soil was encountered 4.5 feet below surface, approximately 8 inches from
the south profile and adjacent to the east face of the seawall. This stained area was associated with several
pieces of terra cotta pipe or tile, but no pattern or identifiable artifacts were recovered from the fill. A single
piece of terra cotta tile, also pulled from the fill east of the seawall, had been stamped â¦ADON CO / CHICAGO
/ IMPERIAL TILE / PATâD APR 8TH 1924, dating the fill east of the seawall to later than 1924.

Western Side of the 1904 Galveston Seawall
Another large stain was encountered on the west side of the seawall, approximately 14 to 22 inches from
the north profile and approximately 5 to 6.5 feet below the street surface. The stain, which appeared as a
0.5-inch-thick concentration of small pebbles and rust in the soil near the wall, may have been the remains
of a piece of ferrous metal left adjacent to the wall.
The western side of the seawall also showed some evidence of construction techniques; the imprints of the
wooden forms were present on the western face, and a junction between two of the sets of forms was located
approximately 3 feet from the north profile (Figure 58). North of the junction, the wood cladding left marks
only 5.5 inches wide, while to the south, the boards were 9.5 inches wide. Although the Galveston Seawall
was constructed in 60-foot sections that cured separately, the demolition of this section of the seawall did
not reveal any cleavage planes, suggesting that this pattern was caused by the forms, as opposed to
construction techniques (Wright-Gidley and Marines 2008:20).

Demolition of the Section of the 1904 Galveston Seawall
The initial demolition of the section of the seawall was conducted between August 29 and September 4,
2014. Demolition utilized both handheld jackhammers and a backhoe-mounted jackhammer to break
through the dense concrete and granite aggregate (Figure 59). Several pieces of square rebar were noted
within the seawall, which corresponds to methods detailed in historical documentation of the construction
(Davis 1981).

No other features were noted within the interior of the seawall during demolition (Figure 60). A section of
the seawall measuring approximately 7 feet wide by 9 feet deep was removed for the placement of the
pipes. On October 17, 2014, SWCA returned to the site to monitor a small amount of final cleaning and
demolition beneath the installed pipes, which required a 6-inch buffer on all sides. No excavation or
demolition was conducted after that point.

Bore Pit 11, Market Street
Bore Pit 11 was located approximately 256 feet east of the center intersection of 6th Street and Market
Street. The pit measured 40 feet east-west and 17.5 feet north-south (Figure 62). The northern edge of the
pit was located approximately 4.5 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at Bore Pit
11 began on February 3, 2014. Pre-dig excavations were conducted on February 6, 2014. Subsequent work
on Bore Pit 11 was not monitored due to changes in the monitoring plan after mid-February 2014.
Soils at Bore Pit 11 were markedly different from those at Bore Pit 10 and Bore Pits 1 through 9. Stratum
1 consisted of approximately 5.7 feet of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand. Below this, excavation encountered
approximately 6 inches of gray (10YR 5/1) sand on top of a stratum of 4 inches of very dark gray (10YR
3/1) sand. Excavation proceeded down to 7.5 feet below the surface, through alternating layers of shell and
grey sand. Excavation encountered a number of historic artifacts, and two possible features.

Plank Feature 1
Approximately 10 inches below the modern street surface, excavation encountered a 0.5-inch-thick wooden
plank approximately 3.5 feet south of the modern curb (Figure 61). The plank, identified as Plank Feature
1, ran for 12 feet from the west profile of the block. A soil color change was noted north and south of this
plank that continued even after the plank stopped. South of the plank, 0.8 inch of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand
lay over 2.4 inches of mixed clay and shell. Below this, excavation found 8.6 inches of brown (7.5YR 4/4)
sand over another strata of brown sand mixed with shell. North of the board, the same brown sand extended
straight down to 12 inches below the surface, and then the same strata of brown sand and shell appeared.

Plank Feature 2
A second board, identified as Plank Feature 2, was recovered 39 inches below the surface and slightly north
of the first board. This board, measuring 1 inch wide, 6 inches tall, and 8 feet long, was angled in relation
to the bore pit (and Galveston street grid) at approximately 50 degrees. This brought the board beneath a
modern concrete duct bank that skirted the north edge of the pit. This board did not appear to be associated
with any other boards. While the first plank appears similar to other possible street edge features identified
in Bore Pits 1-8, this plank does not appear to conform to this pattern. It may be a remnant of another
feature, or simply trash incorporated into historic fill.

Figure 63. Plank Feature 2 within Bore Pit 11.

Bore Pit 11 Artifacts
A third wooden artifact appears to be historic debris. Two planks were removed together from the east end
of the bore pit, 39 inches from both the east and north profiles, and 4.2 feet below the surface. The boards
appear to have been fastened together with screws or nails which had subsequently completely rusted
(Figure 64).

Historic debris became more common in the dark gray sandy horizon approximately 5 feet below the
surface. Numerous pieces of roofing slate, wood fragments, concrete, and brick were identified between 5
to 6 feet below the surface. Only one diagnostic artifact, a glass bottle base, was recovered (Figure 65). The
base shows evidence of being formed in an automatic bottle machine, dating it later than 1905 and likely
into the 1910s (Society for Historical Archaeology [SHA] 2014).

Based on maps and aerial photographs, the area east of the seawall was filled in slowly between 1904 and
the 1950s (Sanborn 1912; U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] 1952; USGS 1930). When the original
seawall was built, this area was low and outside of the raised portion of the city. After the extension of the
seawall to Fort San Jacinto in the 1920s, the area east of the old seawall was protected from flooding (Davis
1981). However, it was not filled in, remaining marshy, and not conducive to construction.
In 1909, this area was utilized as a trash dump for the City of Galveston, though the unsanitary conditions
proved unacceptable to Galveston residents (Rosenberg Library 2015). In 1929, the populace approved a
bond measure funding a filling project to accompany the newly constructed eastern seawall extension
(Rosenberg Library 2015). The area was not completely filled at this time, and construction was piecemeal.
Over time, it appears the area was filled in, but even by the 1950s, few structures had been constructed east
of 6th Street (USDA 1952; Rosenberg Library 2015). It appears the deposits within Bore Pit 11 conform to
this series of events, with trash refuse overlaid by a cap of intentional fill dating to the second quarter of
the twentieth century.

Bore Pit 12, Market Street
Bore Pit 12 was located 226 feet west of the center intersection of 4th Street and Market Street. The pit
measured 32 feet east-west and 18 feet north-south (see Figure 62). After monitoring at Bore Pit 12, project
plans changed and this location is no longer within the project alignment. At the time of monitoring, the
northern edge of the pit was located 56 inches north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations at
Bore Pit 11 began on February 4, 2014. Pre-dig excavations were conducted on February 6 and 7, 2014.
Subsequent work on Bore Pit 12 was not monitored due to changes in the monitoring plan after midFebruary 2014.
Soils at Bore Pit 12 were similar to those from Bore Pit 11. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 39 inches
of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand. Below this, excavation encountered between 29 to 50 inches of gray (10YR
5/1) sand. Stratum 3 featured 4 inches of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sand and copious amounts of historic
debris. Excavation proceeded down to 7.5 to 8 feet below the surface, through alternating layers of shell
and gray sand (Figure 66).

Bore Pit 12 Artifacts
Excavation encountered numerous historic artifacts in Stratum 2. A Nehi bottle embossed DESIGN PATâD
MAR 3, 25, and a Hazel-Atlas Glass Company bottle appear to date Stratum 3 to at least the second quarter
of the twentieth century (SHA 2014). An Owens-Illinois bottle embossed FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS RESALE
OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE and a date code of 1944 (Figure 67) corroborates this date (Lockhart 2004).
Other historic debris included cut and wire nails, brick fragments, a crushed bucket full of hardened plaster,
a headlight, and a section of a tile with attached grout.

Bore Pit 13, Market Street
Bore Pit 13 was located approximately 19.5 feet east of the center intersection of 4th Street and Market
Street. The pit measured 19 feet east-west and 20.5 feet north-south (see Figure 62). After monitoring at
Bore Pit 12, project plans changed and this location is no longer within the project alignment. The northern
edge of the pit was located approximately 9 feet north of the edge of the Market Street curb. Excavations
at Bore Pit 13 began on February 10, 2014. Pre-dig excavations were conducted on February 10, 2014.
Subsequent work on Bore Pit 13 was not monitored due to changes in the monitoring plan after midFebruary 2014.
Soils at Bore Pit 13 were similar to those at Bore Pit 11 and 12. Stratum 1 consisted of approximately 6.5
feet of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand. Below this, excavation encountered gray (10YR 5/1) sand. The layer of
dark sand and copious amounts of historic artifacts seen in Bore Pit 12 was not encountered within the
limited excavations conducted at Bore Pit 13.
Excavation at Bore Pit 13 encountered large areas of disturbance (Figure 68). A gas line runs north-south
across the excavation area 2.5 feet below the surface. An area of stabilized sand cut across the block eastwest from 2 to 5 feet north of the south profile. An electrical conduit crossed the north side of the block,
and, according to civil survey maps, a water main was buried within Bore Pit 13, but was never encountered.
No historic artifacts or features were encountered within this excavation area.

East Plant / Morgan Hall
The area around Morgan Hall, which was demolished for this project, was excavated in order to place clean
fill beneath the proposed East Plant building. The excavation area lies 187 feet south and 16 feet west of
the intersection of Harborside Drive and Holiday Drive (4th Street). The excavated area was irregularly
shaped and measured approximately 157 feet north-south by 200 feet east-west (Figure 69). Prior to
archaeological monitoring, some excavation occurred on the site for pre-dig and placement of shoring piers
and plates. Archaeological monitoring of the excavation and the main removal of material occurred after
April 8, 2014, and ended on May 1, 2014.
Between 11.5 to 14.5 feet of soil were removed from the excavation area. Clean sand was then trucked into
the pit and compacted to provide a foundation for the proposed East Plant. When monitoring began, the
ground surface level within the excavation area was 1.5 to 3.5 feet lower than the surrounding, intact ground
surface. Below this, excavations encountered 1.5 to 3.5 feet of light brown (7.5YR 6/3) sand over
approximately 9.8 feet of gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay. At approximately 11.5 to 13 feet below the surface,
excavations encountered a thin (2- to 4-inch) layer of dark gray to black (10YR 4/1 to 2/1) sand, mixed
with copious organic material and some historic artifacts. This stratum has been interpreted as a buried O
Horizon. Below this, excavations found white (10YR 8/1) sand. According to topographic maps of the area,
this would mean that the dark sand should be near mean sea level.

Concrete Pad Features
Three concrete pads, each measuring 3 by 3 feet and 1 foot deep and featuring rebar extending from the
upper surface were identified. These may have been related to Morgan Hall, although they were located
outside of the footprint of the building. Topographic maps and available aerial photographs do not appear
to show any other structures in the area prior to the construction of Morgan Hall (USDA 1952; USGS 1930).

Posts and Beam Feature
A small number of buried features were also identified in the East Plant excavations. A large wooden beam
was recovered from a possible buried O Horizon (Figure 70). The beam, which measured 8 x 8 inches by
11 feet long, featured a metal spike 6 inches from one end. This spike featured a portion of a threading such
that a bolt or machinery might be attached to the beam (Figure 71).
Approximately 16.5 feet east of this beam, two posts were set 11.5 feet below the surface (Figure 72). Both
were sheared off during excavation, so it was not possible to identify the original upper surface. One portion
of a post could be measured and had a diameter of 9 inches. The posts were 8 feet apart. Finally, another
beam was located under the north wall of the excavation area. Measuring 5 feet long and 1 foot square, this
beam was also oriented north-south approximately 13 feet below the surface.
It was not clear how or if these posts and beams were related to each other, though no other wooden
architecture was encountered within the East Plant excavation. It is possible that these are remains from a
wooden pier or dock which was once located in the area.

East Plant/Morgan Hall Artifacts
A small number of possibly historic artifacts were encountered within the first 3.5 feet of light brown sand.
Historical artifacts and some features were more common within the dark, buried O Horizon. Bottles,
ceramics, shoe fragments, slate fragments, brick fragments, and wood fragments were present throughout
the area. Concentrations increased on the western and southern side of the excavation area.
A total of 82 bottles were recorded, and these provide excellent temporal control for the stratum (Figure
73). Bottles dated to the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but stop around the second quarter of
the twentieth century. Machine-made bottles were common, but were not the exclusive component of the
assemblage, suggesting a date range that includes both the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
Numerous bottles featured volume measurements embossed on the surface, dating them to later than 1913
(SHA 2014). Out of the 82 documented bottles, none were embossed FEDERAL LAW FORBIDS SALE OR REUSE OF THIS BOTTLE, which would date liquor bottles to later than 1934 (SHA 2014). While this is not
positive evidence for an early date, it strongly suggests that artifact deposition stopped before the end of
Prohibition.
The east end of the island and the area north of the East Plant location once featured rail lines and a
petroleum facility, but the area around the East Plant itself was swampy (USGS 1930; Rosenberg Library
2015). It is likely that structures in the area were ephemeral. In 1909, the area was utilized as a trash dump
for the City of Galveston, though the unsanitary conditions proved unacceptable to Galveston residents
(Rosenberg Library 2015). The O Horizon and historic debris identified within the East Plant excavations
likely resulted from this generalized dumping.

In 1929, the populace approved a bond measure funding a filling project to accompany the newly

few structures had been constructed east of 6th Street (USDA 1952; Rosenberg Library 2015). It appears
the deposits within the East Plant excavation area conform to this series of events, with trash refuse overlaid

Summary of Field Investigations
Historic archaeological deposits and features were encountered within the sub-street excavations associated
with the DHCP. No prehistoric cultural resources were identified during excavation. Historic deposits
included isolated artifacts, portions of historic period street surfacing, and portions of historic
utilities/infrastructure.

Drainage Features
Excavations west of the seawall revealed the remains of an extensive, but varying, network of pre-1900
street drainage features. These were distinguished based on the direction the streets were running. Northsouth streets, such as 12th and 11th Streets, featured drainage troughs constructed of multiple planks on the
base and short plank sidewalls.
At cross-street intersections, these troughs became taller, with added steps and layers. The presence of
multiple trough layers at intersections remains an enigma. In the case of Bore Pit 1 Plank Feature 1, the
lower trough did not connect with the rest of the drainage network, whereas at the west side of 12th Street,
the second level was above the main trough. These multi-level constructions may have been utilized to
stabilize the cross-street portions of the drains, as these would need to support the weight of vehicles and
animals. The open drains were supplemented by closed conduits such as that which crosses east-west across
12th Street (Plank Feature 2). These conduits have been recorded elsewhere on the island and have been
suggested to be a fairly common occurrence (Moore 1999:65).
On east-west running streets, the drainage features were much more ephemeral. In some cases, brick curbs
(see Bore Pits 1, 3, and 4) would have served to route water along streets and towards the more substantial
north-south drainages. In other cases (see Bore Pits 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the only demarcation between roads
and house plots were thin, short planks. These may have been placed in addition to open, unlined trenches,
as appears to be the case in Bore Pit 2.
Domestic structures likely routed rain and wastewater into the drainage network, such as with the drainage
features in the Bridge A excavations. This practice has been documented historically, and was one of the
prime motivators for the construction of a belowground sewage system (McComb 1986:100).

Street Surfacing
Excavations encountered a number of different types of street surfacing across the extent of excavations.
At the 12th Street Open Cut, evidence identified along the center of the street suggested the presence of
wooden block paving that was common throughout Galveston at the turn of the twentieth century (Moore
1985; McComb 1986). No intact sections of wooden paving were recovered and the area appears to have
been disturbed.
Brick paving was encountered in several areas, as well. At Bridge A, the brick paving extended over a large
area and appeared to be a substantial sidewalk or driveway. At Bore Pits 1 and 1A, bricks were used to
create small sidewalks. Possible brick paving was also encountered within the small excavation around the
water main at the 12th Street Open Cut. In all, brick paving does not appear to be commonly employed
within the project area. No large sections of brick road surfacing were encountered within any of the streets.

The most commonly encountered intact road surface was a thick layer of shell. The shell road surface was
best preserved on Mechanic Street, where an area towards the center of the street was paved with up to 4
inches of crushed shell. Small amounts of shell were also encountered close to the historical surface within
bore pits along Market Street, though these may have been washed in from other, surrounding areas. Of
note, several areas of Market Street also exhibited varying concentrations of crushed brick. Though this
may represent an ad hoc attempt at road paving, it is possible that it, too, was washed into the street from
elsewhere. Shell paving was also encountered below the sidewalk at Bore Pit 1A, alongside sections of
brick paving.

Evidence of the 1903â1911 Grade Raising
Excavation areas west of the original seawall contained a uniform Stratum 1. This included the excavations
on 6th Street, 12th Street, Mechanic Street, Bore Pits 1 through 8, and Bore Pit 10. Stratum 1 consisted of
1 to 8.5 feet of strong brown to pinkish gray (7.5YR 4/6 to 6/2) sandy lamina. This stratum overlaid historic
features including early street surfaces, historic drains, historic curbs, and layers of crushed brick and
historic debris that may be remains from the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. Both historic and modern street
features overlay Stratum 1, including modern asphalt and concrete street surfaces, electrical conduits (see
Bore Pit 10), and the remains of the 1905-1930s streetcar network (see Bore Pits 2, 3, and 4).
Stratum 1 also conforms to the descriptions of the grade raising provided by historic sources (Davis 1981;
McComb 1986; Wright-Gidley and Marines 2008), with the depth of the historic fill being greatest near the
seawall, and dropping as it neared the center of the city. The presence of a distinct fill within Bore Pit 9
may be due to the relationship of that pit to the grade raising canal which once ran through the area. The
lamina present in many parts of Stratum 1 were likely caused as water-borne dredge fill was pumped across
each grade raising block.
In studies of the historic street surfaces of the central business district, the presence of tan sands associated
with the grade-raising program were noted; however, other fill events were noted that were associated with
grading street surfaces (Moore 1999:50). Non-street excavations at Bridge A showed similar layers of fill
outside of the streets, suggesting that these two events may be similar fill events with little time between
them.
Other evidence of activities associated with the 1903â1911 grade raising was found within deeper
excavations at Bore Pit 9. The presence of a deeply buried wooden wall (Plank Feature 1) and historic
artifacts, along with possible evidence of another wooden feature 80 feet to the east identified only during
the boring operation and documented in the bore returns only), conform to descriptions of the grade raising
canal which circled the east end of the island. This canal was utilized to bring dredge fill from Galveston
Bay inland on steam dredges, where it could then be pumped out into the heart of the city.

Fill Event East of the Galveston Seawall ca. 1925
East of the 1904 seawall at the 6th Street Open Cut, Bore Pits 11 through 13, and the East Plant, excavations
encountered several feet of more recent historic fill unassociated with the 1903â1911 Galveston grade
raising. Excavations at the bore pits on Market Street encountered between 3 to 5 feet of brown (7.5YR
4/4) sand. Below this, some excavations encountered gray sand. A dark horizon of very dark gray (10YR
3/1) sand was universally located between 6 and 12 feet below the surface; this horizon appears to represent
an historic surface where historic debris accumulated. Bottles from this horizon date from the late
nineteenth to the middle of the twentieth century. This appears to correspond with the extension of the
seawall to Fort San Jacinto in the early 1920s and the subsequent land reclamation and grade raising of the
area (McComb 1986:140).

This later grade raising is not well documented, but based on maps and photographs of the area, it appears
that, historically, some areas were lower than others in the zone east of the seawall. Throughout the
nineteenth century, the topography of the east end of the island changed multiple times (Freeman and
Hannum 1991). This may have led these areas to be in-filled at different times. An 1856 map shows the
area to be relatively dry (Bache 1856).
During the Civil War, a rail line extended east along the route of Market Street out to several forts on the
east end of the island (United States War Department 1895: Plate 38). However, an 1875 hurricane washed
out a huge area on the east end of the island, cutting a channel up to 3.5 feet deep in the area between 10th
and 8th Streets (Freeman and Hannum 1991:26).
In 1909, the eastern tidal flats were utilized as a dump by city residents. Even after the construction of the
Fort San Jacinto seawall extension, the area nearer to the East Plant excavation was still depicted as marshy
into the 1930s (USGS 1930). By 1929, the swampy and unsanitary conditions, as well as the desire for
more developable land, led the residents of Galveston to approve of a bond measure to begin filling of a
portion of the eastern end of the island behind the 1921 seawall extension, a project that was completed in
1931 (Rosenberg Library 2015). The process was slow, and the entire area was not filled at the same time.
Even into the 1950s, most of the east end of the island had not been developed (USDA 1952).
The shifting topography of the east end of the island could also explain why the dates for the historic
artifacts and fill appear at different times. The 1875 destruction of the east end of the island may also explain
why historical deposits on the east end of the island do not appear to date prior to the late nineteenth century,
and the 1931 date for the infilling of the east end likely explains the lack of more modern artifacts within
the possible buried O horizon in Bore Pits 11 and 13 and the East Plant excavations. The 1944 date for a
bottle within the same horizon in Bore Pit 12 argues for the piecemeal infilling of east of the original
Galveston seawall.

Evidence of the 1904 Galveston Seawall
Excavation at the 6th Street Open Cut revealed evidence of the original Galveston Seawall, built in 1904 to
protect the island against a repeat of the devastation of the 1900 Galveston Hurricane. A portion of the
seawall was demolished during this project in accordance with the MOA between UTMB, FEMA, TDEM,
and the THC. A Secretary of the Interior Qualified Archaeologist completed documentation of the exposed
portion of the seawall, as well as its demolition, and the resulting photographs and drawings were submitted
as requested by the MOA.
The uncovered portion of the seawall was relatively intact, though the upper surface had been demolished
by previous projects. The remaining dimensions appeared to correspond to those given in documentary
sources on the original seawall construction, including the curved eastern surface and the inclusion of pink
granite aggregate.

CHAPTER 7: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of UTMB and Terracon, SWCA conducted archaeological monitoring of portions of the DHCP
construction in Galveston County, Texas. The work was conducted in compliance with a MOA between
UTMB, FEMA, THC, and TDEM. Under that agreement, FEMA, through TDEM, provided UTMB
assistance for the replacement of a campus-wide heating and cooling pipeline network damaged by
Hurricane Ike in 2008.
The MOA required monitoring of ground disturbing activities connected to open cut utility trenches, boring
pits, the East Plant floodwall, and thermal water storage tanks. SWCA conducted this monitoring in
accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) and its implementing regulations 36 CFR 800,
and the Antiquities Code of Texas, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6482.
Additionally, the MOA required UTMB to document historic resources in the project area that would be
affected by the project, including the dormitories, Morgan Hall, and Nolan Hall, scheduled for demolition
for the East Plant construction. Terracon completed this documentation in a separate investigation, not
included within this investigation or report.
The current investigation included an archaeological background literature and records review along with
monitoring of excavation areas during the course of construction on an extensive, deeply buried utilities
pipeline. In cases where unanticipated features or artifacts were encountered, work in the area stopped
immediately while an SWCA archaeologist documented these finds. Findings were then relayed to THC
and FEMA archaeologists, who assisted in determinations of significance and the future course of action.
Between April 4, 2013 and February 14, 2014, a Secretary of the Interior Qualified Archaeologist (as
defined by 36 CFR 61) from SWCA monitored all excavations associated with construction of the DHCP.
After that point, FEMA clarified the demands of the MOA, such that UTMB was only required to monitor
certain, limited ground disturbing activities. As such, monitoring was conducted sporadically between April
7 and October 17, 2014, though SWCA remained on-call, in case the project encountered any previously
unrecorded discoveries or developed unanticipated effects.
Historic archaeological deposits and features were encountered within the sub-street excavations associated
with the DHCP. No prehistoric cultural resources were identified during excavation. Historic deposits
included isolated artifacts, portions of historic-period street surfacing, and portions of historic
utilities/infrastructure. These archaeological deposits constituted only a portion of the extensive historic
street network of Galveston, which stretches across much of the eastern end of Galveston Island. Similar
features have been encountered in street excavations across the island and appear to be ubiquitous and
unexceptional. They embodied no distinctive characteristics, had no known association with significant
historic individuals, and were unlikely to yield further information about the history of the area. In
consultation with the THC and FEMA archaeologists, these features and deposits were considered as
isolated finds NOT ELIGIBLE for the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.
In addition, the DHCP route crossed a portion of the NRHP-listed 1904 Galveston Seawall. A buried portion
of the wall was identified during excavation. SWCA archaeologists undertook an extensive documentation
of the exposed portion of the seawall and monitored and documented the demolition of a small portion of
the wall, in accordance with the MOA. In consultation with THC and FEMA archaeologists, no further
work is recommended within this area of the 1904 Galveston Seawall at this time.
