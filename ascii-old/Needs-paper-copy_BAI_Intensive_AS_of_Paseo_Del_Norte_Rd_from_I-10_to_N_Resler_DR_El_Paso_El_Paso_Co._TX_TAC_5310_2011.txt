In June 2009, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. conducted an intensive archeological survey
of Paseo Del Norte Road from 1,400 feet west of North Desert Boulevard to Northwestern Drive, as well
as an approximately 1,300-foot extension of Paso Del Norte Road from Northwestern Drive to North
Resler Drive in the City of El Paso, El Paso County, Texas (CSJ: 0924-06-343). Survey efforts discovered
no archeological resources. Based on the survey results, as well as the soil and geologic conditions in the
study area, Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommend that the proposed construction should be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional archeological investigations, as the proposed construction would
not affect any archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.4(d)) or State Archeological Landmarks (13
TAC 26.12). This was a non-collection survey. Curation was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey of Paseo Del Norte Road from IH 10 to North
Resler Drive in the City of El Paso, El Paso County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: At the request of Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., and on behalf of the
Texas Department of Transportation’s El Paso District and the City of El Paso, Blanton & Associates,
Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive archeological survey with judgmental shovel testing of the existing
Paseo Del Norte Road from 1,400 feet west of North Desert Boulevard to North Desert Boulevard, as
well as a proposed 1,300-foot long extension of Paseo Del Norte from North Desert Boulevard to North
Resler Drive.
The existing Paseo Del Norte Road right-of-way (ROW) is 120 feet wide with a 90-foot wide four-lane
divided road consisting of a two-lane 33-foot wide eastbound roadway, a 24-foot wide raised concrete
median, and a two-lane 33-foot wide westbound roadway (Figure 3). The road has no shoulders. The
ROW for the proposed improvements to the existing Paseo Del Norte Road from 1,400 west of
Northwestern Drive to Northwestern Drive would remain 120 feet wide and contain a four-lane divided
road 90 feet wide. The eastbound roadway would be reconfigured to contain a two-foot wide gutter, two
12-foot wide travel lanes, and a seven-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound and westbound
roadways would be a 24-foot wide raised concrete median. On the south side of the eastbound roadway
would be a 0.5 foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot wide bike
and hike trail. The westbound roadway would contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel
lanes, and a seven-foot wide shoulder. North of the westbound lanes would be a 0.5 foot wide curb, as
well as a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk with 5.5 feet of
clear space between the sidewalk and the northern edge of the proposed ROW.
The proposed ROW for the extension of Paseo Del Norte Road from Northwestern Drive to North Resler
Drive would be 120 feet wide. There were two roadway build alternatives that were investigated for the
proposed construction. Alternative #1 would consist of a 90-foot wide four-lane road. The eastbound
roadway would be configured to contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes, and a
seven-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound and westbound roadways would be a 24-foot wide
raised concrete median. On the south side of the eastbound roadway would be a 0.5 foot wide curb, a
four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot wide bike and hike trail. The westbound
roadway would contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes, and a seven-foot wide
shoulder. North of the westbound lanes would be a 0.5 curb, as well as a four-foot wide strip between the
curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk with 5.5 feet of clear space between the sidewalk and the
northern edge of the proposed ROW.
Alternative #2 would consist of an 86-foot wide road. The eastbound roadway would be configured with a
two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes and a 10-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound
and westbound roadways would be a 14-foot wide raised concrete. On the south side of the eastbound
roadway would be one 0.5 foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot.
wide bike and hike trail. The westbound roadway would be configured with a two-foot wide gutter, two

12-foot wide travel lanes and a 10-foot wide shoulder. North of the westbound roadway would contain a
0.5 foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk.
In order to accommodate the reconstructed intersection at Paseo Del Norte Road and Northwestern Drive,
the proposed improvements would require reconstruction of portions of Northwestern Drive within the
existing ROW from 240 feet south of Paseo Del Norte Road to Paseo Del Norte Road, and from about
200 feet north of Paseo Del Norte Road to Paseo Del Norte Road. The new construction on Northwestern
Drive would consist of two 12-foot travel lanes in each direction with 8-foot shoulders, all within the
existing 90-foot wide ROW. Temporary construction easements are proposed north and south of the
proposed new location section of Paseo Del Norte Road for grading purposes. These temporary easements
total 0.6 acre.
Alternative #1 was chosen for the planned construction and the overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) for
this project is therefore approximately 2,700 feet long, a maximum of 120 feet wide, and encompasses
approximately 8.0 acres. Based on typical construction practices, the maximum depth of impacts for
roadway improvements would extend three feet or less below ground surface. For culvert replacements,
the maximum depth of impacts would extend 10 feet or less below the existing ground surface.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is in the City of El Paso just east of the IH 10/Paseo Del
Norte intersection on the Canutillo, TX (3106-344) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 8.0 acres.
DATES OF WORK: Pre-field tasks (e.g., completion of a scope of work and Texas Antiquities Permit
application) involved eight person-hours. Field investigations involved 30 person-hours on June 15 and
16, 2009 and July 11, 2009. Report production (including maps) involved 39 person-hours.
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 5310
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
PROJECT ARCHEOLOGIST: Mark D. Willis
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None
COMMENTS: The survey indicated that the Paseo Del Norte APE is deflated thereby lacking intact
soils. Previous disturbances to the APE include surface and subsurface utilities, erosion, and adjacent
housing development construction. Surface investigations in the APE discovered no traces of prehistoric
or historic archeological material. Because of those conditions, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little
to no potential for previously unidentified archeological resources to be impacted by the proposed

construction. Based on the above data, B&A recommends that there is little to no potential for the APE to
contain previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC
26.12). B&A further recommends that the planned construction should not affect any archeological
historic properties (36 CFR 800.4(d)) or SALs and the proposed construction should be allowed to
proceed as planned without additional archeological investigations.

I NT R ODUC T I ON
On June 15 and 16, 2009 and July 11, 2009 at the request of Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., and on
behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s El Paso District and the City of El Paso, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive archeological survey of the existing Paseo Del Norte Road
from 1,400 feet west of North Desert Boulevard to North Desert Boulevard, as well as a proposed 1,300foot long extension of Paseo Del Norte from North Desert Boulevard to North Resler Drive. The linear
project area is in northwest El Paso near the community of Bordertown, Texas and west of the Franklin
Mountains (Figures 1 and 2).
The existing Paseo Del Norte Road right-of-way (ROW) is 120 feet wide with a 90-foot wide four-lane
divided road consisting of a two-lane 33-foot wide eastbound roadway, a 24-foot wide raised concrete
median, and a two-lane 33-foot wide westbound roadway (Figure 3). The road has no shoulders. The
ROW for the proposed improvements to the existing Paseo Del Norte Road from 1,400 west of
Northwestern Drive to Northwestern Drive would remain 120 feet wide and contain a four-lane divided
road 90 feet wide. The eastbound roadway would be reconfigured to contain a two-foot wide gutter, two
12-foot wide travel lanes, and a seven-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound and westbound
roadways would be a 24-foot wide raised concrete median. On the south side of the eastbound roadway
would be a 0.5-foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot wide bike
and hike trail. The westbound roadway would contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel
lanes, and a seven-foot wide shoulder. North of the westbound lanes would be a 0.5-foot wide curb, as
well as a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk with 5.5 feet of
clear space between the sidewalk and the northern edge of the proposed ROW.
The proposed ROW for the extension of Paseo Del Norte Road from Northwestern Drive to North Resler
Drive would be 120 feet wide. There were two roadway build alternatives that were investigated for the
proposed construction. Alternative #1 would consist of a 90-foot wide four-lane road. The eastbound
roadway would be configured to contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes, and a
seven-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound and westbound roadways would be a 24-foot wide
raised concrete median. On the south side of the eastbound roadway would be a 0.5-foot wide curb, a
four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot wide bike and hike trail. The westbound
roadway would contain a two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes, and a seven-foot wide
shoulder. North of the westbound lanes would be a 0.5-foot wide curb, as well as a four-foot wide strip
between the curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk with 5.5 feet of clear space between the
sidewalk and the northern edge of the proposed ROW.
Alternative #2 would consist of an 86-foot wide road. The eastbound roadway would be configured with a
two-foot wide gutter, two 12-foot wide travel lanes and a 10-foot wide shoulder. Separating the eastbound
and westbound roadways would be a 14-foot wide raised concrete. On the south side of the eastbound
roadway would be one 0.5-foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed 10-foot
wide bike and hike trail. The westbound roadway would be configured with a two-foot wide gutter, two
12-foot wide travel lanes and a 10-foot wide shoulder. North of the westbound roadway would contain a
0.5-foot wide curb, a four-foot wide strip between the curb and a proposed five-foot wide sidewalk.

In order to accommodate the reconstructed intersection at Paseo Del Norte Road and Northwestern Drive,
the proposed improvements would require reconstruction of portions of Northwestern Drive within the
existing ROW from 240 feet south of Paseo Del Norte Road to Paseo Del Norte Road, and from about
200 feet north of Paseo Del Norte Road to Paseo Del Norte Road. The new construction on Northwestern
Drive would consist of two 12-foot travel lanes in each direction with 8-foot wide shoulders, all within
the existing 90-foot wide ROW. Temporary construction easements are proposed north and south of the
proposed new location section of Paseo Del Norte Road for grading purposes. These temporary easements
total 0.6 acre.
Alternative #1 was chosen for the planned construction and the overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) for
this project is therefore approximately 2,700 feet long, a maximum of 120 feet wide, and encompasses
approximately 8.0 acres. Based on typical construction practices, the maximum depth of impacts for
roadway improvements would extend three feet or less below ground surface. For culvert replacements,
the maximum depth of impacts would extend 10 feet or less below the existing ground surface.
As the proposed construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed
in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas must identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) through
survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. Furthermore, as the
project would utilize funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the project is also subject
to the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. All work will be conducted in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the
FHWA, TxDOT, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (TXSHPO), the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings
(PA-TU), as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC).
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all cultural resources discovered within the proposed APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for
nomination to the National Register Historic Places (NRHP) or for formal SAL designation, and should
significant cultural resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management
options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.
Prior to field investigations, eight person-hours were necessary to conduct an archeological background
review and prepare an appropriate scope of work and a Texas Antiquities Permit application for submittal
to the THC. The intensive survey with judgmental shovel testing took 30 person-hours and was conducted
by Project Archeologist Mark D. Willis on June 15 and 16, 2009 and July 11, 2009. Post-field document
and map production required 39 person-hours. All investigations were completed under Texas Antiquities

Permit No. 5310 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young. There were no artifacts and curation
was unnecessary.
The remainder of this document proceeds from a discussion of the environmental conditions in the APE
to a synthesis of the region’s cultural history, which is followed by a review of previously recorded
archeological sites within a 1,000-meter wide radius of the APE. From previously recorded sites, the
document proceeds to a discussion of archeological methods utilized during investigations followed by
the results of survey investigations. The report concludes with a summary and recommendations chapter.

The proposed project is located in the Hueco Bolson of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and
Range Province. The Bolson is characterized by intermontane basins separating north-south trending
mountain ranges. The APE traverses the nearly level to undulating basin west of the Franklin Mountains
(Figures 4 and 5). The Hueco Bolson contains numerous fault line depressions that have been commonly
referred to as playas. This is a misleading conception because most of the depressions do not retain
surface water for long periods rather they retain ground water for short periods of time following periods
of heavy rain. Ground surface visibility throughout the APE averages approximately 70 percent.

Norte Road. The Franklin Mountains are in the background.

Geology of the study location consist of Young Quaternary (Holocene) sandy and silty colluvium and
alluvial fan deposits originating from the Franklin Mountains east of the APE (Barnes 1983). There is a
potential for these sediments to contain archeological resources.
SOI L S
Soils in the APE consist of Bluepoint association, rolling, and the Delnorte-Canutio association,
undulating. The Bluepoint association, rolling, developed over outwash sediments that have been affected
by eolian processes. The soil is loamy fine sand that extends to a depth of at least 150 centimeters below
ground surface (Jaco 1971). Only a small area of this soil is in the APE at the intersection of Paseo Del
Norte Road and I-10 near the western project terminus. Due to the soil being disturbed by surface and
subsurface utilities and roadway construction at the intersection, there is little to no potential for the
western end of the APE to contain archeological resources.

More than 90 percent of the APE contains upland soils of the Delnorte-Canutio association, undulating,
which consist of very gravelly loam to very gravely sandy loam extending to at least 115 centimeters
below ground surface or very gravelly loam from 0 to 15 centimeters overlying caliche. The soils
developed from outwash sediments (Jaco 1971).
V E G E T A T I ON
It is believed that the Hueco Bolson originally supported semidesert grasslands prior to overgrazing since
the eighteenth century. Modern flora is described as a Mesquite/Broom snakeweed association. The
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) forms coppice dunes that rise from the desert floor from 0.5 to 2.0 meters
above the general terrain. Four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescans) is usually associated with these dunal
formations. Interdunal areas support broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and Sporobolis spp. Less
dominant vegetation forms within the project area are creosote (Larrea tridentate), yucca (Yucca elata),
and prickly pear (Oppuntia spp.). The project area is predominantly vegetated with creosote and yucca.

The overall cultural region was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) in his study of the Jornada Branch of
the Mogollon. Because no historic archeological material was discovered during the survey, this
discussion is limited to a summary of the commonly accepted prehistoric and Contact-era periods and
phases of occupation in the Jornada and adjacent regions.
PA L E OI NDI A N
Lithic artifacts found in the area suggest that early occupations in the El Paso area date to the late
Pleistocene/early Holocene between approximately 10,000 and 6000 B.C., although MacNeish's (1991)
work at Pendejo Cave suggests evidence of earlier occupations. Diagnostic point types of later and betterdocumented periods found within the El Paso area, such as Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and Plainview (all
dated from other regional contexts) provide strong support for late Pleistocene occupations (Whalen 1977,
1978). Unfortunately, natural processes have either buried or destroyed most archeological evidence from
this time period, and therefore, relatively little is known about late Pleistocene lifeways in the El Paso
area. Based on comparative evidence from archeological sites of the same period in other areas, the
general social and economic organization of Late Pleistocene populations appears to be characterized by
small, mobile bands subsisting predominantly on large game supplemented with the utilization of wild
plant resources (Cordell 1984, Carmichael 1986a).
AR C HAI C
Evidence of increasing cultural complexity among the prehistoric inhabitants of the El Paso area is based
on the excavations of relatively well-preserved Archaic period cave sites dating from 6000 to 2300 B.C.
in the mountain region (MacNeish 1989a, 1991; Phillips 1990). Archeologists have found evidence of
basketry, bone and woodworking, including the introduction of the atlatl, which demonstrates an increase
in technological complexity. Additionally, the recovery of possible digging sticks as well as groundstone,
important in plant processing, combined with palynological evidence for increased reliance on plant
products suggest that people in the area experimented with horticulture and plant domestication by the
second or first millennium B.C.
MacNeish (1989a, 1989b, 1991) proposed that the Archaic period should be subdivided into four separate
phases. The Gardner Springs phase (ca. 6000±500 to 4300±300 B.C.) is characterized as a “simple
scheduled seasonal-round settlement pattern organized around a few very small groups. In essence, these
Archaic people were probably foragers engaged in hunting, animal collecting or trapping, and plant
collecting” (MacNeish 1991:685). People lived mainly in small ephemeral camps on the desert floor or
around the playas there, with a few living in mountain rock shelters such as Fresnal shelter.
The Keystone phase (ca. 4300±300 to 2500±200 B.C.) is proposed as an outgrowth of the Gardner
Springs phase, with a continuation of small, microband camps and task force sites but with the notable
addition of large pithouse sites such as the Keystone Dam Site (O’Laughlin 1980) along the Rio Grande.
These sites appear to have been occupied during winter, but they may also have been bases for excursions
into other microenvironments during the spring, summer, and fall. MacNeish notes that this period

INTENSIVE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF PASEO DEL NORTE ROAD FROM I-10 TO NORTH RESLER DRIVE

9

“reveals a subtle shift toward a more efficient desert foraging subsistence system as well as a possible
exploitation of more desert plants from more ecozones” (MacNeish 1989b:689). This may correspond to a
shift in the Chihuahuan Desert fauna and flora.
The Fresnal phase (ca. 2500±200 to 900±150 B.C.) is coeval with the introduction of early maize into the
Southwest and reflects fundamental changes in prehistoric lifeways. There was a substantial increase in
the number of sites, including many more and larger sites in the Rio Grande Valley and desert floor/playa
areas. The phase is characterized by MacNeish (1991:691) as possibly having year-around occupations
where the sites served as base camps for a radial rather than a calendar-round system. The early evidence
of horticulture includes maize and squash but not beans, which are known to be essential for their
complementary amino acids; however, in this low desert region along the Rio Grande, tornillo or
mesquite seeds may have satisfied this need (Schroeder 1974).
During the Hueco phase (ca. 900±150 B.C. to A.D. 200±100), people lived in seasonal microband or
taskforce occupations but with larger and probably more numerous pithouse sites that may have served as
winter villages (Carmichael 1986b, O’Laughlin 1980). The ephemeral sites include new site types such as
rock-roasting pits that indicate harvest and preparation of leaf succulents (Carmichael 1986b, O’Laughlin
1980, O’Laughlin et al. 1988). Faunal remains from sites indicate an increase in rabbit bones over large
game, and the remains include fish and turtle for the first time. MacNeish (1991:695, 697) characterizes
this phase as a trend toward larger and more numerous base camps occurring in a broader area. The
village settlement in the later Mesilla and El Paso phases apparently developed out of this shift toward
sedentism made possible by the adoption of horticulture. Mauldin et al. (1994), Burgett et al. (1995), and
O’Laughlin et al. (1988) have excavated pithouses that are associated with this phase. The sites have
occasionally contained brownware ceramics, although associations with the structures have not been
definitively verified.
M E SI L L A PH A SE
The introduction of ceramics around the first century A.D. denotes the beginning of the Mesilla phase,
first defined by Lehmer (1948). Characteristic of the Mesilla phase is the production of El Paso
Brownware, a plain earthenware ceramic type. This development is accompanied by larger and more
permanent pithouse settlements (MacNeish 1989a, 1989b; O’Laughlin 1980; Whalen 1977). Until near
the end of the Mesilla Phase (about A.D. 1000), people sometimes lived in pithouse clusters ranging from
15 to 50 or more structures. Though population density remains low, a significant change in social
organization appears to have occurred, with small, mobile bands gradually adapting to a more sedentary
lifestyle. Evidence from neighboring areas suggests that the emphasis on horticulture continued to grow
throughout this time period. The presence of pottery types from the Mimbres Valley of southwestern New
Mexico in the El Paso area indicates that long-distance material and information exchanges were
occurring between the prehistoric inhabitants of these two regions by approximately A.D. 750 to 950. The
presence of shells from the Pacific Coast supplements the evidence for external contact. The proliferation
of trade and shifts in settlement patterns may indicate increasingly sedentary populations with a growing
dependence on horticulture (Cordell 1984).

Foster (1988), Carmichael (1986a; personal communication from D. Carmichael to J. Peterson 1995), and
Gerald (1959) have excavated pithouse structures dating within this time frame along the Rio Grande
Valley margin. Of these, only the Keystone escarpment sites (Carmichael 1985) contained more than a
single pithouse structure on a particular site. It appears that during the Mesilla Phase in the west El Paso
region, isolated pithouse structures constitute the prehistoric habitations along the river zone. This has
also been demonstrated on the basin floor zones (Mauldin et al. 1994, O’Laughlin et al. 1988.)
DOÑA A NA PH A SE
Lehmer (1948) proposed a transitional Doña Ana phase to describe the period of adjustment from
pithouse to pueblo settlement in the Jornada Mogollon region. Carmichael (1986a) presented evidence for
this phase based on a survey of the Doña Ana Range and Fort Bliss in the Tularosa Basin. In Carmichael's
survey area, both decorated and undecorated El Paso Brownwares were found along with contemporary,
non-local, decorated ceramics dating to the mid-Formative period, but there are insufficient fine-grained
chronometric data from good contexts to define the period. The phase is analogous to similar transitional
phases proposed for the Mimbres region to the west and the Reserve−Tularosa region to the north. There
is clearly a florescence of population and settlement systems in the El Paso area from the end of the
Mesilla phase through the El Paso phase that appears to have corresponding development in the Mimbres
and the Casas Grandes regions.
Recent excavations of the Sandcliffe site in Sunland Park, New Mexico, at a small Doña Ana Phase
village along the Rio Grande Valley found El Paso Bichrome and Polychromes along with the
introduction of numerous types of trade wares. The excavations have also revealed that hunting and
gathering still appear to be the predominant subsistence pattern rather than horticulture. Predominant
remains uncovered in association with the Doña Ana Phase village consist of tornillo seeds and various
faunal remains associated with the river. Investigations at the Meyer Pithouse Village (Peterson et al.

1986, Scarborough and Wilcox 1991).

The elaboration of ceramic technology, as indicated by the introduction of new, locally produced ceramic
types such as El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome (Hill 1990a, 1990b) as well as the appearance
of new architectural forms marks the beginning of the El Paso Phase, dating from approximately
A.D. 1050 to 1375 (Lehmer 1948). Large, 100- to 200-room pueblos such as Hot Wells, Escondido,
Worley, Cottonwood Springs, Alamogordo Site 1 (House 2), and Indian Tank occur in alluvial fan and
riverine settings. The architecture of the largest villages consists of surface or semi-subterranean linear
roomblocks, multiple rows of parallel roomblocks, or U-shaped or enclosed plaza structures of adobe or
masonry construction. The introduction of this pueblo-style architecture is accompanied by further
evidence for significant increases in population density, intraregional and interregional exchange, and
sociopolitical complexity (Lehmer 1948). Concomitant increases in the sociopolitical complexity of other
regional communities in the Mimbres Valley to the north and at Casas Grandes to the south may indicate
that these areas were playing a role in these cultural changes (Di Peso 1974).

While there are clearly stylistic and settlement similarities with Pueblo groups to the north in New
Mexico, the pueblo occupation of the El Paso area shares at least as much affinity with systems described
from northern Chihuahua and western Texas as documented in the La Junta and Guadalupe Mountains
areas (Kelly 1949a, 1949b, 1952, 1953; Mallouf and Tunnell 1977; Phillips 1990; Sebastian and Larralde
1989). Also, as several investigators have proposed, the pueblo settlements of El Paso do not appear to
have been fully dependent on horticutural subsistence. The occupants apparently practiced a wide range
of subsistence activities (MacNeish 1989a, 1989b; Carmichael 1986b; O’Laughlin and Martin 1990;
Whalen 1977, 1978). Excavations of El Paso Phase pueblos on the west side of El Paso near the Rio
Grande Valley verify a wide range of subsistence practices (Bradley 1983, Scarborough 1985). In this
regard they may have taken a different trajectory toward sedentary village life than elsewhere in the
Southwest (MacNeish 1989a:695).
In contrast to the pueblos of the northern Rio Grande Valley, rancherías appear to have been the
settlement of choice in the lower Rio Grande Valley and south along the Rio Grande from El Paso. These
smaller, probably seasonal, settlements documented along the river by Spanish accounts have been found
“on the banks of the river” as “distinct groups of jacales” (Kelly 1952:273). Other accounts appear to
have distinguished rancherías from the more permanent pueblos situated on the mesas at La Junta and
recorded settlements at arroyo mouths and springs along stretches of the river, which would not otherwise
have provided floodplain settlement opportunities.
By A.D. 1375, the populations of the Hueco Bolson and El Paso area exhibited an abrupt shift in
socioeconomic strategies, with a dispersed, hunting-and-gathering lifestyle replacing the previous
horticulturally oriented, aggregated village (Brethauer 1977; Whalen 1977, 1978; O’Laughlin and Martin
1990). Though the cause for this subsistence shift is poorly understood, an extended period of drought
during this time period or a shift in relationship between hunter-gatherer and farming populations could
be involved. Whatever the cause, a relatively dispersed hunting and gathering lifestyle prevailed in the
desert regions of far west Texas until historic times, although some pueblos were present in the Rio
Grande Valley.
The normative cultural chronology for the region, embodied particularly in Lehmer's Jornada Mogollon
Branch, was originally based on the distribution of El Paso Polychrome, Lincoln Black-on-red, and Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta ceramics (Lehmer 1948:71). The boundaries of these distributions have since
been found to be much more extensive, especially to the east and south. Furthermore, the range of
settlement types by period of occupation also appears to be much broader than originally proposed. With
the wealth of recent and finer-grained data, the Jornada Mogollon Branch, similar to its precursor as
proposed by Haury for western New Mexico and eastern Arizona (1956), may be ripe for a heuristic
overhaul.
The El Paso Phase was proposed to extend to A.D. 1450 by Lehmer and others. This date is commonly
considered the end of the period, although O’Laughlin (1980:26) states that the El Paso Phase may have
extended to A.D. 1500.

POST -E L PA SO PH A SE
The Post-El Paso Phase spanned the years from A.D. 1450 to 1657, and the occupants of the general area
and their relative utilization of the region remains relatively unknown (see Peterson and Brown 1994).
This time period has been referred to as the Protohistoric period. Prior to 1680, El Paso was utilized
primarily as a river crossing and for temporary settlement (Peterson and Brown 1994:70). However, early
Spanish descriptions of the general area speak of “a valley of swamps extending over eight leagues”
(Walz 1951:2). Earlier Spanish entradas in 1581 and 1583 along with the colonizing expedition of Oñate
in 1598 provided chronicles of the region. However, the first known settlement was the establishment of
Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe in Paso del Norte as a mission for the Manso Indians in 1659.
Mansos were reported to be living north of El Paso in 1630 (Benavides 1966:13-16). Later accounts place
the origin of the Manso at the time of contact with the Spanish in the area of Doña Ana, New Mexico
(Gerald 1974:122). No direct accounts of the Manso were reported in the Upper Valley of El Paso or the
lower Mesilla Valley.
Other Indian groups mentioned from early Spanish accounts through the general area refer to the Suma
Indians (Gerald 1974:69). The group described by Gerald (1974:69) as Suma in the late seventeenth
century lived within “northern Chihuahua, northeastern Sonora, and from present day El Paso down river
about 130 miles to El Cajon.” Gerald (1974:51) notes the Suma Indians to the south of the pass. Like the
Manso, there is no direct historical evidence of the Sumas living in the Upper or Lower Mesilla Valley
during the Mexican or Historic periods.
The Manso population was reported as consisting of small villages of rancherías that are described as
“huts of branches” (Benavides 1966:13). Mansos were also noted to be raw-meat eaters, although Gerald
(1974:118) reports that Bandelier noted some tilling of the land. Gerald (1974:122) concludes that the
Manso were a nomadic group that was probably “related to one of the Rio Grande Pueblo groups,
probably one of the southern Tigua speakers.”
The Suma population was reported in Gerald (1974:74) from Bandelier and Naylor as living in flimsy
brush structures called jacales that were covered with skins in the winter. The Suma quickly adapted to
Spanish cultural practices (Gerald 1974:74). Gerald (1974:80) also states that the Suma practiced a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The Suma Indians were reported as living with the Spanish at the Nuestra
Señora de Guadalupe in present-day Ciudad Juárez by 1659 (Gerald 1974:76). Hendricks documents
Suma as laborers on the Hacienda Santa Bárbara in the eighteenth century (Hendricks 2001).
Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache Indians were reported in the area from as early as the first Spanish
entradas into the region, and possibly from the late prehistoric period. They were Athabaskan speakers
who, along with other groups such as the Utes and Comanches, migrated into the region. Their lifeways
were horticultural as well as nomadic, but they adapted a lifestyle of raiding and high mobility following
the intrusion of the Spanish. This highly resilient lifeway enabled them to coexist with pueblo and
Spanish settlements as well as early Euro-American occupation. By the late 1880s, however, the last of
the Mescalero and Chiricahua Apache Indians were subdued and removed to reservations.

The reported Indian groups present in the El Paso general area by early Spanish invaders were hunters
and gatherers with limited horticultural practices. The archeological remains from these groups were
similar to those described in ethnobiological accounts by Castetter (1935) and Castetter and Opler (1936)
of Indian groups within the Southwest. The remains from processing native American plants were similar
to remains observed in association with most of the prehistoric groups of the area. Hearths, roasting pits,
various structures, and other features would be expected. These remains are common to cultural resources
located throughout the Jornada Mogollon. Unfortunately, few absolute dates have been recorded from the
Post-El Paso Phase, especially along the Rio Grande Valley. An exception is a fire-cracked rock feature
excavated on site 41EP2933 to the east of the Rio Grande. This feature may date to this period or within
the late El Paso Phase.
Tigua, Piro, and other Indian groups would later move into the Lower Valley of El Paso by 1680 and
1682 (Gerald 1974:140) to eventually be absorbed by the Ysleta Mission. They moved into this area
following the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This is the time frame most archeologists refer to as the official start
of the Historic period. This however, does not correspond to the time that initial settlements were
established in present-day Juarez, Chihuahua. The history of the Tiguas within the region is extensive and
reported in detail by Gerald (1974, 1977) and others. They were not reported as utilizing the Upper Valley
area of El Paso, though given their extensive range throughout the Hueco Bolson and south along the Rio
Grande as reported from their hunting ranges (Gerald 1974:65) and somewhat verified from historic finds
in a report (Seebach et al. 1995) of their remains in the Hueco Bolson, it is highly probable that Tiguas
would have extended up into the Upper Valley area of El Paso. This is even a greater possibility given the
Pueblo settlement in the Mesilla Valley at the village of Tortugas.

A review of records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and data available on the
THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any
previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the APE. There are no
historical markers, SALs, cemeteries or sites listed on the NRHP within the APE, though the search
revealed that there are 15 previously recorded sites, one National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)

In 1992, TxDOT recorded prehistoric site 41EP880 about 500 meters due west of the Paseo Del Norte
Road/I-10 intersection on the west side of I-10 prior to proposed roadway improvements on Artcraft
Road. Test excavations were recommended, as the site may have contained the remains of a pit house
(TxDOT 1992). TxDOT archeologists conducted test excavations at 41EP880 during January 3–14, 1994.
Test excavations involved 1 x 1 meter excavation units, backhoe trenches, shovel tests, and soil profiles,
all of which indicated that the surface and subsurface site components in the proposed ROW were
extensive. The eligibility of all of site 41EP880 for inclusion in NHRP or for formal designation as a SAL
was not determined, as the study considered only those portions of the site within the APE. The portion of
the site within the proposed APE was not recommended for inclusion to the NRHP (pursuant to 36 CFR
60.4) or for formal SAL designation (pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8) (Ward and Hickman 1997).
Due west from the Paseo Del Norte Road/I-10 intersection, B&A conducted an intensive archeological
survey of 10.9 miles of I-10 on behalf of TxDOT prior to proposed roadway improvements. No new sites
were discovered and seven previously recorded sites were found to have been destroyed (Willis et al.
2005). There were no sites documented in or near the current APE.
The majority of the previously recorded sites (e.g., 41EP2827 through 41EP2829, 41EP2837, 41EP2933,
41EP2945, 41EP2956, 41EP2958, 41EP2959, 41EP2561 through 41EP2965) within 1,000 meters of the
APE were documented during archeological investigations for Phase II of the Rancho Las
Lomas/Westport Development project (TASA 2009).
In the general area of the above sites is the NRHP-listed O. T. Bassett Tower at 301 Texas Avenue. This
Modernistic 15-story structure was built circa 1930 by Charles N. Bassett in honor of his father O.T.,
Bassett (TASA 2009).

To the west and north of the western terminus of the APE, El Paso Water Utilities sponsored survey
investigations prior to the proposed construction of the Artcraft/Westport/El Paso West Interceptor Relief
System. A total of 50 acres was surveyed and no archeological resources were discovered (Burt 2002).

M E T H ODS
The intensive archeological survey of the project area involved surface investigations of the APE to
determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of all archeological resources. The survey
complied with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's
Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and
the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC
n.d). All field investigations were thoroughly photographed. Surface investigations consisted of a
100 percent pedestrian survey of the APE utilizing a five-meter wide transect interval. Shovel testing was
unnecessary given the APE’s deflated conditions with 100 percent ground surface visibility.
Site recording criteria in the El Paso region is complex due to the high density and variety of
archeological materials. This survey utilized site definition standards conforming to criteria established by
the U.S. Army for their extensive, on-going archeological program on Fort Bliss. These criteria also
include Isolated Occurrences (IOs), which are scattered artifacts not associated with a discernible site.
Had archeological resources been discovered, site documentation would have involved the recording of
the horizontal and vertical extent of any previously unidentified sites within the project area. Site data
would have included a description of the site’s environment, cultural materials observed within the APE,
and observations on the continuance of any site that extended outside of the project area. Sites would
have also been evaluated with respect to their eligibility for listing to the NRHP and for formal
designation as SALs, as per eligibility criteria set forth in NPS regulations 36 CFR 60.4 and Chapter 26.8
of the Antiquities Code of Texas. If site eligibility were uncertain, then further archeological
investigations would have been recommended to determine eligibility. However no sites were found
during this project.

Intensive survey efforts for the proposed improvements to Paseo Del Norte Road discovered no
archeological resources within the APE (Figure 6). Investigations along the existing and proposed Paseo
Del Norte ROW, as well as in the existing Northwestern Drive ROW, revealed little to no soil (ground
surface visibility was excellent, averaging approximately 70 percent) due to naturally deflated conditions
or from mechanical scraping, like the existing Northwestern Drive ROW (Figures 7 and 8). As Figure 8
indicates, the rocky colluvial deposits in the APE have no potential for containing intact surface or
subsurface archeological deposits. Given those conditions, shovel testing was unwarranted. Based on
these data, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain previously
unidentified archeological material.

The survey indicated that the Paseo Del Norte APE is generally deflated and lacks intact soils. Previous
disturbances to the APE include surface and subsurface utilities, erosion, mechanical scraping, and
adjacent housing development construction. Surface investigations in the APE discovered no traces of
historic or prehistoric archeological material. Because of those conditions, it is the opinion of B&A that
there is little to no potential for previously unidentified archeological resources to be impacted by the
proposed construction.
Based on the above data, B&A recommends that there is little to no potential for the APE to contain
previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12).
B&A further recommends that the planned construction should not affect any archeological historic
properties (36 CFR 800.4(d)) or SALs and the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional archeological investigations.
If it is determined that the project requires additional ROW then additional archeological investigations in
those areas would be necessary. In the event that previously unidentified archeological materials are
discovered during construction, work in the immediate area would cease and the City of El Paso and
TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures in accordance
with the aforementioned PA-TU and MOU.
