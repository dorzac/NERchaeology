Chapter 7: Diatoms and Freshwater Sponge Spicules

INTRODUCTION
Diatoms are microscopic, single-celled, photosynthetic algae with silica cell walls
that may be preserved in archeological deposits. Formerly considered members of the
plant kingdom, they are now often classified (along with other organisms such as kelp
and mildew) in the kingdom Chromista. They are also members of the phylum
Bacillariophyta. Although most archeologists probably think of diatoms and other forms
of algae as aquatic organisms, they also live in terrestrial environments that are
sufficiently damp, and in fact about half of the diatoms counted in the bench samples are
from species that can be found in either submerged or terrestrial habitats. Aerophilic
species are motile and can move in response to light sources (Winsborough 2001:114).
Aquatic species are found in benthic (bottom-dwelling), epiphytic (attached to plants) or
planktonic (free-floating) forms. A wide range of environmental variables has been
investigated as possible controls on abundance and assemblage composition in aquatic
habitats (both fossil and modern), chiefly water chemistry (pH, salinity, dissolved organic
and inorganic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and sulfide content) and
physical properties (water temperature, velocity and turbulence, depth; Moser,
MacDonald and Smol 1996:31-34; Battarbee et al. 2001:164-168). Patrick (1977)
provides a very comprehensive review.

Freshwater sponges are sessile, multi-celled, invertebrate members of the animal
kingdom (phylum Porifera, family Spongillidae) and are entirely confined to freshwater
aquatic habitats. They are mentioned in this chapter because their decomposition also
produces microscopic siliceous bodies that may preserve well in alluvial sediments. They

823

probably occur in many streamside archeological sites, but are usually overlooked.
Freshwater sponge spicules from Berger Bluff were not systematically studied, but I
noted their presence and condition both in sediment thin sections and in raw sediment
samples examined microscopically on glass slides (see Chapter 4). Sponge spicules also
appear (along with phytoliths) on the diatom slides, where their presence was noted but
not tabulated. They have also been reported from two sites (41 GD 21 and 41 GD 21A)
on Sulphur Creek in the western part of Coleto Creek Reservoir (Robinson 1979).
Sponge spicules will receive only brief discussion here. Plant phytoliths and chrysophyte
cysts were also noted on the diatom slides, but not identified or tabulated. Chrysophytes
are golden brown algae in the class Chrysophyceae (mostly freshwater). Texas has at
least 33 species (Wujek, Wee and Van Kley 2002). Cysts are spherical, siliceous resting
stages which may be preserved in sediments (Cohen 2003:297-298; Nicholls and Wujek
2003:Fig. 2; Wilkinson, Hall and Smol 1999:18; Zeeb and Smol 2001).

DIATOM SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS METHODS
Altogether 31 small sediment samples from the bench deposits were submitted for
diatom analysis to Barbara Winsborough of Winsborough Consulting (Table 7.1).
Twenty-seven of these samples form a continuous column (92.90 to 91.55 m) extracted
from matrix samples in the southwest corner of unit N110 E102. These are supplemented
by three more samples (92.95 to 92.80 m) from the southwest corner of N109 E103,
added to give better representation at the top of the bench (Fig. 7.1). Figure 3.4 shows
how these subsamples were collected from the matrix samples. One more sample
(number 44) was extracted from the 93.45-93.40 m geological sample in the cutbank in
order to sample stratum 2E. Because the 92.80-92.80 m level in N110 E102 is a 10 cm
level, separate samples were submitted from the upper (2A) and lower (2B) halves of the
level (Fig. 7.1). Unfortunately, there are no samples from stratum 3. A total of 7882
diatom cells was counted from these 31 samples.

exaggerated, through the bench deposits. Vertical scale is absolute elevation
in meters. Note that sample 2 approximately duplicates sample 2A in
elevation, and sample 3 approximately duplicates sample 2B. Samples 40
and 42 were collected from the Lissie terrace exposure upstream from the
site. Stratum 2E is actually exposed along the cutbank downstream, but in
this schematic view is shown pushed back from the edge in order to keep the
relative elevation of the sample consistent. See Fig. 4.22 for the actual
position of this stratum and the sample block.

Four more diatom samples were submitted for comparative purposes, and three of
them proved to be sterile. Two of these (samples 29 and 39) were extracted from the
southwest corner wall of the large excavation block in the upper deposits. These come
from the west wall of unit N97 E96 at 99.75 m and 97.75 m, from strata 5 and 4
respectively (black sample boxes in Fig. 4.61). Joan DeCosta and I collected these from
the standing wall of the open excavation on April 17, 1981. Both of these samples were
sterile, producing no diatoms at all. Winsborough noted that sample 39 (97.75 m) also
lacked phytoliths, pollen, or sponge spicules. The reason is unknown though it might
somehow relate to late Middle and Late Holocene local aridity.

The other two samples (samples 40 and 42) were collected from the Lissie terrace
cutbank, upstream from the site. These come from stratigraphic section 1 (samples 1-1
and 1-3; Fig. 4.13). Of the two, the upper sample, number 40, was also sterile. The lower
sample, number 42 (= field number 1-3) produced a diatom assemblage somewhat
different from that seen in the bench deposits.

Altogether, 35 samples from these different contexts were analyzed. These 35
samples were analyzed in three separate batches. The first batch (February, 1992) was a
pilot study of six samples designed to discover if diatoms were preserved at the site, and
if they would have any diagnostic value. The second batch (December, 1992) added six
more samples. The final batch (February, 1998) added 23 more samples and completed
the columns.

Barbara Winsborough describes the processing protocol as follows:
The material was treated with hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid to oxidize the
organics and remove soluble minerals. Permanent glass slides were made using
HYRAX, a resin with a high refractive index. Slides were scanned at 1500X.
Because the samples were sparsely diatomaceous, the entire slide was scanned,
829

and both whole cells and fragments large enough to be recognized were counted.
The presence of phytoliths, sponge spicules and any other biogenic material was
recorded along with the diatoms (Winsborough 1998a:2).
It should be noted that the concentration of diatoms in the sediments and the
number of diatoms counted per slide both vary widely. Two sets of slides were prepared
from the processed samples; Winsborough retained one, and the other is to be curated
with the site collections.

In addition to the archeological samples, a series of contemporary comparative
samples was collected from the Berger Bluff catchment in 1997 and 1998. Twenty-one
localities (diatom sampling sites D-1 through D-21) in the counties of Karnes, De Witt,
Goliad, and Victoria were sampled. Where possible, from each site at least one small soil
sample, a 2 cc bottom water sample, and a 2-quart water column sample were collected
and delivered to Barbara Winsborough. These samples (23 soil and 42 water) have been
processed and analyzed, but the data are not yet available.

DEFINITIONS OF TERMS
Following are definitions of some terms used in this chapter.

Aerophilic (or aerophilous): a preference for non-submerged habitats (such as soil or
damp moss) rather than habitats found below the water surface.

Alkaliphilic: a preference for a pH of at least 7.

Benthic: refers to the bottom zone of a water body.

Epipelic: found on the surface of mud, clay, silt or other fine sediments.

830

Epiphytic: growing on plants or other algae (many diatoms are found attached to algae or
submergent aquatic plants).

Halophilic: salt-tolerant.

Oligohalobous: in salt concentrations less than 5500 mg/l (Winsborough 1988:Table 51).

Oligotrophic: a water body with low levels of nutrients (especially nitrogen and
phosphorus).

Periphytic: attached to a substrate of some kind.

Planktonic: âgrowing suspended, floating, or drifting in waterâ (Wehr and Sheath
2003:845).

Tychoplantktonic: âspecies that are predominantly planktonic, but capable of prolonged
survival on or in sedimentsâ (Wehr and Sheath 2003:848).

RESULTS OF DIATOM STUDIES

Habitat Preference
A minimum of at least 65 distinct species or genera of diatoms was recovered
from the bench deposits (Table 7.2). Because some cells could only be identified to
generic level (due to poor orientation on the slide, or incompleteness of the diatom), it is
possible that a few more species (no more than seven at the most) could be present.
About half of the counted diatoms are from preferentially aquatic species (about 47-53

831

species) and about half (18 species) are species found typically in terrestrial habitats
(such as mud, damp moss, or seasonally wet and dry soil; Fig. 7.2).

Figure 7.2. Major Habitat Categories for Diatoms From the Bench Deposits. Tallied by
cell count, diatoms are about evenly divided between preferentially aquatic
species and those found in both aquatic and aerophilous habitats.
The first group represents a diverse mixture of different aquatic species deposited
by overbank flooding of Coleto Creek, and perhaps drawn from large sections of the
drainage system upbasin. The aquatic assemblage includes three species (Epithemia
turgida, Fragilaria ulna, and E. adnata) with abundant cell counts, plus a much larger
number of low-frequency species. Many of the aquatic species are represented only by
one, two, or three cells.

The second group represents an assemblage of more adaptable species that can
live in aerial habitats. These might have come from saturated mud around seeps, a spring,
or a spring run, from off-site temporary floodplain pools, from damp floodplain soil, or
from moss growing on the floodplain or on dead wood. This aerophilous assemblage
includes the second, third, and fourth most abundant species (Pinnularia borealis,
Hantzschia amphioxys, and Luticola mutica) from the bench. Some of these are very
common soil diatoms. Achnanthes, Amphora, Eunotia, Hantzschia, Navicula, Nitzschia,
and Pinnularia have all been reported as soil diatom genera from the Texas coastal plain
(King and Ward 1977:Table 2).

Figure 7.3 shows taxa with a total of at least 20 cells in the summed 31 samples
(taxa with less than 20 are lumped together in the âotherâ category). The ten most
abundant taxa shown in this diagram are all adapted to seasonal drying of the habitat,
regardless of whether it is aquatic or marshy. The following description by Winsborough
is based on the initial small group of samples analyzed in February, 1992:
With the possible exception of S. ulna, which is not very useful as an ecological
indicator, [the dominant] species are either characteristically soil (Hantzschia,
Pinnularia, and Navicula) or shallow water/marsh species (Epithemia and
Denticula). All occur at or above a pH of 7, are indifferent to variable salt
concentrations or are stimulated by small amounts of salts. They are littoral,
standing water forms, and are found in habitats that contain aquatic vegetation,
but that dry out periodically, or become very shallow and marshy. All but one
species (Melosira) belongs to the category of pennate diatoms, those that are
attached to a substrate or crawl actively in or on sediments. The one centric,
planktonic diatom (Melosira) was probably transported to the site from a deeper
water habitat as it forms long chains and would be much more abundant if it was
part of the resident population. There is no evidence of a planktonic population,
indicating deep (a meter or greater) permanent water (Winsborough 1992a:3-4).

834

The last statement calls for comment. Geologic evidence (Chapter 4) and
freshwater mussels (Chapter 9) suggest the channel of Coleto Creek was fairly deep
during accumulation of the bench deposits. The littoral or marsh forms referred to above
probably originated in seeps or spring-saturated floodplain sediments at or near the site.

Figure 7.3. Principal Diatom Taxa. This diagram shows all taxa with cell counts of at
least 20, ordered by abundance in a clockwise direction beginning with
Epithemia turgida. Taxa with counts of less than 20 are grouped together in
the âotherâ category.
835

So many aquatic species, with varying tolerances, are found in the bench deposits
that it is difficult to form a general picture of Coleto Creek waters in the Younger Dryas
and early Holocene. Certainly, the overwhelming majority of species are epiphytic and
alkaliphilous, probably indicating the presence of abundant aquatic vegetation in the
creek and pH at least as high as at present (pre-inundation pH was measured at 7.66-8.18;
Murray, Jinnette and Moseley 1976:Table 1). Only three species (Neidium affine var.
longiceps, Pinnularia appendiculata, and P. microstauron) are particularly acid-tolerant.
A few species (Cyclotella meneghiniana, Gomphonema affine, Navicula elginensis, N.
oblonga, Nitzschia cf. N. frustulum, N. tropica, Rhopalodia gibberula, and Sellaphora
pupula) tolerate saline water, but they are all rare species with very low cell counts,
indicating the water was never significantly brackish. Several species are characteristic of
warm waters (Craticula cuspidata, Denticula elegans, Nitzschia amphibia, Rhopalodia
gibberula, and especially Fragilaria ulna). Some of the species (such as Pinnularia
borealis) in the genus Pinnularia might be cool-water indicators.

Patterns of Abundance, Preservation, and Species Diversity
Species richness is simply the number of species in an assemblage or sample;
species diversity is a mathematical measure that incorporates both the number of taxa and
their relative abundances; evenness is a mathematical measure of how similar or disparate
the abundances are. Both diatom abundance and species richness decline somewhat
erratically from the base of the bench deposits toward the top (Fig. 7.4). Diatoms are
abundant and diverse in strata 1 and 2A, but decline above 92.20 m (Table 7.3).
Abundance and species richness are closely correlated (r = 0.84), and as a result species
diversity and evenness show no major long-term trends.
836

Figure 7.4. Diatom Species Richness and Abundance by Level. Vertical bi-axis plot of
the number of taxa and cell count per sample. Samples 2 and 3 are omitted.
Two samples (indicated by solid dots) have cell counts of 500. This plot
shows that species richness and abundance are heavily correlated, and both
diminish upsection and over time, especially above stratum 2A. Compare
with Fig. 7.6. Strata are labeled along the right side (note: sample 2B should
not be confused with stratum 2B). Diatom abundance and species richness
tend to peak in the sandy strata and decline in the muddy strata (shaded).

Both of these statistics display only minor fluctuations from bottom to top, except
for one major negative excursion at 92.05-92.00 m and a slight trend toward declining
diversity above the 92.55-92.50 m level (Fig. 7.5, Table 7.4). There are fewer species in
the upper part of the bench deposits, but there are also fewer individuals per species, and
because both decline at about the same rate, the diversity index remains relatively
constant from bottom to top.
Species diversity is calculated using Simpsonâs unbiased diversity index, defined
as

The upsection decline in diatom abundance and species richness is
presumably due to progressive drying and decline in spring discharge during the Younger
Dryas and early Holocene. There is no compelling evidence that it is due to loss of
diatoms through dissolution or breakage. Chemical dissolution can remove diatoms from
sediments and selectively alter species composition, but this is chiefly seen in saline lake
sediments (Ryves et al. 2001). Because the bench sediments are mostly quartz sand
chemically similar to the diatoms themselves, and because the sediments are buffered by
phreatic carbonate, chemical deletion of diatoms is not likely to have been a significant
factor, unless the opaline silica in the diatoms is more easily soluble than quartz. The
bottom-up decline in abundance and species richness is also the exact opposite of that
seen for the snail assemblage, which declines from the top down (see Chapter 8).
The maximum number of species in any one level is 22-24, at the 91.80-91.75 m
level in stratum 1 (two categories are identified only to the genus level, so the exact
number of species is ambiguous). The minimum number of species is five, at the 92.7592.70 m level in N109 E102 and the 92.85-92.80 m level in N110 E102 (both from
stratum 2D). Much of this upsection decline in species richness (and possibly abundance)
is probably due to the loss of aquatic species, because the percentage of aquatic diatoms
in any given sample also declines upsection in almost identical fashion (Fig. 7.6).

In comparison to aquatic environments, a diatom assemblage consisting of only 524 species per sample is not very diverse. In the Guadalupe River, diatom samples
routinely produced about 80-100 species from 1958 to the mid-1970s (Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 1991:Fig. III-5). A study by Sherwood and Sheath
(1999) recorded 66 species for the San Marcos River and 44 species for the Comal River.
841

Figure 7.6. Percentage of Aquatic Diatoms by Level. Samples 2 and 3 are omitted. This
vertical plot shows a pronounced reduction in the percentage of aquatic
diatoms over time, especially above 92.25 m. The fitted trend line has an r2
value of 0.39. Compare with Fig. 7.4.
Even relatively small creeks may produce over 100 species or subspecies of
diatoms (Koch and Risser 1974), though many produce only two or three dozen.
Contemporary lakes in stressed environments like the northern Plains may produce
842

assemblages of about one to three dozen species, while lakes in the eastern US may
produce assemblages of over 130 species.

Terrestrial sites produce diatom assemblages of widely varying size. At the upper
end of the spectrum are paleontological or archeological sites where pond or cienega
deposits have been sampled, like the Gibson site (Marks Beach), where some levels may
approach 50 species per sample (Winsborough 1995:Fig. 34). More typical, perhaps, are
sites like Wilson-Leonard, where most samples produced very few diatoms at all, and the
two most productive samples yielded only 13 and 15 species (Winsborough 1998b:Table
38-2); or the Armstrong site, where individual samples yielded at most three species
(Winsborough 2002a:Table 2). Unlike other kinds of proxy data (snails, vertebrates, or
pollen) where species richness in any one sample may be inflated by time-averaging,
diatom samples from archeological or paleontological sites often seem to produce species
lists that are rather limited in comparison to contemporary sampling. In part, this is
because archeological or paleontological samples are less spatially extensive, and in part
because the diatom samples are diluted by sediment.

Stratigraphic Distribution of Species
A few species of diatoms (Cocconeis placentula, Rhopalodia gibba, and
Pinnularia borealis) not only occur in abundance, but are also widely distributed from
the bottom to the top of the bench section (Table 7.5) or increase slightly in abundance
toward the top (Hantzschia amphioxys, Luticola mutica). Aside from their abundance,
these persistent species are distinguished by being widespread, common, and relatively
well-documented in the diatom literature. In general, they are cosmopolitan and include
both aquatic and aerophilic/aquatic forms. A few examples are shown in Fig. 7.7.
843

Another group (Figs. 7.8, 7.9) consists of species that are concentrated in the
lower part but drop out toward the top of the section (for example, Achnanthes coarctata,
Aulacoseira italica, A. ambigua, Cymbella mexicana, Epithemia adnata, Eunotia cf. E.
pectinalis, Fragilaria capitata, F. capucina var. vaucheriae, Navicula muticopsis, and
Pinnularia appendiculata). Except for N. muticopsis and P. appendiculata, these are
mostly aquatic species occurring in low to moderate abundance. It is notable that
Epithemia adnata, which does not tolerate dry conditions as well as Epithemia turgida
(Winsborough, personal communication 2005), drops out toward the top of the section
while E. turgida persists, even into stratum 2E, though becoming less frequent. Some of
these species might have been more stratigraphically persistent if their sample sizes had
been larger. Nitzschia amphibia seems to appear uniquely in sandy units (Fig. 7.7).

A third group (Fig. 7.10) consists of a few rare species found in very low numbers
only in the upper half or near the top of the section (Epithemia argus, Fragilaria
elliptica, Gomphonema affine, G.

angustum, Meridion circulare var. constrictum,

Nitzschia tropica, Pinnularia braunii, P. subcapitata, and Surirella sp.). These are nearly
all aquatic (including a couple of salt-tolerant species) and are often represented by only
one or two cells. Their restricted stratigraphic range may be largely due to small sample
size.
The remaining species (Fig. 7.11 shows a few examples) are scattered irregularly through
the stratigraphic section. These (for example, Denticula elegans, Mastogloia smithii,
Pinnularia viridis, and Stauroneis obtusa) generally have rather low cell counts and show
no distinguishing stratigraphic patterns.

cell counts; width is constant but scaling is variable by species. Cell counts for
the entire column are given next to the species name. This scaling style
emphasizes vertical patterns within a species and de-emphasizes relative
proportions of species. Lower counts in the muddy units (shaded) may have
resulted from turbidity restricting photosynthesis (for aquatic species).

Aquatic Diatoms and Suspended Load Content
Most research on diatom autecology has focused on chemical variables like pH,
salinity, conductivity, and the like. For Coleto Creek during the Younger Dryas and early
Holocene, these factors were probably less variable than in the lakes that are often the
focus of diatom studies. In the present context, fluvial variables like suspended load
content, water depth, velocity and turbulence, and water temperature are probably much
more relevant, but these are less often studied by diatom specialists, making it more
difficult to discern relationships between the diatom assemblage and the geology of the
bench deposits.

One exception to this emphasis is a study done in 1996-99 by Blinn and Herbst
(2003) of substrates in 38 stream habitats in the Lahontan Basin. The study showed that
dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, conductivity, and substratum were all correlated with
diatom community structure. The study is particularly useful because a few species found
at Berger Bluff are included. Aulacoseira italica was found in habitats with high
gradients, high discharge, coarse substrate, high canopy cover, and low conductance.
Cyclotella meneghiniana, Nitzschia frustulum, N. palea, and Rhopalodia gibba were
found in habitats with low gradients, low discharge, fine substrate, low canopy cover, and
high conductance (Blinn and Herbst 2003:3). They also found that
Species of Hantzschia, Navicula, Nitzschia, and Surirella were most abundant in
low elevation assemblages, with fine substrata, reduced canopy, low gradients,
low discharges, and high conductance and lowest in habitats with high ecological
integrity. Also, based on indices of % fines and sand and % embeddedness,
species such as Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Cyclotella meneghiniana,
Fragilaria ulnaâ¦ Nitzschia frustulum, Nitzschia paleaâ¦ and Rhopalodia gibba
were considered to be most tolerant of disturbed sites with substrata composed of
a high percentage of fines and sandâ¦. (Blinn and Herbst 2003:3).
854

The authors define an index (FSI) of % fines and sand which can be used as an
indicator of the siltation tolerance of each diatom species. See Blinn and Herbst (2003:6)
for a definition of the index. Species in their study ranged from a minimum index of 28 to
a maximum of 82 (representing the most silt-tolerant). Species that are also found at
Berger Bluff are shown in Table 7.6, ranked in order from most tolerant to least tolerant.

From the rankings, it is apparent that all the species are fairly silt-tolerant, but
Nitzschia amphibia is most tolerant. Only H. amphioxys, L. mutica, and N. amphibia
occur in any abundance in the bench deposits. Of the species listed in the table above,
two of the most abundant species (H. amphioxys and L. mutica) are stratigraphically
persistent species that become progressively somewhat more abundant through time.
Most of the remaining species (except for M. circulare and P. subcapitata) are found in
the lower two-thirds or lower part of the stratigraphic section. Nitzschia amphibia appears
early in the sequence and then again in the upper part of stratum 2B.

Correspondence Analysis of the Diatom Data
Correspondence analysis is an exploratory technique for analyzing two-way
contingency tables. Here the variables are counts of diatom species and the cases are the
samples drawn in most cases from 5 cm excavation levels. The analysis extracts axes, or
gradients of variation, that are orthogonal and independent of each other.

The unmodified provenience table of diatom counts (Table 7.5) is inherently
somewhat unsuitable for ordination studies. Good practice in multivariate analysis
requires that there be at least as many samples as variables, but the unmodified table has
72 variables (taxonomic categories)

by 31 cases (samples). As an experiment, a

correspondence analysis was done using the unmodified data table, but it was clear that
better results would be obtained by deleting as many of the least informative taxonomic
categories as possible. A wide variety of modifications was tried (including log and
percentage transformations of the counts), but ultimately the most interpretable results
were obtained by

â¢

Entirely deleting four cosmopolitan species that are ecologically undiagnostic
(Fragilaria ulna, Cocconeis placentula, Nitzschia amphibia, and Denticula
elegans)

â¢

Deleting all taxa identified only to generic level, except for Cymatopleura sp.

Cymatopleura was exempted because there are no species in this genus identified in the
deposits, so the taxon is unique as it stands.
856

Deletion of these taxa reduced the data table to 60 variables by 31 cases, and as a result,
about 61% of the variance (or âinertia,â as it is sometimes termed in correspondence
analysis) was accounted for by the first three axes extracted, compared to only 37% for
the unmodified table. The table is still twice as variable-heavy as it should be, but it
yielded interpretable results, so the analysis is presented here. The final and best solution
also featured downweighting of rare species and detrending of scores. The
correspondence analysis was done using MVSP 3.1. The first axis accounts for 50% of
the variance (inertia). Positive loadings represent diatoms characteristic of wet conditions
or flooding, and all are benthic, epiphytic or epilithic hardwater taxa (except possibly A.
italica, both planktonic and benthic; Barbara Winsborough, personal communication).
Negative loadings are opportunistic benthic species from dry or temporarily wet habitats.
This axis seems to represent a gradient of continuity in groundwater or floodwater
saturation. The second axis accounts for only 6% and is not readily interpretable. It seems
to feature mostly rare aquatic species. Negative loadings include several characteristic of
water with moderate to high electrolyte content. Some of the highest loadings (selected
from the total 60 variables) are listed below:

Table 7.7 lists the case scores for the 31 diatom samples from the bench deposits for the
first two axes. Figure 7.12 shows a plot of these scores on the first two axes. In the figure,
each data point is identified both by the sample number (as listed in Table 7.1) and by its
stratum (strata are hyphenated for samples at contacts between strata). Solid and dashed
lines outline clusters of samples from muddy and sandy strata. This plot demonstrates
that each stratum has a fairly distinct diatom assemblage signature. There is some overlap
(especially between strata 1 and 2A). There are a few outliers (samples 1, 9, 10, 28), and
of course the single sample from stratum 2E sits as an outlier at the left edge of the plot,
but otherwise the samples cluster well. In Figure 7.12, the horizontal axis appears to
represent an aquatic gradient from more drought-prone conditions on the left side to more
persistently saturated or flooded conditions on the right. The various strata are arrayed
very roughly in sequence from right to left on the plot, indicating that in general there is
an increasing emphasis on species that can withstand periodic desiccation, moving
upward in the stratigraphic sequence. Stratum 2D is distinguished by a greater response
to Axis 2.

Table 7.7 lists the case loadings for each of the 31 samples; only the first two axes
extracted are shown. In Figure 7.13, these scores (except for samples 2 and 3) are plotted
stratigraphically.

Figure 7.12. Correspondence Analysis of Diatom Samples from the Bench Deposits. Biaxis plot showing scores on the first two axes. Each point represents a single
diatom sample. Solid lines outline clusters of samples from muddy strata;
dashed lines outline clusters from sandy strata. A single sample from
stratum 2E lies at the left edge. Note that the strata cluster fairly well,
showing only partial overlap. Samples toward the right side of the plot have
diatom assemblages emphasizing species usually found in permanent water;
samples toward the left have species adapted to periodic desiccation. The
gradient represented by axis 2 is unidentified, but may have something to do
with electrolyte tolerance. Only stratum 2D seems to score very high on this
axis. Hyphenated labels designate samples from contacts between strata (for
example, â2A-calcâ is from the contact area between stratum 2A and the
underlying calcrete zone). Also note that samples 2A and 2B should not be
confused with strata 2A and 2B.
861

Figure 7.13. Vertical Plot of First Two Axes, Correspondence Analysis of Diatom
Samples. Case scores from analysis of simplified matrix are shown; samples
2 and 3 are used in the analysis, but omitted from this plot. Note the
similarity of this plot to figures 7.4 and 7.6.

862

Axis 1 has high scores at the top of stratum 1, in the calcrete zone, diminishing
rapidly through stratum 2A and into stratum 2B, and reaching a minimum in strata 2B
and 2E. In fact the vertical pattern of axis 1 (Fig. 7.8) is almost identical to the plot of
aquatic diatoms shown in Fig. 7.6, a clear indication that both are essentially measuring
the same thing â the abundance of diatoms preferring consistently flooded or watersaturated conditions. It is apparent that this assemblage experiences a step reduction in
abundance at the top of stratum 1 and continues to diminish as sediment accumulates on
the floodplain.

SPECIES ACCOUNTS: DIATOMS FROM THE BENCH DEPOSITS
The following brief species accounts (modified from those provided by Barbara
Winsborough) pertain to taxa from the bench deposits. Autecological descriptions
without literature citations are based on the personal experience of the analyst, Barbara
Winsborough. Two species unique to the Lissie terrace (Opephora martyi and
Staurosirella pinnata) are described separately at the end of this list. Digital photographs
of biosilica were taken with the TARL videomicroscopy system. All photos (except two
at 10X as noted) were taken through a 50X planchromatic objective lens; diatoms were
identified by Barbara Winsborough from printouts. For comparison with water chemistry
optima listed in the accounts, the following USGS data for Coleto Creek covering several
recent years are listed.

increase to about 23-27Â° C (73.4-80.6Â° F; Kindt and Small 2002:Table 1). Cosmopolitan,
fresh to brackish water, colonizer of disturbed habitats, may be an indicator of a change
from brackish to fresher water (Hodgson, Vyverman and Tyler 1997). In Florida fresh,
hard-water springs, it is a pioneer species on bare surfaces such as young plant leaves
(Whitford 1956:437), and it is a dominant species in such springs. Found in cold water

FRESHWATER SPONGE SPICULES
Freshwater sponges are collagen supported by a reticulate skeleton of
microscopic, needlelike spicules made of opal (hydrated silica; Pennak 1989:95). These
can be preserved in alluvial sediments when the sponge tissue disintegrates, and
megascleres (the largest type of spicule) are readily visible under magnification. Because
they are made of amorphous silica, they will extinguish under polarized light. Sponge
spicules are most often recovered from lake sediments (Frost 2001; Wilkins et al. 1991),
but can also be present in terrestrial soils (Clarke 2003:180-181; Jones and Beavers
1963). Unfortunately, megasclere morphology is not very diagnostic of species (Harrison
and Warner 1986:116). The smaller types of spicules (microscleres and gemmoscleres)
are more distinctive but require more magnification and have not been observed in the
Berger Bluff dust samples.

Microscopic spicules from freshwater sponges are apparently scattered throughout
the bench deposits. They were visible in the diatom sample slides and on dust fractions
extracted from raw sediment samples (coating glass microscope slides), and they appear
in the sediment thin sections from strata 1 and 2A discussed in Chapter 4 (slides 5, 6, and
7; Fig. 4.92, top). Megascleres can be seen at magnifications of about 200-400X and
above. No attempt to tally or quantify these spicules was made, but from qualitative
observations made by Barbara Winsborough, it appears that spicules are most abundant
in the lower part of the bench deposits, below 92.00 m, are moderately abundant in the
middle of the deposits, and become scarce above 92.65 m (Table 7.1). The uppermost
diatom samples apparently contain only a few broken spicules. In scanning duplicate
slides, I found very few spicules above stratum 2A. Although unverified quantitatively, it
901

seems likely that the density of spicules probably parallels the upwardly-declining
density of diatoms seen on the slides (Fig. 7.4). The single diatom sample from stratum
2E (sample 44 at 93.45-93.40 m) lacks spicules entirely and has very few diatoms.

Winsborough did not find any visible sponge spicules in diatom samples from
stratum 4 (sample 39, N97 E96, 97.75 m) and stratum 5 (sample 29, N97 E96, 99.75 m)
in the blufftop excavation, and scanned dust samples from the 99.00 m and 99.75 m
levels also lacked spicules. In scanning a duplicate slide (number 29) from the 99.00 m
level, I found only one or two fragments of spicules (Fig. 7.20). The evidence seems to
suggest that conditions in Coleto Creek were favorable for sponge growth during the
early history of the bench deposits, became somewhat less favorable during the middle
part of the bench section, and became unfavorable as the bench deposits stopped
accumulating. Conditions may have been unfavorable throughout the accumulation of the
upper deposits in the Holocene, although Robinson (1979) reports sponge spicules from
all of the samples examined at 41 GD 21, located nearby on Sulphur Creek. Presumably,
the upward decline in density and eventual disappearance of the spicules is controlled by
the size of the sponge populations in Coleto Creek, and not by taphonomic decay or by
varying rates of sediment dilution. Freshwater sponges are not reported in the preinundation assessment done by Murray, Jinnette and Moseley (1976).

In Lissie stratigraphic section 2, dust fractions from all four sediment samples
were scanned, but no spicules were seen. In Lissie stratigraphic section 1, no spicules
were seen in sample 1-1, occasional spicules were seen in sample 1-2, and very wellpreserved, complete or nearly complete spicules were seen in sample 1-3. In sample 1-4,
only one possible spicule was seen.

upper deposits, N97 E96 (99.75 m). This small medial megasclere fragment
was one of only one or two found in scanning of the slide. The sample
comes from the upper part of stratum 5, about 25 cm below the ground
surface.
The species of sponge present in the bench sediments is unidentified, but all of the
spicules seen in the dust fractions on microscope slides seem to be of the same type,
relatively slender, arched, smooth megascleres with a central axial filament of collagen
around which the spicule forms (Figs. 7.21, 7.22). Many of the spicules from the bench
sediments are broken central or distal fragments, but complete or nearly complete
megascleres (Figs. 7.23, 7.24) resemble published illustrations of Spongilla lacustris, the
most widespread and common freshwater sponge in North America (Frost 1991:Figs. 4.6,
903

4.7). Spongilla lacustris has megascleres about 200-350 Âµm (0.2-0.35 mm) long (Frost
1991:120). There are several other species that can have smooth, slightly curved
megascleres, however (for example, Eunapius fragilis, Heteromeyenia baileyi), and
Poirrier (1972) reports at least nine species of freshwater sponges are present in Texas.
According to Pennak (1989:101), âit is common to find three different species in the
same lake, less common to find four, and rare to find five or six,â so it is possible that
more than one species might be present in the bench deposits.

Presumably, the spicules are the remains of sponges that grew in Coleto Creek during the
Younger Dryas and early Holocene, decomposing and shedding spicules into bottom mud
that was later swept up and deposited as overbank sediment on the floodplain. Because
sponges are often found encrusting submerged roots or deadwood, it is also possible
some sponge tissue could be carried onsite attached to floating wood during overbank
floods. Because the spicules seen in the Lissie samples are the same type as those seen in
the bench, and because many of the bench specimens are broken, the possibility that the
Lissie terrace contributed some spicules cannot entirely be ruled out. But the limited
905

stratigraphic occurrence of spicules in the Lissie terrace suggests it was not a major
contributor of spicules to the bench sediments. The apparent (though quantitatively
undemonstrated) co-occurrence of diatoms and sponge spicules suggest both derive from
the same source.

Pennak (1989:99) reports that freshwater sponges are most common in water less than 2
m deep, and are rarely found on mud bottoms, in silty or very rapid water. However,
Spongilla lacustris is known to grow on soft mud bottoms (Frost 1991:107; Frost, de
Nagy and Gilbert 1982), and Cheatum and Harris (1953:100) observed that sponges of
various species were as abundant in Dallas County in muddy ponds and sluggish streams
as in clear water. Turbidity did not seem to be a limiting factor for sponge distribution,
although they are phototropic (light-seeking) organisms. Most colonies are found
encrusting submerged deadwood, roots, or basal stalks of cattails and sedges. Cheatum
and Harris (1953:100) report turbidities of 20-150 ppm; Harrison (1974:51) reports that
907

Spongilla lacustris tolerates turbidity of 2-200 ppm, Secchi disk visibility of 0.9-7.3 m,
and a wide range of temperature (12-37Â° C) and pH (5.3-9.0). In eastern Canada, the
species tolerates water temperature of 4-25Â° C and pH 4.8-9.0 (Ricciardi and Reiswig
1993:676). Sponges are also susceptible to crawdad predation (Williamson 1979).

Besides sponge spicules, other kinds of biosilica can be seen on the diatom slides.
Phytoliths (Figs. 7.25, 7.26) are common but have not been identified or quantified.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS FOR CHAPTER 7
At least four kinds of biosilica (diatoms, freshwater sponge spicules, chrysophyte
cysts, and phytoliths) were found in the bench deposits, but only the diatoms were studied
systematically. A single column of samples collected at 5 cm intervals (except near the
top of the column) was analyzed, supplemented by three additional samples from N109
E103 and one from stratum 2E. Additional comparative samples from the Lissie terrace
and upper deposits were also analyzed.
909

Although cienega sites like the Gibson (Marks Beach) site may produce over 100
species of diatoms (Winsborough 1995:Table 33), many terrestrial sites in Texas have
produced only sparse counts and limited assemblages of diatoms. It is a fairly common
occurrence for samples from archeological sites to produce very depauperate
assemblages, either from taphonomic decay or because the sediments were not good
diatom sinks to begin with. In contrast, the bench deposits at Berger Bluff have produced
a fairly abundant and taxonomically diverse diatom assemblage of at least 65 species,
mostly from the lower part of the deposits. Figure 7.27 shows how abundances of these
species are distributed. The 72 categories (65 species plus some identified only to generic
level) are ranked by abundance. Only a few of the most abundant species at the left are
labeled.

Diatom species often have global or near-global distributions, and many of the
species found in the Berger Bluff bench deposits can also be found today in such exotic
locations as Africa, Turkey, Japan, Antarctica, or Greenland. Consequently,
biogeography is of no help in understanding the environmental requirements of different
species. Many are equally cosmopolitan in terms of physical or chemical variables. For
example, Nitzschia amphibia is reported from lakes and ponds in the Canadian Arctic,
from peat bogs in Tierra del Fuego, and from hot springs in Kenya (as well as from the
Guadalupe River). Diatoms are not particularly temperature-sensitive, in any case
(Anderson 2000). This frequently wide adaptability makes it difficult to derive
environmental interpretations from assemblage composition or to interpret the axes
derived from correspondence analysis.

910

Figure 7.27. Relative Proportions of Diatom Taxa. Summing all counts from the bench
deposits, this histogram shows all 72 taxonomic categories ranked by
abundance from left to right, but only the most abundant taxa are prominent
enough to show at this scale. Only the six most abundant ones are labeled.
The purpose of this histogram is to show that, time-averaged over the 2000
or more years of bench deposits, the summed collection resembles the
composition of contemporary diatom communities.

Biosilica originated both in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. When cell counts are
added up, there is an approximate even division, numerically speaking, between 1)
diatoms characteristic of aquatic environments and 2) diatoms that are more droughtadapted and may be found either submerged in water or in aerophilous, damp habitats
like mud, damp moss or rocks. The first group is a large roster (about 47-53) of species
911

that in many cases may be represented by only one, two, or a few cells each. These are
thought to be diatoms that lived in Coleto Creek and were deposited by overbank
flooding. Cell counts and species richness peak in the sandy units and tend to be reduced
in the muddy units (Fig. 7.4), perhaps indicating that biosilica was mainly deposited as
part of the traction load rather than the suspended load. The chrysophyte cysts, sponge
spicules, and probably the phytoliths as well were likely deposited the same way. It is
also possible that the differences between the sandy and muddy units are due to turbidity
controls on diatom populations. Cell counts may be higher in the sandy units because
creek turbidity was lower when these units were being deposited. Species diversity and
evenness are slightly depressed in the muddy units (Fig. 7.5). Diatoms and sponge
spicules are either absent or present in low density in the Lissie terrace upstream,
suggesting that material reworked from the Lissie terrace was not a major source of
biosilica for the bench deposits. Two of the species found in the Lissie sample are also
entirely absent from the bench deposits, reinforcing this conclusion.

The second group of diatoms is very nearly as numerous but makes up a much
smaller list of species (about 18-19), most of which are represented by rather large cell
counts (for example, 1387 for Pinnularia borealis). Only a few species have cell counts
in the 2-10 cell range. These are species characteristic of seasonally desiccated muddy or
marshy habitats, and they likely originated at seeps or springs on the floodplain surface.
These autochthonous diatoms either lived onsite in groundwater-saturated sediments, or
may have been moved by floodwaters a short distance onto the site from nearby seeps or
springs upstream. Many of the most abundant species are characteristic of seasonally
drying habitats.

912

Declining Diatoms: Taphonomy or Environmental Change?
Although species diversity and evenness show no well-defined long-term trends,
diatom abundance and species richness show a fluctuating, persistent decline from the
bottom to the top of the bench stratigraphic sequence. While not quantified, sponge
spicules appear to show an equally dramatic decline upsection. Especially notable is a
major step decline at the top of stratum 2A (Fig. 7.4). The trend culminates in stratum 2E,
where the single sample analyzed was nearly sterile. The percentage of diatoms
originating strictly in aquatic habitats also declines over time (Fig. 7.6). As the bench
sediments accumulate, drought-adapted species that can live in aerophilous as well as
aquatic habitats show increased proportional representation. This pattern could be due to
reduced flood frequency (if the floodplain elevation rose while the channel bed remained
fixed), but since the elevation difference is not much more than a meter, this hypothesis
seems unlikely.

A more likely explanation is that aquatic diatom habitat quality was diminishing
during the Younger Dryas because of increased flood force, more frequent and intensified
drought, and possibly changing salt or alkalinity levels in Coleto Creek. Certainly, by the
time the upper deposits formed in mid- to late Holocene time, environmental conditions
for diatom growth must have become very unfavorable. How much of the upsection
decline in diatom density, if any, is due to taphonomic decay remains an open question.
Sponge spicules show frequent breakage (Figs. 7.20, 7.22) but no noticeable evidence of
chemical dissolution. Complete spicules seem to be present mostly in the lower samples.
My observations of selected duplicate slides and Barbara Winsboroughâs observations
(Table 7.1) suggest that breakage of both spicules and diatoms tends to increase
913

upsection, which is consistent with the hypothesis of increasingly violent flooding
presented in Chapter 4. Most fragmentation of diatoms (Fig. 7.17) is probably
mechanical, but a few appear corroded as well. Sponge spicules survive chemical
dissolution better than diatoms because they are more massive (Conley and Schelske
1993). Biosilica dissolution can occur both in anoxic, organic environments like peat
bogs (Bennett et al. 1991) and in very alkaline environments (Ryves et al. 2001; see
Battarbee et al. 2001:169-170) for a review. Winsborough (personal communication) has
observed that the diatoms present in the bench deposits are chiefly large, robust species
that resist breakage and decay well. An experimental study of diatom dissolution by
Ryves and others (2001) includes seven or eight species found in the bench deposits, and
the abundance of these species in the deposits is roughly proportional to their dissolution
resistance, except for Rhopalodia gibba, which is more abundant than its resistance rank
would seem to suggest.

If postburial chemical dissolution had removed significant numbers of diatoms
from the bench sediments, I would expect diatom density to decline downward, not
upward, since the deeper sediments appear to have experienced greater groundwater
activity and to have been exposed to groundwater longer. Indeed, snails recovered from
the deposits show just this pattern, declining markedly in abundance with depth (see
Chapter 8). As it happens, the density gradients of snails and diatoms are opposed.

Another possibility that should be considered is the potential for mechanical
breakage of biosilica by weathering processes long after burial in overbank sediment.
Fissuring of the sediments by shrink-swell processes is more prominent in the upper part

914

of the stratigraphic section (see Chapter 4). Much more extensive sediment thin section
studies than have been done on the bench deposits would be needed to resolve this issue.

Still another possible cause for the upsection decline might be accelerating
sedimentation rates, which would probably dilute species richness as well as cell counts,
but there is no clear evidence (radiocarbon or otherwise) for greatly accelerated
sedimentation rates in the bench sediments. There is a slight trend for upward coarsening
of sediment (see Chapter 4), but it is not dramatic. If there is an acceleration of the
sedimentation rate, it probably occurred in strata 4 and 5, well after the bench sediments
were deposited.

Do the diatom assemblages respond to the alternation of sandy and muddy units,
or do they show trends that crosscut the strata? There is a slight tendency for diatom
abundance and species richness (Fig. 7.4) and for Axis 1 from the correspondence
analysis (Fig. 7.13) to peak in the sandy strata and decline in the muddy strata, but on the
other hand, the muddy strata 2A and 2C are well separated by the correspondence
analysis and do not cluster on the plot (Fig. 7.12). Only one species, Nitzschia amphibia,
shows a particular affinity for sandy strata (Fig. 7.7), although several of the other species
shown in Fig. 7.7 show increased abundance in the sandy units. Overall, the long-term
trends that can be seen in Figs. 7.4 and 7.6 seem more dominant than smaller-scale
fluctuations related to the sandy-muddy couplets.

Synopsis
Diatoms probably originated from two sources, 1) Coleto Creek and 2) nearby
seeps, springs, or in situ growth on the site itself. Declining cell counts and species
915

richness appear to indicate long-term drying as the bench deposits accumulated, and
changes in assemblage composition are more responsive to this long-term trend than to
cyclic sedimentation. Diatoms are abundant in the lower part of the bench deposits, less
abundant in the upper part, scarce in stratum 2E, and absent in the upper deposits. Sponge
spicules were not quantified but probably show a similar history. This contrasts with the
report of fairly abundant sponge spicules in the upper 40 cm of deposits at 41 GD 21
(Robinson 1979:112).

Added Note

This chapter could not have been written without the expertise and repeated
assistance of Barbara Winsborough, who not only identified and analyzed the diatoms,
but provided counsel and information on many occasions. Funding for diatom research
was provided by the R. L. Andrews Memorial Award.
