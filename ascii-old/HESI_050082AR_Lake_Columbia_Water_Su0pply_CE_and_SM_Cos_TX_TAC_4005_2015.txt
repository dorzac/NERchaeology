MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Project Background and History
In 2000, the Angelina & Neches River Authority (ANRA) applied to the US Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE), for a Department of the Army permit under Section 404
of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as well as
for water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA to discharge dredged and fill materials
into “waters of the US,” associated with the construction of Lake Columbia, a proposed circa (ca.)
10,000.0-surface-acre water-supply reservoir in Cherokee and Smith counties, Texas. This
proposed reservoir had been in the planning stages since at least 1978 and had been known by
various names, including Mud Creek Reservoir and Lake Eastex. In 2003, the proposed reservoir
was renamed Lake Columbia to honor the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated
in the skies over northeastern Texas on February 1, 2003, while re-entering the atmosphere after
a 16-day scientific mission. The proposed Lake Columbia reservoir would be located on Mud
Creek, a major tributary of the Angelina River, on the US Geological Survey (USGS) Troup West,
Tecula, Griffin, Jacksonville East, and New Summerfield, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangles in USGS Hydrologic Unit 12020004.
In 2004, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA [P.L.
91-190; 83 Stat. 852; 42 USC §4221 et seq.]), the USACE determined that issuance of such a
permit may have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment and required the
preparation of a third-party Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In the third-party EIS, the
USACE would assess potential impacts associated with a range of alternatives. ANRA secured
funding from the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) to fund the development of the thirdparty EIS. ANRA contracted with RJ Brandes Company (RJBCO) to develop the third-party EIS,
and RJBCO subcontracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to provide
cultural resources inventory and evaluation services and to assist with EIS document preparation.
In 2005, Horizon developed a Scope of Work (SOW) for the cultural resources
investigations for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project (Owens 2005), including preliminary
archeological, geomorphological, and historic structures surveys and limited historical and
archival research, in consultation with ANRA, USACE, and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC). The goal of these studies was to survey a sample of environments within the Lake
Columbia Area of Potential Effect (APE) in the interest of obtaining representative baseline

HJN 050082 AR

v

Management Summary

information about the types of cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE.
The purpose of this sample survey strategy was to provide the USACE with enough information
to characterize the types of cultural resources that are likely to occur within the APE rather than
to provide an exhaustive listing of all cultural resources that actually exist within the APE. As this
survey was not designed to provide 100% intensive survey coverage of the APE, it was
designated as a baseline, or “Phase 1a,” cultural resources study to distinguish this phase of
survey-level investigations from any future survey activities that may be necessary to develop a
comprehensive inventory of cultural resources within the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE.
In 2006, the THC issued Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4005 to ANRA and Horizon under
the Antiquities Code of Texas to perform cultural resources investigations for the proposed Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. The permit was issued on January 12, 2006 and would remain
in effect for 10 years, with an expiration date of January 12, 2016.
Horizon completed the baseline cultural resources survey activities covered under the
approved SOW (Owens 2005) between February and June 2006 and prepared an interim report
describing the results of the baseline investigations (Owens et al. 2006). This interim report was
requested by the USACE as a management tool to assist the agency in permitting decisions
regarding the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. However, as the interim report was a
comparatively brief summary document, it did not meet the reporting requirements of a formal
technical report suitable for review by the regulatory agencies under the THC’s Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines
for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The interim report was approved by ANRA and
submitted to the USACE and THC for review. The USACE approved the interim report as a
management tool for use in the preparation of the third-party EIS being prepared by RJBCO, and
Horizon assisted with the preparation of a summary of results of the baseline cultural resources
survey activities for inclusion in the third-party EIS.
Based on their review of Horizon’s interim report describing the results of the baseline
cultural resources studies (Owens et al. 2006), both the USACE and THC concurred that
additional cultural resources survey, testing, and possible data recovery mitigation studies may
be required to complete ANRA’s cultural resources obligations under applicable state and federal
laws in the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future.
However, to date, the USACE has not yet approved the third-party EIS or issued a permit
authorizing the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project to move forward, and no further cultural
resources studies have been conducted in connection with the project since the submission of
the interim report of the baseline cultural resources survey to the USACE and THC in 2006.
Nevertheless, the Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC to ANRA and Horizon for
the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project is set to expire on January 12, 2016. In May 2015,
ANRA and Horizon consulted with the USACE and THC regarding the current status and future
prospects of the project as well as the outstanding items remaining to be completed to fulfill the
terms and conditions of the existing Texas Antiquities Permit. Under the Antiquities Code of
Texas, ANRA and Horizon are required to (1) prepare draft and final technical reports suitable for
review by the regulatory agencies under the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26,
Section 27, and the CTA’s Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports, and
vi

(2) prepare project records for permanent curation at an approved curation facility within the state
of Texas.
While additional cultural resources investigations, including 100% completion of the
cultural resources survey, eligibility testing of cultural resources for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL),
supplemental historical and archival research, and/or data recovery mitigation studies, may be
required in the future to comply with applicable federal and state laws, no further cultural
resources studies have been conducted in connection with the Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project since 2006, and the agencies have concurred that it seems unlikely that such studies will
be authorized within the timeframe covered under the existing Texas Antiquities Permit. As such,
in order for ANRA and Horizon to meet their mutual obligations under the existing Texas
Antiquities Permit, Horizon was authorized to complete the draft and final reports describing the
results of the baseline cultural resources investigations conducted to date and to prepare project
records for permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). All
cultural materials collected from archeological sites during the baseline survey were recovered
from privately owned lands. As stipulated in the approved SOW (Owens 2005), all artifacts
collected from private lands remain the property of the landowners. As such, upon receiving
notification from the THC that all terms and conditions of the existing Texas Antiquities Permit
have been fulfilled, Horizon will return the artifact collections to ANRA to be distributed by ANRA
to the appropriate landowners. Thus, while additional cultural resources investigations may be
necessary in the event that the proposed undertaking moves forward in the future, this report
serves to fulfill ANRA’s and Horizon’s obligations under the existing Texas Antiquities Permit and
to close the current chapter of cultural resources studies for the Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project.
Regulatory Jurisdiction
The proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project falls under the jurisdiction of existing
federal laws and guidelines designed to preserve and protect the nation’s cultural heritage,
including Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (P.L.
89-665; 16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), as amended through 2000 (P.L. 91-243, P.L. 93-54, P.L. 94-422,
P.L. 94-458, P.L. 96-199, P.L. 96-244, P.L. 96-515, P.L. 98-483, P.L. 99-514, P.L. 100-127, P.L.

No. 11593 of 1971, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”; the
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act (AHPA) of 1974 (P.L. 93-291; 88 Stat. 174; 16 USC
§469 et seq.); the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) of 1978 (P.L. 95-341; 92 Stat.

(NAGPRA) of 1990 (P.L. 101-601; 104 Stat. 3048; 25 USC §3001 et seq.).
In addition, ANRA, the project sponsor, funded the development of the third-party EIS
using a loan from the TWDB and would serve as the project sponsor for construction and ongoing
management of the facilities associated with the proposed Lake Columbia. Both ANRA and the
TWDB are considered subdivisions of the State of Texas; consequently, the project also falls

HJN 050082 AR

vii

Management Summary

under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977
[revised 1987], Title 9, Chapter 191), as amended through 2009, and the regulatory oversight of
the THC, which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the State of Texas.
Definition of Area of Potential Effect
The proposed undertaking would involve the discharge of dredged and fill materials into
“waters of the US” associated with the construction of the proposed Lake Columbia. Proposed
filling activities would occur in conjunction with the construction of the dam, spillway, and staging
areas and impoundment of the reservoir.
The project would impound approximately
22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) of Mud Creek and would inundate roughly 10,000.0 acres at a
conservation pool elevation of 315.0 feet above mean sea level (amsl) based on the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). The project would impact approximately 5,747.0 acres of
“waters of the US” associated with clearing, excavation, filling, and inundation.
The APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project refers to the area that would be
potentially impacted physically, visually, audibly, and/or aesthetically by the proposed
undertaking. This includes direct impacts associated with the construction of project facilities and
impoundment of the reservoir as well as indirect impacts resulting from ongoing use and
maintenance of the reservoir and appurtenant facilities. By definition, the APE includes the entire
area associated with the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project that would be covered
under the permit issued by the USACE. Based on consultation completed among the USACE,
ANRA, and the THC, the APE for purposes of the baseline cultural resources studies was
considered to include the normal conservation pool (i.e., the reservoir impoundment), the acreage
between the normal conservation pool boundary and ANRA’s “purchase line” or “fee line,” and
the dam and spillway area.
The normal pool (or conservation pool) refers to the average surface acreage of the
proposed reservoir under normal conditions (i.e., when the reservoir is not reduced by drought
conditions). ANRA had determined that the proposed Lake Columbia’s mean normal pool
elevation would be 315.0 feet NGVD. Based on the projected location of the dam, the 315.0-foot
NGVD contour line, as plotted on USGS topographic quadrangles, encompasses an area of
10,144.0 surface acres.
The area covered under the USACE’s permit would also include the acreage between the
normal pool boundary (i.e., the 315.0-foot NGVD contour) and ANRA’s “purchase line” or “fee
line,” the outside edge of property that would be acquired by ANRA to contain the reservoir
impoundment and that would be maintained as a management zone. ANRA had determined that
the elevation of the “purchase line” would coincide with the 318.0-foot NGVD contour. Based on
the 318.0-foot NGVD contour line, the “purchase line” associated with the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project encompasses an area of approximately 11,837.0 surface acres, inclusive of the
10,144.0-acre normal pool.
The proposed dam site would be located on Mud Creek approximately 4.8 kilometers
(3.0 miles) downstream (south) of US Highway 79 (US 79) in Cherokee County. The proposed
dam would be constructed of earthen fill material with an impervious clay core, cutoff to control

viii

subsurface seepage, and soil cement to maintain stability. The structure would be 2,073.2 meters
(6,800.0 feet) in length and 22.6 meters (74.0 feet) high with a top elevation of 336.0 feet NGVD.
The dam would contain outlet works consisting of two 48-inch-diameter pipes. The concrete
service spillway would be established at an elevation of 315.0 feet NGVD and would extend
approximately 61.0 meters (200.0 feet) in length. The emergency spillway would be constructed
as a 335.4-meter- (1,100.0-foot-) long, earthen-bottom, grass-lined swale and would be
established at an elevation of 324.0 feet NGVD. The proposed dam and spillway facility covers
a 533.0-acre area.
Thus, for purposes of the baseline cultural resources survey, the APE of the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project was considered to cover a total area of 12,370.0 acres, inclusive
of the 10,144.0-acre normal conservation pool (defined by the 315.0-foot NGVD contour), the
1,693.0-acre area between the normal conservation pool and “purchase line” (defined by the
318.0-foot NGVD contour), and the 533.0-acre dam and spillway area.
In addition to the abovementioned components of the APE, the USACE projected that the
proposed Lake Columbia’s pool elevation would rise to 322.6 feet NGVD during a 100-year storm
event and estimated a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) elevation of 334.1 feet NGVD. The
design of the proposed Lake Columbia did not include any flood storage capacity, and all
floodwaters would be passed through the lake at the service spillway elevation of 315.0 feet
NGVD. Thus, the 100-year and PMF flood elevations were not incorporated within the APE, and
the APE did not include any additional landscape above the 318.0-foot NGVD contour (i.e., the
“purchase line”) except for limited areas of higher elevation encompassed within the dam and
spillway area. Also, no downstream impacts associated with the discharge of impounded water
had yet been identified; consequently, the APE did not include any areas located downstream
from the dam and spillway area. Finally, the quantity, locations, extent, and types of ancillary
facilities that may be associated with the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project had not yet been
identified; consequently, the APE did not include any ancillary facilities.
Baseline Cultural Resources Survey Results
The baseline cultural resources inventory survey resulted in the documentation of
37 previously unrecorded archeological sites, including 30 aboriginal sites, 4 historic-age sites,
and 3 sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural components. The historic
structures reconnaissance survey resulted in the recording of 8 historic-age resources, including
1 historic-age structure that was also documented as an archeological site (i.e., Historic Site 7
and site 41CE384 are the same). Seven of the historic-age structure sites are stand-alone
properties, while 1 resource—the African American Freedman’s community of Pleasant Plains—
consists of 9 related historic-age resources.

Archeological Survey
As discussed in the approved SOW for the baseline cultural resources investigations
(Owens 2005), Horizon developed a probability model prior to initiating archeological fieldwork
that stratified the APE into physiographic environments with “high” versus “moderate” and “low”
probabilities for containing cultural resources that could be located quickly using basic surveying

HJN 050082 AR

ix

Management Summary

techniques (i.e., pedestrian walkover and shovel testing). Dr. Timothy K. Perttula of Archeological
& Environmental Consultants, LLC (AEC), as well as Robert Cast, Tribal Historic Preservation
Officer (THPO), and Bobby Gonzales of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, assisted with the
development of the probability model. It should be noted that the high-probability landforms
identified in the model tended to represent likely locations for later prehistoric (i.e., Caddoan)
archeological sites and, to a lesser degree, earlier prehistoric sites. Earlier prehistoric sites may
be located on any type of physiographic landform, including those defined as high-, moderate-,
and low-probability, but low-probability environments, as defined here, generally consisted of
marshy lowlands that are difficult to survey using conventional techniques. Thus, the probability
model was designed to maximize the number of sites that could be documented given the financial
and time constraints available for fieldwork rather than to provide a 100% inventory of all sites
that may be present within the APE.
A total of 208 high-probability areas (HPA) were identified inside of and adjacent to the
APE that covered a cumulative area of 2,064.0 acres. All or portions of 160 of these 208 HPAs
fell within the boundaries of the APE, covering a total area of 1,272.0 acres, or approximately
10% of the 12,370.0-acre APE. HPAs for aboriginal cultural resources included alluvial formations
on floodplains, along valley margins, and at the mouths of tributary streams where they discharge
into lower-order stream floodplains. In Mud Creek, such areas included sandy ridges bordering
stream meander scars on the floodplain; alluvial fans and terraces on the floodplain, along valley
margins, and at the mouths of tributary streams; similar landforms along higher-order tributary
streams; topographically elevated ridges and rises in otherwise low-lying, partially or totally
inundated floodplain settings; alluvial and/or colluvial landforms at the mouths of tributary streams
where they discharge into the Mud Creek floodplain; and upland settings near springs or other
perennial water sources. During the archeological fieldwork, Horizon surveyed high-probability
landforms located within the APE as well as areas within the APE located adjacent to highprobability landforms located just beyond the APE. While a small fraction of the HPAs were not
surveyed due to their relative inaccessibility and time constraints, the vast majority of these
landforms were surveyed for cultural resources.
Moderate-probability areas (MPA) for aboriginal cultural resources included areas lying
between high-probability landforms along valley margins outside of seasonally or permanently
inundated floodplains. MPAs were not specifically delineated on project maps or quantified by
number or acreage but rather were identified during the fieldwork. MPAs were surveyed for
cultural resources opportunistically based on available time and accessibility, usually while field
crews were moving from one HPA to another.
Low-probability areas (LPA) for cultural resources included low-lying, permanently or
seasonally inundated floodplain settings; steeply sloping valley margins; some landforms lacking
a developed B horizon; and some upland settings. Floodplain settings in general have a low
probability for historic-age cultural resources, though elevated alluvial formations may represent
suitable historic-age habitation sites. Steep valley margins (i.e., those with slopes greater than
ca. 20%) have a low potential to contain any cultural resources. LPAs also included any landform
that had experienced extensive damage from natural (e.g., erosion, bioturbation) or artificial (e.g.,
construction, timber clearing, plowing, residential and commercial development) impacts. LPAs

x

also were not specifically delineated prior to the beginning of fieldwork, but were expected to be
largely coextensive with the bottomland wetland environments identified during earlier wetland
studies. A small sample of LPAs was surveyed opportunistically as time and accessibility allowed,
though the low-lying portions of the Mud Creek and tributary floodplains near the primary stream
channels and channel meanders were not surveyed.
Horizon performed the baseline archeological survey between February 13 and April 12,
2006, resulting in the documentation of 37 newly recorded archeological sites, including
30 aboriginal sites, 4 historic-age sites, and 3 sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age
cultural components. The majority of archeological investigations were performed by Horizon,
though Dr. Timothy K. Perttula of AEC assisted with classification of aboriginal ceramic artifacts
following completion of the survey, and AEC employees Bo Nelson and Mark Walters assisted
with the first day of the archeological field survey. Based on available information, cultural
components on aboriginal sites consist of approximately equal numbers of ceramic sherd and
lithic artifact scatters that likely represent a range of Caddoan campsites, hamlets, and villages
on the one hand, and lithic artifact scatters that may represent aceramic Caddoan or Early
Ceramic sites or earlier PaleoIndian or Archaic period encampments on the other hand. In
addition, Early Ceramic period components are suspected to exist on several sites that also have
Caddoan components, and 1, or possibly 2, single-component Early Ceramic period sites were
also identified. Based on available data, Archaic, Early Ceramic, and Caddoan period
components are likely represented among the archeological sites, providing evidence of
aboriginal occupation in the Mud Creek basin as early as the Early or Middle Archaic period (ca.
7000 or 4500 to 3000 B.C.) and extending through the Late Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1400 to
1680). No definitive cultural components associated with earlier PaleoIndian or Early Archaic
periods were documented, though any of the aceramic lithic scatter sites may be found to date to
these early periods, and an isolated Calf Creek projectile point recorded as site 41CE374 may
suggest either an Early or Middle Archaic period presence. Similarly, no clear evidence of
protohistoric or early historic aboriginal components has been observed to date. Many of the
aboriginal sites appear to contain multiple cultural components, but these often cannot be clearly
separated based on available information. Historic-age components documented on multiplecomponent sites and on exclusively historic-age sites include farmsteads, possible industrial
features, and bridges, dating mainly from the late 19th to early 20th centuries.
Based on data gathered during the baseline survey investigations, 36 of the
37 archeological sites (41CE367-380 and 41CE382-403) were recommended as being of
unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Section 106 of the NHPA and for designation
as SALs under the Antiquities Code of Texas. One site (41CE381) was recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No further investigations were
recommended on site 41CE381, but further testing and/or archival research would be necessary
to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining 36 sites. It should be noted that a
standing historic-age structure present on site 41CE384, a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house, was
determined by the THC to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C in the area of
Architecture and Criterion A in the area of Settlement (see below); however, the archeological
deposits on this site are of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D based
on their research value. The THC concurred with these recommendations, which were presented

HJN 050082 AR

Management Summary

in Horizon’s 2006 interim report (Owens et al. 2006), in a comment letter addressed to the USACE
dated January 10, 2007.
In addition to the 37 archeological sites, 25 isolated occurrences (IOs) of artifacts were
recorded during the baseline archeological survey. In general, whenever any cultural materials
were observed during the survey, the area surrounding the initial find was further shovel tested to
determine the nature, extent, and quantity of any associated cultural materials. By definition, IOs
were cultural resources localities that did not warrant formal designation as archeological sites
because cultural resources were present in extremely small numbers and lacked any contextual
associations that would help identify the functional or chronological associations of the items. In
practice, any occurrence of a single, isolated artifact in either surface or subsurface contexts that
lacked any apparent associations with other cultural resources or datable paleosols was
designated as an IO unless exceptional circumstances warranted its designation as a site (which
occurred only in 1 instance in the case of site 41CE374). Similarly, if very small numbers of
artifacts (4 or less) were found within a single shovel test and supplemental delineation shovel
tests failed to produce any further evidence of cultural materials, the artifacts from the single
positive shovel test were designated as an IO.
While the IOs encountered during the baseline archeological survey by definition lacked
sufficient manifestation of cultural resources to warrant designation as archeological sites, no
specific management recommendations are offered regarding the eligibility of these cultural
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Many of the IOs were found in
small clusters in proximity to 1 or more other IOs, in proximity to archeological sites, and/or in
proximity to landforms that may have represented possible locations for past habitation. Even
though additional delineation shovel tests surrounding these isolated finds failed to produce
additional cultural resources that would have resulted in recording of the cultural materials as
archeological sites, the surface and subsurface scatters of cultural resources on many of the
archeological sites documented during this project were relatively sparse, and many sites
contained far more negative shovel tests (i.e., shovel tests lacking subsurface cultural resources)
than positive ones (i.e., shovel tests containing subsurface cultural resources). As such, in the
event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future, additional survey
efforts may be needed in the vicinity of the locations of IOs make sure nothing was overlooked.

Geomorphological Reconnaissance Survey
The baseline geomorphological investigations were performed on March 22 and 23, 2006
(initial reconnaissance), and from May 22 to June 1, 2006 (baseline geomorphic survey). Dr.
Charles D. Frederick performed the baseline geomorphological studies with the assistance of
Reign Clark, Horizon Project Archeologist, running the backhoe for mechanical trenching
operations.
The work that was performed principally consisted of a limited
subsurface/stratigraphic examination of late Quaternary deposits at sample locations along Mud
Creek within the APE in order to form an impression of the temporal activity of the stream and the
potential of these deposits to contain prehistoric archeological sites.
The stratigraphy of Mud Creek was examined by means of subsurface investigations in
3 transects across the lower, middle, and upper reaches of the APE (designated as Areas 1, 2,

xii

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

and 3, respectively), and efforts were made to obtain a cross-section of the valley floor deposits
in each one of these areas by means of limited backhoe trenching and soil coring. The
geomorphic reconnaissance identified 3 alluvial stratigraphic units within the APE of the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. Unit 1 consists of a sandy Pleistocene terrace, Unit 2 consists
of first terrace fill, and Unit 3 is recent alluvium. Although none of these deposits were directly
dated, the field evidence suggests that 2 of the 3 units (i.e., Units 2 and 3) are of Holocene age
and have a potential for buried archeological sites. More detailed work within the APE may
discover additional alluvial units and allow for mapping of the units already identified, thereby
helping to refine expectations about the locations and depths at which cultural resources sites
might be encountered in areas outside the high-probability zones identified prior to the initiation
of the baseline archeological survey.

Historic Structures Survey
The historic structures survey and accompanying historical and archival research were
performed from March 18 to 22, 2006, and from May 30 to June 2, 2006, by Terri Myers and A.
Elizabeth Butman of Preservation Central, Inc. (PCI). A total of 8 historic-era resources, including
1 historic-era structure that was also documented as an archeological site (41CE384) were
recorded. PCI’s architectural historians examined 7 historic-age resources that had been
identified by Horizon during archeological field investigations (including the archeological site
containing a historic-age standing structure—41CE384). In addition, the architectural historians
discovered an 8th historic-age resource—the African American Freedman’s community of
Pleasant Plains—which consists of 9 related historic-age sites.
Historic structures survey efforts targeted specific resources within and in the vicinity of
the APE identified as being of historic age and potentially meriting further study. Under the NRHP
and the Antiquities Code of Texas, historic-age structures, objects, and districts are those of at
least 50 years of age. Any historic structures and objects dating to 1956 or earlier (i.e., 50 years
of age or older at the time the survey was conducted in 2006) were recorded. The historic
structures reconnaissance survey entailed documentation of the selected resources, most of
which consisted of front- or side-gabled frame bungalows and associated outbuildings dating to
the 1910s and 1920s. A ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house and a ca. 1955 Ranch-style house, plus
their associated outbuildings, define the apparent temporal limits of historical development among
the sampled population of historic-age structures.
Historic Site 1 consists of a ca. 1925 frame bungalow and a large horse or dairy barn.
Both resources were overgrown with vegetation, and related features, such as wells or cisterns,
were not observed. Historic Sites 2 and 3 are nearly identical, consisting of ca. 1925 front-gabled
bungalows and associated agricultural buildings, including barns and sheds. A single road
accesses these 2 sites, and small two-track lanes peel off the main dirt road in opposite directions
to the 2 farmsteads. Historic Site 4 is a ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow and chicken house.
Historic Site 5 consists of a ca. 1955 Ranch-style house and contemporaneous agricultural
outbuildings. Historic Site 6 contains a ca. 1940 front-gabled bungalow and a ca. 1965 sidegabled house (the ca. 1940 house is the newest of the frame bungalows in the APE and was
likely a pre-World War II farm house). Historic Site 7 is a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor plan house with

Management Summary

a hipped porch and exposed rafter ends more common to bungalows of the early 20th century;
like the other dwellings in the APE, this was probably a farm house.
Historic Site 8, the Pleasant Plains Community, contains the only civic properties observed
during the survey and appears to represent a rare example of an African American Freedman’s
Village formed after Emancipation. It consists of several farmsteads (Sites 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F, and
8G) with houses dating from ca. 1900 to ca. 1925, a cemetery (Site 8A) with headstones ranging
from 1883 to 2004, a possible former house site (8B), a ca. 1970 church situated on an earlier
church site (Site 8H), and a ca. 1920 school (Site 8I). Barns, sheds, and other agricultural
resources dating to the 1920s and 1930s stand near the houses on their 10.0- to 20.0-acre plots.
From the apparent construction dates, this community appears to have been founded in ca. 1870,
peaked in the 1920s, and declined thereafter, though it is still a functioning community today. The
only post-World War II construction in the community consists of a single manufactured house
erected on Site 8F and a now-vacant church building (Site 8H) constructed in the 1970s. The
Pleasant Plains Community is located approximately 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) east of the APE
along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 4727 in an upland setting between South Caney and Bridge
creeks. The resource was nevertheless recorded in order to evaluate the impact of any potential
indirect effects of the development of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir.
In Horizon’s interim report describing the results of baseline survey activities, Historic
Site 8, the Pleasant Plains Community, was recommended as being potentially eligible for listing
in the NRHP as a historic district (Owens et al. 2006). Historic Sites 1, 2, 3, and 7 were
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for listing in the NRHP. Further research was
recommended to determine the historic significance of these resources and to make final
recommendations regarding NRHP eligibility. Because of their age, condition, and/or extensive
alterations, Historic Sites 4, 5, and 6 were recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Based on its review of Horizon’s interim report, the THC determined in a comment letter
addressed to the USACE dated January 10, 2007, that a portion of Historic Site 1 (ca. 1925
bungalow only), Historic Site 2 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 3
(ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed
bungalow), Historic Site 5 (ca. 1955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), and Historic Site 6 (ca.
1940 bungalow and ca. 1955 side-gabled house) were ineligible for listing on the NRHP. The
THC further determined that a portion of Historic Site 1 (ca. 1925 barn only) and Historic Site 7
(ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) were eligible for listing on the NRHP and that Historic Site 8 (the
Pleasant Plains Community) was eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district.
Summary of Potential Impacts to Cultural Resources

Lake Columbia Impoundment
Construction of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir would result in the impoundment
of approximately 22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) of the Mud Creek basin up to the 315.0-foot NGVD
elevation contour. Any cultural resources located at or below this elevation within the APE would
be subject to permanent inundation and may be disturbed as a result of ongoing erosive actions.
Twenty-two of the 37 recorded archeological sites are situated entirely at elevations lower than

xiv

Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

315.0 feet NGVD and would be impacted by proposed reservoir impoundment. If any of these
22 archeological sites should be determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and/or for
designation as SALs, construction of the proposed reservoir impoundment would constitute an
adverse effect on any such historic properties.
One historic structures site (Historic Site 6) is similarly situated below 315.0 feet NGVD;
however, this site has been determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and would
therefore not constitute an adverse effect on historic properties.
Ongoing erosive forces associated with proposed reservoir impoundment may have
adverse cumulative effects on any historic properties located at or below the elevation at which
the normal pool would be maintained.
Additional survey would be necessary to inventory all cultural resources that exist within
the proposed impoundment area, and additional archeological testing and/or archival research
would be necessary to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of any known cultural resources
within the proposed impoundment area that are currently of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as SALs.

Lake Columbia Shoreline
The normal pool of the proposed reservoir would be maintained at an elevation of
315.0 feet NGVD, and ANRA would maintain additional acreage up to the 318.0-foot NGVD
elevation as a management zone. Three archeological sites and 6 historic structures sites are
located above the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation of the proposed reservoir but would be
located on or adjacent to the proposed shoreline. Eleven additional archeological sites would be
situated partially underwater (i.e., below the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation) and partially
along the shoreline (i.e., above the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation).
One of the 14 shoreline archeological sites (41CE381) was determined to be ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL and would therefore not constitute an
adverse effect on historic properties. However, the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining
13 shoreline archeological sites is currently unknown; additional eligibility testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to establish their significance.
Of the 6 historic structures sites located along the proposed shoreline, portions of Historic
Site 1 (the ca. 1925 barn) and Historic Site 7 (a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) were determined
to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP; as such, any impacts to these resources would constitute
an adverse effect on historic properties. The remaining historic structures within the shoreline
area, including a portion of Historic Site 1 (the ca. 1925 frame bungalow) as well as Historic Site 2
(ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and
agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow), and Historic Site 5
(ca. 1955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP; as such, any impacts to these resources would not constitute an adverse effect on
historic properties.

Management Summary

Ongoing erosive actions along the shoreline of the proposed reservoir impoundment may
have adverse cumulative effects on any cultural resources sites located in shoreline areas. In
addition, increased accessibility to the proposed reservoir shoreline may increase the potential
for vandalism to cultural resources sites located in shoreline areas and may result in adverse
cumulative effects to any NRHP- and SAL-eligible historic properties. Any NRHP- and SALeligible historic properties located along the proposed reservoir shoreline may experience
cumulative viewshed impacts as a result of proposed reservoir impoundment. In addition,
construction or ongoing use of any ancillary facilities associated with the proposed reservoir
located along the shoreline may result in cumulative direct or indirect impacts to any historic
properties situated in shoreline areas.
Additional survey would be necessary to inventory all cultural resources that exist within
the proposed shoreline area, and additional archeological testing and/or archival research would
be necessary to determine the significance of any known cultural resources within the proposed
shoreline area that are currently of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs.

Dam and Spillway
Construction-related impacts within the dam and spillway area may create adverse effects
for 1 archeological site (41CE387) located on the uplands overlooking Mud Creek on the eastern
side of the channel. However, based on available data, site 41CE387 is currently of unknown
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; additional eligibility testing
and/or archival research would be necessary to establish the significance of this cultural resource.
During the baseline cultural resources survey, 100% of the upland settings and immediately
adjacent sideslopes of the Mud Creek floodplain on which the proposed spillway facilities would
be built have been surveyed for cultural resources. However, virtually none of the floodplain
settings along the dam axis have been surveyed, and it is unknown whether or not any cultural
resources exist within the area in which the proposed dam would be constructed. It should be
noted that landscaping activities undertaken by a local landowner have resulted in fairly extensive
prior impacts to surface and near-surface sediments across most of the proposed dam axis area,
though it is currently unknown how deep these impacts may extend.
A total of 6 cultural resources sites, including 5 archeological sites (1 of which is also a
historic architecture site) and 1 additional historic architecture site, are situated within the APE
south of US 79, which is located about 4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) north of the proposed dam axis.
Portions of the APE south of US 79 have been suggested to represent possible sources of fill
material to construct the proposed dam. Borrow acquisition conducted in this area would
potentially have adverse effects on cultural resources located within borrow excavation areas or
along haul roads.
Management Recommendations
A baseline cultural resources inventory, including initial archeological, geomorphological,
and historic structures surveys, has been completed for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project.
Based on its review of Horizon’s interim report, which was presented to the USACE and the THC

xvi

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

in 2006, the USACE concluded that the survey was sufficiently extensive to develop a profile of
the types of cultural resources that are likely to exist within the APE or that would be affected by
construction of the proposed reservoir. One hundred sixty high-probability landforms, which cover
approximately 10% of the land area within the APE, were identified prior to initiating baseline
survey activities, and most of this land area was surveyed for cultural resources. However, many
of these areas were covered in a deep, sandy mantle that likely dates to the Holocene period and,
therefore, potentially contains deeply buried, subsurface cultural resources. Shovel testing was
unable to penetrate below the depth of sandy Holocene sediments in all areas, and backhoe
trenching was not conducted during the archeological survey due to landowner permission and
accessibility restrictions.
A total of 37 archeological sites, 7 historic-age architectural sites (1 of which was also
documented as an archeological site—41CE384), 1 historic-age community composed of
9 related historic-age sites, and 25 IOs were documented as a result of the survey. The baseline
cultural resources survey was conducted to provide the USACE with sufficient information to
characterize the types of cultural resources likely to occur within the APE, though it was beyond
the scope of the approved SOW to develop an exhaustive inventory of all cultural resources
located within the APE. The preliminary survey activities were sufficient to establish the range of
cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE, though a 100% survey of the
APE would be necessary to locate all cultural resources that may be potentially affected by
proposed project development in the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves
forward in the future. Furthermore, additional eligibility testing investigations and/or historical and
archival research would be necessary on 36 archeological sites that are currently of unknown
NRHP and SAL eligibility to determine their significance.
Based on data gathered during baseline survey investigations, 36 of the 37 archeological
sites (41CE367-380 and 41CE382-403) recorded during the baseline archeological survey were
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Section 106 of the
NHPA and for designation as SALs under the Antiquities Code of Texas. One site (41CE381)
was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No
further investigations were recommended on site 41CE381, but further testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining 36 sites.
The THC concurred with these recommendations in a comment letter addressed to the USACE
dated January 10, 2007.
While the 25 IOs encountered during the baseline archeological survey by definition
lacked sufficient manifestation of cultural resources to warrant designation as archeological sites,
no specific management recommendations are offered regarding the eligibility of these cultural
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Many of the IOs were found in
small clusters in proximity to 1 or more other IOs, in proximity to archeological sites, and/or in
proximity to landforms that may have represented possible locations for past habitation. Even
though additional delineation shovel tests surrounding these isolated finds failed to produce
additional cultural resources that would have resulted in recording the cultural materials as
archeological sites, the surface and subsurface scatters of cultural resources on many of the
archeological sites documented during this project were relatively sparse, and many sites
contained far more negative shovel tests (i.e., shovel tests lacking subsurface cultural resources)

HJN 050082 AR

xvii

Management Summary

than positive ones (i.e., shovel tests containing subsurface cultural resources). As such, in the
event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future, additional survey
efforts may be needed in the vicinity of the locations of IOs make sure nothing was overlooked.
Based on data gathered during baseline survey investigations, a portion of Historic Site 1
(ca. 1925 bungalow only), Historic Site 2 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic
Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed
bungalow), Historic Site 5 (ca. 1955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), and Historic Site 6 (ca.
1940 bungalow and ca. 1955 side-gabled house) are ineligible for listing on the NRHP. A portion
of Historic Site 1 (ca. 1925 barn only) and Historic Site 7 (ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) are
eligible for listing on the NRHP, and Historic Site 8 (Pleasant Plains Community) is eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district.
In the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future,
additional cultural resources investigations, including 100% completion of the cultural resources
survey, additional geomorphological studies, eligibility testing of cultural resources for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs, supplemental historical and archival research, and/or
data recovery mitigation studies, may be required to comply with applicable federal and state
laws. However, no further cultural resources studies have been conducted in connection with the
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project since 2006, and the regulatory agencies and project sponsor
have concurred that it seems unlikely that such studies will be authorized within the timeframe
covered under the existing Texas Antiquities Permit. As such, no specific recommendations for
project clearance or for future studies are offered here; rather, this report is being prepared in
order for ANRA and Horizon to meet their mutual obligations under the existing Texas Antiquities
Permit, which requires that ANRA and Horizon complete the draft and final reports describing the
results of the baseline cultural resources investigations conducted to date and to prepare project
records for permanent curation. Thus, while additional cultural resources investigations may be
necessary in the event that the proposed undertaking moves forward in the future, this report
serves to fulfill ANRA’s and Horizon’s obligations under the existing Texas Antiquities Permit and
to bring to a close the current chapter of cultural resources studies for the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

No cultural resources management project is ever completed without the concerted efforts
of a diverse array of talented individuals. The current undertaking is no exception.
Kenneth Reneau, formerly the General Manager of the Angelina & Neches River Authority
(ANRA), served as the primary project contact at ANRA in 2006, the time at which the baseline
cultural resources studies described in this report were conducted. Kelley Holcomb, ANRA’s
current General Manager, has provided ongoing project updates to archeologists at Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), since 2006. At the time of the 2006 cultural resources
studies, Mr. Holcomb was serving as ANRA’s Operations Manager and accompanied Horizon’s
archeological survey crews into the field during several days of fieldwork. Mr. Holcomb’s ongoing
interest in the cultural resources dimension of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project has been
much appreciated.
At the time the cultural resources studies were conducted in 2006, Horizon was
subcontracted to RJ Brandes, the engineering firm overseeing development of the third-party
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. R.J. Brandes
and James Machin were Horizon’s points of contact during the 2006 studies, providing contract
management services and facilitating the flow of project design information between Freese and
Nichols, the engineering firm contracted by ANRA to design the proposed Lake Columbia dam,
spillway, and reservoir, and Horizon’s cultural resources staff.
Skipper Scott, the regulatory archeologist of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
Fort Worth District, provided invaluable permitting guidance and made himself available for
countless telephone calls, email inquiries, and meetings throughout the process of scoping and
completing the cultural resources studies described in this report. Mr. Scott’s extensive
knowledge of reservoir permitting and the history of prior archeological studies at other reservoirs
in Texas was invaluable throughout the project.
Bill Martin, James Bruseth, and Mark Denton of the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
participated in the development of the scope of work for the project. Mr. Martin of the THC’s
Archeology Division and Gregory Smith of the THC’s History Program reviewed the interim report
submitted in 2006 and provided comments that have been incorporated into the current report.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1

PROJECT PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION

In 2000, the Angelina & Neches River Authority (ANRA) applied to the US Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE), for a Department of the Army permit under Section 404
of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as well as
for water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA to discharge dredged and fill materials
into “waters of the US,” associated with the construction of Lake Columbia, a proposed circa (ca.)
10,000.0-surface-acre water-supply reservoir in Cherokee and Smith counties, Texas. This
proposed reservoir had been in the planning stages since at least 1978 and had been known by
various names, including Mud Creek Reservoir and Lake Eastex. In 2003, the proposed reservoir
was renamed Lake Columbia to honor the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia, which disintegrated
in the skies over northeastern Texas on February 1, 2003, while re-entering the earth’s
atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The proposed Lake Columbia reservoir would be
located on Mud Creek, a major tributary of the Angelina River, on the US Geological Survey
(USGS) Troup West, Tecula, Griffin, Jacksonville East, and New Summerfield, Texas, 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangles in USGS Hydrologic Unit 12020004 (Figure 1-1).
The proposed undertaking would involve the discharge of dredged and fill materials into
“waters of the US” associated with the construction of Lake Columbia. Proposed filling activities
would occur in conjunction with the construction of the dam, spillway, and staging areas and
impoundment of the reservoir. The project would impound approximately 22.5 kilometers
(14.0 miles) of Mud Creek and would inundate roughly 10,000.0 acres at a conservation pool
elevation of 315.0 feet above mean sea level (amsl) based on the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD). The project would impact approximately 5,747 acres of “waters of the US”
associated with clearing, excavation, filling, and inundation (USACE 2003).
The purpose of the proposed project was to provide water for a 5-county region of East
Texas, including Angelina, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, Rusk, and Smith counties. Lake Columbia
would impound approximately 195,500.0 acre-feet per year and provide a firm yield of
85,090.0 acre-feet per year. In addition to water supply, the East Texas Regional Planning Group
identified Lake Columbia as a potential water source for future steam electric power generation.
The proposed reservoir would also provide opportunities for aquatic-related recreational activities,
such as boating, fishing, and hunting (USACE 2003).

REGULATORY BACKGROUND

In 2000, the USACE received an application from ANRA for a Department of the Army
permit under Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as
well as for water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA to discharge dredged and fill
materials into “waters of the US,” to construct Lake Columbia. In 2004, in accordance with the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA [P.L. 91-190; 83 Stat. 852; 42 USC §4221 et
seq.]), the USACE determined that issuance of such a permit may have a significant impact on
the quality of the human environment and required the preparation of a third-party Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS). In the third-party EIS, the USACE would assess potential impacts
associated with a range of alternatives. ANRA secured funding from the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB) to fund the development of the third-party EIS. ANRA contracted
with RJ Brandes Company (RJBCO) to develop the third-party EIS, and RJBCO subcontracted
with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), to provide cultural resources inventory and
evaluation services and to assist with EIS document preparation.
ANRA’s application was reviewed in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 320-331, the Regulatory Program of the USACE, and other pertinent laws, regulations,
and executive orders. The USACE’s evaluation also followed the guidelines published by the US
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) pursuant to Section 404(b)(1) of the CWA. The
decision to issue a permit would be based on an evaluation of the probable impact, including
cumulative impact, of the proposed activity on the public interest. That decision would reflect the
national concerns for both protection and utilization of important resources. The benefits that
reasonably may be expected to accrue from the proposal would be balanced against its
reasonably foreseeable detriments. All factors that may be relevant to the proposal would be
considered, including its cumulative effects. Among the factors addressed would be conservation,
economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, historic properties, fish and
wildlife values, flood hazards, floodplain values, land use, navigation, shore erosion and accretion,
recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber
production, mineral needs, considerations of property ownership, and, in general, the needs and
welfare of the people.
Among the factors addressed in the third-party EIS, the potential impact of the proposed
undertaking on historic properties needed to be assessed. The USACE serves as the lead
regulatory agency for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project; as such, construction of the
proposed reservoir represents a federally permitted undertaking with the potential for damaging
or destroying historic properties. The project falls under the jurisdiction of existing federal laws
and guidelines designed to preserve and protect the nation’s cultural heritage, including
Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (P.L. 89-665; 16
U.S.C. 470 et seq.), as amended through 2000 (P.L. 91-243, P.L. 93-54, P.L. 94-422, P.L. 94458, P.L. 96-199, P.L. 96-244, P.L. 96-515, P.L. 98-483, P.L. 99-514, P.L. 100-127, P.L. 102-575,

of 1971, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment”; the Archaeological and
Historic Preservation Act (AHPA) of 1974 (P.L. 93-291; 88 Stat. 174; 16 USC §469 et seq.); the

American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) of 1978 (P.L. 95-341; 92 Stat. 469; 42 USC
§12996); and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990
(P.L. 101-601; 104 Stat. 3048; 25 USC §3001 et seq.).
In addition, ANRA, the project sponsor, funded the development of the third-party EIS
using a loan from the TWDB and would serve as the project sponsor for construction and ongoing
management of the facilities associated with the proposed Lake Columbia. Both ANRA and the
TWDB are considered subdivisions of the State of Texas for purposes of the proposed
undertaking; consequently, the project also falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977 [revised 1987], Title 9, Chapter 191), as amended
through 2009, and the regulatory oversight of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which
serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the State of Texas.
Under existing federal and state regulations, the USACE (under the NHPA) and ANRA
(under the Antiquities Code of Texas) were required to provide for an evaluation of the potential
impact of the proposed undertaking on significant cultural resources within the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE). The first step in this process involved developing an inventory of cultural
resources present within the APE and assessing the potential effects of the undertaking on
significant or potentially significant cultural resources. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, all
cultural resources investigations for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project must be performed
under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC.

1.3

DEFINITION OF AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECT

The APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project refers to the area that would be
potentially impacted physically, visually, audibly, and/or aesthetically by the proposed
undertaking. This includes direct impacts associated with the construction of project facilities and
impoundment of the reservoir as well as indirect impacts resulting from ongoing use and
maintenance of the reservoir and appurtenant facilities. By definition, the APE included the entire
area associated with the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project that would be covered
under the permit issued by the USACE. Based on consultation completed among the USACE,
ANRA, and the THC, the APE for purposes of the baseline cultural resources studies was
considered to include the normal conservation pool (i.e., the reservoir impoundment), the acreage
between the normal conservation pool boundary and ANRA’s “purchase line” or “fee line,” and
the dam and spillway area. The APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, as currently
defined, covers a total area of 12,370.0 acres (Table 1-1; Appendix A, Figures A-1 to A-2).
Lake Columbia Normal Pool
The normal pool (or conservation pool) refers to the average surface acreage of the
proposed reservoir under normal conditions (i.e., when the reservoir is not reduced by drought
conditions). ANRA had determined that the proposed Lake Columbia’s mean normal pool
elevation would be 315.0 feet NGVD (ANRA 2015). Based on the projected location of the dam,
the 315.0-foot NGVD contour line, as plotted on USGS topographic quadrangles, encompasses
an area of 10,144.0 surface acres, extends approximately 22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) north of

the proposed dam location, and averages about 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) in width (Appendix A,
Figures A-1 to A-2; see Table 1-1)1.
The 10,144.0-surface-acre area of the proposed Lake Columbia’s normal conservation
pool would be located primarily in central and north-central Cherokee County, extending a short
distance into southern Smith County, Texas. The normal pool would impound a large portion of
the floodplain of Mud Creek and portions of numerous Mud Creek tributaries, including Bear
Creek, Bell Branch, Birches Creek, Bridge Creek, 2 separate streams bearing the name Caney
Creek (herein referred to as North Caney Creek and South Caney Creek), Club Lake Branch,
Lavender Branch, West Mud Creek, and numerous unnamed tributaries.
Floodplain
environments in the Mud Creek drainage include a complex array of wetlands, abandoned and
active stream channel meanders, floodplain lakes, swamps, and bogs. Sandy ridges rise above
the inundated wetlands and marshes in many areas, and alluvial landforms are common along
valley margins and at the mouths of tributary streams where they discharge into the Mud Creek
floodplain.
Among the floodplain and valley margin environments that would be impounded by the
proposed Lake Columbia, normal pool inundation and dam construction would impact
5,747.0 acres of “waters of the US” (USACE 2003). Affected “waters of the US” would include
3,689.0 acres of forested wetlands (of which 3,652.0 acres are bottomland hardwood forest),
144.0 acres of scrub-shrub wetlands, 1,518.0 acres of emergent wetlands, 47.0 acres
(204,864 linear feet) of intermittent streams, 255.0 acres (370,128.0 linear feet) of perennial
streams, 63 acres of ponds, 0.5 acres of a forested hillside wetland seep, and 30.0 acres
(14,256 linear feet) of a channelized reach of Mud Creek. The proposed project would also result
in the inundation of 2,245.0 acres of deciduous upland forest, 235.0 acres of upland shrubland,
and 2,381.0 acres of upland grassland (USACE 2003).

Note that the projected surface acreage of the normal pool used in this report (i.e., 10,144.0 surface acres)
is based on the 315.0-foot NGVD contour developed by Freese and Nichols, Inc. (Freese and Nichols
2003). This estimate differs from ANRA’s current projected normal pool size of 10,133.0 surface acres
(ANRA 2015).

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Lake Columbia “Purchase Line”
The area covered under the USACE’s permit would also include the acreage between the
normal pool boundary (i.e., the 315.0-foot NGVD contour) and ANRA’s “purchase line” or “fee
line,” the outside edge of property that would be acquired by ANRA to contain the reservoir
impoundment and that would be maintained as a management zone. ANRA had determined that
the elevation of the “purchase line” would coincide with the 318.0-foot NGVD contour. Based on
the 318.0-foot NGVD contour line, the “purchase line” associated with the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project encompasses an area of approximately 11,837.0 surface acres, inclusive of the
10,144.0-acre normal pool (Appendix A, Figures A-1 to A-2; see Table 1-1)2.
The “purchase line” would completely encapsulate the projected boundary of the normal
pool, establishing a buffer area of approximately 1,693.0 surface acres between the boundary of
the 10,144.0-surface-acre normal pool (i.e., the 315.0-foot NGVD contour line) and the boundary
of the 11,837.0-surface-acre “purchase line” (i.e., the 318.0-foot NGVD contour line). Along steep
valley margins, the “purchase line” boundary extends only a short linear distance beyond the
normal pool boundary and encompasses only a few additional feet of landscape. In the
floodplains of Mud Creek and its tributary streams, where surface topography is more level, the
“purchase line” adds up to several hundred linear feet of additional landscape.
Lake Columbia Dam and Spillway
The proposed dam site would be located on Mud Creek approximately 4.8 kilometers
(3.0 miles) downstream (south) of US Highway 79 (US 79) in Cherokee County, approximately at
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates 297304.242 East and 3535573.434 North
(Zone 15) based on the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27) (USACE 2003). The proposed
dam would be constructed of earthen fill material with an impervious clay core, cutoff to control
subsurface seepage, and soil cement to maintain stability. The structure would be 2,073.2 meters
(6,800.0 feet) in length and 22.6 meters (74.0 feet) high with a top elevation of 336.0 feet NGVD
(ANRA 2015). The dam would contain outlet works consisting of two 48.0-inch-diameter pipes.
The concrete service spillway would be established at an elevation of 315.0 feet NGVD and would
extend approximately 61.0 meters (200.0 feet) in length. The emergency spillway would be
constructed as a 335.4-meter- (1,100.0-foot-) long, earthen-bottom, grass-lined swale and would
be established at an elevation of 324.0 feet NGVD (ANRA 2015). The proposed dam and spillway
facility covers a 533.0-acre area, including the floodplain of Mud Creek, associated valley
margins, and adjacent upland settings (Appendix A, Figures A-1 to A-2; see Table 1-1).

Note that Horizon’s projection of the 318.0-foot NGVD contour covers an area of 11,837.0 surface acres,
as opposed to ANRA’s currently projected 11,500-surface-acre area (ANRA 2015). At the time Horizon’s
projection was developed in 2005 during development of the scope of work for the baseline cultural
resources survey, ANRA had not yet developed an official projection of the 318.0-foot NGVD contour.
Horizon’s projection has been retained throughout this report as this projection formed the basis of the
baseline survey scope of work.

Facilities Not Included in the USACE Permit Area

100-Year Flood and Probable Maximum Flood Elevations
The USACE projected that the proposed Lake Columbia’s pool elevation would rise to
322.6 feet NGVD during a 100-year storm event and estimated a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF)
elevation of 335.3 feet NGVD (USACE 2003). The design of the proposed Lake Columbia does
not include any flood storage capacity, and all floodwaters would be passed through the lake at
the service spillway elevation of 315.0 feet NGVD. Thus, the 100-year and PMF flood elevations
were not incorporated within the APE, and the APE did not include any additional landscape
above the 318.0-foot NGVD contour (i.e., the “purchase line”) except for limited areas of higher
elevation encompassed within the dam and spillway area.

Areas Downstream of the Dam and Spillway
No downstream impacts associated with the discharge of impounded water had been
identified at the time of the baseline cultural resources survey; consequently, the APE did not
include any areas located downstream from the dam and spillway area.

Ancillary Facilities
Ancillary facilities associated with the construction and ongoing use and maintenance of
the proposed Lake Columbia may include, but are not limited to, borrow areas, construction sites,
equipment staging areas, temporary and/or permanent access roads built to facilitate movement
of construction equipment and/or future recreational traffic to the lake shoreline, temporary and/or
permanent utility lines, and water pipelines installed to transport water to and/or from the reservoir.
Ancillary facilities may also include parks, boating ramps, and other recreational facilities along
the lake shoreline. Furthermore, any cultural resources identified along the projected reservoir
shoreline may be subject to ongoing impacts not directly associated with reservoir construction,
and the USACE may require that the potential effects of the use and maintenance of the reservoir
on these cultural resources be evaluated, even if they are located adjacent to or beyond the
permitting boundary otherwise delimited by the “purchase line.”
The quantity, locations, extent, and types of ancillary facilities that may be associated with
the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project had not yet been identified at the time of project scoping
for the baseline cultural resources survey; consequently, the APE did not include any ancillary
facilities located beyond the boundaries of the APE as defined above. Any such facilities, such
as possible borrow or equipment staging areas, located within the 318.0-foot NGVD topographic
contour (i.e., the “purchase line”) can be considered to be included within the APE, though the
locations of any such facilities had not yet been specified.

PROJECT HISTORY

Formal consultation among the USACE, ANRA, RJBCO, and Horizon began at a project
kick-off meeting held at the USACE’s offices in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 6, 2005, and
preliminary details concerning the requirements for the third-party EIS in general, and cultural
resources investigations in particular, for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project were

HJN 050082 AR

7

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

discussed. Consultative discussions continued from May to August 2005 via telephone
conversations and in-person meetings, during which the third-party EIS and cultural resources
survey requirements were refined.
In regard to the cultural resources component of the larger third-party EIS effort, these
early conversations accomplished 3 primary goals:
1. Define the APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project that would be covered
under the current USACE permitting activity.
2. Identify the parties that would participate in cultural resources consultation in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
3. Define the minimum acceptable level of cultural resources management activities that
would be necessary to provide the USACE with sufficient information to issue a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic Agreement (PA), as appropriate,
for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project.
During the ongoing May to August 2005 conversations held among the USACE, ANRA,
RJBCO, and Horizon, the USACE initially stipulated that the entire APE would need to be
surveyed for cultural resources prior to development of an MOA or PA. The reason for the
USACE’s directive regarding survey coverage was that no prior cultural resources investigations
had been conducted within the APE; in fact, very few previous cultural resources studies had
been conducted in the surrounding region. As a result, virtually nothing was known about the
nature or quantity of cultural resources that may be expected to occur within the APE, and archival
research could not be expected to provide any information that would be directly relevant to
evaluating the potential effects of the proposed undertaking on historic properties.
The USACE therefore established that the third-party EIS process needed to incorporate
cultural resources investigations that would provide sufficient information on the nature, variety,
location, and significance of cultural resources for the USACE to prepare an MOA or PA, as
appropriate, a necessary step in the third-party EIS process. In order to develop the MOA or PA,
the USACE initially stated that it would require (1) a complete (100%) inventory of all cultural
resources that potentially may be impacted by construction of the proposed Lake Columbia, and
(2) sufficient information about the age, cultural affiliation, chronological sequence of cultural
deposits, and integrity of the resources to determine their significance, as measured by their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as
Texas State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). Thus, the cultural resources survey of the proposed
Lake Columbia APE would need to be complete, and all cultural resources that potentially would
be affected by the proposed undertaking would need to be documented to an adequate extent to
determine their significance. As it is rarely possible to make firm eligibility assessments based
only on survey-level data, the USACE indicated that it may additionally be necessary to complete
some initial level of eligibility testing on some of the sites to supplement survey-level information.
In August 2005, Horizon developed a Draft Scope of Work (Draft SOW) for the cultural
resources survey of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. The Draft SOW was designed to
accommodate the USACE’s requirements as defined to date and included provisions for an

8

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

intensive archeological survey, an intensive geomorphological study, a historic structures
reconnaissance survey, and historical and archival research that would allow for the beginnings
of a historic context to be developed for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. It was already
clear at this point, however, that the financing available to fund the development of the third-party
EIS and to perform appurtenant studies, such as the cultural resources investigations, would be
insufficient to allow for an intensive cultural resources inventory of the entire 12,370.0-acre APE.
Consequently, the Draft SOW proposed to stratify the physiographic environments encompassed
within the APE into areas with “high” versus “moderate” and “low” probabilities to contain cultural
resources and to focus cultural resources survey activities on “high-probability” landforms to
maximize the amount of data collected during the survey given the available resources. By
surveying only a portion of the APE, the Draft SOW provided for documenting a sample of cultural
resources that may be expected to occur within the APE rather than developing an exhaustive
inventory. The Draft SOW was submitted to the USACE, the THC, and the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma (Caddo Nation) for review on August 26, 2005. At the same time, Horizon submitted
an application form for a Texas Antiquities Permit to the THC based on the methodology outlined
in the Draft SOW.
On September 30, 2005, the THC issued correspondence containing its comments on the
Draft SOW to the USACE. In general, the THC concurred with the survey and analysis methods
presented in the Draft SOW; however, the THC expressed concern that the APE should be
expanded to cover the 100-year flood and PMF elevations as well as any downstream areas that
may be affected by water releases from the dam. The THC also stated that all ancillary facilities
associated with the undertaking should be included in the APE.
The Caddo Nation offered its comments on the Draft SOW in correspondence dated
November 3, 2005. The Caddo Nation expressed its concerns that the Draft SOW did not provide
for identifying Traditional Cultural Properties (TCP) and requested that the Caddo Nation be
invited to participate in the consultative process to resolve any adverse effects to TCPs.
The USACE offered its comments on the Draft SOW and its responses to the THC’s and
Caddo Nation’s concerns in correspondence dated November 1, 2005. In general, the USACE
concurred with the recommended cultural resources survey strategy with a few minor revisions.
First, the USACE agreed that segmenting the APE into environments with higher and lower
probabilities for cultural resources was reasonable; however, the USACE stressed the importance
of expending a sufficient level of field effort and wisely concentrating subsurface testing options
to maximize the information return of such a probability model. Second, the USACE requested
clarification that all artifacts found on cultural resources sites would remain the property of the
landowners since all property within the APE was privately owned at the time. Third, the USACE
indicated that the objectives of the intensive geomorphic investigations may be too ambitious for
the current stage of work and allowed that some of the more intensive studies could be postponed
until a future phase of investigations. Fourth, in response to the Caddo Nation’s concerns, the
USACE provided language to be included in the SOW indicating that independent consultation
would be initiated with the Caddo Nation on a government-to-government basis to resolve the
Caddo Nation’s concerns about TCPs. Finally, the USACE responded to the THC’s comments
about the extent of the APE, expressing that the reservoir design did not provide for any flood-

storage capacity and that no plans had been announced to purchase flood easements or retain
high flows, effectively limiting the APE for the current phase of investigations to that described
previously in this chapter.
In November 2005, Horizon developed a Final Scope of Work (Final SOW) incorporating
the USACE’s requested revisions and responses to the THC’s and Caddo Nation’s comments
(Owens 2005). Based on the USACE’s November 1, 2005, comments, the geomorphological
investigations were abbreviated, though the proposed methodologies for the archeological
survey, historic structures reconnaissance survey, and historical and archival research were not
adjusted at this time. Language was added to the Final SOW expressing that the USACE would
consult with the Caddo Nation to develop a strategy for addressing the Caddo Nation’s concerns
about TCPs separately from the archeological, geomorphological, and historical studies being
conducted as part of the third-party EIS process, and the discussion of the artifact collection policy
was updated to reflect that the entire APE was under private ownership. The Final SOW was
submitted to the agencies on December 2, 2005.
Formal comments were not received on the Final SOW from the USACE, the THC, or the
Caddo Nation, and the THC granted Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4005 on January 12, 2006, to
ANRA and Horizon to perform the cultural resource investigations described in the Final SOW.
At this time, ANRA and RJBCO notified Horizon of additional financial constraints that arose
subsequent to agency acceptance of the Final SOW. In response, Horizon formulated a
condensed cultural resources inventory proposal that abbreviated the level of effort of both the
archeological and geomorphological surveys still further yet still provided the USACE with
sufficient information to characterize cultural resources within the APE, though not to the same
degree as proposed in the Final SOW. In effect, the revised Final SOW would focus archeological
survey activities on “high-probability” environments, with attention paid to “moderate-“ and “lowprobability” settings only on an opportunistic basis; eliminate any eligibility testing on archeological
sites of unknown significance; and further reduce the level of geomorphological investigations.
Horizon, RJBCO, and ANRA arranged a conference call with the USACE to discuss the revised
plan on January 13, 2006. The USACE concurred during the conference call and in a follow-up
e-mail dated February 7, 2006, that the revised work plan would be sufficient to accomplish the
most immediate goals of the third-party EIS, but stipulated that additional archeological and
geomorphological investigations would likely be required at a later time to complete the originally
scoped inventory activities.
Thus, the final approved Scope of Work, hereafter referred to simply as the “approved
SOW,” proposed to survey a sample of high-probability environments within the overall Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project APE in the interest of obtaining representative information about
the types of cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE. The purpose of this
sample survey strategy was to provide the USACE with enough information to characterize the
types of cultural resources that are likely to occur within the APE rather than to provide an
exhaustive listing of all cultural resources that actually exist within the APE. As this survey was
not designed to provide 100% intensive survey coverage of the APE, it was designated as a
baseline, or “Phase 1a,” cultural resources study to distinguish this phase of survey-level

investigations from any future survey activities that may be necessary to develop a
comprehensive inventory of cultural resources within the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE.
Horizon completed the baseline cultural resources survey activities covered under the
approved SOW between February and June 2006 and prepared an interim report describing the
results of the baseline investigations (Owens et al. 2006). This interim report was requested by
the USACE as a management tool to assist the agency in permitting decisions regarding the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. However, the interim report focused almost exclusively on
presenting cultural resources site descriptions; as such, it did not meet the reporting requirements
of a formal technical report suitable for review by the regulatory agencies under the THC’s Rules
of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The interim report was approved by
ANRA and submitted to the USACE and THC for review. The USACE approved the interim report
as a management tool for use in the development of the third-party EIS being prepared by
RJBCO, and Horizon prepared a summary of results of the baseline cultural resources survey
activities for inclusion in the third-party EIS.
Based on their reviews of Horizon’s interim report describing the results of the baseline
cultural resources studies (Owens et al. 2006), both the USACE and THC concurred that
additional cultural resources survey, testing, and possible data recovery mitigation studies may
be required to complete ANRA’s cultural resources obligations under applicable state and federal
laws in the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future.
However, to date, the USACE has not yet approved the third-party EIS or issued a permit
authorizing the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, and no further cultural resources studies
have been conducted in connection with the project since the submission of the interim report of
the baseline cultural resources survey to the USACE and THC in 2006.
Nevertheless, Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4005, issued by the THC to ANRA and Horizon
for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project on January 12, 2006, covering a period of 10 years,
is set to expire on January 12, 2016. In May 2015, ANRA and Horizon consulted with the USACE
and THC regarding the current status and future prospects of the proposed undertaking as well
as the outstanding items remaining to be completed to fulfill the terms and conditions of the
existing Texas Antiquities Permit. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, ANRA and Horizon are
required to (1) prepare draft and final technical reports suitable for review by the regulatory
agencies under the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
CTA’s Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports, and (2) prepare project records
for permanent curation at an approved curation facility within the state of Texas.
While additional cultural resources investigations, including 100% completion of the
cultural resources survey, eligibility testing of cultural resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs, supplemental historical and archival research, and/or data recovery
mitigation studies, may be required in the future to comply with applicable federal and state laws,
no further cultural resources studies have been conducted in connection with the Lake Columbia
Water Supply Project since 2006, and the agencies have concurred that it seems unlikely that
such studies will be authorized within the timeframe covered by the existing Texas Antiquities
Permit. As such, in order for ANRA and Horizon to meet their mutual obligations under the

HJN 050082 AR

11

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

existing Texas Antiquities Permit, Horizon was authorized to complete the draft and final reports
describing the results of the baseline cultural resources investigations conducted to date and to
prepare project records for permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). All cultural materials collected from archeological sites during the baseline survey were
recovered from privately owned land. As stipulated in the approved SOW, all artifacts collected
from private lands remain the property of the landowners. As such, Horizon will return all artifact
collections to ANRA following successful completion of the Texas Antiquities Permit to be
distributed by ANRA to the appropriate landowners. Thus, while additional cultural resources
investigations may be necessary in the event that the proposed undertaking moves forward in the
future, this report serves to fulfill ANRA’s and Horizon’s obligations under the existing Texas
Antiquities Permit and to close the current chapter of cultural resources studies for the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

This chapter presents an overview of the environmental characteristics of Northeast Texas
in general, with an emphasis on the Angelina and Neches river valleys whenever possible and
the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project vicinity in particular. This discussion aims to provide a
general picture of the natural environment of the APE based on readily available published
resources.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Lake Columbia Water Supply Project area is located in Cherokee and Smith counties
in Northeast Texas within the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1938:605-630).
Environmentally, the Gulf Coastal Plain is characterized as:
an area where the temperate southeastern woodlands gradually give way to the grasslands
of the plains. It is a land of mixed forests, pine barrens, open savannas, tall grass prairies,
and littoral marshes. Much of the terrain is gently rolling but mountains (the Ouachitas)
and costal flats are to be found in the northern and southern margins of the region,
respectively. A number of perennial rivers and streams cross the area, ending in the deltas
and bays along the…Gulf of Mexico (Story and Guy 1990:2).

Northeastern Texas supports 3 major physiographic communities— the Blackland Prairie,
the Post Oak Savanna (or Oak Woodlands), and the Pineywoods (Diamond et al. 1987). The
Blackland Prairie is a narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to the
west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east. This area consists of low, rolling land that extends in
a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in
Northeast Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic
relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very
gentle gradients. The Blackland Prairie supports a tall-grass community that commonly includes
such species as little bluestem, yellow Indian grass, big bluestem, switchgrass, and various forbs
(Diamond et al. 1987:209, 211). The distribution of the tall-grass prairie is closely related to
patterns of rainfall and soil character, as the prairie tends to occur in areas that receive less than
40 inches of rain annually and that have clayey, calcareous soils (Collins and Bousman 1990:29).
The Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods support medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests, and shortleaf loblolly pines are common in the Pineywoods on upland fine sandy loam

13

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

soils with adequate moisture. Small areas of tall-grass prairie may occur in both communities (cf.
Jordan 1981). The Post Oak Savanna is a narrow, southwest-to-northeast-trending woodland
belt that marks a natural transition zone, or ecotone, between the more xeric Blackland Prairie to
the west and the more mesic Pineywoods to the east (Kuchler 1964). The Post Oak Savanna is
composed primarily of post oak, blackjack oak, hickory, pecan, and ash (Kuchler 1964).
The Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE is situated within the Pineywoods, the
dominant vegetation region of Northeast Texas. The Pineywoods region is composed of 2 distinct
forest communities—mixed pine-hardwood forest and longleaf pine forest. The mixed pinehardwood forest, the specific vegetation region within which the Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project area is located, is characterized by medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous hardwoods,
including a wide variety of oak, elm, hickory, maple, sweetgum, and other mesic species. In some
cases, the presence of pine represents a subclimax vegetation association. The longleaf pine
forest is most common in the southern part of Northeast Texas, extending south to the coastal
prairies of Southeast Texas. Longleaf, shortleaf, and loblolly pines, as well as a variety of
hardwoods such as oak, hickory, beech, birch, gum, and magnolia, as well as tupelo and bald
cypress in swampy floodplain areas, are constituents of this vegetation region. Within both
Pineywoods vegetation communities, bottomland forests and wetlands are common. These
communities are dominated by hardwood and swamp forests, marsh and bog vegetation, herbs,
shrubs, and other plants that tolerate extended periods of stream overflow. Common trees in
these habitats are sweetgum, black tupelo, elm, green ash, bald cypress, water oak, overcup oak,
cottonwood, black willow, and American hornbeam (Diamond et al. 1987:212). Herbs, shrubs,
ferns, cane, wax myrtle, sassafras, holly, yaupon, cane, and buttonbush occur along the margins
of marshes, bogs, and channel lakes and sloughs.
As a result of moderately high rainfall and extensive aquifers, perennial rivers and streams
are common across most of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Story 1990:8-9). With the exception of some
small coastal streams, 6 major river basins occur in this region—the Brazos, Neches, Red,
Sabine, San Jacinto, and Trinity—all of which flow in a more or less southeasterly direction and
discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. Under current climatic conditions, all of the larger rivers are
reliable sources of surface water, though smaller streams are more variable. The most
dependable are those that receive groundwater discharge and delayed runoff (Thurmond
1981:29-36). The least reliable are those fed solely by direct runoff. Two other sources of surface
water, lakes and springs, also occur in the area. With the exception of Caddo Lake (a natural,
albeit artificially enlarged, impoundment) on the Cypress River and lakes on the Red and lower
Brazos floodplains, most lakes in the region occur on smaller streams, are dry at least part of the
year, and have minimal subsistence value. Springs are fairly numerous in the region, and even
high-order streams in the region often have sustained water flow because they are fed by
groundwater discharge and aquifers (Story 1990:8-9). Changing land use practices, farming, and
erosion have caused many springs to dry up over the last 150 years or to have a much reduced
flow (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:38).
Cherokee County is extensively dissected by creeks and rivers. The 3 main drainages—
the Neches River on the west, the Angelina River on the southeast, and Mud Creek in the eastern
part of the county—have broad, poorly drained floodplains. The Lake Columbia Water Supply

14

Project’s APE is situated in the Mud Creek drainage. Mud Creek flows generally southsoutheasterly to its confluence with the Angelina River approximately 24.1 kilometers (15.0 miles)
south-southeast of the proposed location of the Lake Columbia dam. The Angelina River, in turn,
flows southeastwards about 128.7 kilometers (80.0 miles) to its confluence with the Neches River,
which in turn flows generally southwards and discharges into Sabine Lake, an inlet of the Gulf of
Mexico, in the vicinity of Beaumont and Port Arthur near the Texas-Louisiana state line.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The Lake Columbia Water Supply Project area is situated within the West Gulf Coastal
Plain physiographic province (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Sedimentary bedrock formations of
limestone and sandstone laid down during the Cretaceous Period parallel the margins of the
ancient, receding coastline of the Gulf of Mexico and crop out as cuestas or escarpments across
the generally southwardly dip of the modern land surface (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Little
internal relief over 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) occurs except along the eroded fronts of the cuestas
and in the ironstone hills (Fisher 1965; Godfrey et al. 1973).
Soils in Northeast Texas are divided into 2 broad groups—upland soils and alluvial valley
soils (Godfrey et al. 1973). Upland soils support tall grasses and hardwoods and tend to form
directly on bedrock, except where colluvial deposition has occurred during the Quaternary Period.
These soils vary from moist, acidic soils with a sandy to loamy surface horizon and clayey subsoil
to soils whose basic loamy surface horizons overlie clay-enriched B-horizons. Bone and shell
preservation is common in archeological deposits in the latter soils (Story 1990:9). Mixed
hardwood and pine forests occur on the acidic upland soils in Northeast Texas. Tall-grass prairie
occurs on the dark, clayey soils of the Blackland Prairie to the west of the APE (Perttula and
Kenmotsu 1993).
As a region, Northeast Texas exhibits relatively little topographic relief. The bedrock is
exclusively sedimentary and is not very resistant to erosion. Drainage is well developed, including
major river systems that arise both outside of the region (i.e., Red and Trinity) as well as within it
(i.e., Angelina, Attoyac, Cypress, Neches, Sabine, and Sulphur). Much of Northeast Texas is
dominated by fluvial transport systems in which streams tend to meander within their valleys,
locally cutting into the outer banks of bends and depositing sediment packages against the inner
banks of bends (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Valley soils are important archeologically because
they often contain stratified cultural deposits, usually in association with buried, cumulic soils.
Point bars, levees, and flood basins are distinctive geomorphic features that share the common
attribute of active aggradation. In theory, archeological sites may be expected to form in such
landforms and, depending on the rate of sedimentation and human occupation, may develop
internal stratification. To date, however, most archeological surveys conducted along streams in
Northeast Texas have documented almost no sites on levees or point bars (Hsu 1969; Anderson
et al. 1974; Bruseth et al. 1977). The low density of recorded archeological sites in such areas
likely results from the low site visibility and difficult survey conditions. In the Angelina and Neches
drainages, bottomlands support a diverse hardwood and swamp forest with natural levees, point
bar deposits, old stream channels, oxbow lakes, and backwater swamps. The low number of
archeological sites recorded in these drainages is almost certainly a function of the difficulty of

HJN 050082 AR

15

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

surveying floodplain environments partially covered by impenetrable swamps (Perttula and
Kenmotsu 1993; Pertulla 2004:370).
Natural lakes, ponds, and swamps are also common features of Northeast Texas
floodplains, and they typically represent sections of abandoned channels of rivers and streams
that have not been filled by alluvial deposits (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). Lakes generally
contain some open water, marshes are heavily vegetated (usually with grasses) but do not form
peat, and bogs are waterlogged and spongy areas in which mosses and other decaying
vegetation produce an acidic environment conducive to peat development. Lakes, ponds, and
marshes in Northeast Texas are generally of fresh water and form aerobic, basic environments—
they may contain excellent stratigraphic records and preserved bone, though they are not
conducive to botanical preservation. Bogs, on the other hand, are anaerobic, acidic, and may
have remained permanently saturated over long periods of time. Such environments are optimal
for the preservation of normally perishable artifacts (Chelf 1946) as well as the entire spectrum of
natural organic remains (Bryant 1989). Bog material is suitable for direct radiocarbon dating, and
the 2 pollen cores upon which much of the palynological record of Northeast Texas is based were
obtained from the Boriack and Weakly bogs in Lee and Leon counties, respectively (Bryant 1969,
1977; Holloway and Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). According to available vegetation data
(USACE 2003), a hillside seep or bog occurs within the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s
APE near the southern end of the conservation pool area that may be a suitable source of
important paleoenvironmental information.
Valley margins in Northeast Texas streams include colluvial slopes and occasional alluvial
fans. Such geomorphic features represent areas of natural deposition that may be well suited to
some kinds of human activity, a combination favoring the formation of stratified archeological sites
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The lower reaches of such features afford high ground adjacent
to flood basin resources, and archeologists commonly find sites in these settings in Northeast
Texas.
Aeolian landscape features pose a somewhat more complicated scenario in Northeast
Texas (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). These are extensive surficial sand deposits that are subject
to modification by wind at any time that vegetative cover is disrupted. Some indications of aeolian
modification of sand deposits have been noted in and near the region (e.g., Gunn and Brown
1982; Mandel 1987; Perttula et al. 1986), but the validity of some of these interpretations, the
possible extent of Quaternary aeolian-modified landscapes, and the timing of any increased
aeolian activity are in question.
Within the APE, the Mud Creek channel proper is represented as the Iuka-Bibb
Association, which consists of sandy and clayey soils on floodplains (Mowery 1948). East of the
Mud Creek channel, the APE is characterized by 2 soil associations, including the NacogdochesMagnolia-Bub Association roughly in the area south of New Summerfield, which is characterized
by sandy and clayey soils of the Redlands, and the Boswell-Susquehanna Association to the
north of New Summerfield, which is composed of soils with compact subsoils. West of the Mud
Creek channel, the APE is characterized by the Nacogdoches-Magnolia-Bub Association
extending from the southern margin of the APE to the area just to the north of US 79 and,

16

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

continuing northward, by the Bowie-Lakeland-Eustis Association, which is composed of sandy
soils with friable subsoils (Mowery 1948).
The APE is composed of a complex mosaic of 51 specific soil units (NRCS 2015). The
vast majority of these soil units consist of deep sandy, loamy, or clayey alluvial packages of
Holocene age found on floodplains or interfluves between stream channels. Appendix B presents
a series of soil maps displaying the distribution of NRCS soil units within the APE and an
accompanying listing of mapped soil units in tabular form.

2.3

CLIMATE

The environment in Northeast Texas has not remained the same throughout the ca.
12,000 years during which humans have lived in the region. Archeological, faunal, geological,
and pollen evidence suggest that significant changes have occurred, and these changes have
major implications for the development and maintenance of human adaptive strategies in the
region (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). At present, these changes are poorly understood as only
limited evidence of past environments prior to ca. 3,000 years ago has been obtained (Bruseth et
al. 1987; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins and Bousman 1990; Story 1990).
Evidence for climatic change from the late Pleistocene to the present is most often
obtained through studies of pollen sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Few pollen studies
have been conducted in Northeast Texas—to date, only a few studies from Buck Creek Marsh
and Jewett Mine have provided interpretable pollen data from this portion of the state (Jacobs
1991; Scott-Cummings 1991), but these are poorly dated or have serious gaps in their records.
Nevertheless, an important series of pollen sites occur in areas surrounding Northeast Texas (cf.
Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). The best dated and most informative pollen sequences come from
Boriack Bog in Lee County and Weakly Bog in Leon County (Bryant 1969, 1977; Holloway and
Bryant 1984; Holloway et al. 1987). The radiocarbon dates from Boriack Bog suggest a regular
accumulation of deposits and indicate that Boriack Bog surface sediments are approximately
3,000 years old. Bryant (1977) indicates that the bog was drained and the surface peat was
excavated in the 20th century; thus, the surface of the peat was lowered to sediments of that age.
Weakly Bog, by contrast, covers the last 3,000 years or so, and the bottom samples roughly match
the younger portion of Boriack Bog. Thus, Boriack and Weakly bogs cumulatively provide a
general picture of vegetation change throughout most of the late Pleistocene and Holocene
periods for this region of Texas.
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for East Texas that
includes 3 separate climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.),
the Late Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to
present). Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. The limited available evidence suggests
that the region was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods and
that, prior to ca. 10,000 years B.P., it was forested with species that prefer cool, temperate
conditions, including boreal taxa such as spruce (Bryant and Holloway 1985). This late
Pleistocene/early Holocene climate is inferred to have been cooler than today, with increased
precipitation and/or more effective moisture, but with perhaps less seasonal climatic constraints.

HJN 050082 AR

17

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The Late Glacial Period was characterized by a slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 2004)
during which the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak
savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial Period, the environment appears to have been more stable.
During the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 7000 B.P.), warmer temperatures prevailed, with less
moisture and presumably a lower density of forest cover. The deciduous forests were replaced
by prairies and post oak savannas. Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that significant
expanses of grassland were present along the western edge of the Northeast Texas region. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. In the middle Holocene, the period between ca. 7000 and
4000 B.P., much drier and warmer conditions may have characterized the region’s climate,
possibly resulting in even more widespread grasslands and replacement of forests along its
western edge. The forest cover in Northeast Texas is suspected to have been at its lowest density
during this time period (Collins and Bousman 1990:62).
Following the warm and dry interlude of the middle Holocene, environmental data suggest
that a gradual reforestation of the region continued into the late Holocene (ca. 4000 B.P. to
present). Collins and Bousman (1990) suggest that prairie areas were replaced first by oak
savanna, then by oak-hickory forest in the western part of the region and by oak-hickory-pine
forest in the eastern portions of the region. Bryant and Holloway (1985) suggest that essentially
modern environmental conditions in Northeast Texas were probably achieved by about
1,500 years ago.
Stable carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope analyses are becoming
increasingly important sources of information about past climatic conditions and changes. A
14,000-year stable isotopic record from the Aubrey Site in the Trinity River Basin in North-Central
Texas documents changing climatic conditions with wetter (and perhaps slightly cooler) or more
humid climates from ca. 11,000 to 7500 B.P., again between 4000 and 2000 B.P., and yet again
after 1,000 years ago (Humphrey and Ferring 1994; Perttula 2004:371). Conversely, the Aubrey
Site record suggests periods of warmer-than-present climate between 7,500 and 4,000 years ago
and between about 2,000 and 1,000 years ago. Interestingly, fossil vertebrate, pollen, and stable
isotope data from Central Texas and the Edwards Plateau tell a somewhat different story,
highlighting 2 dry climatic peaks between ca. 7000 and 3000/2500 B.P. and after 1,000 years ago
(Toomey et al. 1993; Perttula 2004:371). The timing and nature of such climatic changes have
major implications regarding the relative position of the prairie-forest border, the possible
presence or absence of bison, and the natural resource potential of the Pineywoods and Post
Oak Savanna.
The modern climate of the region is characterized as humid subtropical, with warm, humid
weather from the spring to the fall, and cool, humid weather in the fall and winter. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature. Summers are long and warm. Winters are short and
18

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

mild and are characterized by short periods of clear, cold, or freezing weather interspersed with
cloudy and rainy periods and clear, pleasant days. Extremely hot or cold temperatures are rare.
Sudden temperature changes are not very common during summer, but may occur frequently in
winter. Rapid drops in winter temperature are caused by cold waves or sudden, strong north
winds, though freezing weather is uncommon. Average winter temperatures range between
35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and average summer temperatures range from 85 to 95°F.
Valleys and low divides are often covered with frost on early winter mornings, but freezing
temperatures are of short duration. The average frost-free season is 246 days (March 15 to
November 16) (Bomar 1983; Mowery 1948:3-5).
The region is well watered—precipitation falls rather uniformly over the area and is fairly
well distributed throughout the year. Normally, it is heaviest in December, March, April, and May,
and lowest in August. Rainfall varies from year to year, but the average is about 45.0 inches.
Torrential rains fall occasionally, especially in winter and spring, and light snows fall occasionally
in winter but melt rapidly. Hailstorms are infrequent but do occur (Mowery 1948:3-5). Precipitation
generally increases from north to south across the region and decreases from east to west in a
clinal pattern. The wettest counties in the area (Shelby, Sabine, and San Augustine) receive more
than 48.0 inches of annual precipitation, while the driest counties (Fannin, Henderson, and
Anderson) receive between 36.0 and 40.0 inches of precipitation each year. Droughts are not
uncommon, and periods of lower summer precipitation are often accompanied by extended
droughts caused by warm continental Pacific air masses moving across the area from the west.
Dendrochronological analyses of tree rings suggest that numerous wet and dry spells
occurred during the last 1,000 years (Stahle and Cleaveland 1994, 1995). Dry conditions and the
worst droughts occurred in the late A.D. 1200s, in the mid-1400s and 1600s, and then again in
the mid-1700s (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). Stahle et al. (1985) suggest that the worst June
drought to occur in the past 450 years occurred during the period between A.D. 1549 and 1577.
More favorable conditions probably occurred during the intervening years, especially between ca.
A.D. 1390 and 1440, then again in the late part of the 16th and early 17th centuries (Perttula
2004:371). Such climatic perturbations presumably affected the predictability and success of
maize harvests during the Caddoan occupation of the Pineywoods and neighboring Post Oak
Savanna (Perttula 2004:371). Similar fluctuations throughout the Holocene would also have
affected the range, distribution, and abundance of naturally occurring plants and animals upon
which non-agricultural human populations relied.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Northeast Texas Archeological Region is situated within the Austroriparian biotic
province (Blair 1950). This province includes the Gulf Coastal Plain from the Atlantic Ocean to
eastern Texas, and its western boundary, which is approximated by a line running north from
western Harris County to western Red River County (Dice 1943), is the western boundary of the
main body of pine and hardwood forests of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. In Texas,
Austroriparian vegetation consists of 2 vegetation regions—the long-leaf pine and pine-oak forest
regions. The Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE is situated within the pine-oak forest
region.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The area within and surrounding the APE can generally be characterized as rural, with
land uses including both managed and unmanaged woodland, improved and abandoned pasture,
and sparse rural residential development (USACE 2003). Bottomland communities along the
Neches and Angelina drainages contain a diverse hardwood and swamp forest, with natural
levees, point bar deposits, old stream channels, oxbow lakes, and backwater swamps (Perttula
2004:370-371). Forested wetland areas located within the APE are typically situated within the
floodplain of Mud Creek or its tributaries and are dominated by a variety of trees and shrubs,
including willow oak (Quercus phellos), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), American elm (Ulmus
americana), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), water oak
(Quercus nigra), ironwood (Carpinus caroliniana), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), deciduous holly
(Ilex deciduas), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Scrub-shrub wetlands are
dominated by deciduous holly, buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), red maple (Acer rubrum),
eastern false-willow (Baccharis halimifolia), swamp privet (Fostiera acuminate), overcup oak,
black willow (Salix nigra), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), and American snowbell (Styrax americana).
Numerous herbaceous species are present in both forested and scrub-shrub wetlands, including
lizardtail (Seraurus cernuus), sedges (Carex spp.), smartweed (Polygonum spp.), and narrowleaved chasmanthia (Chasmanthum latifolia). Emergent wetlands are dominated by various
sedge species, rushes, smartweed, lizardtail, morning glory (Ipomea sp.), switch grass (Panicum
virgatum), and various species of bluestem (Andropogon sp.; Schyzachyrium spp.). In addition
to these herbaceous species, emergent wetlands support patches of trees and shrubs (USACE
2003).
Approximately 4,254.0 acres of the proposed Lake Columbia’s normal conservation pool
area consists of various types of upland areas, including forests, shrubland, and grassland. In
addition to waters of the US, these areas would be impacted as a result of the proposed project.
Forested uplands within the APE generally consist of a mix of hardwood and pine stands with
dense understories composed of trees, shrubs, and vines. These areas are typically dominated
by water oak, post oak (Quercus stellata), southern red oak (Quercus falcata), loblolly pine,
shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), sweet gum, winged elm (Ulmus alata), eastern red cedar
(Juniperus virginiana), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), American beautyberry, and
blackberry (Rhubus sp.). Upland shrubland consists of small tree species such as various elms,
various oaks, sweet gum, and pine, as well as a variety of shrub species such as eastern falsewillow, sumac (Rhus sp.), Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana), and rusty black-haw (Viburnum
rufidulum). Upland grasslands are dominated by Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), nettles
(Solanum spp.), and yankeeweed (Eupatorium compositifolium) (USACE 2003).
Northeast Texas has historically supported a diverse array of animal species. Large
mammals currently found in the timberlands include bobcat, coyote, and white-tailed deer.
Historically, the area also provided habitat for the Louisiana black bear and the red wolf. Small
mammals found in this region include more than 70 species of insectivores, bats, and rodents.
Fox squirrels, gray squirrels, and flying squirrels are found throughout the area. More than
300 species of birds have been documented in East Texas, some of which represent annual
migrations through the area. In addition, 59 species of reptiles and 30 amphibian species have
been recorded in the area, including 19 reptile species and 8 amphibious species that are closely
associated with aquatic habitats.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

This chapter presents an overview of the cultural history of Northeast Texas. This
discussion is intended to provide a general picture of the cultural and archeological background
of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project based on readily available published literature in the
interest of providing a context for evaluating appropriate survey methods for the baseline cultural
resources inventory. Whenever possible, this discussion emphasizes the cultural history of the
Angelina-Neches basin, paying special attention to the landforms and physiographic settings in
which archeological sites tend to be found.
The Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE is situated within the Northeast Texas
Archeological Region, a subdivision of the THC’s Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and
Pertulla 1993). The Northeast Texas Archeological Region encompasses a 31-county area
bounded on the north by the Red River, on the east by the Louisiana-Texas state line, partially by
the Neches River on the south, and by the Trinity River on the west. This region incorporates
segments or all of several prehistorically important river systems, including the Angelina, Cypress,
Neches, Red, Sabine, Sulphur, and Trinity drainages. The Northeast Texas Archeological Region
shares numerous similarities with adjacent portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and
Arkansas at various points in prehistory and history, especially during the Late Prehistoric
segment of the cultural sequence during which Caddoan peoples occupied the area.
The cultural history of Northeast Texas can be subdivided into 9 broad temporal periods,
although the historic period has been differentiated into overlapping Historic Caddoan and Historic
EuroAmerican periods to distinguish between the highly divergent historical experiences of the
indigenous Native Americans and EuroAmerican settlers during the settlement of Texas (Table 31).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9500 TO 7000 B.C.)

The initial human occupation of the New World can be confidently extended back before
10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; Meltzer
1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans were
present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al. 1990),
while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for human
occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer et al.
1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation in North
America during the Pleistocene glacial period.
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Northeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (ca. 9500 to 7000 B.C.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This period
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred endscrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns are known primarily
through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of small animals,
fish, and shellfish during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in Northeast Texas for
hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North America; rather, a
broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced until the Late Prehistoric period.
In nearby Central Texas, the PaleoIndian period is divided into 2 subperiods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period,
which is defined based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice,
and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate
points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
Undoubtedly, discrete PaleoIndian components are present in Northeast Texas, but they
have proved to be quite difficult to recognize and define (Perttula 2004:373). The Northeast Texas
archeological record for the PaleoIndian period consists largely of surficial, mixed, or isolated
finds of diagnostic projectile points (cf. Johnson 1989; Meltzer and Bever 1995; Story 1990).
Seriation of these projectile point styles is based on comparison with similar forms from well dated,
stratified archeological contexts to the east and west of the region (Anderson et al. 1996;
Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 2004; Meltzer and Bever 1995). At the Forrest Murphey site
(41MR62), for instance, Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, and other lanceolate projectile point forms and
tools were found in several discrete concentrations on an upper terrace above Big Cypress Creek.
The Delta Bone Quarry 5 (41DT86) on the North Sulphur River yielded a buried hearth and antler
tool (Slaughter and Hoover 1963, 1965), and charcoal from the hearth produced a calibrated 1sigma age of 9170 to 8082 B.C., broadly contemporaneous with Clovis, Folsom, and Dalton
complexes in adjacent regions (Perttula 2004:373).

PaleoIndian artifacts have been found at numerous archeological sites in the Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas (Bousman et al. 2004). Early PaleoIndian materials
include Clovis and Folsom fluted projectile points and scraping tools commonly manufactured on
high-quality, non-local raw materials (Story 1990:179, Tab. 44). Unfluted lanceolate points were
more common during the Late PaleoIndian period in the region, including Dalton (Johnson 1989;
Wyckoff and Bartlett 1995), San Patrice, and Scottsbluff points (Saunders and Allen 1997), as
well as early side-notched points and Albany beveled bifaces or knives (Johnson 1989; Webb et
al. 1971), Quince-style scrapers, end and side scrapers, denticulates, burins, and bifacial adzes.
San Patrice points and associated tools were typically manufactured from local raw materials
(Saunders and Allen 1997; Webb et al. 1971), although one unrecorded PaleoIndian site in Gregg
County, Texas, contains an abundance of large, early side-notched points crafted from novaculite
along with a Dalton point of Ouachita Mountains chert and a San Patrice lanceolate point made
from local raw material (Perttula 2004:373).
The distribution of PaleoIndian artifacts within the region suggests that these early
aboriginal occupations were principally situated within the valleys of major stream basins
(Anderson 1996a; Thurmond 1990; Perttula 2004:373) as well as in resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment to the north (Anderson 1996a). Anderson (1996a) hypothesizes
that the initial and most intensive PaleoIndian settlement of the Southeast (including Northeast
Texas) occurred in the resource-rich valleys of the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.
From there, PaleoIndian groups spread throughout the wooded Southeast and East, with
concentrations at 249.4- to 400.6-kilometer (155.0- to 249.0-mile) intervals. The relatively sparse
PaleoIndian archeological record, combined with the dispersion of artifacts across many different
landforms and physiographic settings, seems to indicate that PaleoIndian groups were highly
mobile, generalized hunters and gatherers rather than specialized hunters of extinct megafauna
(Fields and Tomka 1993), as has been inferred for PaleoIndian populations on the Great Plains.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 7000 TO 200 B.C.)

Throughout most of North America, the onset of the hypothesized Hypsithermal drying
trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period (ca. 7000 to 200 B.P.) (Perttula and Kenmotsu
1993). In many regions, this climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle—the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Northeast Texas, however, a generalized hunting and gathering
pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory prior to the advent of large-scale agricultural systems
during the Late Prehistoric.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late (or Transitional)
subperiods. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating
these 3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture have been noted as well. Johnson
(1962) employs archeological data from the Yarbrough site (41VN6) on the upper Sabine River
to bring chronological order to the diverse Archaic archeological record in Northeast Texas.
Johnson’s (1962) temporal divisions are based on projectile point sequences and on the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the Archaic period. More recent refinements of the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

projectile point sequence (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990) document straight and expanding-stem
forms characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic subperiods and contracting-stem darts during
the Late Archaic and subsequent Early Ceramic periods (Schambach 1982, 1998).
Paleoenvironmental research suggests that much of the Archaic period in Northeast
Texas, particularly the middle portion of the period, was drier than today, with apparent reductions
in biomass and local expansions of prairie habitats along the western margins of the region (see
Chapter 2.0, Environmental Setting; cf. Ferring 1995). While archeological data are still rather
limited, it appears that group mobility remained high for hunting-and-gathering populations during
the Early Archaic subperiod, and the subsistence base included hardwood nuts, deer, shellfish,
turtles, and small mammals. Excavations at the Conly Site (16BI19) in northwestern Louisiana
suggest that the Early Archaic inhabitants of the site “focused on deer and slack water aquatic
species, but a wide range of resources, from varied microenvironments, was exploited” (Girard
2000:63). Hickory nuts and acorns are also common occurrences in archeological deposits.
Anderson (1996a, 1996b) suggests that Archaic groups had highly mobile foraging adaptations
along the Red River, the central Sabine River, and in interior uplands away from major drainages,
and employed expedient lithic tool technologies. Thurmond (1990) suggests that group territories
were probably large and poorly defined and that sites were occupied repeatedly and recurrently
by small groups at this time.
By the Middle Archaic subperiod, fairly substantial and extensive occupations occurred
within the major basins in the region, with limited use of smaller tributaries and headwater areas
(Thurmond 1990). Middle Archaic components consist largely of open campsites dominated by
hunting tools, including the distinctive blade-notched Evans Point, and generalized cutting and
scraping tools, lithic manufacturing debris and cores, and groundstone tools (Perttula 2004:375).
Burned rock features, such as hearths, ovens, and roasting pits, and burned rock concentrations
have been documented at a few sites in the Sulphur River drainage (Cliff et al. 1996; Gadus et
al. 1992), though the large burned rock midden features that begin appearing in Central Texas
around this time appear to be absent in Northeast Texas. Lithic raw material data from a possible
Middle Archaic assemblage at Lake Fork Reservoir in the upper Sabine River basin suggest that
exchange of non-local raw materials, especially finished tools, was commonplace (Perttula 1984),
but raw material procurement and utilization patterns were not uniform across Northeast Texas
(Fields and Tomka 1993:92). Mound complexes dating to the Middle Archaic subperiod have
been documented in northern Louisiana, which suggests the development of more complex
hunter-gatherer societies in the Lower Mississippi Valley area at this time (Saunders and Allen
1997).
Late (or Transitional) Archaic sites are common in the Pineywoods and Post Oak
Savanna, occurring along major streams, near springs, on spring-fed branches, on upland ridges,
and on tributary drainages (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Cliff et al. 1996; Dixon et al. 1997; Thurmond
1990). In fact, the distribution of Late Archaic sites suggests that these groups ranged extensively
across almost every part of the region (Perttula 2004:375). In particular, Anderson (1996a) notes
major concentrations of Late Archaic sites along the Red and Little rivers in southwestern
Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana as well as in the Ouachita Mountains. A generalized
foraging adaptation appears to have remained the predominant subsistence pattern, and

24

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

population growth has been inferred based on the substantially larger numbers of sites (in
Northeast Texas, however, only 4 well-dated Late Archaic components have been documented).
Some Late Archaic components in riverine settings in the Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna
(e.g., the Yarbrough site on the Sabine River) contain earthen middens, but sites of this age
generally contain only small burned rock features (Cliff et al. 1996). Projectile points, bifacial and
flake tools, and lithic debris are common in Late Archaic artifact assemblages. Characteristic
projectile points include expanding-stem (e.g., Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas, Yarbrough) and contractingstem (e.g., Gary, Kent) styles. There is no paleobotanical evidence to indicate that Late Archaic
populations in Northeast Texas cultivated native plant species (such as sumpweed, sunflower,
and chenopod), as was the case in many parts of North America in the first millennium B.C. (cf.
Ford 1985; Fritz 1994). Extensive use of local lithic raw materials during the Late Archaic in the
Sulphur, Sabine, Cypress, and Angelina-Neches basins speaks to a more limited interregional
interaction at this time (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula and Bruseth 1995). In contrast, Late
Archaic sites in the Mississippi River basin of northern Louisiana are marked by large quantities
of non-local lithic raw materials, particularly novaculite and Boone and Pitkin cherts (Saunders
and Allen 1997).
While there is no evidence of prolonged sedentism in Northeast Texas in the Late Archaic,
the occurrence of relatively more substantial archeological components and an increased number
of sites have lead some researchers to infer a higher degree of sedentism in this area than in
surrounding regions of Texas (Perttula et al. 1993). Northeast Texas exhibits some similarities in
artifact styles with the Prairie-Savanna Archeological region to the west, possibly suggesting
increased contact or affiliation with people in that region (Story 1990:220). The large Late Archaic
cemeteries that form such a prominent part of the archeological record of the Southeast Texas
Archeological Region extend only to the western margins of Northeast Texas in the Trinity River
basin. Burial mounds occur in the subsequent Early Ceramic period, but these appear to “reflect
the emergence of more complexly organized local groups” (Story 1985:53) rather than an
extension of the Late Archaic mortuary pattern of the Gulf Coast.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (CA. 200 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), also known as the Woodland period
in adjoining regions (Perttula 2004:375-378)3, is characterized in much of Northeast Texas,
especially from the Sabine to the Red rivers, primarily by plain, relatively thick ceramic bowls and
flowerpot-shaped jars, double-bitted axe heads, smaller and thinner versions of Gary dart points,
and later in the period by corner-notched arrow points (Thurmond 1990). Early Ceramic sites
along the Red River in southwestern Arkansas and in Northeast Texas have abundant ceramics,
though many sites of this age, especially between the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, do not evince
such prevalent use of ceramics (Perttula 2004:376). This situation suggests regional differences
in food processing technologies and/or dietary habits, and may further highlight differences in the

3

This time period is herein referred to as the Early Ceramic period rather than the Woodland period
following Perttula et al. (1993:100) due to some divergences between Early Ceramic components in
Northeast Texas and more or less contemporaneous components in the Fourche Maline (Galm 1984;
Schambach 1982) and Woodland (Aten 1984; Shafer 1975) areas of the eastern and southeastern US.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

degree of sedentism among populations across the area (Skibo and Blinman 1999). Lower
Mississippi Valley ceramic styles (e.g., Tchefuncte Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville
Incised, Troyville Stamped, and Marksville Stamped) occur with some regularity at sites in the
Sabine, Sulphur, and Big Cypress basins (Story 1990). These ceramics may provide evidence
of contact and interaction between Trans-Mississippi South and Lower Mississippi Valley
populations, or they may represent the adoption of Lower Mississippi Valley stylistic and
decorative attributes by local potters (Perttula and Bruseth 1995; Schambach 1982, 1998).
The presence of grinding stones, projectile points, ceramics, and/or refuse pits at the Viper
Marsh and Mahaffey sites in Oklahoma (Story 1990:298-299), the Fish Lake Site in Arkansas
(Jeter and Mintz 1990), and the Sanders (41LR2), Hurricane Hill (41HP106), and other sites in
Texas indicates that both plant and animal resources were important during the Early Ceramic
period. The Early Ceramic inhabitants of Northeast Texas were still primarily hunter-gatherers,
though they may have lived in increasingly large groups and/or resided for longer periods of time
at certain sites (Perttula 2004:377). Larger villages and multiple mound centers begin to be
constructed during this period on the major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers). In the
Angelina and Attoyac basins, Early Ceramic period sites contain plain, sandy-paste ceramics of
the Mossy Grove tradition (Story 1990) as well as decorated ceramics of Lower Mississippi Valley
affiliation. Changes in the density and location of Early Ceramic sites, particularly in favor of
sandy interfluves, has led some researchers (e.g., Corbin 1998) to suggest that horticulture may
have been introduced into the Angelina-Neches basin at this time, though such measures may
also have been tied to “moving closer to a significant plant food resource (i.e., plants that were
restricted to valley margins and/or the floodplain) whose use was facilitated by processing via
cooking in ceramic vessels” (Corbin 1998:115). Settlement data from the McGee Bend area at
the confluence of the Angelina River and Attoyac Bayou indicates that middens and occupational
components range from 0.5 to 8.0 acres in size (Duffield 1963; Jelks 1965). Some sites have
relatively substantial midden deposits, particularly along the Red River and in the upper Sulphur
River basin (Fields et al. 1997; Schambach 1982), and some evidence for structures (probably
daubed pole and thatch structures), but the degree of settlement permanence is still less than
that seen in the subsequent, long-term, Caddoan settlements of Northeast Texas (Perttula et al.
1993:99).
On the basis of available paleobotanical information, Early Ceramic groups may have
cultivated squash (McGregor 1996) and used native seeds, tubers, and roots in addition to a
variety of woodland and aquatic animal resources (Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Early Ceramic occupations suggests that some level of
horticultural activity was occurring, though intensive use of colonizing weedy annuals may
similarly account for the presence of these implements. Bruseth (1998) has suggested that maize
was being cultivated during the latter portions of this period, but stable isotope analyses of some
25 or more Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and Formative to Early Caddoan human remains
indicate that maize was not a major part of the diet at this time (Rose et al. 1998). Early Ceramic
period burial mounds have been documented in bluff top and alluvial valley settings on the Red
River in northwestern Louisiana and southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1982, 1997; Webb
1984) and on the Angelina, Neches, and Sabine rivers in Northeast Texas (Story 1990). Mortuary
ceremonialism included the interment of costly, non-local raw materials and artifacts, including

26

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

chert, copper, and Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic vessels, in the burial mounds. Evidence of
mortuary or ritual practices also occurs in non-mound contexts such as the Hurricane Hill Site,
which contained a small cemetery on a prominent hill, and the Mahaffey Site on the Kiamichi
River in southeastern Oklahoma, which had a large cemetery with flexed and semiflexed burials
without grave goods (Perino and Bennett 1978). In the broadest sense, the establishment of
bounded cemeteries is often interpreted as a correlate of increasing sedentism in the western
Gulf Coastal Plain of Northeast Texas (Pertulla 2004:378).
Early Ceramic components are relatively common in the Angelina and Neches basins,
accounting for at least 25 to 50% of known prehistoric archeological sites in the Angelina-Neches
confluence area (Martin et al. 1995; Perttula et al. 1993). In the Angelina and Neches basins,
Early Ceramic sites are typified by sandy-paste pottery, small Gary points, and possibly Friley
expanding-stem arrow points. These sites typically occupy sandy ridges adjacent to stream
valleys, although components of this age have been noted in other sandy locations such as
alluvial fans.
Early Ceramic occupations in Northeast Texas are usually identified through 1 of
2 methods. One method involves the application of absolute chronometric techniques, such as
radiocarbon or thermoluminescence dating (Story 1990). Some of the dates that have been
obtained, however, derive from mixed contexts and may not be completely reliable, and most
excavated Early Ceramic period sites also contain Late Archaic and/or Formative Caddoan
components, thus creating “a degree of uncertainly in assigning some features and specimens to
the Early Ceramic components” (Story 1990:293). Early Ceramic period occupations may also
be identified by isolating components that contain sizable collections of Gary dart points or
expanding-stem arrow points (e.g., Friley), early types of ceramics (e.g., sandy-paste wares,
Williams Plain, Cooper Boneware [Schambach 1982]), and Marksville and Troyville types without
late arrow points or Caddoan ceramics.
Early Ceramic components commonly overlie Late Archaic components, and a number of
Early Ceramic period components occur in conjunction with Late Caddoan components as well.
Frequently, the components are difficult to separate. In fact, the association of Early Ceramic
materials with earlier and/or later materials poses something of a problem, and it is possible that
Early Ceramic components may not be entirely isolable; that is, some or all of these sites may
well be part of a continuum in which Gary points become smaller, sandy-paste pottery appears,
and, later, Gary dart points are replaced by Friley expanding-stem arrow points. In this light, it
may not be possible to even identify many Ceramic Period components without performing some
level of excavation to define the stratigraphic nature and artifact composition of archeological
deposits. Isolating Early Ceramic period components in multi-component sites may not be
possible based on survey-level information—surface collected artifacts, together with those from
shovel tests, may reveal the presence of multiple components but will not aid in determining
whether or not the components are too badly mixed to merit further work. Minimally, testing-level
investigations may be necessary to address these issues, and then only if the excavations are
sufficiently extensive to evaluate the deposits on a site.
Despite these difficulties, Early Ceramic sites in the Angelina-Neches basin seem to be
relatively common. Cultural resource surveys and test excavations (Fields 1979; Ippolito 1983)

at 2 sites (41HO61 and 41TN27) within the Davy Crockett National Forest show that Early
Ceramic components are relatively common in the Neches basin. An archeological survey of
Lake Nacogdoches on Bayou Loco, a tributary of the Angelina, also produced a number of sites
with Early Ceramic Period components (Prewitt et al. 1972). Excavations at the Deshazo Site
(41NA27), primarily a Historic Caddo occupation, revealed an important sandy-paste ceramic
component (Story 1982). Other excavated sites on tributaries of the Angelina include 41NA44 on
Legg Creek (Corbin et al. 1978), 41NA144 and 41NA157 on Bayou LaNana (Corbin 1988), and
41SA135 on Attoyac Bayou (Middlebrook 1983).

3.4

FORMATIVE, EARLY, AND MIDDLE CADDOAN PERIODS (CA. A.D. 800 TO 1400)

The Caddoan archeological record represents the fluorescence of aboriginal complex
societies in northeastern Texas, northwestern Louisiana, southwestern Arkansas, and
southeastern Oklahoma, and generations of archeologists have long been captivated by the
beautifully manufactured ceramics and other material goods, the earthen mounds, the well
preserved villages and hamlets, and the existence of a paleobotanical record (e.g., Perttula 2004;
Swanton 1942). In the Northeast Texas Archeological Region, the timeframe referred to in many
surrounding regions as the Late Prehistoric period is usually subdivided into the Formative
Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1000), the Early Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1200), the Middle Caddoan
(ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400), and the Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) periods (Perttula 1993a).
European contact with Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas began around ca. A.D. 1540, but it
was sporadic until after ca. A.D. 1680 (Perttula 1992), and the Historic Caddoan period (ca.
A.D. 1680 to 1860) therefore covers the period of regular interaction with Spanish, French, and
other EuroAmerican settlers up to the expulsion of the Caddo peoples from their homelands and
forced removal to Indian Territory in 1859. General characteristics of Caddoan tradition are
discussed below, followed by brief overviews of specific archeological periods.
The term Caddo derives from the French abbreviation of Kadohadacho, a word meaning
“real chief” in the Kadohadacho dialect (Newkumet and Meredith 1988); however, depending
upon the context of use, Caddo or Caddoan can refer to a Native American linguistic family or a
subdivision of related dialects within that family; be a collective term for up to 25 related tribes or
bands, 3 possible confederacies, or specific prehistoric and historic archeological assemblages;
or refer to the geographic region containing these archeological assemblages (Perttula 1992;
Trubowitz 1984). In general terms, the Caddo were characterized by:
a large population represented by many small settlements scattered within particular
resource areas; a reliance upon horticulture as one of the primary means of subsistence;
differentiated and undifferentiated mound/habitation sites with structurally differentiated
mound classes (producing an apparently hierarchic division of places on the landscape);
differential treatment of the dead reflective of a system of ranking; [and] indications of longterm cooperation in disposal of the dead by groups represented by some of the
archeological units (Prewitt 1974:76).

Broadly, these basic characteristics of settlement, subsistence, sociopolitical organization, and
mortuary practices are representative of the Caddoan archeological area from ca. A.D. 750 to
1750 and are similar, if not identical, to what constitutes the Mississippian period cultural traditions

28

of the Mississippi River Valley and Eastern Woodlands of North America (Griffin 1967, 1985;
Muller 1978; Smith 1986, 1990; Steponaitis 1986). Despite these similarities, Caddoan
archeologists maintain that the prehistoric and early historic Caddoan tradition developed largely
independently of Mississippian-period chiefdoms elsewhere (Smith 1990).
The overall Caddoan archeological area has been divided into 3 subareas (Perttula
1992:7-9), including (1) the Arkansas, or Northern Caddoan, subarea of northeast Oklahoma,
northwest Arkansas, and southwest Missouri, including the Arkansas Valley lowlands, the South
Canadian basin, and the western Ozark Highlands (Brown et al. 1978); (2) the Western Caddoan
subarea of East Texas and south-central Oklahoma, including the western Gulf Coastal Plain
outside the Red River Valley and the Ouachita Mountains (Story 1981, 1990; Wyckoff and Baugh
1980); and (3) the Central Caddoan subarea in the Red and Ouachita river valleys in southwestern
Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and southeastern Oklahoma (Schambach 1983; Williams and
Early 1990). Archeological developments within each of these subareas seem to represent the
in situ formation of separate and complex Caddoan cultural traditions (Schambach 1983). Despite
the intraregional and diachronic distinctions that characterize the different Caddoan subareas,
Caddoan tradition is generally distinguished by:
the development of more complex social and political systems of authority, ritual, and
ceremony; the rise, elaboration, and maintenance of social ranking and status within the
Caddoan communities and larger social and political spheres; and the intensification of
maize agriculture and a reliance on tropical cultigens over time in local economic systems
(Perttula 1992:13).

Throughout prehistoric times, Caddoan peoples lived in dispersed communities of grassand cane-covered structures that were frequently associated with grass-covered arbors and
armadas (Perttula 1992:13). The communities were composed of isolated homesteads or
farmsteads, small hamlets, a few larger villages or towns, and large civic-ceremonial centers.
Such centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds that were used as temples,
burial mounds, and ceremonial fire mounds (Jeter et al. 1989:2001). The civic-ceremonial centers
appear to have “served a local population which [was] dispersed in small social and economic
groups around the center” (Schambach and Early 1983:SW107).
The distribution of Caddoan settlements across the landscape suggests that all habitats
were used to some extent, either intensively as locations for the sedentary communities and
farmsteads (that may have been occupied for single or multiple generations) or periodically by
groups in logistical camps where specific natural resources could be procured in bulk. Caddoan
sites of Formative to Middle Caddoan age are situated primarily on elevated landforms, such as
alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and upland edges, adjacent to major streams and along
minor tributaries and spring-fed branches (Perttula 2004:378). Settlement locations near arable
sandy loam soils were preferred, presumably due to the excellent drainage afforded by such soils
for habitation and cultivation purposes. Most of these Caddo sites are:
permanent settlements that have evidence of the structures, including posts, pits, and
features marking their residency, along with the cemeteries and graves where the dead
were buried; the middens where the animal and plant food refuse was discarded amidst
broken stone tools and pottery vessels; and the material remains of tools and ceramics

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

used in the procurement and processing of the bountiful resources of the region. They
represent the settlements of Caddoan communities and sociopolitical entities, and the
civic-ceremonial centers that were their focus (Perttula 1993a:125).

Post Oak Savanna and Pineywoods Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas constructed
temple and burial mounds, and the larger sites were important civic-ceremonial centers containing
multiple mounds and associated villages, generally dating after ca. A.D. 900. The multiple mound
sites are evenly spaced along the Red River, Sabine River, and Cypress Bayou, and those that
are contemporaneous may represent the nodes of hierarchical systems of an
“integrated…regional network of interaction and redistribution” (Thurmond 1990:234). Perttula
(1994:12) identified the Jamestown, Boxed Springs, and Hudnall-Pirtle multiple-mound centers
as the nodes of such a network during the Early to Middle Caddoan periods in the Sabine River
basin. The Hale (41TT12) and Keith (41TT11) multiple-mound sites may have served civicceremonial functions in the Big Cypress Creek basin (Perttula 2004:384), and the Roitsch
(41RR16), Wright Plantation (41RR7), Fasken (41RR14), and Sanders (41LR2) sites may have
served similar roles in the Red River basin (Bruseth 1998; Hamilton 1997).
The premier mound centers in the Angelina-Neches river basins are the George C. Davis
and Washington Square sites (Corbin and Hart 1998; Story 1997). Calibrated radiocarbon dates
from village contexts at the George C. Davis site establish that the site was occupied beginning
in the 9th century and was then continuously settled through the end of the 13th century (Story
2000). Radiocarbon dating of the Washington Square site suggests that it began to flourish after
ca. A.D. 1250, when the George C. Davis site may have begun to lose power and social authority
(Perttula 2004:386). The proximity of the Washington Square Mound complex to the north-tosouth and east-to-west aboriginal trails that later became known as the Caddo trace and the
Camino Real, respectively, may suggest reasons why the seat of power shifted away from the
George C. Davis site, the preeminent polity on the Neches River, which was abandoned by the
early 14th century.
About 80% of the approximately 500 radiocarbon dates available from Northeast Texas
archeological sites are from sites with prehistoric and protohistoric Caddoan components. The
largest number of radiocarbon dates fall in the Middle Caddoan period, followed by the Early
Caddoan period. While the number of dates in this period is probably inflated to some degree by
the extensive series of dates from the George C. Davis Site (n=130) (Story 1997; Story and
Valastro 1977), it nevertheless appears to be the case that Middle Caddoan occupations are
rather commonplace throughout much of Northeast Texas (Middlebrook and Perttula 1997;
Perttula 2004:378).
Formative to Middle Caddoan period groups seem to have been horticulturalists,
cultivating maize and squash along with several kinds of native seeds (Perttula and Bruseth
1983). They also gathered nuts, tubers, and roots and were proficient hunters of deer, fish,
rabbits, raccoon, turkey, squirrel, and turtles. Available paleobotanical and bioarcheological
evidence from Northeast Texas and elsewhere within the Caddoan area, including stable carbon
isotope analyses of human remains (Rose et al. 1998), suggests that Caddoan groups became
dependent primarily upon maize and other domesticated crops only after about A.D. 1300. By
ca. A.D. 1450, maize composed more than 50% of the diet (Burnett 1990; Perttula 1996; Rose et

30

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

al. 1998), though local variation in dependence upon cultivated plants has been noted (Cliff 1997;
Largent et al. 1997; Perttula 1999).
The most distinctive material culture items of the Caddo populations living in Northeast
Texas were the ceramics they made for cooking, storage, and serving needs (Perttula et al.
1995b). The variety of styles and forms of ceramics recovered from the region hint at the range,
temporal span, and geographic extent of prehistoric Caddoan groups across the landscape
(Thurmond 1990). Story (1990:246-247, 277-319) suggests that the earliest ceramics in the
region date between ca. 500 and 100 B.C. and are closely related to the ceramics being produced
in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Between the introduction of ceramics in the region and the
emergence of distinctive Caddoan vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D. 800, the local
plainware traditions seem to have continued relatively unchanged. As Story notes:
Sometime probably between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900 (there is a lot of room for arguing the
age), Caddoan ceramics came to dominate the northeastern part of [Texas]. These
ceramics are distinguished by certain vessel forms (especially a long-necked bottle with a
globular body and a carinated bowl), engraved decorations, and other attributes. Although
the bottle form and engraving may have an exotic origin, most of the Caddoan ceramics
can be recognized as local developments with strong influences from the [Lower
Mississippi Valley] (1990:247).

The diversity in decoration and shape in Caddoan ceramics is substantial, ranging from
utility jars and bowls to fineware bottles, carinated bowls, and compound vessels, and precludes
any succinct summary in the present context (cf. Perttula 2004; Story 1990). Some general
observations and trends may nevertheless be highlighted. Ceramics are quite common in
domestic contexts on Caddoan sites, and it is not unusual to recover more than 10,000 sherds
from hundreds of vessels during excavations on Caddo settlements, and upwards of
100,000 sherds is common on larger sites such as George C. Davis (Newell and Krieger 1949;
Stokes and Woodring 1981), Deshazo (Fields 1981, 1995), Benson’s Crossing (Driggers 1985),
and 41MX5 (Brewington et al. 1995). The Caddo made both finewares, with very finely crushed
temper (Schambach and Miller 1984:109), and utility wares. Almost without exception, Caddoan
ceramics were tempered with grog (crushed sherds) or bone, although burned and crushed shells
were used after ca. A.D. 1300 among most of the Red River Caddo groups (Bruseth 1998;
Schambach and Miller 1984) and on later Caddoan sites in the lower and upper Sulphur River
basin (Cliff and Perttula 1995; Fields et al. 1994a and b). These kinds of ceramics were designed
to serve utilitarian purposes within the Caddoan community as well as ceremonial functions in
burials. In general, earlier Caddoan finewares across Northeast Texas (and indeed across much
of the overall Caddoan area) are rather uniform in style and form, suggesting broad and extensive
social interaction among groups in the region (Perttula 2004:389). Later Caddoan finewares (after
ca. A.D. 1300/1400) are more stylistically diverse across Northeast Texas, and highly distinctive
vessel shapes, designs, and decorative attributes characterize ceramics in individual drainages,
and sometimes even within segments of specific river and creek basins (Thurmond 1985, 1990;
Perttula et al. 1993). This diversity can be reasonably interpreted to represent specific Caddoan
social groups. In historic Caddoan times, ceramic vessel forms and decorations were
considerably more homogenous across much of the Caddoan area than during prehistory,

HJN 050082 AR

31

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

suggesting extensive intraregional contact among contemporaneous Caddoan groups (Perttula
1992:154).
Aside from ceramics, Formative to Middle Caddoan period populations in the Pineywoods
possessed a sophisticated technology based on the use of stone, bone, wood, shell, and other
media for the manufacture of tools, clothing, basketry, ornaments, and other items (Perttula
1992:15). Well made corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points were common,
along with siltstone and greenstone celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan bifaces, and a
variety of more expedient stone tools, such as unifacial flake scraping and cutting implements
(Perttula 2004:386). Long-stemmed Red River (Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped ceramic pipes,
as well as ceramic earspools and figurines, were also manufactured by the Caddo at this time
(Newell and Krieger 1949).
Locally available lithic materials were usually employed for the manufacture of stone tools,
but non-local raw materials and finished goods made from these raw materials were also obtained
through trade (Brown 1983; Perttula 1990). The development and maintenance of long-distance
east-to-west and north-to-south trade networks were notable features of prehistoric Caddoan
tradition. Trade items included bison hides and salt; raw materials such as copper, stone, and
marine shell; and finished objects such as pottery vessels and large ceremonial bifaces (Brown
1983; Creel 1991; Early 1990; Vehik 1988, 1990). Many of the more exotic trade items, especially
marine shell and copper artifacts, were obtained from areas more than 300 miles away from the
Caddoan area (Perttula 1992).

3.5

LATE CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1400 TO 1680)

As currently defined, the Late Caddoan period extends from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680 (Story
1990). Late Caddoan occupation in Northeast Texas was arguably centered on the Great Bend
area of the Red River, where Late Caddoan archeological sites are included in the
contemporaneous Belcher and Texarkana phases (Schambach 1983). Texarkana phase sites
occur on the Red River northwest of Texarkana to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line, as well as
on the lower Sulphur River (Jelks 1961), while Belcher phase sites are distributed from about
Fulton, Arkansas, to below Shreveport, Louisiana (Kelley 1997; Schambach 1983; Webb 1959).
The McCurtain phase represents another Late Caddoan archeological complex upstream from
the Texarkana phase (Bruseth 1998). Texarkana and Belcher phase sites include large,
permanent settlements with mounds and cemeteries, hamlets, and farmsteads (Perttula
2004:393). The mound centers were marked by the construction of earthen mounds used as
temples, burial mounds, and/or ceremonial fire mounds, as during earlier Caddoan periods (Kelley
1998; Webb 1959). These settlements were inhabited by sedentary Caddo agricultural
communities with complex societies led by individuals with high status (Story 1990). Sites such
as Belcher (16CD13), Battle Mound (3LA1), Hatchel (41BW3), Moore/Higginbotham (3MI3/30),
and Cabe Mounds (41BW14) represent the larger villages or towns (Creel 1996; Kelley and Coxe
1998; Kelley and Guccione 1997; Perttula et al. 1995a; Sierzchula et al. 1995), while smaller
hamlets or farmsteads have been investigated at the Shewin, Atlanta State Park (Harris et al.
1980), and 41MX5 (Brewington et al. 1995) for the Texarkana phase, and Cedar Grove (3LA97),
Spirit Lake (3LA83), and Cox for the Belcher phase.

In the Angelina-Neches river basin, the Late Caddoan period is represented by the
Frankston phase, which dates from ca. A.D. 1400 to 1650 (Perttula 2004:395), and the Angelina
focus or phase in the vicinity of Lake Sam Rayburn (formerly the McGee Bend Reservoir) (Jelks
1965). Only one Frankston phase mound site is known, the A.C. Saunders site (41AN19)
(Jackson 1936; Kleinschmidt 1982). Other Frankston phase sites include small, residential
settlements in dispersed agricultural communities, with small family and/or community cemeteries
that appear to have been used over relatively short periods of time (Anderson et al. 1974; Johnson
1961; Shafer 1981). Anderson notes that the concentration of Frankston phase sites in one
section of the upper Neches basin comprises:
base settlement clusters [with middens, burials, and structures, likely representing
permanent settlements] on streamside flats with fertile soils in the…uplands. Other site
types include scattered sherds, gathering stations in which pitted stones are found with a
few sherds, and small campsites (1972:163).

One of the larger known Frankston phase cemeteries is the Omer and Otis Hood cemetery
(Kleinschmidt 1982; Suhm et al. 1954), which contains 20 burials, while other, smaller cemeteries
contain fewer than 10 individuals generally laid out individually in extended supine position with
accompanying grave goods (Kleinschmidt 1982:214). In at least one Frankston phase cemetery
in the upper Neches River basin in Smith County, the burial of socially elite individuals occurs in
a family and/or village cemetery context rather than in a mound.
Middlebrook (1994:26-29) separates “late” Angelina focus or phase sites in the Lake Sam
Rayburn area from earlier Caddoan sites in the lake and nearby areas on the basis of (1) an
abundance of ceramic elbow pipes, (2) high proportions of brushed sherds (from Broaddus
Brushed jars), and (3) lower proportions of Pineland Punctated-Incised sherds compared to the
brushed utility wares. In addition, he notes that these late (ca. post-A.D. 1450/1500) Angelina
focus or phase sites have plain:decorated sherd ratios between 0.80 and 1.03 compared to the
Middle Caddoan Sawmill (41SA89), Blount (41SA123), and Tyson sites, which have ratios of 1.53
to 1.83.
The other major Late Caddoan manifestation in Northeast Texas is the Titus phase (ca.
A.D. 1430 to 1680), which represents the remains of a number of Caddoan groups who lived
between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the northeastern Texas Pineywoods. Like the
Frankston phase groups in the upper Neches and Angelina river basins (Kleinschmidt 1982; Story
and Creel 1982) and in the Angelina River and Attoyac Bayou basins (Middlebrook 1994), Titus
phase groups lived in dispersed year-round settlements, buried their dead in planned cemeteries,
and manufactured culturally distinctive ceramics of considerable stylistic and functional diversity
(Perttula 2004:396). Sociopolitically, these Pineywoods Caddo were somewhat akin to the early
historic Kadohadacho groups on the Red River that had elite-controlled and hierarchically ranked
societies (Barker and Pauketat 1992). Several hundred Titus phase components have been
identified, the largest concentration of which is found in the Cypress Bayou (or Big Cypress Creek)
valley (Perttula 2004; Thurmond 1990), with a scatter of sites throughout the Little Cypress Creek
valley, the middle portions of the Sulphur River, the middle and upper portions of White Oak
Creek, and the upper and middle reaches of the Sabine River drainage (Perttula 2004:396).
Thurmond (1985, 1990) has proposed that the Titus phase is composed of 4 contemporaneous

HJN 050082 AR

33

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

spatial subclusters—Three Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek—
within the larger Cypress cluster. By contrast, Turner (1978) proposes early and late
chronological subdivisions within the Titus phase based on motif variations on Ripley Engraved
carinated bowls and on changes in vessel form. It is likely that both spatial and temporal factors
contribute to the archeological character of the Titus phase (Perttula 1992). Despite the
prominence of Titus phase groups in the archeological record, Europeans in historic times
described these Pineywoods Caddo groups in the Sabine and Cypress basins in only a cursory
fashion, unlike the Kadohadacho and Hasinai groups to the north, east, and south (Smith 1995).
Late Caddoan period settlements in the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas have been
termed rural Caddoan community systems (Perttula 1991) because they were distributed along
secondary streams, were widely dispersed, and consisted of functionally equivalent farmsteads
and hamlets. Small mound centers were being constructed by Titus phase and other Late
Caddoan groups up until ca. A.D. 1500, and possibly later, in Northeast Texas, but they lack
evidence of burial mounds or large platforms; rather, these mounds contain buried, burned
structures (Perttula 2004:398). The larger Caddoan towns were distributed along the major
stream valleys, such as the Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These communities were
hierarchically arranged, with civic-ceremonial centers at the “top” surrounded by associated towns
of linear but dispersed farmstead compounds with several structures (such as bark- or brushcovered shelters and storage platforms [Schambach 1983:7-8]), followed by hamlets, farmsteads,
and specialized processing and/or procurement locales, such as salt-making sites (Early 1993;
Gregory 1980:356-357).
The best information on the distribution of Late Caddoan archeological sites derives from
Thurmond’s (1990) study of Titus phase settlements in the Big Cypress Creek basin. Titus phase
sites tend to occur on valley terraces, upland projections, and upland slope landforms, with the
greatest use of minor and upland basins. The distribution of Titus phase settlements suggests
that both farmsteads and hamlets were equally dispersed in prehistoric times and that they were
usually situated near springs and on arable soil and level ground, but the banks along tributary
streams also seem to have been preferred settings. Permanent settlements and cemeteries tend
to occur in association with freshwater springs, whereas mound centers typically do not occur in
proximity to a spring but rather are located on floodplain floors in major and intermediate basins
or on upland projections. Associated occupation areas are situated on terraces, floodplain rises,
or upland projections but are not found on floodplain floor landforms.
Two types of cemeteries have been documented in the Titus phase—the small, family
cemetery and the large, supralocal or community cemetery. More than 115 Titus phase
cemeteries have been recorded to date (Perttula and Nelson 1998). Family cemeteries are
typically situated in immediate proximity to farmsteads or hamlets, contain few interments
(typically about 10 to 20 individuals in cemeteries along the western margins of the Titus phase
area and from 20 to 40 individuals in the “heartland” along Big Cypress Bayou [Perttula and
Nelson 1998]), and offer no evidence of differential status or social rank in grave goods
associations and burial treatment. Large community cemeteries are the product of interments
from numerous nearby communities, and they are therefore reflective of wider, community-based
participation in ceremonial and mortuary activities (Perttula and Nelson 1998; Story 1990:338-

34

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

339). These cemeteries typically contain at least 60 to 70 individuals, though some are known
that contain at least 150 to 300 interments (Perttula 1993a; Perttula and Nelson 1998, 1999; Story
1990; Thurmond 1990; Turner 1978). Large community cemeteries do contain evidence for the
existence of social differentiation within the Titus phase Caddoan communities—they are
organized internally by space and structurally divided by rank (Thurmond 1990; Turner 1978).
There is little evidence for overlapping graves; rather, the cemeteries appear to have been
regularly expanded over time (Perttula 1992). As the cemetery plan was consistently maintained,
it may reflect community participation over several generations. Burial populations are roughly
evenly divided between males and females (Rose 1984:240). Children were typically buried in
subfloor pits within household structures (Perttula 2004:401). In general, community cemeteries
were relatively short-term mortuary phenomena that were used intensively in portions of the
Pineywoods after ca. A.D. 1550 to the early 1600s, and it is probably no coincidence that the
intensive use of these burial grounds occurs generally contemporaneously with the initial contact
between Titus phase Caddoan populations and the Spanish de Soto/Moscoso entrada of 1542 to
1543 (Perttula 1992; Thurmond 1990).
Late Caddoan material culture is at least as distinctive and diverse as early Caddoan
assemblages. The wide variety of ceramic vessel shapes and decorative motifs, as well as their
frequency in domestic contexts, demonstrates the importance of ceramics for cooking and serving
food, as personal possessions, and as social identifiers. Both finewares and utility wares were
manufactured during the Late Caddoan period. Finewares were tempered with finely crushed
grog and bone and were well polished. Shell-tempered vessels are quite rare and, when found,
are typically trade wares from the Red River Caddo area (Perttula 2004:404). Utility vessels were
tempered with grog and grit and utilized a coarser paste and a thicker body. Ceramic earspools
and biconical and elbow pipes were made (Jackson 1933), and other types of earspools were
manufactured from siltstone, sandstone, and wood (Turner 1992:84). Lithic tools and debris are
uncommon on Late Caddoan period sites in the Pineywoods, which presumably reflects the
development of a strong wood and bone tool industry, few examples of which are preserved in
the archeological record (Perttula 2004:404). Tool diversity is low, consisting primarily of
triangular and corner-notched arrow points, flake tools (e.g., drills, scrapers, and retouched
flakes), lithic debris and cores, and a variety of groundstone implements, including petaloid and
tabular celts, manos and metates, battered and polished cobbles and pebbles, hematite and
limonite pigment stones, and abrading slabs (Thurmond 1990; Turner 1992). Bone is not usually
well preserved on Late Caddoan sites, though occasional deer mandibles, deer beamers, ulna
punches, antler tines, deer and bird bone pins, and turtle shell rattles have been noted (Perttula
2004:405).
Faunal subsistence remains are known from a few sites in Northeast Texas dating to this
time period but have so far received relatively little attention (Perttula 1993a; Thurmond 1990).
Vertebrate species represented in trash middens include deer, turkey, cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit,
squirrel, beaver, turtle, and fish, though deer and turkey appear to have been the dominant
economic species (Perttula et al. 1982; 1993). In general, subsistence evidence suggests that
Pineywoods Caddo practiced a strongly maize-based economy at this time (Fritz 1990:421, 425).
Floral evidence from trash middens suggests that maize (Zea mays) provided a dietary staple,
and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) were also an important food source (Perttula 2004:4005). Nuts

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and seeds were gathered but appear to have been of lesser importance than during earlier time
periods (Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Perttula et al. 1982).
The large Titus phase cemeteries in the Cypress Creek basin form 4 spatial clusters
defined by Thurmond (1981, 1985). The earliest expressions of community integration,
organization, and social hierarchy occur in the Three Basins, Tankersley Creek, and Swauano
Creek subclusters, and the latest expressions occur in the Swauano Creek and Big Cypress
Creek subclusters. Presumably, the Three Basins and Tankersley Creek areas were abandoned
by resident Caddoan groups after ca. A.D. 1650 to 1670 (Thurmond 1985:198), and it is perhaps
not surprising that Norteno phase Wichita sites dating after ca. A.D. 1700 to 1760 are found in
the Three Basins subcluster area (Perttula 1992:113). These community cemeteries are primarily
protohistoric phenomena of the Titus phase and Cypress Cluster dating to ca. A.D. 1550 to
1650/1700, and they do not extend into the later Historic Caddoan period (ca. 1685 to 1800).
Caddoan cemeteries after A.D. 1685 do not exhibit the coherence and internal structure noted in
the protohistoric community cemetery centers; rather, they are uniformly small, and each burial
contains limited grave goods usually common only to household cemeteries, with the addition of
European trade goods. Protohistoric cemetery centers are thus short-term (ca. 150-year
maximum), transitory phenomena in the Cypress/upper Sabine river areas. The timing of this
development is of considerable significance as Titus phase community cemeteries appear to have
replaced mounds by the middle to late 16th century. These changes in the sociopolitical and
ceremonial aspects of Caddoan life reflect a reduction in complexity and the scope of community
integration between ca. A.D. 1400 and 1600. The uneven dispersion of supralocal community
cemeteries throughout the region (Perttula 1992:98, Fig. 14) implies that a spatial coalescence or
a decrease in settlement density was occurring in some parts of the 2 basins. This may indicate
a systemic change in Caddoan rural communities at approximately the time of initial European
contact. Subsequent to the discontinuation of community cemeteries ca. A.D. 1650 to 1700, most
of the upper Sabine and Cypress Creek basins were abandoned (Thurmond 1990). The only
post- A.D. 1700 Caddoan occupations that can be related to earlier use of the region are found
in the lower Sulphur and Sabine rivers at known trade portages or at trail crossings of major
streams (Harris et al. 1980; Jones 1968).
By early historic times, the Caddoan nation was composed of at least 25 separate groups,
bands, or tribes organized into loosely affiliated kin-based groups referred to by European
observers as the Hasinai, Kadohadacho, and Natchitoches confederacies (Perttula 1992). The
Hasinai groups lived in the Angelina and Neches river valleys in East Texas, the Kadohadacho
groups on the Red River in the Great Bend area, and the Natchitoches groups on the Red River
in the vicinity of the French trading post of Natchitoches established in A.D. 1714. In the AngelinaNeches area, protohistoric Caddoan development in the upper Neches River basin shares certain
aspects of the sociopolitical and ceremonial change observed for the contemporaneous Titus
phase (Perttula 1992:117). Frankston phase mound centers, such as the A.C. Saunders and
Pace McDonald sites, both of which were apparently structural mounds without accompanying
mortuary events (Story 1981:149), were not used after A.D. 1600. Kleinschmidt (1982:240)
places the A.C. Saunders site in the Frankston Phase 2 subdivision, probably just prior to the
historic contacts of the early 17th century. Cultural change appears to have been toward a more
regionally localized sociopolitical system generally compatible with the A.D. 1680 to 1720

ethnohistorical records from the East Texas Hasinai tribes (Wyckoff and Baugh 1980:246-249),
in which ritual and ceremony were conducted in non-mound structures or plazas and cemeteries
were strictly for extended family use (Perttula 1992:117).

3.6

HISTORIC CADDOAN PERIOD (CA. A.D. 1519 TO PRESENT)

Protohistoric cultural manifestations in Northeast Texas span the Late Caddoan to early
Historic Caddoan period; therefore, a combination of archeological, ethnohistoric, and historical
data may be brought to bear to illuminate Caddoan tradition during the period of contact with
EuroAmerican explorers and settlers. While there is an abundant Late Caddoan and protohistoric
archeological record in the Angelina-Neches basin of Northeast Texas (Story 1990; Perttula 1991;
Perttula 2004), developing an understanding of that record is hampered by a relative lack of
means to identify short-term temporal episodes within the ca. 1400 to 1700 time period (i.e., within
the subdivision of the Frankston and Allen phases). Much of the current picture of the protohistoric
Caddoan presence in the Angelina-Neches basin, specifically the upper Neches River area
(Suhm et al. 1954), derives from a largely undated archeological record (Story 1990; Perttula
1992:115).
The earliest explorations by Europeans in the overall Caddo area began shortly after
Spain’s Indies commerce was formally organized in 1503 by the creation of the Casa de
Contratación (Arnold and Weddle 1978:63; Milanich and Milbreath 1989a, 1989b). Explorations
of the Gulf Coast were carried out from Florida to Tampico throughout the early 16th century as
part of the regulation and encouragement of New World trade. The first European incursion into
what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores
of the Gulf of Mexico (Weddle 1985). While no documentary evidence exists for direct contact
with Caddoan peoples during these initial forays, Europeans were already conducting slave
raiding and native resettlement projects along the Texas coast by 1550 (Bolton 1912). From 1528
to 1534, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors of the Narváez Florida expedition
crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas coast near Galveston Bay
(Bandelier 1904). Swanton (1942:29) does not believe that Cabeza de Vaca actually encountered
any Caddoan people during his wanderings, though his dealings in Native American trade goods
between coastal and inland groups suggest that he might have traveled in the region (Perttula
1992:19). While direct contact between Cabeza de Vaca and Caddoan peoples cannot be
established by historical documentation, Perttula (1992) argues that diseases such as typhoid
and measles carried by the Narváez party could have been transmitted to Native American groups
living elsewhere along the Texas Coast and then inland to Caddoan groups through aboriginal
trade and other contact. Thus, the Narváez and Cabeza de Vaca exploration may have been an
important benchmark for the initiation of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in the
Spanish Borderlands West (Hester 1989:199; Perttula 1992:19, 1993b), and may have introduced
epidemic diseases that resulted in substantial population declines prior to the inception of more
regular contact later in the 16th century.
In the early 1540s, the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by Luis de Moscoso following the
death of de Soto along the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis, passed into the Caddoan
area, spending several months among the Caddoan groups who lived between the Ouachita and

HJN 050082 AR

37

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Trinity rivers (Swanton 1939; Perttula 1992:19). The death of de Soto on the Mississippi River at
the province of Guachoya in the spring of 1542:
freed the survivors from continuing upon the original objectives of the expedition. There
was only one thought shared by all: to escape from the whole dreadful adventure. Under
the leadership of Luis de Moscoso, they officially decided it was hopeless to seek the
sea…in fact, the cavaliers were clearly reluctant to take to boats…and instead determined
to march west in the direction of New Spain (Brain 1985:xlv).

Within what is now recognized as the Caddoan archeological area, Moscoso described
the provinces of Naguatex, Nondacao, and Guasco, for example, as groups that had dense
populations in scattered settlements and abundant reserves of maize (Swanton 1939:258-280).
Perttula’s (1992) examination of Moscoso’s travels suggests that his route passed through
settlements of aboriginal Caddoan groups known archeologically as the Late Mid-Ouachita (or
Social Hill), Belcher, Texarkana, Titus, and Frankston phases. Different versions of Moscoso’s
route have been proposed by various researchers (e.g., Hudson 1986; Perttula 1992; Swanton
1939); interestingly, all of the proposed routes pass through the Angelina-Neches river basin area
in the vicinity of the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. The basic import of the de
Soto-Moscoso expedition in 1542 is that these explorers documented and described aspects of
Caddoan settlement, subsistence strategies, aboriginal routes of travel and trade, and social
organization that are broadly consistent with inferences that have made based on the
archeological record. In the province of Guasco in the Angelina-Neches basin, the Spanish noted
that there was plenty of corn as well as turquoise and shawls of cotton that had been brought
from the southwest (Bourne 1904:181).
Between 1520 and 1685, very few Europeans actually lived in the Caddoan area, and it is
virtually certain that most Caddoan peoples during this time never saw a European (Perttula
1992:29). As a result, artifactual evidence of this phase of European contact is minimal. As
Krieger points out:
In any one site, something like twenty beads and two bits of iron may be all that can be
found to represent perhaps a century of contact; and this being true, there must be scores
of sites actually occupied during the same ‘historic period’ from which the archaeologist
cannot recover a single European object (in Davis 1961:120).

The second major phase of European contact in the Caddoan historic period began with
the renewed exploration of the Mississippi Valley following the establishment of the Illinois colony
by the French in the 1670s. The Mississippi River, initially explored by Marquette and Joliet in
1673 to the mouth of the Arkansas River (Delangez 1946), was fully explored to its mouth by La
Salle. Three years later, another expedition directed by La Salle intended to colonize the area
and link the Gulf Coast with the growing French colonies of Illinois and Canada. For unknown
reasons, this expedition missed the mouth of the Mississippi River and came ashore on the Texas
Gulf Coast at Matagorda Bay (Cox 1922; Gilmore 1986). La Salle made several trips from Fort
St. Louis to explore the region and try to find the Mississippi River, visiting the Hasinai (or Cenis,
in the French transcription) in 1686 before turning back with several horses purchased from the
Hasinai. Another effort was made in 1687 by the survivors of Fort St. Louis; however, La Salle

38

was murdered by several of the men partway through this trip, and the remaining party decided
to stay on with the Hasinai.
The years between 1685 and 1714 were a time of continual French and Spanish
exploration of the Caddoan area. The threat of French settlement in an area the Spanish
considered to be officially under their hegemony spurred serious Spanish efforts to settle and
missionize the country east of New Mexico and the Rio Grande known to them as the “Kingdom
of the Tejas” (Bolton 1912; Perttula 1992:30). At the same time, the French were determined to
take advantage of the La Salle explorations to extend their claims in the region. Shortly thereafter,
English colonies were established along the South Atlantic Coast that wished to extend trade
routes west to Native American groups living on the Mississippi River and the Texas Gulf Coast
(Coker and Watson 1986; Crane 1929; Usner 1989; Woods 1980). European political
relationship, trade and religious objectives, and the larger spheres of influence under the control
of the Spanish, French, and British in the developing world economy all played important parts in
the fate of the Caddo between ca. 1685 and 1800 (Braudel 1984:21-85, 387-429; Wallerstein
1974; Wolf 1982:129-231). Trade contacts, rumors of settlement, and exploration by one
government were responded to in kind by others as part of the unstable process of colonization.
The nature and character of sustained European contact has been comprehensively discussed
by many researchers (Bolton 1915, 1987; Giraud 1957, 1963, 1974a, 1974b; Cox 1909;
Fieldhouse 1966; Galloway 1982; Gibson 1989; John 1975, 1985; Surrey 1916; Swagerty 1984;
Usner 1987; Wade 1989), and only the broad outlines are presented below in the interest of
summarizing the varying European objectives as they impacted the Caddo.
The Spanish were determined to achieve political and religious hegemony over the Caddo
in East Texas. Their purpose was “to convert him, to civilize him, and to exploit him” (Bolton
1917:45), and a system of missions and presidios (forts to protect missionaries and converts) was
established in what is now East Texas and western Louisiana between 1691 and 1721 (Habig
1984). The missions were dependent upon the frontier political situation for government support
as well as upon their presumed success in converting the Caddoan peoples in the vicinity to
Christianity. They were set up in such a way that it was necessary to try to induce the Caddoan
peoples in proximity to the Spanish missions; to have them participate in the religious, social, and
economic activities devised by the missionaries (Espinosa 1716); and to try to create a supporting
peasantry and feudal system (Hudson 1981:167-168). Periodic inspections of the missions in
East Texas (Buckley 1911; Kress and Hatcher 1932; Murphy 1937) lamented not only the lack of
success in converting the Hasinai Caddo (except at death), but also the poor economic and
military support at these settlements, which were located at great distances from the Spanish
supply centers on the Rio Grande and in Coahuila. As a result, the Spanish missions lasted only
a short time among the Hasinai and East Texas tribes (1690 to 1693 and 1716 to 1772). The
Caddoan peoples were able to acquire trade goods and supplies from French traders, and they
failed to develop the desired material dependence upon Spanish missionaries, who were not in a
position to foster trade relationships with them (Perttula 1992:34-35). The religious message of
the Spanish missionaries was equally inefficient, linked as it was to episodic epidemics among
the Caddo after ca. 1687 and the Caddoan belief that the Spanish were the cause of those
epidemics (Ewers 1973; Leutenegger 1979).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

French objectives in the Louisiana colony were firmly based on developing a mercantilistic
trade policy whereby New World goods were produced at lower cost and/or for higher profit than
they could be in France and were then sent to France for sale (Eccles 1973). In addition to the
fur trade, wood, cotton, rice, and indigo were major goods produced in French Louisiana in the
18th century (Surrey 1916). Involvement in the fur trade was particularly lucrative for the French
prior to the stabilization of the French Louisiana economy around other exportable goods (Surrey
1916). For all intents and purposes, the French colonial policy can be described as monopolistic
but accommodative, often approaching a symbiosis between French colonists and Native
Americans. The French wished to exclusively control the economic exchange and trade with the
Indians but were willing to accommodate short-term relationships with some of the Indian groups
that were not as profitable as the long-term ones. This accommodative attitude arose not only
from the logistical difficulties of carrying out trade ventures in virtually unknown regions of their
territory with poor means of supply , but also from their reliance on the aboriginal community for
critical food items that they could not produce themselves. This requirement was never overcome
completely during the French control of the Louisiana colony.
The British played a late, albeit marginal, role in the Spanish Borderlands West inasmuch
as their trade activities were concentrated mainly to the east of the Mississippi River (Woods
1980). By the time of the cessation of French Louisiana to Spanish control in 1767, the British
trade network extended from the Atlantic Coast to the Mississippi River, and efforts were
underway to penetrate Louisiana and the Gulf Coast of the Texas province (Stevens 1916).
British objectives, like those of the French, were to take advantage of opportunities to garner a
profit in the Indian trade (Hudson 1981:168; Nash 1972; White 1983). Throughout the 1770s and
1780s, English traders were reported to have been living among the East Texas Caddoan tribes,
even at Natchitoches, and Indian groups were also visiting the British supplies and trading houses
to purchase goods directly (Bolton 1914).
From the 1790s, containment of the expanding US east of the Mississippi River dominated
Spain’s concerns in its Texas and Louisiana colonies, and the allegiance of the various Indian
nations of the Provincias Internas, such as the Caddo, Wichita, and Comanche, was perceived
by the Spanish government as a critical factor in controlling the frontier. The 1790s were a period
of growth in the American fur trade, and another major growth period in the industry occurred from
1800 to 1808 (Clayton 1967). Beaver was the primary fur resource in the trade from 1790 to
1820. The Kadohadacho and Hasinai participated in the trade from the outset, and their
contributions to the fur trade were considered important parts of the Spanish and Louisiana
economies (Ewers 1969:47-48; Flores 1984; Peake 1954:17-18). Following the purchase of the
Louisiana Territory in 1803, the US moved rapidly to explore the boundaries and character of its
new territory, and the federal government emphasized the establishment of commercial and
political relationships with resident aboriginal groups, including Caddoan tribes. The Freeman
and Custis expedition of 1806 on the Red River followed specific guidelines regarding interaction
with the Indians. This expedition was ultimately abandoned due to interference with the Spanish
related to questions about the boundary between Spanish Texas and the Louisiana Territory. The
US initiated a border war with Spain that resulted in the 1806 Neutral Ground Agreement.
Possession of the Red River, as well as the territorial allegiance of the Kadohadacho, remained
unresolved (Flores 1984:287).

As Spanish and American trading ventures evolved during the first 2 decades of the
19th century, the actual settlement of the Red River, its tributaries, and the neutral ground
between Louisiana and Texas began in earnest (Strickland 1937; Haggard 1945). By 1818,
nearly 3,000 settlers from the Midwest and upper South had squatted illegally in Caddo country
along the south side of the Red River from the Great Bend to the Kiamichi River (Lottinville
1980:170-172). Anglo-American settlements increased up to and beyond the time of the Texas
Revolution in 1836 (Strickland 1937:64-238). This settlement expansion was also accompanied
by an influx of aboriginal groups from east of the Mississippi River and from the Arkansas River,
including Choctaw, Cherokee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Shawnee, and Koasati groups
(Anderson 1990; Everett 1990; Ewers 1969; Kniffen et al. 1987; Williams 1964). These groups
exchanged hides, corn, pumpkins, and beans at the trading house in Nacogdoches (Swanton
1942:88) as well as with American government traders at the new agency house at the mouth of
the Sulphur River. As the frontier moved west, Caddoan Indians in Louisiana became more
isolated in the Anglo-American community and were under continual pressure from these settlers
and from the immigrant Indians (Swanton 1942:88; Williams 1964). In Texas, settlement
pressures did not impinge on Caddoan lands until after 1830 (Strickland 1937:318-355), though
Stephen F. Austin viewed the aboriginal populations of Texas as a hindrance to the security of
settlement (Barker 1925).
Following the death of the Caddo chief Dehahuit in 1833, American pressure in Louisiana
on the new Caddo chiefs led to the ceding of Caddo homelands within the limits of the US on
1 July 1835 (Swanton 1942:89-92). The Caddo relinquished their lands for $80,000, agreed to
move at their own expense within 1 year of the treaty date, and moved to Texas just prior to the
establishment of the Republic of Texas in 1836. The term “Caddo Nation” came to be associated
with the Cherokee as well as with the Hasinai, Anadarko, and other related tribes of East Texas,
and the Indians became subject to the repressive measures of successive Republic of Texas
administrations (Neighbors 1973, 1975). By the early 1840s, the Caddo Nation was composed
of remnants of the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and other once-independent Caddoan tribes, and it
had been essentially pushed out of East Texas along with the other groups who had signed the
Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the Republic of Texas in 1843 (Strickland 1937:355; Swanton
1942:97). In 1846, the Kadohadacho, Hasinai, and Anadarko lived together in a village of about
150 houses on the Brazos River near the present City of Waco, Texas; shortly thereafter, they
moved near the Clear Fork of the Brazos to maintain their distance from Anglo-American frontier
communities. From 1846 to 1854, the US government and the Texas legislature founded the
Texas Indian Reservation on the Brazos River (Neighbors 1957, 1973), but this reservation lasted
only until 1859 due to frictions among white settlers, Indian agents, and the agglomeration of tribal
members. Accordingly, in August 1859, the Caddo Nation, then about 1,050 people in number,
was removed to the Indian Territory and the Wichita agency in western Oklahoma. Since that
time, the history of the Caddo peoples is largely similar to the overall history of the US.

HISTORIC EUROAMERICAN PERIOD (CA. 1519 TO PRESENT)

The first documented entry of Europeans into Cherokee and Smith counties, within which
the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project is situated, occurred on November 6, 1691, when the
expedition of Domingo Terán de los Ríos and Father Damián Massenet entered the county en

HJN 050082 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

route from San Francisco de los Tejas to the Red River4. The mission was abandoned in 1693,
and Europeans ignored the area until 1705, when French traders led by Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis began to do business among the Hasinai Caddo. To counter the resultant growing French
influence, Spanish authorities sent Capt. Domingo Ramón to establish a series of missions and
a presidio in East Texas. On July 3, 1716, Ramón founded the Nuestro Padre San Francisco de
los Tejas Mission among the Neches Indians. In June 1719, French pressure led to the temporary
abandonment of the mission, but the Marqués de Aguayo reoccupied the site on August 5, 1721,
at which time it was renamed San Francisco de los Neches. The Spanish permanently
abandoned the mission in 1730. Thereafter, a mission at Nacogdoches maintained the Spanish
presence in the area.
The first land grant in the county went to Nacogdoches merchants William Barr and Peter
Samuel Davenport in 1798, but they did not settle there. The Indians for whom the county was
named—the Cherokees—joined by Delawares, Shawnees, and Kickapoos, began settling north
of the Camino Real (the Old San Antonio Road) ca. 1820. Cherokee chiefs Bowl, Richard Fields,
and John Dunn Hunter tried unsuccessfully to obtain title to their land from the Mexican
government, and Anglo-American settlers began moving onto land claimed by Cherokees near
Linwood in the late 1820s. In 1826, Indian hopes suffered another blow when David G. Burnet
obtained an empresario grant to lands north of the Camino Real, and the area south of the road
fell to empresario Joseph Vehlein.
Rapid settlement began in 1834. The Houston-Forbes treaty of February 23, 1836,
seemingly assured Cherokee neutrality, but the rejection of the treaty by the Texas Senate and
the increased encroachment of settlers on Indian land led to violence. On October 5, 1838,
Indians massacred members of the Isaac Killough family at their farm northwest of the site of
present-day Jacksonville. This led directly to the Cherokee War of 1839 and the expulsion of all
Indians from the county. White settlers quickly occupied the abandoned Indian farms and the
communities of Pine Town, Lockranzie, Linwood, and Cook’s Fort developed. Cherokee County
was marked off from Nacogdoches County on April 11, 1846, and was organized on July 13 of
the same year. The town of Rusk was established as the county seat, though only 1 family lived
in Rusk at that time.
The county’s settlers hailed mostly from the South and brought with them the economic
and social traditions of that region. The 1850 population of 6,673 was the third largest in the state.
By 1860, the population had grown to 12,098, of whom 3,250 were slaves, 2 were free blacks,
and 14 bore Spanish surnames. Of the white families, 29% owned slaves, although only
32 plantations had 20 or more slaves; 7 slaveholders in the county owned more than 40 slaves.
Cotton was important to the local economy, and, in 1860, local farmers produced 6,251 bales of
the fiber. The area’s principal crops, however, were corn and wheat. County farmers produced
more than 496,000 bushels of corn and about 21,000 bushels of wheat in 1860.

Cherokee County voters strongly supported secession, and 24 companies from the county
entered Confederate service. The Confederate Army maintained 2 training camps, a prisoner of
war camp, a large commissary depot, and conscription and field-transportation offices in the
county. War demands allowed the development of 2 iron foundries and a gun factory.
After the war, despite a brief military occupation, Republicans had little impact and did not
seriously challenge Democratic control. There was little evidence of Ku Klux Klan or other terrorist
activity in the county during Reconstruction. Until the 1990s, the only serious challenge to
Democratic control came from the Populist party, which carried the county with strong black
support in 1894 and 1896, despite the leading role in the Democratic party of Governor James S.
Hogg, a native of Rusk. Democrats carried the county in all presidential elections except those
of 1956 and 1968 (when the county went for George Wallace) until the 1980s. Since 1984,
Cherokee County has supported Republican candidates for president, and several Republicans
were elected to county office in the 1990s.
Baptists, who organized the first church in 1844, remain the largest religious denomination
in Cherokee County. Methodist and Presbyterian churches also appeared at Alto, Rusk, and
Jacksonville in the 1840s. Blacks organized separate congregations shortly after obtaining
freedom. Other Protestant groups appeared in the 20th century, and a Catholic parish has been
active in Cherokee County since 1905, but it remained quite small until the recent influx of
Hispanics.
Educational institutions began to develop in Cherokee County soon after white settlement
began in the area. There was a secondary academy by 1848, and, in 1850, Cherokee County
had 17 public schools and ranked first in the state in the number of school children attending
(537 males, 446 females). In 1854, the county commissioners established 44 school districts,
which received some public assistance. Higher education was available as early as 1855 at Hale
Institute in Rusk, but the most important institution of higher education was Larissa College, which
opened in 1856. The Civil War considerably disrupted education, but with Reconstruction came
free public education for children of all races. Improved transportation in the 20th century led to
consolidation of the rural schools. There are now 6 independent school districts wholly in the
county, while parts of 3 others extend into the northern part of the county. Desegregation came
in the 1966 to 1969 period. Higher education is now represented by 2 church-related junior
colleges, Lon Morris College and Jacksonville College, and by North American Theological
Seminary. By 1980, almost 50% of Cherokee County residents over age 25 had completed at
least 12 years of school.
In addition to Rusk, several new towns appeared shortly after the organization of the
county. Larissa, founded in 1846 in the northwest part of the county, became the largest town.
Gum Creek, later renamed Jacksonville, was founded in 1847. Alto was established on the Old
San Antonio Road in 1851. Lone Star (originally Skin Tight), Knoxville, and Griffin were other
pioneer communities.
Railroad construction and agricultural development, especially the expansion of cotton
cultivation, helped the county to grow and mature between 1870 and 1900. In 1870, there were
1,216 farms and ranches in Cherokee County, and the county had a population of 11,079; by

HJN 050082 AR

43

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

1900, 3,683 farms and ranches had been established in the county, and the population had
increased to 25,154. During this period, total farm acreage rose from 133,014 to almost 341,000
and the number of improved acres more than tripled from 43,000 to almost 149,000.
The arrival of the railroads drastically altered the settlement pattern. Most of the old towns,
with the exceptions of Jacksonville, Rusk, and Alto, disappeared, unable to compete with the new
railroad centers. The International-Great Northern (later the Missouri Pacific), built in 1872, gave
rise to Troup and a relocated and revitalized Jacksonville. Between 1882 and 1885, the Kansas
and Gulf Short Line built north-to-south through the county, producing new towns—Bullard, Mount
Selman, Craft, Dialville, Forest, and Wells—and bringing rail service to Rusk and Alto. In 1905,
the Texas and New Orleans produced Cuney, Reese, Turney, Gallatin, Ponta, and Reklaw.
Maydelle appeared on the Texas State Railroad in 1910. The only new town not associated with
a railroad was New Summerfield, which was founded as a market center in the late 1890s. The
automobile and school consolidations led to the growth of the 4 central towns—Jacksonville,
Rusk, Alto, and Wells—at the expense of the others, which today typically have only 1 or 2 stores.
The decline of farming, which began in the 1930s, and increased industrial job
opportunities in the years during and after World War II led to another major population shift.
County population reached a peak of 43,970 in 1940, then declined to 38,694 in 1950 and to
33,120 in 1960, before dropping to its lowest point of 32,008 in 1970. Yet, during these same
years, the population of the larger towns in the county increased as the result of both emigration
from the county to outside urban areas and migration within the county from the countryside to
the towns.
Although no longer preeminent, agriculture remains important in the local economy.
Cotton replaced wheat as the major crop immediately after the Civil War and continued to grow
in importance into the 20th century. In 1928, the county’s cotton production reached its maximum
(36,951 bales), and, in 1929, 113,689 acres of Cherokee County farmland was devoted to its
cultivation. In the 1930s, production fell sharply because of low prices and New Deal allotment
programs; by 1940, cotton production utilized only about 45,000 acres in the county. Peaches
became important after the introduction of refrigerator cars in 1893, and Cherokee County
orchards produced a record of 1,204 carloads in 1912 before the San José scale and marketing
troubles brought a decline. In the late 1930s, however, peach production revived somewhat.
From its beginnings at Craft in 1897, tomato culture grew until, by 1917, Cherokee County
produced 90% of the tomatoes shipped from Texas. Tomatoes remained a major product in the
county until increased competition and marketing problems caused a sudden collapse in the
1950s. Since then, Cherokee County agriculture has centered on cattle and timber. The nursery
industry dates from the 1880s and is of increasing importance in the New Summerfield-Reklaw
area. Some truck farming still exists, dairies remain significant, and some poultry production
remains from the boom of the late 1950s. Sharecropping, which had been prevalent since
Reconstruction, largely disappeared with farming. The typical modern Cherokee County farm is
a beef-and-timber operation run as a sideline by a landowner with a job in town.
The 20th century brought numerous improvements in transportation. The first automobile
arrived in 1905; by the 1920s, automobile ownership was commonplace. During the 1930s and
1940s, the basic highway system was paved. Four federal and 4 state highways now cross the
44

Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

county, while hundreds of miles of paved Farm-to-Market (FM) roads network the rural areas.
Rail transportation, however, has been sharply curtailed. The last passenger train ran in the late
1960s, and, in the early 1980s, the Southern Pacific stopped all service, as did the Cotton Belt,
south of Rusk. The first airport in the county was established at Jacksonville in 1934. The present
county airport, built in 1961, has no scheduled airline service.
Sawmills provided the first industry in the county, beginning with John Durst’s mill at the
lower San Antonio Road crossing of the Angelina River in 1832. The rich iron ore deposits have
produced important industries 3 times—blast furnaces operated during the Civil War, in the 1884
to 1909 period, and during World War II. The industry led to the founding of New Birmingham in
1888, which grew to be a city of 2,000 inhabitants before collapsing completely as a result of the
panic of 1893. Since World War II, industry has led the private sector of the economy, employing
around 30% of the private-sector work force. Jacksonville, in which more than 60 firms make
wood, metal, and plastic products, has become the industrial and commercial hub of the county.
Altogether, some 114 manufacturing firms operated in the county in 1977. Oil was discovered in
1933, but technical and financial difficulties prevented development until 1934. Continuing
discoveries produced an oil value of $51,379,910 by 1982. Currently, 26% of the labor force
works in professional and related services (a relatively high figure reflecting employment at the
Rusk State Hospital), 22% work in manufacturing, and 18% are in wholesale and retail trade.
Tourism is of growing importance, spurred by the establishment in 1971 of the Texas State
Railroad State Historical Park.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS

Prior to initiating the baseline cultural resources survey fieldwork, Horizon conducted
preliminary archival research of documentation on file at the National Park Service’s (NPS) online
National Register Information System (NRIS), the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas), the THC’s hard copy map files, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
and the General Land Office (GLO) (NPS 2005; THC 2005). The goal of the archival research
was to locate information on previously recorded cultural resources sites within and in the vicinity
of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE, as defined, as well as to identify any previous
cultural resources investigations conducted nearby.
The objective of the archival research was to determine whether or not cultural resources
had been previously recorded within the APE and if prior investigations might affect expectations
regarding possible archeological site locations and suggest appropriate survey methods for the
current project. Archival research revealed that the segment of Mud Creek in which the proposed
Lake Columbia reservoir would be built had never been professionally studied by archeologists,
architectural historians, or other cultural resources specialists. No cultural resources sites had
been previously documented within the APE, and no records of any previous cultural resources
surveys were identified within the APE. No historic properties listed on the NRHP or designated
as SALs had been documented within or in the vicinity of the APE.

4.2

PRIOR LARGE-SCALE SURVEYS IN NORTHEAST TEXAS

As no data directly pertaining to the potential density of archeological sites in the APE
were available, other large-scale archeological surveys in Northeast Texas were examined,
including Lake Gilmer in Upshur County (Horizon 1992), Lake Naconiche in Nacogdoches County
(Perttula 2000, 2002; Perttula et al. 2002), and Troup Mine in Rusk and Smith counties, Texas
(Skinner 1981) (Table 4-1).
At Lake Gilmer in Upshur County, the cultural resources survey covered an area of
1,900.0 acres. A total of 29 archeological sites were documented during the survey, including
22 aboriginal sites and 7 historic-age sites (5 of the aboriginal sites also exhibited historic-age
cultural components). Documented aboriginal site types included lithic artifact scatters and open

campsites or hamlets ranging in age from the PaleoIndian to Caddoan periods, with the majority
of definable aboriginal cultural components dating to the Caddoan period. Historic-age sites
included a variety of farmsteads, tenant houses, industrial sites (including 2 syrup mills), and a
trail or road dating from the early 19th to 20th centuries. Archeological sites occurred in a broad
cross-section of physiographic settings, ranging from alluvial fans and terraces on floodplains to
terrace margins and upland settings, though sites appear to have been most commonly
encountered in upland settings. At Lake Gilmer, the density of archeological sites within the
surveyed area was 0.015 sites per acre surveyed, or 1 site per 65.5 acres (see Table 4-1).
At Lake Naconiche in Nacogdoches County, the overall project area covered a total of
1,254.0 acres, though only 609.0 acres of high-probability areas were surveyed. A total of
65 sites, including 62 newly documented sites and 3 previously recorded sites, were encountered
during the survey of the 609 acres of high-probability areas, including 60 aboriginal sites,
3 historic-age sites, and 2 mixed aboriginal and historic-age sites. Aboriginal cultural components
consisted of a range of lithic artifact scatters and open campsites or hamlets, including 2 Archaic
sites, 9 Early Ceramic sites, 11 Caddoan sites, 9 ceramic sites of unidentified Late Prehistoric
age (i.e., Early Ceramic to Caddo periods), and 31 components of undetermined prehistoric age.
No PaleoIndian components were recorded. Historic-age sites included 3 farmsteads or
homesteads, 1 cemetery, and 1 trash dump ranging in age from the late 19th to 20th centuries.
The majority of the documented sites occurred on alluvial fans and terraces and on toe slopes
along valley margins, though upland settings were also relatively common.
By way of contrast, the cultural resources survey of the proposed Troup Mine in Rusk and
Smith counties was examined. While the Troup Mine survey area was situated in a predominantly
upland environment and is therefore not entirely comparable to the bottomland environments that
characterize most of the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE, the Troup Mine project area was located
nearer to the current project’s APE than the other reservoir projects. During the Troup Mine
survey, a total of 33,200.0 acres of the overall 35,000.0-acre project area were surveyed, and
248 archeological sites were documented, resulting in a site density of 0.0007 sites per acre
surveyed, or 1 site per 133.9 acres. Documented sites included 94 historic-age standing
structures, 108 historic-age archeological sites, and 46 aboriginal sites. Prehistoric sites included

48

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Archaic, Sanders Focus (Early Caddoan period), and Frankston Focus (Late Caddoan period)
cultural components, and historic-age sites spanned the period from 1850 to World War ii.
The site-density data from these previous studies in Northeast Texas are not directly
comparable to each other or to the current project’s APE, though they represent the only available
data set upon which to extrapolate the total population of cultural resources sites that may be
expected to occur within the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE. At Lake
Gilmer, for example, the entire 1,900.0-acre project area was surveyed, while less than 50% of
the proposed Lake Naconiche reservoir (i.e., only those areas identified as having a high
probability to contain archeological sites) was surveyed. As a result, the overall site density was
much higher at Lake Naconiche (1 site per 9.4 acres) than at Lake Gilmer (1 site per 65.5 acres).
Furthermore, the physiographic environment of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir is not
necessarily comparable to the environments of the other Northeast Texas reservoirs. Mud Creek
possesses a much wider floodplain than either Lake Gilmer or Lake Naconiche, and most of the
lower elevations in the Mud Creek basin consist of braided stream meanders and deep overbank
alluvial deposits. While these settings have the potential to contain buried archeological deposits,
such settings have proved difficult to survey for cultural resources in Northeast Texas. In the
context of the current study, the majority of the high-probability settings selected for survey were
located along the valley margins; as such, broad expanses of floodplain acreage within the Mud
Creek basin were not surveyed during the baseline cultural resources survey. Nevertheless,
based on the data from these previous studies, the density of archeological sites that may be
expected in the 12,370.0-acre APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project may range from
as low as 189 sites (projected from the Lake Gilmer data) to as many as 1,316 sites (projected
from the Lake Naconiche data). Projected from the Troup Mine data, the proposed Lake Columbia
APE would be projected to contain 92 sites, though this calculation is likely erroneous as the
Troup Mine survey consisted almost exclusively of upland settings, whereas only a minute
proportion of the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE consists of upland settings or upland margins.

4.3

HISTORIC MAP ANALYSIS

As discussed in Chapter 3.0, the first land grant in Cherokee County went to Nacogdoches
merchants William Barr and Peter Samuel Davenport in 1798; however, they did not settle there.
After several Cherokee chiefs attempted unsuccessfully to obtain title to their land from the
Mexican government, Anglo-American settlers began moving onto land claimed by Cherokees
near Linwood in the late 1820s. In 1826, David G. Burnet obtained an empresario grant to lands
north of the Camino Real, and the area south of the road fell to empresario Joseph Vehlein. Rapid
settlement, however, did not begin until 1834.
Horizon performed a preliminary inspection of the GLO’s historic land plats of Cherokee
County dated 1848, 1851, 1877, 1879, and 1902. These maps indicated that Cherokee County
was platted in its entirety by 1848. A small sample of the names recorded on the historic GLO
plat maps were compared to names listed on the Texas State Historical Association’s (TSHA)
Handbook of Texas Online. This cursory examination suggested that at least some of the
individuals who owned plats of land in the vicinity of the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project area were of historical importance, including Thomas Jefferson Rusk, a signatory of the

HJN 050082 AR

49

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

Texas Declaration of Independence. It is currently unknown whether or not the landowners whose
names are depicted on historic GLO plat maps actually lived on the land they owned in this area.
More extensive historic and archival research would be necessary to place the individuals and
families who owned land and/or lived in the vicinity of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project
into a proper historic context.

5.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY METHODOLOGY

5.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

At the survey level of investigation, the principal objectives of cultural resources
management are to inventory the cultural resources in the APE of the proposed undertaking and
to collect sufficient data to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the cultural
resources possess significance. As the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project falls under both
federal and state jurisdiction, the significance of cultural resources would be evaluated based on
their eligibility for listing on the NRHP (under the NHPA) and for designation as SALs (under the
Antiquities Code of Texas). Thus, the primary cultural resources management goals at the survey
level are typically as follows:



Locate all historic-age and aboriginal (i.e., prehistoric, protohistoric, and early historic)
cultural resources that occur within the designated APE.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

For archeological sites, significance is usually defined based on the potential of a cultural
resource to make a contribution to 1 or more previously defined research domains; however, the
limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner
to such research issues. The objective of the inventory survey is rather to determine which
cultural resources sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for evaluating the significance of cultural resources. Because research
questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of site context and
chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the
inventory process. For non-archeological historic structures, objects, and districts, significance is
often based on architectural characteristics and associations with historically important persons
or events, though research potential may also be a consideration.

5.2

PROJECT HISTORY

Formal consultation among the USACE, ANRA, RJBCO, and Horizon began at a project
kick-off meeting held at the USACE’s offices in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 6, 2005, and
preliminary details concerning the requirements for the third-party EIS in general, and cultural
resources investigations in particular, for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project were
discussed. Consultative discussions continued from May to August 2005 via telephone
conversations and in-person meetings, during which the third-party EIS and cultural resources
survey requirements were refined.
In regard to the cultural resources component of the larger third-party EIS effort, these
early conversations accomplished 3 primary goals:
1. Define the APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project that would be covered
under the current USACE permitting activity.
2. Identify the parties that would participate in cultural resources consultation in
connection with the proposed undertaking.
3. Define the minimum acceptable level of cultural resources management activities that
would be necessary to provide the USACE with sufficient information to issue an MOA
or PA, as appropriate, for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project.
During the ongoing May to August 2005 conversations held among the USACE, ANRA,
RJBCO, and Horizon, the USACE initially stipulated that the entire APE would need to be
surveyed for cultural resources prior to development of an MOA or PA. The reason for the
USACE’s directive regarding survey coverage was that no prior cultural resources investigations
had been conducted within the APE; in fact, very few previous cultural resources studies had
been conducted in the surrounding region. As a result, virtually nothing was known about the
nature or quantity of cultural resources that may be expected to occur within the APE, and archival
research could not be expected to provide any information that would be directly relevant to
evaluating the potential effects of the proposed undertaking on historic properties.
The USACE therefore established that the third-party EIS process needed to incorporate
cultural resources investigations that would provide sufficient information on the nature, variety,
location, and significance of cultural resources for the USACE to prepare an MOA or PA, as
appropriate, a necessary step in the third-party EIS process. In order to develop the MOA or PA,
the USACE initially stated that it would require (1) a complete (100%) inventory of all cultural
resources that potentially may be impacted by construction of the proposed Lake Columbia, and
(2) sufficient information about the age, cultural affiliation, chronological sequence of cultural
deposits, and integrity of the resources to determine their significance, as measured by their
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Thus, the cultural resources
survey of the proposed Lake Columbia APE would need to be complete, and all cultural resources
that potentially would be affected by the proposed undertaking would need to be documented to
an adequate extent to determine their significance. As it is rarely possible to make firm eligibility
assessments based only on survey-level data, the USACE indicated that it may additionally be

52

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

necessary to complete some initial level of eligibility testing on some of the sites to supplement
survey-level information.
In August 2005, Horizon developed a Draft Scope of Work (Draft SOW) for the cultural
resources survey of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. The Draft SOW was designed to
accommodate the USACE’s requirements as defined to date and included provisions for an
intensive archeological survey, an intensive geomorphological study, a historic structures
reconnaissance survey, and historical and archival research that would allow for the beginnings
of a historic context to be developed for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. It was already
clear at this point, however, that the financing available to fund the development of the third-party
EIS and to perform appurtenant studies, such as the cultural resources investigations, would be
insufficient to allow for an intensive cultural resources inventory of the entire 12,370.0-acre APE.
Consequently, the Draft SOW proposed to stratify the physiographic environments encompassed
within the APE into areas with “high” versus “moderate” and “low” probabilities to contain cultural
resources and to focus cultural resources survey activities on “high-probability” landforms to
maximize the amount of data collected during the survey given the available resources. By
surveying only a portion of the APE, the Draft SOW provided for documenting a sample of cultural
resources that may be expected to occur within the APE rather than developing an exhaustive
inventory. The Draft SOW was submitted to the USACE, the THC, and the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma (Caddo Nation) for review on August 26, 2005. At the same time, Horizon submitted
an application form for a Texas Antiquities Permit to the THC based on the methodology outlined
in the Draft SOW.
On September 30, 2005, the THC issued correspondence containing its comments on the
Draft SOW to the USACE. In general, the THC concurred with the survey and analysis methods
presented in the Draft SOW; however, the THC expressed concern that the APE should be
expanded to cover the 100-year flood and PMF elevations as well as any downstream areas that
may be affected by water releases from the dam. The THC also stated that all ancillary facilities
associated with the undertaking should be included in the APE.
The Caddo Nation offered its comments on the Draft SOW in correspondence dated
November 3, 2005. The Caddo Nation expressed its concerns that the Draft SOW did not provide
for identifying TCPs and requested that the Caddo Nation be invited to participate in the
consultative process to resolve any adverse effects to TCPs.
The USACE offered its comments on the Draft SOW and its responses to the THC’s and
Caddo Nation’s concerns in correspondence dated November 1, 2005. In general, the USACE
concurred with the recommended cultural resources survey strategy with a few minor revisions.
First, the USACE agreed that segmenting the APE into environments with higher and lower
probabilities for cultural resources was reasonable; however, the USACE stressed the importance
of expending a sufficient level of field effort and wisely concentrating subsurface testing options
to maximize the information return of such a probability model. Second, the USACE requested
clarification that all artifacts found on cultural resources sites would remain the property of the
landowners since all property within the APE was privately owned at the time. Third, the USACE
indicated that the objectives of the intensive geomorphic investigations may be too ambitious for
the current stage of work and allowed that some of the more intensive studies could be postponed

HJN 050082 AR

53

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

until a future phase of investigations. Fourth, in response to the Caddo Nation’s concerns, the
USACE provided language to be included in the SOW indicating that independent consultation
would be initiated with the Caddo Nation on a government-to-government basis to resolve the
Caddo Nation’s concerns about TCPs. Finally, the USACE responded to the THC’s comments
about the extent of the APE, expressing that the reservoir design did not provide for any floodstorage capacity and that no plans had been announced to purchase flood easements or retain
high flows, effectively limiting the APE for the current phase of investigations to that described in
this report.
In November 2005, Horizon developed a Final Scope of Work (Final SOW) incorporating
the USACE’s requested revisions and responses to the THC’s and Caddo Nation’s comments
(Owens 2005). Based on the USACE’s November 1, 2005, comments, the geomorphological
investigations were abbreviated, though the proposed methodologies for the archeological
survey, historic structures reconnaissance survey, and historical and archival research were not
adjusted at this time. Language was added to the Final SOW expressing that the USACE would
consult with the Caddo Nation to develop a strategy for addressing the Caddo Nation’s concerns
about TCPs separately from the archeological, geomorphological, and historical studies being
conducted as part of the third-party EIS process, and the discussion of the artifact collection policy
was updated to reflect that the entire APE was under private ownership. The Final SOW was
submitted to the agencies on December 2, 2005.
Formal comments were not received on the Final SOW from the USACE, the THC, or the
Caddo Nation, and the THC granted Antiquities Permit No. 4005 on January 12, 2006, to ANRA
and Horizon to perform the cultural resources investigations described in the Final SOW. At this
time, ANRA and RJBCO notified Horizon of additional financial constraints that arose subsequent
to agency acceptance of the Final SOW. In response, Horizon formulated a condensed cultural
resources inventory proposal that abbreviated the level of effort of both the archeological and
geomorphological surveys even further yet would still provide the USACE with sufficient
information to characterize cultural resources within the APE, though not to the same degree as
proposed in the Final SOW. In effect, the revised Final SOW would focus archeological survey
activities on a sample of “high-probability” environments, with attention paid to “moderate-“ and
“low-probability” settings only on an opportunistic basis; eliminate any eligibility testing on
archeological sites of unknown significance; and further reduce the level of geomorphological
investigations. Horizon, RJBCO, and ANRA arranged a conference call with the USACE to
discuss the revised plan on January 13, 2006. The USACE concurred during the conference call
and in a follow-up e-mail dated February 7, 2006, that the revised work plan would be sufficient
to accomplish the most immediate goals of the third-party EIS, but stipulated that additional
archeological and geomorphological investigations would likely be required at a later time to
complete the originally scoped inventory activities.
Thus, the final approved SOW, hereafter referred to simply as the “approved SOW,”
proposed to survey a sample of high-probability environments within the overall Lake Columbia
Water Supply Project APE in the interest of obtaining representative information about the types
of cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE. The purpose of this sample
survey strategy was to provide the USACE with enough information to characterize the types of

54

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

cultural resources that are likely to occur within the APE rather than to provide an exhaustive
listing of all cultural resources that actually exist within the APE. As this survey was not designed
to provide 100% intensive survey coverage of the APE, it was designated as a baseline, or “Phase
1a,” cultural resources study to distinguish this phase of survey-level investigations from any
future survey activities that would be necessary to develop a comprehensive inventory of cultural
resources within the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE.

5.3

CULTURAL RESOURCES PROBABILITY MODEL

As discussed in the approved SOW for the baseline cultural resources investigations,
Horizon developed a probability model prior to initiating archeological fieldwork that stratified the
APE into physiographic environments with “high” versus “moderate” and “low” probabilities for
containing cultural resources that could be located quickly using basic surveying techniques (i.e.,
pedestrian walkover and shovel testing).
Dr. Timothy K. Perttula of Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC (AEC), as well as Robert Cast, Tribal Historic Preservation
Officer (THPO), and Bobby Gonzales of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, assisted with the
development of the probability model. It should be noted that the high-probability landforms
identified in the model tended to represent likely locations for later prehistoric (i.e., Caddoan)
archeological sites and, to a lesser degree, earlier prehistoric sites. Earlier prehistoric sites may
be located on any type of physiographic landform, including those defined as high-, moderate-,
and low-probability, but low-probability environments, as defined here, generally consisted of
marshy lowlands that are difficult to survey using conventional techniques. Thus, the probability
model was designed to maximize the number of sites that could be documented given the financial
and time constraints available for fieldwork rather than to provide a 100% inventory of all sites
that may be present within the APE.
A total of 208 high-probability areas (HPA) were identified inside of and adjacent to the
APE that covered a cumulative total of 2,064.0 acres (Appendix A, Figure A-3). All or portions of
160 of these 208 HPAs fall within the boundaries of the APE, covering a total area of
1,272.0 acres, or approximately 10% of the 12,370.0-acre APE. HPAs for aboriginal cultural
resources included alluvial formations on floodplains, along valley margins, and at the mouths of
tributary streams where they discharge into lower-order stream floodplains. In Mud Creek, such
areas included sandy ridges bordering stream meander scars on the floodplain; alluvial fans and
terraces on the floodplain, along valley margins, and at the mouths of tributary streams; similar
landforms along higher-order tributary streams; topographically elevated ridges and rises in
otherwise low-lying, partially or totally inundated floodplain settings; alluvial and/or colluvial
landforms at the mouths of tributary streams where they discharge into the Mud Creek floodplain;
and upland settings near springs or other perennial water sources. During the archeological
fieldwork, Horizon surveyed high-probability landforms located within the APE as well as areas
within the APE adjacent to high-probability landforms located just beyond the APE. While a small
fraction of the HPAs were not surveyed due to their relative inaccessibility and time constraints,
the vast majority of these landforms were surveyed for cultural resources.
Moderate-probability areas (MPA) for aboriginal cultural resources included areas lying
between high-probability landforms along valley margins outside of seasonally or permanently

HJN 050082 AR

55

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

inundated floodplains. MPAs were not specifically delineated on project maps or quantified by
number or acreage but rather were identified during the fieldwork. MPAs were surveyed
opportunistically for cultural resources based on available time and accessibility, usually while
field crews were moving from one HPA to another.
Low-probability areas (LPA) for cultural resources included low-lying, permanently or
seasonally inundated floodplain settings; steeply sloping valley margins; some landforms lacking
a developed B horizon; and some upland settings. Floodplain settings in general have a low
probability for historic-age cultural resources, though elevated alluvial formations may represent
suitable historic habitation sites. Steep valley margins (i.e., those with slopes greater than ca.
20%) have a low potential to contain any cultural resources. LPAs also included any landform
that had experienced extensive damage from natural (e.g., erosion, bioturbation) or artificial (e.g.,
construction, timber clearing, plowing, residential and commercial development) impacts. LPAs
also were not specifically delineated prior to the beginning of fieldwork, but were expected to be
largely coextensive with the bottomland wetland environments identified during earlier wetland
studies. A small sample of LPAs was surveyed opportunistically as time and accessibility allowed,
though the low-lying portions of the Mud Creek and tributary floodplains near the primary stream
channels and channel meanders were not surveyed.

5.4

GEOMORPHOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

As originally designed in the Draft SOW (Owens 2005), the geomorphological study was
intended to provide preliminary views of late Quaternary deposits and channel evolution
processes in the APE as well as a means of identifying areas where more intensive subsurface
prospecting may be necessary to identify deeply buried cultural resources sites. This study was
to involve basic geomorphic mapping and limited stratigraphic exploration, possibly coupled with
radiocarbon dating of any marker paleosols that were identified. The geomorphic field study was
to be performed concurrently with the archeological survey and conducted in sufficient detail to
guide archeological survey in terms of identifying (1) landforms with a potential to contain surficial
and subsurface cultural resources and (2) methods appropriate to detecting cultural resources in
different areas. The geomorphic work would utilize inspections of exposed stratigraphic profiles,
mechanical trenching, and/or soil coring, possibly combined with limited radiocarbon dating.
Sufficient subsurface investigations were to be conducted to examine and describe soil profiles
so that marker strata could be identified and targeted for archeological investigation.
Four specific objectives were identified in the original Draft SOW for this phase of
investigation (Owens 2005):

56



Develop a preliminary map of landforms and geomorphic features in the APE that
would serve to enhance and focus archeological survey activities.



Conduct limited stratigraphic/subsurface examination by soil coring and/or mechanical
trenching, possibly combined with limited radiocarbon dating of the landforms
identified during geomorphic mapping activities, to form a preliminary impression of
the age and depositional history of each feature.



Identify areas within the APE for more detailed stratigraphic and subsurface
prospecting and dating to be performed during future phases of geomorphological
studies.



Evaluate the deep stratigraphy of the proposed dam axis, where construction-related
impacts are likely to be relatively deeper than in other portions of the APE.

However, not all of these objectives were addressed in the approved SOW owing to
financial and scheduling constraints and the results of ongoing consultation with the USACE to
determine the requirements of baseline investigations, which resulted in an overall reduction of
the level of effort for the baseline geomorphological study. The work that was performed
principally consisted of a limited subsurface/stratigraphic examination of late Quaternary deposits
in sample locations along Mud Creek in order to form an impression of the temporal activity of the
stream and the potential of these deposits to obscure buried prehistoric archeological sites. Also,
while the geomorphic study was originally intended to be performed concurrently with the baseline
archeological survey, the geomorphic survey was in fact conducted following the conclusion of
the archeological fieldwork due to scheduling conflicts.
Dr. Charles Frederick conducted the geomorphic field reconnaissance with the assistance
of Reign Clark, Horizon Project Archeologist, who operated the backhoe for the mechanical
trenching. The results of the geomorphic study are presented in Chapter 6.0.

5.5

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY PROCEDURES

Archeological survey procedures were differentiated according to the probability model
categories discussed above for different areas and landforms within the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project’s APE.
HPAs were intensively surveyed for cultural resources, including thorough surface
inspection and shovel testing. The spacing of survey transects and/or field crew within HPAs
depended, to some degree, on the thickness of forest and ground cover, with thicker vegetation
generally requiring that the field crew remain closer together. Horizon field crew members
covered the ground in HPAs in the manner best suited to specific areas, but generally did not
necessarily walk parallel, linear survey transects. The goal was to locate cultural resources in the
most effective and efficient manner possible, whether this called for traversal of parallel, linear
transects or a more targeted approach to surface inspection, while still covering the area in its
entirety. Shovel tests were excavated in sufficient density to assess the presence or absence of
HPAs for subsurface cultural resources. Shovel tests in HPAs were excavated at intervals
ranging from 15.0 to 100.0 meters (49.2 to 328.0 feet). Tighter shovel testing intervals in the 15.0to 30.0-meter (49.2- to 98.4-foot) range were favored in HPAs, especially those with dense
vegetative growth. Higher or lower densities of shovel tests were called for based on local
conditions.
MPAs were subjected to at least reconnaissance-level survey, including pedestrian
walkover and judgmental shovel testing. Methods for surveying moderate-probability areas were

HJN 050082 AR

57

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

generally similar to those employed in HPAs but involved lower densities of shovel tests and
possibly wider transect intervals.
LPAs were selectively spot-checked to assess the reliability of the probability model. A
sample of low-probability areas was examined to determine the stratigraphic structure and
presence or absence of cultural resources. Survey activities conducted within LPAs included
surface inspection and shovel testing.
5.5.1

Pedestrian Walkover and Surface Inspection

The primary method utilized in most cultural resources survey projects is pedestrian
walkover of the APE. Pedestrian survey involves traversing the landscape located within the APE
on foot and thoroughly examining the modern ground surface for evidence of cultural resources.
In regions with little vegetation cover and relatively thin soils, such as desert regions or rocky
upland environments, a pedestrian walkover is often sufficient to determine the nature and extent
of any cultural resources that may be present. In regions with thicker vegetation cover, in which
the modern ground surface is not continuously visible, and in areas with deeper soils in which
buried cultural resources may exist, subsurface prospecting methods are usually necessary to
assess the potential for cultural resources. Inspection of erosional features, such as
streambanks, rills, and gullies, encountered during pedestrian survey can often provide insights
into near-surface stratigraphy and the potential of different landforms to contain buried cultural
resources. Ground surface visibility was typically low throughout the APE due to ground cover,
and shovel testing and other subsurface prospecting techniques were therefore essential to
locating and defining archeological deposits within the APE.
5.5.2

Shovel Testing

Shovel tests are manually excavated subsurface probes that are designed to provide
information about stratigraphy and the presence/absence of belowground cultural resources. The
THC, in coordination with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), has developed a set of
minimum cultural resource survey standards called the Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS). The TSMASS state the minimum requirements for surveys
conducted in the State of Texas that must be met, other things being equal, for the project to pass
regulatory review. The standards identify the minimum amount of work that will be considered
acceptable by the THC for intensive archeological surveys. These standards are not intended to
limit additional work that may be necessary or desirable to identify and delineate archeological
sites on the basis of the APE, anticipated impacts, or the likelihood of encountering cultural
resources, but serve to establish a minimum level of effort that is considered to represent a good
faith effort to identify cultural resources.
For project areas measuring more than 200.0 acres in size, such as the Lake Columbia
Water Supply Project, the TSMASS requires that appropriate survey methods be negotiated with
the THC’s Archeology Division prior to implementing the survey to determine the minimum level
of effort that would be considered acceptable. The survey methods implemented during the
survey reflected prior discussions undertaken with the USACE and THC and were consistent with
the TSMASS requirements as defined for this project.

58

Shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 centimeters (cm) (11.8 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below ground surface, to pre-cultural
deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. Shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary 20.0-cm
(7.9-inch) levels unless natural stratigraphic breaks were observed. In a few cases, shovel tests
were expanded to 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) in diameter or more to explore subsurface archeological
deposits on a small number of archeological sites. These larger shovel tests are explicitly noted
within the appropriate site descriptions in Chapter 7.0. All sediments excavated from shovel tests
were screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) hardware cloth, and screened sediments
were replaced in the shovel test hole after recording was complete.
The Universe Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of each shovel test were
determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based
on the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27). In the event that forest canopy cover was
sufficiently thick in some areas to prevent GPS devices from obtaining a satellite lock, the
locations of shovel tests were determined with the maximum accuracy possible by triangulating
the shovel test location among recognizable landforms and plotted on USGS 7.5-minute
topographic field maps. The UTM coordinates of triangulated shovel tests were determined later
based on their mapped locations. Shovel test locations were downloaded from GPS devices on
a daily basis during the archeological survey, and a Geographic Information System (GIS) data
layer was updated daily showing the georeferenced locations of all shovel tests excavated during
the survey.
Information on each shovel test was recorded on standard shovel test logs, including the
UTM coordinates and unique identification number of each shovel test, the stratigraphy observed
in the shovel test, the color and texture of sediments, the surveyor’s name, the quantity and type
of any cultural materials recovered from the shovel test, and other relevant information about
natural sediment inclusions and excavation conditions. If a shovel test was terminated prior to
reaching a depth of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface, the reason for terminating the shovel test
was provided on the shovel test log completed by the surveyor. During the final quality assurance
review of shovel testing data conducted for the preparation of the table presented in Appendix E
of this report, a note was made regarding whether or not each shovel test was able to penetrate
to pre-cultural deposits.
Maps showing the locations of all 2,526 shovel tests excavated during the baseline
archeological survey are presented in Appendix C, and Appendix E summarizes data from all
2,526 shovel tests.
5.5.3

Mechanical Trenching

In general terms, some form of subsurface prospecting for cultural resources is necessary
whenever a potential for buried archeological materials exists in a specific physiographic setting.
Shovel testing is capable of penetrating up to 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface and constitutes
an appropriate site prospecting technique in areas where cultural resources are buried in nearsurface sediments. Whenever Holocene sediment packages deeper than about 1.0 meter
(3.3 feet) exist, it is necessary to employ a technique capable of exposing or sampling more
deeply buried deposits. Backhoe or trackhoe trenching is the most commonly used form of deep

HJN 050082 AR

59

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

sampling as it provides long, linear exposures of sediment strata and also provides a mechanism
for sampling more deeply buried soil strata for cultural resources. Mechanical trenching is
required by the TSMASS whenever deep alluvial packages or other sediment deposits are
encountered. As most of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE is situated in floodplain
and valley margin environments, mechanical trenching would ordinarily be extensive during an
archeological survey provided that accessibility constraints do not preclude the use of heavy
equipment in remote floodplain locations.
However, no mechanical trenching was conducted during the baseline archeological
survey due to time and financial constraints associated with completing the approved SOW and
access restrictions to the privately owned lands that characterized the APE at the time of the
survey. As noted in the preceding section, during the final quality assurance review of shovel
testing data conducted for the preparation of the shovel test data table presented in Appendix E
of this report, a note was made regarding whether or not each shovel test was able to penetrate
to pre-cultural deposits. In the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward
in the future, these notes regarding the depth of subsurface sediments with the potential to contain
archeological deposits can be used to target appropriate locations for backhoe trenching.
Limited backhoe trenching was conducted during the baseline geomorphic study. The
stratigraphy of Mud Creek was examined by means of subsurface investigations in 3 distinct areas
of the APE, and efforts were made to obtain a cross-section of the valley floor deposits in each of
these areas. Area 1 is the southernmost of the 3 study transects and was situated along an
overhead power line corridor just north of and parallel to US 79. Area 2 is situated at the point
where Mud Creek crosses Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 4223 between the communities of Tecula
and Gould. Area 3 is located in the northern reaches of the APE, just west of Troup, in the vicinity
of FM 4915, which used to cross Mud Creek but has since been largely abandoned. A total of
30 backhoe trenches were excavated during the geomorphic study, including 10 in Area 1, 10 in
Area 2, and 10 in Area 3.
Locations selected for stratigraphic study were chosen, first, for general ease of access
and, second, on the basis of the alluvial geomorphology. Ease of access to the floodplain was
paramount in selecting locations for this work due to the limited amount of time available for
fieldwork. With this in mind, existing transmission line and road rights-of-way were selected as
they consisted of corridors that had been cleared of vegetation and were generally maintained.
Two of the areas examined were accessed from existing or abandoned county roads that crossed
the Mud Creek valley floor. In the field, deposits were exposed by means of a backhoe and by
coring. Vertical sections thus created were subsequently cleaned with a flat-bladed shovel,
described using the nomenclature of Schoeneberger et al. (2002), and photographed, and the
deposits were related to local geomorphic features. Radiocarbon dating of identified sediment
units was not conducted, though several soil samples were collected for possible future sediment
humate dating.
Trenches were excavated using a backhoe with a 0.6-meter- (2.0-foot-) wide bucket and
generally measured approximately 3.0 to 4.0 meters (9.8 to 13.1 feet) in length. Trenches were
excavated by removing thin layers measuring approximately 0.1 m (0.3 feet) in thickness from
across the entire trench before proceeding downwards. Maps showing the locations of all
60

30 backhoe trenches excavated during the baseline geomorphic survey are presented in
Appendix C. Unfortunately, field data recorded by Dr. Frederick during the baseline geomorphic
study, such as stratigraphic profiles observed in backhoe trenches and soil cores, are not
available for publication. The only exception is the stratigraphic profile of 1 backhoe trench
(BT011), in which archeological site 41CE403 was recorded, as this information was provided to
Horizon for inclusion in the interim report at the request of the Principal Investigator immediately
after the completion of fieldwork (Owens et al. 2006).
5.5.4

Archeological Site Recording Procedures
Criteria for Recognizing Archeological Sites

Archeological sites are constellations of cultural materials, such as artifacts, structures,
ecofacts, cultural features, and the built landscape, that represent the patterned, material results
of past human activities on the landscape. Theoretically, a site can therefore be any patterned
material representation of past human activity, ranging from a single artifact lying on the modern
ground surface to an extensive complex of burial mounds covering hundreds of acres. For largescale survey projects such as the current one, it is often helpful to establish a definition for
archeological sites that can be used to establish the minimum criteria that a cultural locality must
meet to warrant formal designation as an archeological site. For the Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project, a cultural resources locality had to minimally contain multiple similar artifacts, multiple
types of artifacts, and/or at least 1 cultural feature in 2 discrete locations (such as in 2 different
shovel tests or in 1 shovel test and a separate surface context), to warrant designation as an
archeological site. Not all archeological sites are necessarily significant or warrant further
investigation based on their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs;
however, by definition, a cultural resources locality must be sufficiently complex to warrant
designation as an archeological site in order to warrant evaluation of its significance.
Delineating and Recording Archeological Sites
Whenever any cultural resources were observed on the modern ground surface or
detected in a shovel test, Horizon’s archeologists undertook further investigations to determine
the nature and extent of the cultural materials. Regardless of whether the initial cultural materials
were observed in surface or subsurface contexts, subsurface probes were excavated at regular
intervals extending outward radially from the location of the original find to determine if additional
cultural materials were present. The length of the shovel testing interval was determined to some
extent by the size of the landform on which the cultural resources were observed (e.g., larger
intervals were necessary to adequately cover extensive landforms and/or large sites efficiently)
and the nature of the cultural resources observed (e.g., a historic-age farmstead may be
delineated based on surface features with minimal shovel testing if no subsurface cultural
deposits were present). Site boundaries were determined based on the extent of observable
cultural materials on the modern ground surface and/or in subsurface probes, and an attempt was
made to excavate delineation shovel tests outward until culturally sterile sediments were
encountered in at least 1, and whenever possible 2, consecutive shovel tests.

HJN 050082 AR

61

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

Standard site recording forms were used to record pertinent information on location,
physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics (e.g., vegetation, soils, distance to
nearest water); types and quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and densities of artifacts;
types and locations of cultural features; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of surface
and subsurface cultural deposits. Any diagnostic artifacts identified in the field were quantified
and described on the recording form. A scaled sketch map was drawn that illustrated site
boundaries; locations of shovel tests, locations of cultural features and material concentrations,
and notable features of the landscape. Each site was thoroughly photodocumented using color
digital photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all photographs taken.
Site Identification Numbers
Temporary site identification numbers were given to each archeological site documented
during the baseline archeological survey. The temporary site numbers consisted of an initial 2letter code designating which of the 2 field crews recorded the site followed by a sequential
numeric identifier beginning at “001.” Sites recorded by the “Reservoir Dogs” field crew bore the
designation “RD,” while sites recorded by the “Diggin’ Dillos” team were identified by the letters
“DD.” Based on the information recorded on archeological site recording forms during the
fieldwork, State of Texas Archeological Data Site Forms were completed by Horizon’s laboratory
personnel using the most current version of TARL’s TexSite archeological data collection
software, the forms were submitted to TARL, and TARL issued permanent site trinomials for each
site. The temporary site identification numbers given to each site in the field have been retained
along with the permanent trinomial as a quality control measure throughout the project.
Criteria for Recognizing Isolated Artifact Occurrences
Whenever any cultural materials were observed during the survey, Horizon’s personnel
delineated the nature, extent, and quantity of the materials. Isolated occurrences of artifacts may
not warrant formal designation as archeological sites if they are present in extremely small
numbers or lack any contextual associations that would help identify the functional or
chronological associations of the items. Any cultural resources observed during the survey that
failed to meet the minimum criteria for definition, delineation, and recording as an archeological
site were designated as isolated occurrences (IO) of artifacts. In general, any occurrence of a
single, isolated artifact in either surface or subsurface contexts that lacked any apparent
associations with other cultural resources or paleosols was designated as an isolated occurrence,
unless exceptional circumstances warranted its designation as a site. Locational data for IOs
were recorded using the mapping procedures discussed above (i.e., GPS or triangulation
mapping), the cultural materials and the setting were described on standard field forms, and the
materials were collected or discarded.
5.5.5

Collections Policy

The goal of Horizon’s collections policy for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project was
to provide the maximum amount of information about cultural resources encountered during the
field survey. Horizon’s standard archeological survey paperwork required field crew members to
record extensive details about survey methodology, including field conditions, shovel test

62

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

locations, and soil data, as well as about cultural resources encountered. Many archeological
firms or specific projects employ non-collection policies during inventory surveys. The reasons
for implementing collection versus non-collection policies vary widely. In some cases,
documenting and discarding cultural materials in the field is desirable because the materials are
allowed to remain on the archeological site from which they originated. Non-collection strategies
also reduce the cost of curating archeological collections when projects are finished. However, if
cultural materials are not collected, their information potential is limited to the data recorded in the
field, and such information is rarely sufficient to meet most analytical purposes.
For the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Horizon employed a collection-oriented
policy for cultural materials. Aboriginal (i.e., prehistoric, protohistoric, and early historic) and
historic-age cultural materials, including both diagnostic and at least a sample of non-diagnostic
artifacts, were collected. This includes cultural materials observed on the modern ground surface
and recovered from shovel tests. In the event that large quantities of non-diagnostic artifacts
(e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, metal scrap) were identified within a single
location, these materials were selectively collected to provide a representative sample of
materials present. Any cultural materials that were not collected were replaced in the location
from which they were recovered and noted on field forms.
For the most part, Horizon’s collections policy applied to aboriginal cultural resources,
which tend to consist of smaller objects that are readily portable, as well as to smaller historicage objects. Larger historic-age objects (e.g., railroad ties, wheel components, furniture) and
components of historic-era features (e.g., wells, cisterns, fences, houses) were documented in
the field, but they were obviously not dismantled and transported to the laboratory. In fact, under
the NRHP, historic structures, objects, and districts need to demonstrate integrity of context and
setting to qualify as significant cultural resources, and dismantling the historic landscape would
affect the integrity of such resources.
Cultural materials were placed in resealable plastic bags labeled with relevant
provenience information and returned to Horizon’s laboratory facilities for processing, cataloging,
and analysis. Cultural materials were gently washed using tap water and a soft-bristled
toothbrush, or were simply gently agitated in a tub of clean water if fragile, and placed on trays to
air dry. Artifacts were classified and quantified on a site by site basis, but a master catalog of
cultural materials was not developed and individual artifacts were not assigned or labeled with
individual specimen numbers. As all cultural materials collected during the baseline cultural
resources survey were from privately owned land, all artifacts will be returned to ANRA for
distribution to landowners following completion of the project.

5.6

HISTORIC STRUCTURES RECORDING PROCEDURES

According to the NRHP and the Antiquities Code of Texas, historic-age structures, objects,
and districts are those of at least 50 years of age. At the time the cultural resources baseline
survey for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project was conducted in 2006, Horizon utilized a
cutoff date of 1956 for identifying any historic structures and objects. Whenever a potentially
historic-age structure was observed during the baseline archeological survey, Horizon recorded
the coordinates of the resource using the mapping procedures described above (i.e., hand-held

HJN 050082 AR

63

Chapter 5.0: Cultural Resource Survey Methodology

GPS units or map triangulation), photodocumented the resource using color digital photography,
and recorded notes on accessing the resource. These notes were subsequently provided to the
project’s historians, who utilized the information to re-locate, record, and assess the historic-age
resources. Documentation and assessment of historic-age structures and objects was conducted
by qualified architectural historians. The results of the historic structures survey are presented in
Chapter 8.0.
The vast majority of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE, as currently defined,
is situated in floodplain environments, which consist of a variety of inundated wetlands, alluvial
fans and terraces, and valley margins. Historic-age structures are rarely situated in such
physiographic environments; rather, historic-age settlements in rural areas are usually located in
upland settings suitable for agriculture, and relatively little of the currently defined APE is situated
in upland environments. As a result, historic-age structures were comparatively rare within the
APE; nevertheless, historic-age structures observed during the archeological survey were flagged
for assessment by the project’s architectural historians.

5.7

MAINTAINING QUALITY CONTROL DURING FIELDWORK

Horizon’s Principal Investigator for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project participated
in the field effort 100% of the time. The Principal Investigator directly oversaw the entire field
effort and coordinated fieldwork based out of a temporary field office in a motel located in Rusk,
Texas, where the archeological field crews were lodged. As such, the Principal Investigator was
immediately available to respond to situations as they arose during fieldwork. Each of the
2 archeological field crews was led by a Project Archeologist who participated directly in the field
survey effort on a full-time basis and assisted the Principal Investigator to coordinate the field
effort. Horizon utilized highly experienced, professional archeologists for the survey who had
multiple years of experience in field archeology, Texas archeology in general, and/or East Texas
and Caddo-area archeology in particular.
Field records were turned in by field crew members during the survey to Project
Archeologists at the end of each day for inspection. This allowed each crew’s Project Archeologist
to identify any inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or missing information and solicit corrections or
additional information from field crew members while the information was still fresh in their minds.
Each day’s paperwork was collected from field crew members; reviewed for completeness,
accuracy, and consistency; and placed in 3-ring binders that remained in the project’s field office.
This prevented accidental loss of paperwork and helped project staff identify areas of data
recording in which specific field crew members may require additional training.
Cultural materials collected in the field were inspected on a daily basis by project staff to
ensure that artifact bags were labeled properly and to ensure that provenience information
recorded on the artifact bags was consistent with that recorded on associated field forms. If any
collected cultural materials or samples required special handling, processing, or preservation
treatment, any necessary treatments were applied immediately to stabilize or otherwise ensure
that archeological data were not destroyed before the materials could be properly processed and
analyzed. Cultural materials and samples were placed in storage boxes on a daily basis that
remained in the project’s field office, and all cultural materials were transported back to Horizon’s

64

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

laboratory facilities in Austin, Texas, after each field session. Collection and inspection of cultural
materials and samples on a daily basis minimized inconsistencies and inaccuracies on paperwork
and artifact bag labels and helped to prevent loss or misplacement of cultural materials and other
data.
GPS data were downloaded on a daily basis, and waypoints and UTM coordinates were
imported into GIS data layers on a regular basis. All GPS waypoints and UTM coordinates were
also recorded on paper forms completed by the archeological field crew during fieldwork. For
example, in addition to the daily downloads of electronic data from hand-held GPS devices, the
UTM coordinates of shovel tests were recorded on standard shovel test forms. Maintaining
redundancy in recording locational information in hard copy and electronic formats helped
minimize the potential for data loss and minimized or eliminated error.
Similarly, digital photographs were downloaded to a laptop computer on a daily basis, and
photographic logs were compared to actual photographs to ensure their accuracy. The filename
of each electronic photographic image was recorded on the photographic log to ensure
consistency in data management.

6.0 RESULTS OF GEOMORPHIC FIELD RECONNAISSANCE

This chapter presents the results of the baseline geomorphological study performed for
the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. Dr. Charles Frederick conducted the geomorphic field
reconnaissance with the assistance of Reign Clark, Horizon Project Archeologist, who operated
the backhoe for the mechanical trenching, under the overall guidance of Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator. Dr. Frederick also authored the original version of this chapter presented
as Chapter 3.0 in the interim report (Owens et al. 2006), which has been reproduced below largely
verbatim aside from the addition of a new map, Figure 6-1; inclusion of digital photographs of
backhoe trenches, cores, and a bog site; and minor editorial changes.

6.1

FIELD METHODS

Four specific objectives were identified in the original Draft SOW for this phase of
investigation (Owens 2005:59):



Develop a preliminary map of landforms and geomorphic features in the APE that
would assist archeological survey activities.



Conduct limited stratigraphic/subsurface examination by soil coring and/or mechanical
trenching, possibly combined with limited radiocarbon dating of the landforms
identified during geomorphic mapping activities, to form a preliminary impression of
the age and depositional history of each feature.



Identify areas within the APE for more detailed stratigraphic and subsurface
prospecting and dating to be performed during future phases of geomorphological
studies.



Evaluate the stratigraphy of the dam axis.

However, not all of these objectives were addressed in the approved SOW owing to the results
of financial and scheduling constraints and ongoing consultation with the USACE to determine
the requirements of baseline investigations, which resulted in an overall reduction of the level of
effort for the baseline geomorphological study (see Chapters 1.0 and 5.0). The work that was
performed principally consisted of a limited subsurface/stratigraphic examination of late
Quaternary deposits in sample locations along Mud Creek in order to form an impression of the

Chapter 6.0: Results of Geomorphic Field Reconnaissance

temporal activity of the stream and the potential of these deposits to obscure buried prehistoric
archeological sites.
The stratigraphy of Mud Creek was examined by means of subsurface investigations in
3 distinct areas of the APE, and efforts were made to obtain a cross-section of the valley floor
deposits in each of these areas (Figure 6-1). Area 1 is the southernmost of the 3 study transects
and was situated along an overhead power line corridor just north of and parallel to US 79. Area 2
is situated at the point where Mud Creek crosses FM 4223 between the communities of Tecula
and Gould. Area 3 is located in the northern reaches of the APE, just west of Troup, in the vicinity
of FM 4915, which used to cross Mud Creek but has since been largely abandoned.
Locations selected for stratigraphic study were chosen, first, for general ease of access
and, second, on the basis of the alluvial geomorphology. Ease of access to the floodplain was
paramount in selecting locations for this work due to the limited amount of time available for
fieldwork. With this in mind, existing transmission line and road rights-of-way were selected as
they consisted of corridors that had been cleared of vegetation and were generally maintained.
Two of the areas examined were accessed from existing or abandoned county roads that crossed
the Mud Creek valley floor. In the field, deposits were exposed by means of a backhoe and by
coring. Vertical sections thus created were subsequently cleaned with a flat-bladed shovel,
described using the nomenclature of Schoeneberger et al. (2002), and photographed, and the
deposits were related to local geomorphic features. Radiocarbon dating of identified sediment
units was not conducted, though several soil samples were collected for possible future sediment
humate dating.

6.2

GEOMORPHOLOGY

On March 22 and 23, 2006, Dr. Frederick conducted an initial reconnaissance of the APE.
Preliminary examination of the Mud Creek valley floor identified 3 construction geomorphic
surfaces—a floodplain (T0) and 2 terraces (T1 and T2). Examination of the surface morphology,
vegetation, and deposits, as well as conversations with local landowners, revealed that the T0 and
T1 surfaces are frequently inundated, whereas the T2 surface appears to have rarely been flooded.
6.2.1

Modern Floodplain (T0)

In the lower reaches of the APE, Mud Creek is an anastomosed stream, which at any
single valley cross-section may exhibit multiple channels separated by relatively wide, densely
forested interchannel bars. The channels range from about 3.0 to 8.0 meters (9.8 to 26.2 feet) in
width and are fairly sinuous in plan view. The channel bars are typically very broad, measuring
several hundred meters wide in some instances, and commonly include fragments of more than
1 geomorphic surface. Hence, these bars are not necessarily part of the active floodplain, but
rather artifacts of dissection of the valley floor by Mud Creek.
In most of the examined areas, there is a clearly defined low-water floodplain
characterized by narrow point bars that fringe the channel and rise up onto the floodplain surface,
which lies approximately 1.5 to 2.0 meters (4.9 to 6.6 feet) above the thalweg. The floodplain

surface is undulatory owing to flood scour features. These channel-like linear depressions were
initially thought to be paleochannels, but, when they were bisected, it became clear that they were
artifacts of erosion rather than former channels. Where they were examined in detail, these linear
scours were generally less than 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) deep, often less than 3.0 meters (9.8 feet)
wide, and may include up to 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) of recent sediment deposited upon their floors.
These shallow, sinuous, channel-like scours appear to be active only at high discharges. In many
places, the active floodplain of Mud Creek was easily delineated on the basis of high water marks
on trees, which were often found to be around 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) above the floodplain surface.
Although the anastomosed structure of Mud Creek is more pronounced downstream, a
single channel often prevails farther upstream; however, the presence of linear scours on the
floodplain persists throughout the APE.
6.2.2

First Terrace (T1)

The first terrace is slightly elevated above the low-water channel, stands about 3.0 meters
(9.8 feet) above the thalweg, and is generally delineated from the floodplain by a subtle scarp.
This surface was not easily distinguished in the southern portion of the APE, but was often clearly
visible upstream. Because of its subtle character, mapping this surface would be challenging.
Like the floodplain, this surface is gently undulatory but has not been scoured to the same extent
as the floodplain, and it exhibits fewer and less pronounced scour channels. Upstream, it was
apparent that the T1 surface had been removed by erosion in some places where the floodplain
was inset against the T2 surface.
6.2.3

Second Terrace (T2)

One of the most common surfaces encountered in the APE was a broad, flat, sandy
terrace situated between the upland and the Holocene valley floor. This terrace typically lies
about 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) above the thalweg, and it is often clearly delineated from the T1 or T0
surfaces by a clearly visibly scarp, with the scarp being a bit more pronounced where it abuts the
modern floodplain. This terrace is generally flat-lying, but, in some areas, its leading edge has
been dissected by flooding, leaving either linear, channel-like scour features or low, isolated,
mound-like landforms that, although sometimes superficially similar to pimple mounds, are clearly
not pimple mounds. These floodplain mounds are often lenticular in plan view and cluster at the
edge of the second terrace surface. When viewed from a stratigraphic perspective, they are
clearly remnants of the T2 surface isolated by erosion. Pimple mounds on the T2 surface were
typically dome-like, had fringing marshy wetland areas, and generally were not found in direct
proximity to the T1/T0 margin.

STRATIGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS

From May 22 to June 1, 2006, Dr. Frederick conducted geomorphic survey fieldwork within
the APE. A total of 30 backhoe trenches and 1 soil core were excavated along the 3 study
transects across the Mud Creek floodplain during the geomorphic reconnaissance (see Figure 61). Each of the 3 study areas are discussed in general terms below.

6.3.1

Area 1—Lower Basin

A total of 10 backhoe trenches (BT001-008, BT029-030) and 1 soil core were excavated
in Area 1 (Figure 6-2). The majority of these subsurface probes were excavated along the rightof-way of an existing transmission line east of the main channel of Mud Creek, but 3 of the
trenches (BT008, BT029-030) were located south of and outside of the transmission line right-ofway. To the east of the main channel of Mud Creek, trenches were excavated approximately
every 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) between the upland margin and the main channel of Mud Creek;
however, the segment west of Mud Creek was too wet to traverse with the backhoe and clearly
had a fairly high local water table, and only 1 trench (BT008) was excavated near the western
valley margin. Located at the far western end of the transmission line corridor is a bog that
appears to contain about 3.0 meters (9.8 feet) of organic sediment. Representative photographs
of the 10 backhoe trenches excavated in Area 1 are presented in Figures 6-3 to 6-12.
In general terms, Area 1 exhibited a clear Pleistocene terrace beneath the T2 surface on
the east end and a broad expanse of floodplain, beneath which there appeared to be at least
2 different depositional units. Unfortunately, clear recognition of different-age deposits in Area 1
was hampered by excessive gleying. A single soil core excavated in proximity to the modern
channel of Mud Creek suggests that recent alluvium here is about 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) thick.
While there appear to be several wetland areas within the proposed reservoir flood pool
from which paleoenvironmental records might be obtained, 1 such locality was examined closely
in Area 1. Located just north of where US 79 crosses the western boundary of the APE along the
power line corridor in Area 1 is a promising bog that has formed on the valley floor from a seep
that is emerging at the foot of the upland (Figure 6-13). The center of this bog is located at UTM
coordinates 294541 East, 3540446 North (Zone 15 [NAD 27]). The bog is about 100.0 meters
(328.0 feet) long and at least 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) wide. It is situated within an all-terrain
vehicle (ATV) park, but it is clearly too wet for the ATV enthusiasts to traverse, although some
have tried along the northern edge. The bog is fed by 2 small spring- or seep-fed streams that
enter the valley floor from the west. The periphery of the bog surface is dominated by Scirpus sp.
and the center of the bog is inhabited by a prominent stand of Typha sp (Figure 6-14).
In order to evaluate the paleoenvironmental potential of this wetland, a 3.0-meter (9.8foot-) long by 1.3-cm- (0.5-inch-) diameter auger rod was used to probe the extent of the organic
sediments along a roughly north-to-south transect (Figure 6-13). In general terms, such rods are
easily pushed into organic sediment but are very difficult to push into mineralic sediment. The
results of this transect revealed the presence of up to 3.0 meters (9.8 feet) of peat and/or gytjalike sediment that was deepest in the part of the bog inhabited by the Typha sp. Sediment found
adhering to the rods when they were extracted was black to dark gray in color and odiferous,
which suggests that there is a reasonable potential for pollen preservation here. The coring rig
was unsuitable for extracting a core from this bog as the deposit is too wet; consequently, bog
coring would require use of a Russian corer or a vibrocorer. Examination of the aerial photograph
and wetland map for this portion of the APE suggest that other bog-like deposits may be locally
present, and a more thorough effort should be made in the future to explore the potential of these
sites for paleoenvironmental research.

Area 2—Middle Basin

Work in Area 2 was performed in
2 distinct locations—along an existing
transmission line corridor where it crosses
FM 2064 and in the area where FM 4223
crosses Mud Creek. A total of 10 backhoe
trenches (BT009-018) were excavated in
Area 2, including 6 trenches along the power
transmission corridor (BT009-014) and
4 trenches (BT015-018) on the valley floor in
proximity to FM 4223 (Figure 6-15).
Representative photographs of 9 of the
10 backhoe trenches excavated in Area 2
are presented in Figures 6-16 to 6-24.
The transmission line corridor was
largely underlain by the T2 surface, and
trenches here revealed a prominent sandy
terrace deposit with unconsolidated sands to
depths in excess of 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) that
were often saturated and treacherous when

exposed. A prominent paleochannel-like swale was observed near the leading edge of the T2
surface, and this surface, although dotted by fairly sizable pimple mounds away from the channel,
was otherwise relatively featureless in proximity to the scarp overlooking the floodplain. In this
area, the modern floodplain was inset against the T2 surface and separated by a prominent 1.5to 2.0-meter (4.9- to 6.6-foot) scarp. An aboriginal archeological site (41CE403) was discovered
in BT011 during the geomorphic study upon the T2 surface where it abuts the floodplain. This
was the only archeological site discovered during the geoarcheological investigations, and it is
described in Chapter 7.0.
The Mud Creek valley floor adjacent to the FM 4223 crossing revealed 2 geomorphic
surfaces (the floodplain and first terrace), each of which appeared to be underlain by a single
alluvial deposit. Trenching across a swale upon the T1 surface revealed this feature to be a scour
that contained a thin (less than 50.0-cm- [19.7-inch-] deep) drape of more recent alluvium. A
single piece of aboriginal lithic debitage was found near the base of this more recent veneer,
suggesting that the formation of such scours is not an entirely recent phenomenon. This piece of
lithic debitage was not designated as an IO.
6.3.3

Area 3—Upper Basin

Ten backhoe trenches (BT019-028) were excavated on the Mud Creek valley floor in
Area 3 to target the 2 principal geomorphic surfaces present (T0 and T2) as well as a series of
small floodplain mounds located near the scarp between these surfaces (Figure 6-25).

third were found capping 1 floodplain mound,

remnant of the T2 surface.

SUMMARY OF OBSERVED LATE QUATERNARY ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS

As a result of the geomorphic reconnaissance, 3 distinct alluvial deposits were recognized,
and these are identified as Units 1, 2, and 3, in order of decreasing relative age (Figure 6-36).
The absolute age of these deposits is presently unknown, and it is possible that more detailed
work within the APE may discover additional alluvial units.
6.4.1

Unit 1—Sandy Pleistocene Terrace

Unit 1 was found beneath the T2 surface, at the core of isolated floodplain mounds on the
floodplain near the T2 scarp, and at depth beneath the T0 surface. In many places, this deposit
exhibited a very deep sandy soil in which no B horizon was encountered. In most of these
sections, the profile could be interpreted as an A-C profile. It is much more likely, however, to be
an A-E-Bt profile, but trenching failed to expose the B horizon. Most such sections were quite
wet and exposed a perched water table. Trenches often exhibited an A-E-Ec profile with
prominent manganese nodules at depth. Some exposures of this deposit revealed a horizon near
the surface that appeared to be either a faint, cumulic A horizon or Bw horizon near the surface,
but it was difficult to determine which interpretation was correct in the field (i.e., without additional
laboratory work).

Figure 6-36. Three-Dimensional Schematic of Alluvial Fill Units
(Horizontal is not to scale and the bases of the units are inferred.)

No evidence of bedding was observed within the top 3.0 meters (9.8 feet) of this deposit,
and the sandy character of this deposit suggests either that (1) this unit was deposited when Mud
Creek had a significantly different sediment load than today, perhaps more similar to the Late
Pleistocene Deweyville terraces of the Gulf Coastal Plain, or (2) the T2 surface is actually a
bedrock strath (erosional surface) and this is a soil that has formed down into bedrock since the
surface was cut, which presumably occurred during the Late Pleistocene. Although there is no
definitive evidence at this time, Freese and Nichols (2003:App. 5:7) excavated a geotechnical
core within 1 such terrace northwest of the proposed dam axis that had been mapped by the
Bureau of Economic Geology as a Pleistocene terrace. Freese and Nichols (2003) argued that
this was an exposure of the Queen City Sand formation at an elevation between the floodplain
and the upland, which would support the hypothesis that the T2 surface may be a strath terrace.
6.4.2

Unit 2—First Terrace Fill

Unit 2 was found beneath the T1 surface and draping floodplain mounds on the T0 surface
near the T2 scarp. In the upper reaches of the APE (i.e., Areas 2 and 3), this deposit was found
to be a reddish-brown (7.5YR to 5YR hue) alluvial fill with an A-Bwg-Btg soil profile. Slough-like
linear swales cut into the top of Unit 2 were found not to be paleochannels, but rather scour
features that contained a thin drape of Unit 3 (described below). If this deposit was present in
Area 1, its appearance had been dramatically altered by gleying and redox processes. Without
further field and analytical work, it is difficult to infer the age of Unit 2; at this time, this deposit is
suspected to be an early Holocene alluvial deposit.

86

Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

6.4.3

Unit 3—Recent Alluvium

Unit 3 was found beneath the floodplain surface and draping the floors of scour channels
cut into the T0 and T1 surfaces. These alluvial sediments were distinctly different in appearance
from the aforementioned deposits, having almost equal amounts of brown and gray colors. They
were so altered by redox processes that it was difficult to distinguish which hue represented the
matrix color and which was the result of oxidation-reduction. Near the channel, these deposits
exhibited lithological variation in the form of alternating thin beds of sand and mud; however, away
from the channel, the texture quickly became finer, and evidence of bedding near the surface was
difficult to distinguish. Coring near the channel in Area 1 revealed this unit to be in excess of
4.0 meters (13.1 feet) thick, but trenching away from the main channel demonstrated that only a
thin veneer was present at the foot of the T2 surface. As noted earlier, a thin veneer of this deposit
was also found on the tread to the T1 surface, but it was most clearly recognizable in the linear
paleochannel-like scours. Unit 3 is presumed to be of late Holocene age.

6.5

SUMMARY

The baseline geomorphic reconnaissance identified 3 alluvial stratigraphic units within the
APE of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project. Although none of these deposits were directly
dated, the field evidence suggests that 2 of the 3 units are of Holocene age and have a potential
for buried archeological sites.
It was clear in the field that the leading edge of the T 2 surface (i.e., the top of Unit 1) and
the floodplain mounds, which are an artifact of T2 erosion, represent a significant high-probability
setting for prehistoric settlement. These surfaces are rarely inundated, and the sandy, welldrained deposits were probably attractive to aboriginal inhabitants of this area. If the age estimate
for Unit 1 is correct, then prehistoric sites of all periods could be expected upon the surface of this
deposit. It is perhaps worth noting that the T2 scarp is often considerably lower and situated more
towards the center of the valley than most of the HPAs delineated nearer to the valley margins
before the archeological survey began, and it is likely that a focused attempt to delineate and
survey the leading edge of this surface throughout the APE might identify more Caddo period
sites, especially where the T2 surface is found to abut the floodplain.
Assuming the estimated age of Unit 2 is correct, the T1 surface, where preserved, was
also clearly suitable for settlement during much of the Holocene, and it is possible that prehistoric
sites may be found upon or buried within this deposit. Given that the distinction between the T 0
and T1 surfaces is subtle, practical differentiation at the survey level would be difficult on a large
scale. Furthermore, it is apparent that this surface is frequently inundated today, and, in the lower
reaches of the APE where Unit 2 is inferred to be very gleyed, the T 1 surface seems to be very
wet and may have been unsuitable for settlement in the past, much like it is today.
Unit 3 may be old enough to have a potential for containing prehistoric sites, but the
frequency of inundation and saturation suggests that this surface and the deposits beneath it were
generally unsuitable for habitation for all but the briefest periods of time.
A review of the geotechnical logs collected by Freese and Nichols along the dam axis
(Freese and Nichols 2003) reveals that Quaternary alluvium in this area may be as much as

HJN 050082 AR

87

Chapter 7.0: Results of Geomorphic Field Reconnaissance

10.0 meters (32.8 feet) thick, but the geotechnical logs are insufficiently detailed to be of much
use in the evaluation of the Quaternary stratigraphy of Mud Creek. Future work should include
more coring to evaluate the deeper deposits in the valley, additional trenching and radiocarbon
dating to map and date the alluvial surfaces identified during the baseline geomorphic
reconnaissance, and additional survey work to identify possible additional alluvial structures in
the Mud Creek floodplain.

7.0 RESULTS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

The baseline archeological survey of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir resulted in
the documentation of 37 previously unrecorded archeological sites, including 30 aboriginal sites,
4 historic-age sites, and 3 sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural components
(Table 7-1). This chapter presents descriptions of each archeological site recorded during the
baseline survey, including brief discussions of the physiographic setting of each site, the nature
and extent of cultural components, preliminary chronological assessments of the age of
occupation(s) based on examination of diagnostic artifacts, evaluation of the integrity of
archeological deposits based on known artificial and natural impacts, and initial assessments of
the eligibility of each site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. One of the
historic-age archeological sites discussed in this chapter, 41CE384, also bears the designation
of Historic Site 7, and a historic-age house located on this site is discussed in Chapter 8.0.
In addition to the 37 archeological sites, 25 artifact IOs were recorded during the baseline
archeological survey. The IOs are briefly summarized at the end of this chapter following the
discussion of the archeological sites.
Since the master listing of shovel tests excavated during the baseline archeological survey
included in Appendix E is presented in a digital format rather than as printed pages, each
individual site description in this chapter includes a tabular listing of shovel test data pertinent to
the site in the interest of presenting relevant soil data about each site. Each shovel test table
includes data for each shovel test that falls within the final delineated site boundaries. Additional
data for nearby shovel tests that fall outside the final site boundaries can be found in Appendix E.

SITE 41CE367

Site 41CE367 is a scatter of aboriginal Caddoan ceramic sherds, lithic debitage, burned
sandstone, and groundstone tools found in surface and subsurface contexts on an east-to-westoriented toe slope just east of Bridge Creek (Figures 7-1 to 7-5; Appendix D, Figure D-3). The
site is located approximately 1.7 kilometers (1.1 miles) northwest of the intersection of US 79 and
FM 4222 on a finger of the adjacent uplands that extends westward toward Bridge Creek on the
eastern margin of the broad Mud Creek floodplain. Site 41CE367 may represent a Caddoan
hamlet or a multiple-component site consisting of an Archaic-age campsite and a Caddoan
hamlet. The possible Archaic component consists primarily of lithic debitage concentrated in the
eastern portion of the site in a thick lens of sandy sediments ranging from 20.0 to 90.0 cm (7.9 to
35.4 inches) in depth. The Caddoan component consists minimally of ceramic sherds exhibiting
various decorative styles, including 4 sherds with closely spaced and widely spaced incised lines
and a Canton Incised rim with cross-hatched lines and triangular zones filled with small punctates.

The absence of brushed sherds points to a Caddoan occupation that pre-dates ca. A.D. 1200.
The entire ceramic assemblage was found within the upper 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) of sediment
and was concentrated in the western portion of the site. Additional artifacts include 2 sandstone
nutting stones found on the surface in the eastern portion of the site and a burned sandstone
fragment recovered from 60.0 to 70.0 cm (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface. The presence of
ceramics, nutting stones, and burned rocks hints at domestic activity; however, no specific
evidence of residential or occupational features was found either on the surface or in any of the
24 shovel tests excavated on the site, 15 of which were positive for subsurface cultural resources
(Table 7-2).
Site 41CE367 is located on an east-to-west-oriented, sandy toe slope projecting westward
from an upland formation on the east side of the broad Mud Creek floodplain toward Bridge Creek,
which is located approximately 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) to the west. The landform is dominated
by young stands of pine, oak, and elm trees with a heavy overburden of leaves, pine needles,
brambles, and bamboo. The majority of the site has poor to moderate surface visibility (10 to
50%). Numerous dirt roads and ATV trails meander across the site, allowing for a better view of
the ground surface and revealing mostly reddish-brown sand with sandstone outcrops on the
surface. Shovel testing across the site revealed pockets of deep, sandy sediments that extend
to depths beyond shovel testing capabilities. Several shovel tests in the eastern portion of the
site encountered yellow and yellowish-red clay at approximately 90.0 to 100.0 cm (35.4 to
39.4 inches) below surface, though the sandy mantle was not fully penetrated in all shovel tests.
Elevations across the site range from approximately 86.9 meters (285.0 feet) amsl in the western
portion of the site to 94.5 meters (310.0 feet) amsl in the eastern portion of the site. As such, the
entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line that would serve as the proposed Lake
Columbia pool elevation.
Artifacts were recovered on the surface and from 15 positive shovel tests, demarcating a
site boundary measuring approximately 260.0 meters (852.8 feet) east to west by 75.0 meters
(246.0 feet) north to south. The northern, western, and southern site boundaries were delineated
based on positive and negative shovel tests. The eastern boundary of the site was not fully
delineated, and the site may extend farther up the sandy toe slope to the east.
Lithic and ceramic artifacts found on site 41CE367 exhibited some degree of vertical and
horizontal separation that may represent the presence of 2 discrete cultural components—an
aceramic, possibly Archaic-age campsite and a pre-A.D. 1200 Caddoan hamlet. The possible
Archaic component, consisting of lithic debris, appears to be centered on the eastern portion of
the site while the Caddoan hamlet, consisting minimally of ceramic sherds (and possibly also lithic
debris), is centered on the western portion of the site. Ceramic artifacts were found in the upper
50.0 cm (19.7 inches) of sediment, whereas lithic debris, consisting of chert and quartzite flakes,
was found at depths ranging from 20.0 to 90.0 cm (7.9 to 35.4 inches) below surface. While there
is some apparent separation of lithic and ceramic artifacts, it is also possible that the variable
depths of lithic debitage and the ceramic assemblage are the product of horizontal and/or vertical
translocation within the uniform matrix of deep, loose sand characteristic of the deposits on site
41CE367. It should also be noted that no diagnostic Archaic artifacts were found, and the
suggested presence of a separate Archaic component is based exclusively on the partial

separation of lithic and ceramic artifacts in different areas of the site. Further investigations would
be necessary to properly determine if the recovered assemblage actually represents 2 discrete
components, the lithic artifacts simply represent a Caddoan activity area, or the lithic and ceramic
artifacts have been differently sorted based on post-depositional taphonomic forces.
Archaic sites in East Texas (ca. 7500 to 200 B.C.) consist largely of open campsites
dominated by hunting tools, generalized cutting and scraping tools, lithic manufacturing debris,
and groundstone tools (Perttula 2004:375). As currently defined, the possible Archaic component
on site 41CE367 is represented by lithic debris, consisting of chert and quartzite flakes, recovered
from depths ranging from 20.0 to 90.0 cm (7.9 to 35.4 inches) below surface.
The Caddoan component consists of 10 ceramic sherds recovered from 3 shovel tests
located within 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) of each other in the western portion of the site. Of the
10 sherds found, 5 exhibited various decorative styles, including 4 sherds with closely spaced
and widely spaced incised lines and a Canton Incised rim with cross-hatched lines and triangular
zones filled with small punctates. No ceramic artifacts were found at depths greater than 50.0 cm
(19.7 inches) below surface. The absence of brushed sherds suggests a Caddoan occupation
that pre-dates ca. A.D. 1200. Additionally, 2 sandstone nutting stones were found on the surface
in the eastern portion of the site, and a burned sandstone fragment was recovered at a depth of
50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below surface in the western portion of the site.
The presence of nutting stones and burned rock hints at domestic activity. The nutting
stones were found on the modern ground surface and may be associated with either the possible
Archaic or Caddoan components, though the depth (ca. 50.0 cm [19.7 inches]) at which the single
fragment of burned rock was found may suggest an Archaic affiliation, if such is present. No
evidence of residential or occupational features; organic materials, such as faunal bone or
charcoal; or diagnostic lithic artifacts was observed on the site.
The landform on which site 41CE367 is located appears to be relatively intact, with little
modern disturbance aside from the meandering dirt roads, ATV trails, and associated push piles
and small borrow pits, resulting in some disturbance to near-surface sediments. Despite these
obvious surface impacts, thick vegetation and abundant organic detritus cover the site, apparently
protecting against sheet erosion. As a result, the deep cultural deposits on site 41CE367 seem
relatively stable, allowing for a high degree of preservation. Artifacts were recovered from the

modern ground surface to a depth of 90.0 cm (35.4 inches) below surface, though the bottom of
sandy, artifact-bearing sediments was not reached in all areas of the site via shovel testing.
As site 41CE367 is situated entirely below the 315.0-foot NVGD elevation contour that
represents the limits of the proposed normal pool, the site stands to be entirely submerged by the
proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. At present, the eligibility status of site 41CE367 for
inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL remains undetermined. It is possible that
the apparent vertical and horizontal separation of lithic and ceramic artifacts represents more than
a single cultural component; however, as the cultural materials were situated within a uniform
matrix of deep, loose sand, vertical or horizontal translocation of artifacts may have occurred.
Nevertheless, cultural material was recovered up to a depth of 90.0 cm (35.4 inches) below
surface in some areas of the site. Furthermore, the deepest shovel tests were terminated at
100.0 to 110.0 cm (39.4 to 43.3 inches) below surface, though the bottom of the sandy matrix
containing the artifacts was not reached in many areas of the site. While the apparent age of the
cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE367 suggests that
the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are
currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research
potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE367 is recommended to be of
unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would
be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

7.2

SITE 41CE368

Site 41CE368 is a multiple-component surface and limited subsurface scatter of aboriginal
artifacts, including decorated and plainware ceramics, an Edgewood dart point, a small quartzite
biface, lithic debitage, a nutting stone, and burned rocks, situated on a northeast-to-southwestoriented toe slope just east of Bridge Creek (Figures 7-6 to 7-10; Appendix D, Figure D-3). The
landform on which the site is located is a finger of the adjacent uplands that extends westward
toward Bridge Creek on the eastern margin of the broad Mud Creek floodplain, forming a low,
sandy rise within the Mud Creek floodplain. The bulk of the cultural materials were found on the
modern ground surface within the confines of an excavated borrow pit that measures
approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) north to south by 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) east to west.
Previous excavation of the pit has removed a considerable amount of sand—based on the height
of the banks of the pit, from 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3.0 to 5.0 feet) of sandy matrix has been removed
from across the area in which the majority of the cultural materials were found, indicating the
extent of previous damage to this site. Two shovel tests (STs BS031 and BS033) excavated in
an undisturbed, wooded area just south of the borrow pit contained 3 ceramic sherds at depths
of 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below surface (ST BS031) and 2 pieces of lithic debitage
at depths of 80.0 to 100.0 cm (31.5 to 39.4 inches) below surface (ST BS033), though other shovel
tests excavated elsewhere beyond the edges of the borrow pit failed to produce any subsurface
artifacts.
Shovel tests excavated in the current bottom of the borrow pit suggest that sandy
sediments continue beyond the reach of shovel tests, though it is possible that the sandy matrix
on the floor of the borrow pit has been impacted at depth as a result of borrow excavation and

earth-moving activities. As such, it is possible that intact portions of this site exist beyond the
edges of and/or below the borrow excavations that may contain intact deposits capable of
rendering contextual evidence for the cultural remains already found. Based on the artifacts
found, site 41CE368 appears to have been a Caddoan hamlet, though earlier cultural components
are also suggested. The preponderance of brushed ceramic sherds (44%) among the
assemblage of decorated ceramics suggests an occupation that dates to the Late Caddoan period
(ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680), though the presence of 2 sandy-paste ceramic sherds suggests a
possible Early Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) component as well. The recovery of an
Edgewood dart point suggests that a Transitional Archaic component also may be present.
The site is located approximately 400.0 meters (1,312.0 feet) north of US 79 east of Bridge
Creek on the broad Mud Creek floodplain. The majority of the site is dominated by a large borrow
pit surrounded by thick vegetation consisting of oak and pine trees. Several entry ramps and
associated two-track roads lead into the borrow pit. Elevations across the site range from 85.4 to
86.9 meters (280.0 to 285.0 feet) amsl; as such, the entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD
contour line that serves as the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation boundary. Sediments
within the borrow pit are relatively homogenous, consisting of reddish- to yellowish-brown sands
that extend to depths beyond shovel testing capabilities (ca. 100.0 to 110.0 cm [39.4 to
43.3 inches] below the already 0.9- to 1.5-meter- (3.0- to 5.0-foot-) deep floor of the borrow pit.
Pre-Holocene clays were not encountered anywhere on the site, either within the borrow pit or in
the surrounding area. Seven shovel tests were excavated within the site boundaries, 2 of which
were positive (Table 7-3).
Most of the cultural materials collected from site 41CE368 were found in disturbed surface
contexts. A total of 27 ceramic sherds were collected, 24 of which were found in disturbed surface
contexts within or along the outer rim of the borrow pit. Ceramic types include plain grog- or bonetempered body sherds as well as decorated sherds with brushed, brushed-incised-punctated,
tool-punctated, parallel incised, and closely spaced engraved line motifs. One of the positive
shovel tests (ST BS031) excavated in the undisturbed forested area south of the borrow pit
yielded 3 plainware ceramic sherds at depths of 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below
surface. Other artifacts found on the surface include an Edgewood dart point, a small quartzite
biface, chert and quartzite tertiary flakes, a nutting stone, and burned rocks. The preponderance
of brushing (44%) on decorated ceramic sherds points to an occupation that dates to the Late
Caddoan Period (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680), the recovery of 2 sandy-paste ceramic sherds suggests
a possible Early Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) component, and the recovery of an Edgewood
dart point suggests that a Transitional Archaic component also may be present.
The bulk of the surface materials were found within the excavated borrow pit area, which
measures approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) north to south by 200.0 meters (656.0 feet)
east to west. The site boundaries therefore roughly coincide with the dimensions of the borrow
pit and were delineated in all directions based on the presence of surface artifacts and 2 positive
shovel tests near the southern edge of the pit. Additional shovel tests excavated in and around
the borrow pit were found to contain sandy soils that extended well beyond shovel testing
capabilities (ca. 100.0 to 110.0 cm [39.4 to 43.3 inches] below surface), though no cultural
materials were found in these shovel tests. As such, intact soils may exist below and/or outside

of the area impacted by the excavation of the borrow pit; however, the excavated parts of the site
have experienced considerable damage, resulting in an assemblage of artifacts that lacks
contextual integrity.
Overall, site 41CE368 has experienced considerable damage from the extensive
excavation of sand from a large borrow pit; however, shovel tests dug within and just outside the
boundaries of the borrow pit indicate that remaining sandy sediments extend well beyond shovel
testing capabilities. As such, it is unknown whether or not intact deposits may exist beyond and/or
below the area impacted by the borrow pit excavations. Given the presence of diagnostic ceramic
sherds, an Edgewood dart point, lithic debris, a biface, and groundstone tools, it is likely that site
41CE368 is a multiple-component site consisting of a Caddoan hamlet with possible earlier Early
Ceramic and Transitional Archaic period components. Due to its location below the 315.0-foot
NVGD contour line, site 41CE368 stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake
Columbia impoundment. At present, the eligibility status of the site remains undetermined due to
the lack of data necessary to determine significance under Criterion D of the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. Due to the apparent antiquity of the cultural components, the site is likely
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C. Further testing would be necessary
to determine whether or not intact archeological deposits are present below or beyond the area
that has been impacted by borrow pit excavation activities that would warrant significance under
Criterion D. No organic remains, such as faunal bone or charcoal, or intact cultural features were
observed, though the presence of diagnostic artifacts and a wide range of aboriginal tools argues
for further investigation to determine if any intact subsurface archeological remains exist on site
41CE368 that would provide contextual information relevant to the assemblage of artifacts already
found.

SITE 41CE369

Site 41CE369 is a multiple-component aboriginal Caddoan campsite or small hamlet with
the remnants of a historic-age rock wall or partial foundation with an associated historic-age
artifact scatter located on a slight rise in the Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-11 to 7-19;
Appendix D, Figure D-3). The site is located approximately 6.0 kilometers (3.7 miles) west of the
town of New Summerfield, about 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) north of the US 79 pavement, and
about 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) east of an active channel of Bridge Creek in the eastern half of the
broad Mud Creek floodplain. The sandy, alluvial, floodplain rise on which the site is situated is at
an elevation of 83.8 to 86.9 meters (275.0 to 285.0 feet) amsl. The southeastern portion of the
site slopes down toward a poorly drained slough that runs along the edge of the highway
embankment, which is elevated above the surrounding low, frequently inundated environs. A
linear, earthen berm extends northeastwards from US 79 a distance of approximately
103.0 meters (337.8 feet) from a point located approximately 90.0 meters (295.2 feet) south of
the site. Vegetation on the site is dominated by young stands of oak, pine, and elm trees and
associated underbrush, resulting in generally poor ground surface visibility; however, a series of
ATV trails and two-track roads traverses the site area, allowing for good surface visibility within
the cleared corridors. Shovel testing on the site revealed predominantly sandy soils that extended
to depths beyond shovel testing capabilities at 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) or more below surface
(Table 7-4). Clayey sediments were reached in only 1 shovel test at a depth of 30.0 cm
(11.8 inches) below surface (ST JH018).
Cultural materials were observed in both surficial and subsurface contexts on site
41CE369. As delineated based on the extent of positive shovel tests and the surface artifact
scatter, site 41CE369 spans a total distance of approximately 300.0 meters (984.0 feet) northwest
to southeast by 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) northeast to southwest. Cultural materials representing
aboriginal Caddoan and historic-era components are present. A total of 16 shovel tests were
excavated on the site, 4 of which yielded subsurface aboriginal artifacts and 2 of which produced
subsurface historic-age materials, for a total of 6 positive shovel tests (see Table 7-4). Most
aboriginal artifacts were recovered from subsurface contexts, while most of the historic-age
materials were collected from the modern ground surface.
The Caddoan component consists of a low- to moderate-density, subsurface scatter of
lithic and ceramic materials on the sandy floodplain landform. A two-track road extends roughly
southeast to northwest through the southern portion of the site. Near the southeastern boundary
of the site, this two-track road crosses a small drainage before connecting with another two-track
road that runs northeast to southwest and leads to US 79. A mano/anvil was found on the modern
ground surface just north of the two-track road near the drainage crossing. Subsurface cultural
materials were present in 5 shovel tests starting approximately 110.0 meters (360.8 feet) westnorthwest of the intersection of the 2 two-track roads, including 3 quartzite and 2 chert flakes,
1 piece of chert shatter, a mano/nutting stone, and 2 conjoining, punctated ceramic sherds (the
sherds were recovered from the same shovel test). The sherds are decorated with rows of tool
and fingernail punctations, which was a common vessel decorative style used throughout the
prehistoric Caddoan sequence. In addition to the cultural materials, a piece of charred wood
charcoal was recovered from 1 shovel test (ST AE003) closely associated with a quartzite flake.

The boundaries of the Caddoan component are the same as those of the overall site, measuring
approximately 300.0 meters (984.0 feet) northwest to southeast by 75.0 meters (246.0 feet)
northeast to southwest. No clusters of artifacts were observed; rather, the material was scattered
uniformly across the site. The majority of the prehistoric artifacts appear to be vertically situated
between about 60.0 and 100.0 cm (23.6 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though 1 of the pieces of
lithic debitage was found at depths of 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface.
The historic-age component of site 41CE369 consists of a low, piled-stone wall or partial
foundation; 2 large, shallow depressions; and a surficial scatter of historic-age artifacts. A two-

110

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

track road extends roughly northwest to southeast through the southeastern portion of the site,
crosses a small drainage, and intersects with a perpendicular two-track that runs northeast to
southwest and leads to US 79. The latter two-track road runs along the base of a linear earthen
embankment that heads northeastwards for a distance of approximately 103.0 meters (337.8 feet)
from US 79. The historic-age artifact scatter is primarily restricted to the southeastern portion of
the site in the vicinity of the stone wall or foundation feature. The boundaries of the historic-age
component measure approximately 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) northwest to southeast by
75.0 meters (246.0 feet) northeast to southwest.
The stone wall or partial foundation feature is a low, rectilinear wall composed of stacked
stones atop a low floodplain rise in moderately thick vegetation. The longest wall segment is
oriented north to south and measures approximately 6.0 meters (19.7 feet) in length, and small
adjoining walls project eastwards from both the north and south ends of the long wall for distances
of approximately 3.0 meters (9.8 feet). The 3 adjoining walls of the feature consist of 1 to
4 courses of mortared, cut sandstone slabs that vary from 10.0 to 50.0 cm (3.9 to 19.7 inches) in
diameter. The 2 depressions are situated off the northwest corner of the stone foundation. Each
depression measures 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) in diameter by about 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) in depth.
The majority of the historic-age artifacts were found on the surface, though a large slab of
cut sandstone was found in 1 shovel test (ST BS036) at a depth of 0.0 to 10.0 cm (0.0 to
3.9 inches) below surface that is likely associated with the nearby stone wall. Historic-age artifacts
found on the surface include mortar, cut sandstone slabs, bricks and brick fragments, 2 complete
brown glass vanilla bottles (1 of which still smelled strongly of vanilla when it was found), 2 brown
glass vanilla bottle bases, 1 brown glass vanilla bottle neck, 2 cobalt blue glass fragments,
1 cobalt blue glass medicine bottle fragment, 1 milky white glass bottle or jar fragment, 1 milky
white glass open-rippled dish, 1 stoneware ceramic sherd with Bristol salt glaze, 1 unidentified
whiteware ceramic sherd, and 1 marble tile fragment. The structural debris, including the bricks,
mortar, and cut sandstone slabs, were found in association with the stone wall feature, though
the rest of the historic-age artifacts were found on the two-track roadway leading to the feature.
Some of the historic-age artifacts have diagnostic characteristics. The 2 complete vanilla
bottles and the 2 vanilla bottle bases have similar shapes and markings on the base. The maker’s
mark is an “I” enclosed by an “O,” which was the mark used by the Owens-Illinois Glass Company
from ca. 1954 to the present (Whitten 2006). The Owens-Illinois Glass Company was based in
Toledo, Ohio, and had 22 factories across the US and Canada (Whitten 2006). Cobalt blue glass
is typically linked to the late 18th to 19th centuries, while milk glass is typically linked to the late
19th to early 20th centuries (Jones and Sullivan 1985). Finally, 1 Bristol-glazed stoneware body
sherd was collected. A slight curvature at one end of the body sherd suggests it was connected
to the base of the vessel. Stoneware was typically a utilitarian ceramic and was produced over a
long period of time. Bristol-glazed stoneware was first produced in Bristol, England, in 1835 and
became common after 1890 (Greer 1981). As a whole, the historic-age artifact assemblage
contains materials that may have been produced as early as the mid- to late 19th century up until
the mid-20th century.
While little of the architectural debris associated with the piled-stone feature was collected,
a white marble floor tile fragment and a mortar sample were collected. One side of the tile

HJN 050082 AR

111

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

fragment is smoothed and polished, but not glazed. The age of the marble tile is unknown. The
mortar has a high sand content and does not appear to contain any cement. Masonry cement
and hydrated lime was introduced in the US around the 1930s, suggesting that the construction
debris may pre-date the ca. 1930s introduction of cement (Mack and Speweik 1998).
A linear, earthen berm is present approximately 55.0 meters (180.4 feet) southeast of the
site that extends northeastwards from US 79 a distance of approximately 103.0 meters
(337.8 feet) before terminating on the Bridge Creek floodplain. This linear embankment
represents an abandoned segment of FM 4222. Currently, FM 4222 intersects with US 79
approximately 1.4 kilometers (0.9 miles) to the east and then heads roughly northwards along the
edge of the uplands bordering the broad Mud Creek floodplain. However, in the early to mid-20th
century, FM 4222 intersected with US 79 directly south of site 41CE369 and headed
northeastwards, crossing the Mud Creek floodplain and articulating with the current ROW of
FM 4222 at a prominent bend in the road on the adjacent uplands. The former ROW of FM 4222
is clearly visible on 1945 and 1961 USGS topographic maps (NETR 2015). The earliest USGS
topographic map on which the current ROW of FM 4222 is not visible dates to 1976; as such, the
former ROW was abandoned sometime between 1961 and 1976.
The function of the rectilinear stacked stone wall is unclear based on available evidence.
Based on the physiographic setting on an elevated landform within the Bridge Creek floodplain,
the presence of construction and domestic debris, and the presence of the remnants of a twotrack road connecting this feature to US 79 and a linear embankment that represents a nowabandoned ROW of FM 4222 that would have been active at the time of the historic-era presence
on site 41CE369, the wall may represent the remains of a late 19th to early 20th-century domestic
structure. Alternately, the feature may represent the remnants of an industrial feature, such as a
sawmill boiler or loading facility, associated with the logging industry that was preeminent in
Northeast Texas around the turn of the last century. In regard to the latter interpretation, however,
it should be noted that no machinery components were found anywhere on the site. Additional
research would be necessary to derive more specific conclusions. Mortar, cut sandstone
fragments, and bricks were found on the modern ground surface near the structure.
The area in which the site is located appears to be at least 75% intact. The two-track
roads and ATV trails have likely stirred up and exposed the upper sediments of the site in some
areas. As the majority of the surficial finds were, in fact, found along these existing roadways
where surface visibility was high, additional aboriginal and historic-age artifacts may be present
in the undisturbed portions of the site. Despite these surficial impacts, the sediment deposits that
comprise the aboriginal Caddoan component on site 41CE369 seem relatively stable, possibly
indicating a high degree of preservation or subsurface archeological deposits.
In summary, site 41CE369 is a multiple-component aboriginal Caddoan campsite or
hamlet with a historic-age rock wall or partial foundation with an associated historic-age artifact
scatter located on a slight rise in the Mud Creek floodplain. The Caddoan component consists of
a low- to moderate-density, mostly subsurface artifact scatter in deep sandy deposits that contain
ceramic, lithic, and groundstone artifacts and extends approximately 300.0 meters (984.0 feet)
northwest to southeast by 75.0 meters (246.0 meters) northeast to southwest. The decorative
attributes of the ceramic assemblage are quite common and were used throughout much of the
112

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Caddoan archeological sequence, allowing only a general Caddoan designation to be made for
this component (ca. A.D. 800 to 1680).
The historic-age component consists of a low, rectilinear wall; 2 large depressions of
unknown function; and a low-density, predominantly surficial artifact scatter. The lack of masonry
cement and hydrating lime suggests that the wall was constructed before the 1930s (Mack and
Speweik 1998). The historic-era artifact assemblage includes diagnostic materials, such as cobalt
blue glass and a Bristol-glazed stoneware fragment, that have known manufacture dates from the
mid- to late 19th century up until the mid-20th century. Additional investigations would be
necessary to anchor the date and function of the historic-age component on site 41CE369 as the
majority of the recovered artifacts were found on the surface and lack contextual integrity.
Based on its location below the 315.0-foot NVGD normal pool elevation, site 41CE369
stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. At present, the
eligibility status of the site remains undetermined due to the lack of data necessary to determine
significance under any of the criteria of the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Due to the
apparent antiquity of the aboriginal components, the Caddoan component is likely ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, although insufficient data is available to
determine the eligibility of the historic-age component under these criteria. Further testing would
be necessary to determine whether or not intact aboriginal and/or historic-age archeological
deposits are present that would contribute to the site’s eligibility under NRHP Criterion D.

7.4

SITE 41CE370

Site 41CE370 consists of a moderate-density subsurface scatter of ceramic sherds, a
bifacial tool, and lithic debitage located in a rolling upland pasture on the southern edge of a
tributary valley margin overlooking the Bridge Creek floodplain (Figures 7-20 to 7-22; Appendix D,
Figure D-5). The site is located approximately 175.0 meters (574.0 feet) west of FM 4222 and
10.0 meters (32.8 feet) southeast of an east-to-west-running tributary of Bridge Creek. Based on
aboriginal artifacts found, including 3 grog-tempered plain body sherds, 7 tertiary flakes (only 3 of
which were collected), and a chert biface, site 41CE370 appears to be a small Caddoan hamlet.
Grog-tempered sherds were common in East Texas throughout much of the Caddoan period. A
charcoal sample was recovered from 1 shovel test (ST JW037) at approximately 60.0 to 70.0 cm
(23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface, though it remains unclear if this charcoal derives from cultural
activity or is a byproduct of a localized, non-cultural burning event. A single, square-cut metal
nail was recovered from 1 shovel test (ST AE007) at a depth of 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches)
below surface from the same level as a piece of lithic debitage, indicating some mixing of surficial
sediments. The nail suggests historic-age activity in the vicinity, though no other historic-age
artifacts were recovered from the site; as such, a historic-era cultural component has not been
designated for this site.
Site 41CE370 is a fairly small site located on a broad, open terrace that overlooks the
Bridge Creek floodplain to the north. Seven shovel tests were excavated on the site, 5 of which
yielded subsurface cultural materials (Table 7-5). Based on the distribution of positive shovel
tests, the site measures approximately 65.0 meters (213.2 feet) north to south by 200.0 meters

(656.0 feet) east to west. The eastern and southern boundaries of the site were delineated based
on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests, though the northern and western
boundaries could not be delineated further due to the presence of standing water associated with
a tributary of Bridge Creek. Dense, sterile clays were encountered in many shovel tests directly
below culture-bearing sandy sediments. The sandy mantle appears to coincide with the extent of
the terrace landform, and deep pockets of sand were common in the eastern portion of the site.
The western portion of the site, on the other hand, dips into lowlands where clayey deposits were
observed at shallow depths, suggesting that the northern site boundary roughly coincides with
the natural slope of the upland terrace.
The landform slopes slightly down to the west, ranging from 93.0 meters (305.0 feet) amsl
in the eastern portion of the site to 89.9 meters (295.0 feet) amsl in the western portion. As such,
the entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line that outlines the pool elevation for the
proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. Sediments consist of sand underlain by yellowish-red
clay that was encountered at varying depths depending on the topography. On average, however,
dense clay sediments occurred at depths ranging from 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below

116

surface, though Holocene sediments were not fully penetrated in all shovel tests, including one in
which sand extended to a depth of 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface.
Three plain grog-tempered body sherds were recovered from 2 separate shovel tests.
Two sherds were found at 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches), while the third sherd was
collected from 70.0 to 75.0 cm (27.6 to 29.5 inches) below surface. None of the ceramic artifacts
exhibited distinctly diagnostic characteristics. Additionally, 7 tertiary chert flakes were found in
5 separate shovel tests at depths ranging from 0.0 to 60.0 cm (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below surface.
A bifacial chert tool and a small charcoal sample were found in a single shovel test at a depth of
60.0 to 70.0 cm (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface.
The area in which site 41CE370 is located appears to have experienced moderate erosion
facilitated by tree clearing, substantial cattle grazing, and agricultural activity. As a result, the
sandy soils are generally shallow with dense clayey deposits frequently observed at depths
ranging from 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Cultural materials were
recovered directly above the sterile clay deposits in many cases. Analysis of the recovered
ceramic sherds failed to establish a specific interval of occupation, primarily due to the fact that
the sherds do not exhibit any distinctive diagnostic characteristics. Grog-tempered sherds were
commonly used throughout much of the Caddoan period, suggesting that the site was probably
occupied sometime between A.D. 800 and 1680.
Site 41CE370 is situated entirely below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation,
and the site stands to be submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. At present,
the eligibility status of site 41CE370 remains undetermined due to the lack of data necessary to
determine significance under Criterion D of the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. A small
charcoal sample found at the same depth as a chert biface may be an indication that organic
materials have been preserved within the sandy matrix that characterizes site 41CE370, though
it is not currently certain that this charcoal sample is cultural in origin. While the apparent age of
the cultural deposits on site 41CE370 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of
cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP.
Site 41CE370 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

7.5

SITE 41CE371

Site 41CE371 is a small, possibly multiple-component, subsurface scatter of aboriginal
plainware ceramic sherds and lithic debitage recovered from 3 tightly grouped shovel tests
(Figures 7-23 to 7-25; Appendix D, Figure D-5). The site is located in a cleared pasture on a
terrace approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) north of Bridge Creek at the mouth of the Bridge
Creek valley. The site is 840.0 meters (2,755.2 feet) west of FM 4222 just south of a two-track
road. Based on the artifacts found, site 41CE371 appears to be a small Early Ceramic period
campsite and/or Caddoan hamlet consisting of a single plain body sherd with coarse sandy paste
of possible Early Ceramic period derivation; 2 grog-tempered, plain body sherds of probable
Caddoan origin; and 5 chert tertiary flakes. Due to the small sample size, it is difficult to pinpoint

when site 41CE371 was occupied; however, based on the small ceramic assemblage, Early
Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) and/or Caddoan (ca. A.D. 800 to 1680) components may be
indicated.
The site is located in a cleared upland pasture situated on a terrace remnant that rises
slightly above the Bridge Creek floodplain. The pasture in which the site is located is mostly flat
and featureless and is dominated by short grasses with large oak trees lining the periphery.
Elevations across the site are relatively constant, ranging from 91.5 to 92.1 meters (300.0 to
302.0 feet) amsl. As such, the entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line that
outlines the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation. Sediments are mostly sand underlain by
yellowish-red and red clays encountered at varying depths depending on the topography. In all
but 1 shovel test, dense clays were encountered at depths ranging from 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to
15.7 inches) below surface, though 1 shovel test failed to penetrate below Holocene sediments
at a depth of 60.0 cm (23.6 inches) below surface.
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41CE371 consists of a single plain body
sherd with coarse sandy paste; 2 grog-tempered, plain body sherds; and 5 chert tertiary flakes.
The ceramic sherds were found at depths ranging from 0.0 to 35.0 cm (0.0 to 13.8 inches) below
surface, and the lithic debitage was recovered from 0.0 to 60.0 cm (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below
surface (Table 7-6). Dense, sterile clays were typically encountered directly below culture-bearing
sandy sediments. All of the artifacts were found in 3 tightly grouped shovel tests surrounded by
negative shovel tests that demarcate a relatively small site boundary measuring approximately
50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast to southwest by 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) northwest to southeast.
The site boundaries appear to have been fully delineated based on the distribution of positive and
negative shovel tests. No cultural features or organic materials were observed during the
recording of this site.
The area in which the site is located appears to have experienced moderate to severe
erosion facilitated by tree clearing, cattle grazing, and agricultural activity. Sandy sediments in
the area are generally shallow with dense clayey deposits frequently observed at depths ranging
from 30.0 to 60.0 cm (11.8 to 23.6 inches) or more below surface. Cultural materials were
recovered directly above the sterile clay deposits. Analysis of the recovered ceramic sherds failed
to establish a specific interval of occupation primarily due to the fact that the sherds did not exhibit
any distinctive diagnostic characteristics, though the site may contain multiple cultural
components dating from the Early Ceramic through Caddoan periods.
Because of its location below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation, site
41CE371 stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. At
present, the eligibility status of the site remains undetermined due to the lack of data necessary
to determine significance under Criterion D of the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. While the
apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site
41CE371 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C,
insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to
determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE371 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE372

Site 41CE372 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of lithic debitage recovered from
7 closely grouped shovel tests in a moderately densely forested area west of an active stream
channel formed from the confluence of Dickey and North Caney creeks on the broad Mud Creek
floodplain (Figures 7-26 to 7-28; Appendix D, Figure D-6). The site is located approximately
525.0 meters (1,722.0 feet) east-southeast of the intersection of FM 2064 and an east-to-westrunning transmission line. The site is approximately midway between the Dickey/North Caney
Creek channel to the east and the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks to the west. No ceramic sherds
or diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed during the recording of this site. The lack of temporally
distinct artifacts among the recovered assemblage precludes pinpointing the dates of occupation,
and no organic materials were observed. As such, site 41CE372 can be loosely defined only as
a lithic scatter consisting of 8 tertiary chert, quartzite, and petrified wood flakes recovered from
depths ranging from 50.0 to 90.0 cm (19.7 to 35.4 inches) below surface. Due to the low density
of artifacts and a lack of ceramic sherds, site 41CE372 most likely represents an aboriginal
campsite dating to an unknown prehistoric timeframe, possibly falling within the overall Archaic
period timeframe (ca. 7500 to 200 B.C.).
The site is located in wooded lowlands east of Mud Creek near an intermittent stream.
Sloughs, ponds, and meandering stream channels dominate the area, and sediments are
frequently flooded. Elevation across the site is relatively constant, averaging about 88.4 meters
(290.0 feet) amsl. As such, the entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour that outlines
the proposed Lake Columbia normal pool. A total of 9 shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundaries, 7 of which yielded artifacts (Table 7-7). The site boundaries, measuring
approximately 45.0 meters (147.6 feet) north to south by 105.0 meters (344.4 feet) east to west,
were fully delineated to the north, south, and east. The western boundary could not be delineated
further due to the presence of standing water associated with a slough near the railroad bed. A
small pond formed from an abandoned meander of Dickey/North Caney Creek is located

immediately south of the site. Sediments near the slough to the west consisted of dense clays
frequently encountered at or near the modern ground surface. Sandy sediments extending to
depths beyond shovel testing capabilities were encountered throughout the rest of the site.
Cultural materials recovered from site 41CE372 consist of 8 tertiary flakes of chert,
quartzite, and petrified wood recovered from 7 shovel tests at depths ranging from 50.0 to 90.0 cm
(19.7 to 35.4 inches) below surface. The variable depths of artifacts may represent more than
1 occupation; however, given the nature of the relatively uniform matrix of deep, loose sand on
the site, it is more likely that some translocation of artifacts has occurred. The area in which site
41CE372 is located appears to be at least 75% intact, with little in the way of modern disturbances
aside from the construction activity associated with the nearby railroad track located
approximately 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) west of the site. Because of its location below the 315.0foot NVGD proposed pool elevation, site 41CE372 stands to be entirely submerged by the
proposed Lake Columbia impoundment.
Given the recovered data, it is difficult to formulate interpretations regarding the
significance of site 41CE372. Though relatively little cultural material has been recovered from
the site, all of which consists of small chipped stone flakes, the depositional context and integrity
of the deposits on this site are unclear. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and
concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE372 suggests that the site is ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to
evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under

Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE372 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient
data to evaluate the site’s significance.

7.7

SITE 41CE373

Site 41CE373 is a moderate-density subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts that
spans 2 adjacent lobes of a prominent floodplain rise on the west side of North Caney Creek on
the broad Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-29 to 7-33; Appendix D, Figure D-6). The site is
wedged between the currently active channel of North Caney Creek to the east and the Missouri
Pacific Railroad tracks to the west, directly east of the intersection of FM 4922 and FM 2064. No
ceramic sherds or diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed during the recording of this site. The
lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts among the recovered assemblage limits the ability to
discretely pinpoint dates of occupation. As such, site 41CE373 can only be loosely defined as a
lithic scatter consisting of 15 small chert, quartzite, and petrified wood flakes recovered from
depths ranging from 0.0 to 90.0 cm (0.0 to 35.4 inches) below surface and a single edge-modified
flake tool found at depths of 0.0 to 15.0 cm (0.0 to 5.9 inches) below surface. Due to the lack of
ceramic sherds, site 41CE373 may represent an Archaic period campsite (ca. 7500 to 200 B.C.),
but no diagnostic artifacts were recovered to verify this supposition, and the site may date to any
aboriginal time period.
Site 41CE373 is located on an elevated floodplain ridge that slopes eastward down toward
Caney Creek. The southern half of the site is in open pasture with short grasses and small stands
of mesquite trees. The northern half of the site stretches into a lightly forested area dominated
by oak and pine trees. The current channel of North Caney Creek and several associated sloughs
serve as the eastern boundary of the site, while the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks frame the
western boundary. Elevations range from approximately 93.0 to 94.5 meters (305.0 to 310.0 feet)
amsl across the site. As such, the entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour that outlines
the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation boundary. A total of 23 shovel tests were excavated
on the site, 12 of which yielded subsurface artifacts (Table 7-8), revealing predominately
yellowish-brown sand underlain by dense clayey sediments. The depth of the underlying clay
varied greatly across the site, ranging from 30.0 to 100.0 cm (11.8 to 39.4 inches) or more below
surface. While a few shovel tests failed to penetrate below the overlying sandy mantle at depths
of up to 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface, most shovel tests encountered clay, and it seems
that the culture-bearing sands are less than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) deep across most of the site.
Sixteen artifacts were recovered from 12 positive shovel tests that were relatively evenly
scattered between the northern and southern portions of the site, delineating a site boundary that
measures approximately 370.0 meters (1,213.6 feet) north to south by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet)
east to west. The eastern boundary coincides with the channel of North Caney Creek and several
natural sloughs associated with the drainage. The western boundary of the site is effectively
framed by the north-to-south-running Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks, beyond which lies the
existing right-of-way of FM 2064. The northern and southern boundaries were fully delineated
based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests. The southern boundary also
appears to coincide with the natural slope of the landscape; negative shovel tests in this area

were found to contain shallow clay deposits. Of the 16 artifacts found, 15 are small tertiary flakes
fashioned from chert, quartzite, and petrified wood recovered from depths ranging from 0.0 to
90.0 cm (0.0 to 35.4 inches) below surface. One edge-modified quartzite flake tool was found in
the southern portion of the site near the western boundary at a shallow depth of 0.0 to 15.0 cm
(0.0 to 5.9 inches) below surface. Additionally, a piece of semiangular lithic “debris” was collected,
but it remains unclear if it is of cultural origin.
An approximately 7.0-cm- (2.8-inch-) thick charcoal lens was encountered in a single
shovel test (ST JH125) starting at approximately 20.0 cm (7.9 inches) below surface. The
charcoal lens appears to have been preserved beneath a thin lens of mottled clay and could be
the result of a localized burning event. Given the isolated nature of this charcoal lens and its
close proximity to the railroad tracks, it is possible that this phenomenon is the result of railroad
construction activities or a more recent, localized burning event. No cultural materials were found
associated with this charcoal lens, and no cultural features or other organic materials were
observed elsewhere on the site.
The area in which the site is located appears to be 75% intact, with only limited modern
disturbances aside from tree clearing and the construction of the adjacent railroad and FM 2064.
Presently, the property is frequently used only by hunters, and the landscape remains relatively
undeveloped.
In summary, site 41CE373 consists of a subsurface scatter of lithic debitage recovered
from 12 positive shovel tests. Based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests, the
site measures approximately 370.0 meters (1,213.6 feet) north to south by 100.0 meters
(328.0 feet) east to west. Relatively few artifacts were recovered, none of which were diagnostic,
though 1 edge-modified flake tool was collected. Artifactual materials were recovered from depths
ranging from 0.0 to 90.0 cm (0.0 to 35.4 inches) below surface. Clay sediments were encountered
at depths ranging from 30.0 to 100.0 cm (11.8 to 39.4 inches) or more, though a few deep pockets
of sandy sediments were found to be scattered throughout the site, particularly along the western
margin, that were not fully penetrated via shovel testing.

7.8

SITE 41CE374

Site 41CE374 consists of a single, complete Calf Creek projectile point recovered from a
deep, homogenous sandy matrix at approximately 77.0 cm (30.3 inches) below surface
(Figures 7-34 to 7-38; Table 7-9; Appendix D, Figure D-5). This site was originally recorded as
an isolated occurrence because only a single artifact was found at this locality. Several shovel
tests excavated around the initial positive shovel test yielded negative results; however, shovel
testing failed to penetrate below the sandy mantle in this vicinity, and the find was subsequently
upgraded to an archeological site due to the possibility that additional cultural resources may be
present that would provide contextual evidence for interpreting this somewhat unusual find. Calf
Creek points are a morphological correlate of the Bell-Andice series of dart point, and the Calf
Creek complex dates to the Early to Middle Archaic periods (ca. 7000 to 3000 B.C). The point
itself was fractured during excavation, causing one of the barbs to break off, though it is otherwise
complete and both fragments of the specimen were recovered.
The site is situated on the west-facing toe slope of a high terrace in the eastern portion of
the APE that divides the tributary valleys of South Caney Creek and Bridge Creek. The site is
located about 370.0 meters (1,213.6 feet) north of Caney Creek and approximately 900.0 meters
(2,952.0 feet) west of the intersection of FM 4222 and FM 4227. As site 41CE374 consists of
only a single positive shovel test, the site boundaries were arbitrarily defined based on local
topography to measure approximately 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) in diameter. The site is in a lightly
forested upland setting covered in stands of oak, pine, and elm trees and associated underbrush.
The terrace slope on which the site is located slopes down dramatically to the west into the broad
Mud Creek floodplain. Sediments on the site and along the terrace edge were found to be
relatively homogenous in nature, consisting of deep, yellowish- to reddish-brown sandy deposits.
Clayey sediments underlying the sandy mantle were encountered in nearby shovel tests as
shallow as 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below surface; however, sandy sediments in the initial positive
shovel test and in nearby shovel tests extended below shovel testing capabilities at 100.0 cm
(39.4 inches) or more below surface. Site 41CE374 is situated at the 318.0-foot NVGD elevation
contour that defines the outer edge of the APE; the site stands to be subjected to ongoing
shoreline erosion associated with the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment and, depending on
the distribution of any additional cultural resources that may exist at this locality, possibly also by
partial inundation.

1 Calf Creek point @ 77 cmbs

All Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates are located in Zone 15 and utilize the North American
Datum of 1927 (NAD 27).

The recovered Calf Creek point is an exceptionally well fashioned specimen that
measures 9.8 cm (3.9 inches) in length, 5.2 cm (2.0 inches) in maximum width across the blade,
and 0.8 cm (0.3 inches) in maximum thickness. The stem, which measures 2.8 cm (1.1 inches)
in length, is rectangular in shape with a width of 1.8 cm (0.7 inches), and both faces of the stem
have been basally thinned via pressure flaking. The edges of the point are perfectly sharp and
the tool appears never to have been used. One of the barbs was broken off during the excavation
of the shovel test but was recovered from the screen, and the other barb is intact. The specimen
was manufactured from a chocolate brown, Edwards Formation chert from Central Texas
(Wyckoff 2006).
Calf Creek points are similar in morphology to the Bell-Andice series points that are
commonly found from the Llano Estacado to Central and Southern Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast
(Turner and Hester 1985); however, the large dart points that comprise this series are generally
found in archeological contexts in severely resharpened states; the fragile barbs are especially
prone to breakage and are typically found either by themselves or missing from the body of the
larger projectile point. Calf Creek points typically fall in the middle of the size continuum formed
by the Bell-Calf Creek-Andice types, with Andice being the largest and Bell the smallest. Calf
Creek points are attributed to a discrete cultural group known as the Calf Creek Complex, which
has a known geographical territory ranging from Arkansas to Central Texas to Oklahoma (Duncan
1995). Calf Creek peoples were hunter-gatherers generally believed to have roamed the
Southern Plains and eastern grasslands during the Early to Middle Archaic periods from about
7000 to 3000 B.C (Duncan 1995).
Relatively little can be determined about site 41CE374 at present based on the recovery
of a sole Calf Creek point. The fact that supplemental shovel testing near the find produced no
additional cultural materials is puzzling; however, given the presence of deep sands in the area,
it is possible that additional cultural materials may be present. While the apparent antiquity of the
cultural deposits on site 41CE374 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of
cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP.
Site 41CE374 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE375

Site 41CE375 is a possibly multiple-component site consisting of a diffuse, subsurface
scatter of lithic debitage recovered from 3 widely separated shovel tests and a possible late 19thto early 20th-century farmstead situated on an alluvial terrace on the west side of North Caney
Creek approximately 330.0 meters (1,082.4 feet) south of the intersection of FM 2064 and
FM 2750 (Figures 7-39 to 7-41; Appendix D, Figure D-8). The site is situated entirely within an
active agricultural field flanked on the east by a densely forested area. Investigations were
initiated within this area due primarily to information gathered from a local landowner, who
indicated that he had found prehistoric pottery and projectile points within the confines of the
plowed field on numerous occasions (though he was unwilling to make his artifact collection
available for inspection). However, upon thorough surface and subsurface investigation
throughout the field, no ceramic sherds or diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed. The lack of
temporally distinct artifacts among the recovered assemblage limits the ability to discretely
pinpoint dates of occupation. As such, site 41CE375 can only be loosely defined as a lithic scatter
consisting of 2 quartzite flakes and 1 chert flake recovered from depths ranging from 30.0 to
95.0 cm (11.8 to 37.4 inches) below surface.
Additional conversations with the landowner suggested that 2 structures built around 1880
once existed in the same plowed field as the prehistoric lithic scatter. Historical USGS
topographic maps dating to 1976, 1968, 1943, and 1937 were examined (NETR 2015), though
none of the historical maps show any standing structures within or in the vicinity of this site. While
the site is clearly located on an active farm, no evidence of the reported historic-age occupation,
aside from a single whiteware sherd of uncertain age observed within the confines of a two-track
road, was identified during the recording of this site.
The site is located in an active, plowed agricultural field that occupies an expansive alluvial
terrace overlooking the North Caney Creek floodplain to the east. Due to frequent plowing, the
upper 30.0 to 40.0 cm (11.8 to 15.7 inches) of sediment has been considerably disturbed.
Sediments below this plowzone appear to be relatively intact, consisting of yellowish- to reddishbrown sandy deposits underlain by clays containing sandstone gravels. The depth of the clayey
subsoil varied depending on the local topography. On average, clay deposits were encountered
at 60.0 to 80.0 cm (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface, though a few shovel tests hit clay at 40.0 to
55.0 cm (15.7 to 21.7 inches) below surface, and a few other shovel tests reached depths of
100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface and failed to encounter the clay subsoil. Overlying sandy
sediments were not penetrated in all shovel tests, but the overall consistency of depths at which
the clay substrate was encountered suggests that the sandy mantle is typically less than 1.0 meter
(3.3 feet) deep across this site. Elevation ranges from 90.9 meters (298.0 feet) amsl along the
eastern edge of the site to 95.1 meters (312.0 feet) amsl along the western edge; as such, the
entire site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line that serves as the proposed pool elevation
boundary.
A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated on the site (Table 7-10), though artifacts were
recovered from only 3 shovel tests, including 1 each in the northeastern, central, and
southwestern portions of the site, forming a northeast-to-southwest-oriented linear configuration

that parallels the nearby tree line. The site boundary, as determined by the 3 positive shovel
tests, measures 280.0 meters (918.4 feet) northeast to southwest by 60.0 meters (196.8 feet)
northwest to southeast. In all 3 shovel tests, artifacts were recovered within a thick lens of sandy
deposits at depths ranging from 30.0 to 95.0 cm (11.8 to 37.4 inches) below surface. Dense
clayey sediments were encountered in 2 of 3 positive shovel tests at depths ranging from 45.0 to
95.0 cm (17.7 to 37.4 inches) below surface. Additional shovel testing around the positive shovel
tests yielded negative results.
As mentioned above, conversations with the local landowner suggested that 2 farming
structures constructed around 1880 were once located within the same plowed field as the
aboriginal lithic scatter. Historical USGS topographic maps dating to 1976, 1968, 1943, and 1937
were examined (NETR 2015), though none of the historical maps show any standing structures
within or in the vicinity of this site. A single whiteware sherd of uncertain age was observed on
the modern ground surface along a berm adjacent to a meandering two-track road that traverses
the property. Aside from this solitary sherd, which was not collected, no physical evidence of any
historic-age structures or associated activity areas was found. While the site is clearly located
within an active farm, if there was once, in fact, a historic-era homestead located on the property,
it has since been destroyed, and no traces of the occupation are extant.

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

The active agricultural field in which site 41CE375 is located has experienced near-surface
impacts from frequent plowing and sheet erosion. Because of its location below the 315.0-foot
NVGD proposed pool elevation, site 41CE375 stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed
Lake Columbia impoundment. At present, the only artifacts recovered from site 41CE375 consist
of 3 interior flakes found at depths ranging from 30.0 to 95.0 cm (11.8 to 37.4 inches) below
surface, suggesting an aboriginal occupation dating to an unknown time period. The landowner
reported finding ceramic sherds on the site, which would suggest a later prehistoric, Early Ceramic
to Caddoan period occupation. Given the recovered data, it is exceedingly difficult to formulate
interpretations regarding the significance of the assemblage that constitutes site 41CE375. While
the apparent antiquity of the cultural remains found on site 41CE375 suggests that the site is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, it is possible that additional
investigations would produce evidence relating to the reported historic-age occupation of the site.
Insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to
determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE375 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE376

Site 41CE376 is a moderate-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal Caddoan ceramic
sherds, lithic debitage, and burned sandstone located in the floodplain between Mud Creek and
an unnamed tributary or channel meander of Mud Creek just north of State Highway (SH) 135
(Figures 7-42 to 7-44; Appendix D, Figure D-11). Site 41CE376 appears to be a Caddoan hamlet
made up of a moderate density of artifacts, including diagnostic ceramic sherds that exhibit
decorative styles attributed to the Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400).
The site is located within a lowland portion of the Mud Creek floodplain that has been
dissected by multiple braided segments of Mud Creek with expansive, marshy wetlands to the
north. The area is dominated by dense vegetation consisting of relatively young stands of oak
and pine trees and associated underbrush. Several mowed 2-track roads traverse the site,
allowing for increased surface visibility within the cleared corridors. Elevation across the site is
relatively constant, averaging approximately 94.5 meters (310.0 feet) amsl, with slightly higher
elevations situated adjacent to the SH 135 roadway. As mapped on USGS topographic
quadrangles, the site falls entirely within the impoundment boundary outlined by the 315.0-foot
NVGD contour line; however, the data projection utilized to establish the 315.0-foot NVGD
elevation contour for the project places a strip of land adjacent to the north side of SH 135 above
the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line. While this may be an artifact of the data model used to project
the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line, the site is clearly situated either entirely within the proposed
Lake Columbia impoundment or on the shoreline. In the latter case, the southern extremity of the
site would be above the impoundment boundary, likely due to the fact that it approaches an
artificial berm associated with the roadbed of SH 135.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated on the site, revealing predominately reddishbrown sand that extended to depths below shovel testing capabilities (Table 7-11). Cultural
materials were recovered from 8 positive shovel tests, demarcating a site boundary that measures

approximately 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) north to south by 175.0 meters (574.0 feet) east to west.
The boundaries of the site were determined based on the distribution of positive and negative
shovel tests. Clayey deposits were not encountered anywhere on the site.
A total of 5 ceramic sherds were recovered from site 41CE376, including 2 plain body
sherds, 2 body sherds with parallel brushing patterns, and 1 Canton Incised rim sherd with
hachured and cross-hatched incised lines. The association of these 2 styles suggests a Caddoan
occupation that likely falls in the Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400). The ceramic
sherds were found at relatively shallow depths ranging from 0.0 to 50.0 cm (0.0 to 19.7 inches)
below surface and were generally restricted to the eastern portion of site. The remainder of the
assemblage consists of 9 tertiary flakes recovered from depths ranging from 0.0 to 70.0 cm (0.0 to
27.6 inches) below surface and a small, burned sandstone fragment found at 10.0 to 30.0 cm
(3.9 to 11.8 inches) below surface. No clear vertical patterning is apparent for the lithic
assemblage, and these materials are fairly evenly dispersed across the site. All of the artifacts
recovered from site 41CE376 are situated within the upper 70.0 cm (27.6 inches) of sediment,
with the bulk of the cultural materials found between 10.0 and 50.0 cm (3.9 to 19.7 inches) below
surface. No cultural features or organic materials were observed during the recording of this site.
The site appears to be at least 75% intact, with few modern disturbances aside from
several 2-track roads that traverse the site and construction and subsequent activity associated
with SH 135. Two of the positive shovel tests were located directly adjacent to the northern
shoulder of SH 135. Sediments in these shovel tests were relatively homogenous, consisting of
a thick deposit of reddish-brown sand. The upper deposits did not exhibit any characteristics that

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

would lead one to believe that sediments on the site had been disturbed by the construction of
SH 135. In addition, as the majority of the artifacts were fairly well contained between 10.0 and
50.0 cm (3.9 to 19.7 inches) below surface, relatively little vertical translocation of artifacts
appears to have occurred. Overall, the artifact-bearing sediments on site 41CE376 appear to be
relatively intact.
In summary, site 41CE376 consists of a moderate-density, subsurface scatter of ceramic
sherds, lithic debitage, and a burned sandstone fragment in the Mud Creek floodplain just north
of SH 135. Artifacts occur in a relatively homogenous sandy matrix, the bottom of which was not
reached on any portion of the site. The distribution of positive and negative shovel tests
delineates a site boundary approximately 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) north to south by 175.0 meters
(574.0 feet) east to west. The ceramic assemblage suggests that occupation occurred during the
Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 1400). The bulk of the cultural materials were found
between 10.0 and 50.0 cm (3.9 to 19.7 inches) below surface, with only one small interior flake
recovered from 55.0 to 70.0 cm (21.7 to 27.6 inches) below surface. No cultural features or
organic materials were found during the shovel testing or recording of site 41CE376.
Site 41CE376 is situated below or along the shoreline of the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD
pool elevation, and the site stands to be at least partially, if not wholly, submerged by the proposed
Lake Columbia impoundment and possibly subject to ongoing shoreline impacts. The southern
portion of the site may extend above the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line, while the majority of the
site would be below the surface of the proposed impoundment. While the apparent antiquity of
the cultural deposits on site 41CE376 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of
cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP.
Site 41CE376 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

7.11

SITE 41CE377

Site 41CE377 consists of a multiple-component, subsurface scatter of aboriginal Early
Ceramic and Caddoan ceramic sherds; a small, Steiner-like projectile point; and lithic debitage
that likely represent the remains of an Early Ceramic campsite and later Middle to Late Caddoan
hamlet (Figures 7-45 to 7-49; Appendix D, Figure D-10). The site is situated on a broad expanse
of floodplain between a meander channel of Mud Creek and the eastern valley margin
approximately 2.0 kilometers (1.2 miles) south of the crossing of SH 135 over Mud Creek. Site
41CE377 appears to be a multiple-component aboriginal site, with 1 ceramic sherd dating to the
Early Ceramic Period (200 B.C. to A.D. 800) and 2 conjoinable sherds and a Steiner-like arrow
point likely attributable to the Middle to Late Caddoan periods (A.D. 1200 to 1680).
The site is located within a wide expanse of the Mud Creek floodplain between an active
channel of Mud Creek on the west and the uplands overlooking Mud Creek on the east.
Elevations across the site range from as much as 97.6 meters (320.0 feet) amsl at the
southeastern edge of the site to 86.9 meters (285.0 feet) amsl along the northwestern edge
adjacent to the Mud Creek channel. As such, the majority of the site falls below the 315.0-foot

NVGD pool elevation boundary, though a small portion of the site along the southeastern edge
would be on the shoreline of the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. The site is dominated
by a cleared pasture consisting of short grasses underlain predominately by deep sands. Dense
clayey deposits were only encountered in shovel tests in areas of lower elevation in the southern
portion of the site. A large stock pond surrounded by marshy wetlands and a barn frame the
eastern edge of the site, while the Mud Creek channel serves as the western boundary. This
western boundary is further emphasized by the steep eastern bank of the Mud Creek channel.
A total of 46 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE377, 20 of which yielded cultural
materials, demarcating a site boundary that measures approximately 825.0 meters (2,706.0 feet)
northeast to southwest by up to 350.0 meters (1,148.0 feet) northwest to southeast (Table 7-12).
The boundaries were delineated, where possible, based on the distribution of positive and
negative shovel tests. Natural barriers, such as marshy wetlands and a stock pond on the east
and the Mud Creek channel on the west, precluded further shovel testing, so the southeastern
and northwestern site boundaries may not be fully delineated, though the distribution of positive
and negative shovel tests clearly delineate the northeastern and southwestern boundaries.
Three ceramic sherds were recovered from this site, including 1 plain sandy paste rim
sherd and 2 conjoining, grog-tempered plain body sherds. Sandy paste was commonly used in
ceramic vessel manufacture during the Early Ceramic period (200 B.C. to A.D. 800). The use of
grog temper in the manufacture of ceramic vessels was common during prehistoric Caddoan time
periods and likely represents a Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680) occupation based
on the related discovery of a Steiner-like arrow point on the site. The sandy paste rim sherd was
found at a depth of 60.0 to 80.0 cm (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface and the 2 conjoining grogtempered sherds were found somewhat deeper at 90.0 to 100.0 cm (35.4 to 39.4 inches) below
surface.
A single projectile point, consisting of a small, broken arrow point, was recovered from
60.0 to 70.0 cm (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface. Although portions of the base and shoulders
are broken and missing, this specimen appears to be a Steiner or Steiner-like point judging from
the small, triangular blade and serrated lateral edges. The remainder of the assemblage consists
of 31 pieces of lithic debitage, including chert and quartzite tertiary flakes, recovered from depths
ranging from 20.0 to 110.0 cm (7.9 to 43.3 inches) below surface. The highest concentration of
artifacts, particularly lithic debris, is located in the northeastern portion of the site. Artifact
frequency drops off gradually toward the south; in fact, the central and southern portions of the
site contain only 5 positive shovel tests. The diagnostic ceramic sherds and the arrow point were
found in shovel tests excavated close to the steep bank that marks the channel of Mud Creek.
The importance of the spatial patterning within the site remains unknown; however, the
occurrence of Late Prehistoric artifacts from deeper deposits than those from which the Early
Ceramic materials were recovered suggests that at least some vertical translocation of artifacts
has occurred within the deep, sandy deposits on this site via frequent flooding, erosion, and/or
bioturbation.
Site 41CE377 appears to be 75% intact with only limited modern disturbance resulting
from construction of the nearby stock pond, barn, and associated two-track road. Additionally,
tree clearing and moderate agricultural activity has likely facilitated sheet erosion and near148

surface sediment mixing. Despite these impacts, the cultural deposits that characterize site
41CE377 occur in deep, artifact-bearing sandy sediments that extend below the maximum depth
of shovel tests at 100.0 to 125.0 cm (39.4 to 49.2 inches) below surface. Cultural materials were
recovered from throughout the sandy matrix from 0.0 to 110.0 cm (0.0 to 43.3 inches) below
surface, though the majority of the subsurface cultural materials were encountered at depths of
greater than 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below surface.
In summary, site 41CE377 consists of a subsurface scatter of ceramic sherds, a broken
arrow point, and lithic debitage situated in a broad floodplain setting between a channel meander

of Mud Creek on the west and the Mud Creek valley margin on the east, measuring approximately
825.0 meters (2,706.0 feet) northeast to southwest by up to 350.0 meters (1,148.0 feet) northwest
to southeast. Diagnostic artifacts, including a sandy paste rim sherd, 2 conjoinable grogtempered body sherds, and a Steiner or Steiner-like arrow point, as well as non-diagnostic
artifacts consisting entirely of lithic debitage, were found in a homogenous sandy matrix 0.0 to
110.0 cm (0.0 to 43.3 inches) below surface, though the majority of the subsurface cultural
materials were encountered at depths of greater than 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below surface. The
bottom of the sandy culture-bearing sediments was not reached in any of the positive shovel tests.
Underlying dense, clayey deposits were encountered only in areas of lower elevation in the
southern portion of the site. Diagnostic artifacts point to multiple occupations, including Early
Ceramic (200 B.C. to A.D. 800) and Middle to Late Caddoan (A.D. 1200 to 1680) components. No
cultural features or organic materials were found during the shovel testing and recording of site
41CE377.
Site 41CE377 is situated predominantly below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD normal
pool elevation, and site 41CE377 stands to be largely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia
impoundment. Areas along the southeastern margin of the site are situated above the 315.0-foot
NVGD contour line and would be situated along the proposed Lake Columbia shoreline. At
present, the recovery of diagnostic ceramic sherds, a projectile point, and an assemblage of lithic
debitage manufactured from an array of chert and quartzite raw materials, suggests that the site
represents a multiple-component Early Ceramic campsite and Middle to Late Caddoan hamlet.
At present, the nature of the 2 components remains only vaguely defined. While the apparent
antiquity of the cultural deposits on site 41CE377 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the
integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D
of the NRHP. Site 41CE377 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data
to evaluate the site’s significance.

7.12

SITE 41CE378

Site 41CE378 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of lithic debitage recovered from
2 shovel tests on a low-lying, alluvial formation at the confluence of 2 intermittent streams near
the eastern margin of the broad Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-50 to 7-52; Appendix D,
Figure D-10). The site is located approximately 1.4 kilometers (0.9 miles) west of FM 2064 and
approximately 1.2 kilometers (0.7 miles) southeast of Goldy Lake. No ceramic sherds, cultural
features, organic remains, or diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed on this site. The lack of
diagnostic artifacts among the recovered assemblage limits the ability to pinpoint dates of
occupation. As such, site 41CE378 can only be loosely defined as an aboriginal lithic scatter or
campsite consisting of 2 tertiary chert flakes recovered from depths ranging from 10.0 to 80.0 cm
(3.9 to 31.5 inches) below surface.
The site is located on a slightly elevated floodplain rise in a cleared pasture southeast of
the confluence of 2 intermittent streams, which, due to the flat topography and low elevation, form
a sequence of ponds and marshy areas on the Mud Creek floodplain. Elevations on the site range

only from about 94.2 to 95.1 meters (309.0 to 312.0 feet) amsl. Short, thick grasses cover most
of the landform on which the site is situated, marshy wetlands occur along the western and
eastern margins of the site, and riparian vegetation lines the banks of the intermittent stream to
the north. Shovel testing on the site revealed moderately homogenous, sandy to loamy topsoil
underlain by yellowish-red to pale brown sand (Table 7-13). Underlying clayey deposits were
encountered at depths of 70.0 to 90.0 cm (27.6 to 35.4 inches) below surface across most of the
site, though clay was encountered at a depth of 30.0 cm (11.8 inches) below surface in the
southernmost shovel test excavated on the site.
Artifacts were recovered from 2 positive shovel tests excavated on the site. One shovel
test (ST BS246) contained a single tertiary chert flake recovered at a shallow depth of 0.0 to
10.0 cm (0.0 to 3.9 inches) below surface. The other positive shovel test (ST BS248) contained
a tertiary chert flake at 70.0 to 80.0 cm (27.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Additional shovel
testing around the initial 2 positive shovel tests yielded negative results, and a total of 4 shovel
tests were excavated within the final delineated site boundaries. The site boundary measures
approximately 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) north to south by 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) east to west.
The site appears to be at least moderately intact with few modern disturbances aside from
tree clearing and limited agricultural activity, though it is possible that the relative shallowness of
the overlying sandy mantle may be partially due to erosion. Site 41CE378 is situated below the
315.0-foot NVGD normal pool elevation, and the site would be entirely submerged by the
proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. The only artifacts recovered from site 41CE378 consist
of 2 chert flakes found at varying depths—1 relatively shallow (0.0 to 10.0 cm [0.0 to 3.9 inches]
below surface) and 1 considerably deeper (70.0 to 80.0 cm [27.6 to 31.5 inches] below surface).
Based on the available data, it is difficult to formulate interpretations regarding the cultural or
regional significance of site 41CE378. At present, the site has been designated as a lithic scatter

SITE 41CE379

Site 41CE379 consists of a subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debris and a single
chipped stone tool that occupies a broad, nearly level terrace overlooking an unnamed tributary
of Mud Creek northwest of Twin Lakes (Figures 7-53 to 7-57; Appendix D, Figure D-8). The site
is located approximately 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) northeast of the FM 4905 crossing over Mud
Creek. No ceramic sherds, diagnostic lithic artifacts, cultural features, or organic materials were
observed during the recording of this site, though 1 bifacial tool was recovered in addition to an
abundance of lithic debitage. The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts among the recovered
assemblage precludes pinpointing the dates of occupation. As such, site 41CE379 is loosely
defined as a lithic scatter or aboriginal campsite consisting of 25 small chert and quartzite flakes
and 1 biface fragment recovered from deep, homogenous sandy sediments from depths of 0.0 to
130.0 cm (0.0 to 51.2 inches) below surface. Elevations on the site range from 91.5 meters
(300.0 feet) amsl along the northern and western boundaries to about 95.1 meters (312.0 feet)
amsl along the eastern edge of the site; as such, the site falls below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour
line that serves as the boundary for the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment.
A total of 28 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE379, 13 of which were positive
(Table 7-14). As defined, the site measures approximately 400.0 meters (1,312.0 feet) north to
south by 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) east to west. An unnamed tributary of Mud Creek frames the
western and northern boundaries of the site. The eastern boundary was delineated based on the
distribution of positive and negative shovel tests and is effectively marked by an existing property
fence line. The southern boundary of the site was not fully delineated, and it has been arbitrarily
defined by the existing right-of-way of FM 4905. Short grasses dominate much of the site with
riparian vegetation present near the tributary. Deep sands extending deeper than 110.0 to
130.0 cm (43.3 to 51.2 inches) below surface were encountered across the entire site, and the
deep sandy mantle was not fully penetrated in any of the shovel tests excavated on the site.
Twenty-five pieces of chert and quartzite lithic debitage were recovered from 13 shovel
tests at depths ranging from 0.0 to 130.0 cm (0.0 to 51.2 inches) below surface, with the vast
majority found below 40.0 cm (15.7 inches) below surface. A small bifacial tool made from
petrified wood was also recovered at depths of 40.0 to 55.0 cm (15.7 to 21.7 inches) below
surface. There appears to be no clear horizontal clustering of cultural material on any particular
part of the site, though most of the positive shovel tests occurred on the western half of the site.
The area in which the site is located appears to be largely intact with few modern
disturbances aside from a two-track road that traverses the central portion of the site, tree
clearing, agricultural activity, and construction of the fence line that roughly defines the eastern

site boundary. Due to the proximity of the site to several large creeks, it is possible that frequent
flooding has occurred, depositing substantial amounts of alluvial sands across the terrace.
A collapsed barn is located in the southeastern portion of the site along the western side
of a property fenceline. Examination of historical USGS topographic quadrangles and aerial
photographs indicate that this barn was part of a 20th-century farmstead (NETR 2015). The barn

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

is visible on a 1971 aerial photograph and on the 1976 USGS topographic map, but is not visible
on the 1968 topographic map, suggesting that this outbuilding was built between 1968 and 1971.
This barn was associated with a former farmhouse that was once located approximately
80.0 meters (262.4 feet) south of the barn, or approximately 55.0 meters (180.4 feet) north of
FM 4905. The farmhouse is visible on the 1937, 1943, and 1968 USGS topographic maps, but it
is absent from the 1976 version. The house is visible on an aerial photograph dating to 1971; as
such, the house would appear to have been removed or demolished between 1971 and 1976 and
is no longer standing. Thus, while the map research suggests that an early to mid-20th-century
farmstead existed within, and slightly beyond, the southeastern boundary of site 41CE379, this
historic-age component was not documented as part of the site as no cultural resources of historic
age were observed during the baseline archeological survey. The primary farmhouse is no longer
standing, and the collapsed barn would have been only 35 to 38 years old at the time the baseline
archeological survey was conducted in 2006; as such, the building was not of historic age at the
time of the survey (in fact, it still is not 50 years old as of this writing). Furthermore, no historicage cultural materials were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of the shovel tests
excavated during the delineation of site 41CE379.
In summary, site 41CE379 consists of an expansive, subsurface scatter of lithic debitage
and a petrified wood biface recovered from 13 positive shovel tests. Based on the distribution of
positive and negative shovel tests, the site measures approximately 400.0 meters (1,312.0 feet)
north to south by 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) east to west. The site may extend farther south
beyond the existing right-of-way of FM 4905. Artifacts were recovered from depths of 0.0 to
130.0 cm (0.0 to 51.2 inches) below surface, though most of the material occurred below 40.0 cm
(15.7 inches) below surface with only a single tertiary flake found in near-surface contexts. Some
possible vertical patterning of artifacts was noted, suggesting that 2 possible “lenses” of cultural
materials may be present at ca. 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches) and ca. 70.0 to 80.0 cm
(27.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Given that the cultural materials were situated within a
uniform matrix of deep, loose sand, however, at least some vertical translocation of artifacts likely
has occurred. There is potential for additional materials at depths greater than 130.0 cm
(51.2 inches) as the bottom of the sandy matrix was not reached in any of the shovel tests
excavated on the site. No diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or organic materials were
observed during the recording of this site.
Site 41CE379 is situated below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation that
outlines the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. While the apparent antiquity of the
aboriginal cultural deposits on site 41CE379 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity
of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the
NRHP. Site 41CE379 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and
for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance. Furthermore, any future investigations undertaken on site 41CE379 may
need to take into account the remnants of a 20th-century farmstead located off the north side of
FM 4905 in the southeastern portion of the site, which was not investigated during the baseline
archeological survey as the only remnants of this site observed during the survey, a collapsed
barn, was not of historic age at the time the survey was conducted in 2006.

SITE 41CE380

Site 41CE380 is a subsurface, aboriginal artifact scatter consisting of 8 conjoinable
fragments of a large ceramic sherd, 2 small bifacial tools, and lithic debitage situated on a low
alluvial finger on the broad Mud Creek floodplain just south of Twin Lakes (Figures 7-58 to 7-60;
Appendix D, Figure D-8). The site is located approximately 940.0 meters (3,083.2 feet) southeast
of the FM 4905 bridge over Mud Creek. Site 41CE380 appears to be an aboriginal campsite
evidenced by a moderate-density, subsurface scatter of artifacts, including 8 conjoinable
fragments of a large, sandy paste ceramic body sherd dating to the Early Ceramic period (ca.
200 B.C. to A.D. 800).
The site is located on a low, ridge-like alluvial landform just east of an active meander of
Mud Creek on the broad Mud Creek floodplain. The site is situated in a relatively flat, open
pasture that is bounded on the east, south, and west by thick vegetation that lines the banks of
the nearby drainages and associated marshy lowlands. Elevation ranges from 91.5 to
93.0 meters (300.0 to 305.0 feet) amsl; as such, the entire site falls below the impoundment
boundary outlined by the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line. Modern vegetation on the site consists
of short grasses and wildflowers, with a few large oak and pine trees scattered throughout. Dense
riparian vegetation borders the streams on the western, southern, and eastern margins of the site.
An east-to-west-running two-track road runs along the site’s northern margin.
A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE380, all of which contained
subsurface artifacts, demarcating a site boundary that measures approximately 130.0 meters
(426.4 feet) north to south by 85.0 meters (278.8 feet) east to west (Table 7-15). The site is
bounded by an active meander of Mud Creek on the west and by an unnamed, intermittent
drainage on the east. The northern and southern boundaries were fully delineated based on the
distribution of positive and negative shovel tests.
Eight conjoinable sandy paste ceramic sherds, which combine to form a single large body
sherd, were recovered from 1 shovel test at depths of 70.0 to 80.0 cm (27.6 to 31.5 inches) below
surface and points to an Early Ceramic period occupation on site 41CE380. Additional artifacts
recovered include 4 pieces of lithic debitage (only 3 of which were collected), all of which are
small interior flakes fashioned from low-quality chert and quartzite found at depths ranging from
65.0 to 110.0 cm (25.6 to 43.3 inches) below surface. Two small biface fragments fashioned from
quartzite and metaquartzite were also found in 2 shovel tests at depths ranging from 75.0 to
105.0 cm (29.5 to 41.3 inches) below surface. No cultural features or organic materials were
found during the recording of this site.
Based on the distribution of the positive shovel tests, the site appears to be largely
restricted to the alluvial floodplain rise on which it occurs. All cultural materials recovered from
shovel tests occur between 65.0 and 110.0 cm (25.6 to 43.3 inches) below surface, though the
bottom of the sandy matrix containing the artifacts was not reached in any of the shovel tests
excavated on the site. No artifacts were recovered from surficial or near-surface contexts. Thus,
the cultural component on this site would appear to be relatively deeply buried, though it is
possible, given the nature of the relatively uniform matrix of deep, loose sand on the site, that
some vertical translocation of artifacts may have occurred.

The site appears to be relatively intact with few modern disturbances aside from a twotrack road that runs east to west across the northern site boundary. Additionally, tree clearing
and possibly some limited agricultural activity may have facilitated some degree of erosion of
near-surface sediments, but the deeper deposits where the bulk of the cultural materials were
found (ca. 65.0 to 110.0 cm [25.6 to 43.3 inches] below surface) appear to be relatively intact.
In summary, site 41CE380 consists of a moderate density subsurface scatter of 8 sandy
paste ceramic sherds that conjoin to form a single body sherd, 2 small bifacial chipped stone
tools, and lithic debitage on a low alluvial rise in the Mud Creek floodplain just east of a meander
channel of Mud Creek. Subsurface cultural materials occur between 65.0 and 110.0 cm (25.6 to
43.3 inches) below surface, though the bottom of the sandy matrix containing the artifacts was
not reached via shovel testing on any portion of the site. As delineated by the distribution of
positive and negative shovel tests and the alignment of natural topographic features, including
the Mud Creek meander channel on the west and an unnamed tributary on the east, the site
measures approximately 130.0 meters (426.4 feet) north to south by 85.0 meters (278.8 feet) east
to west. The ceramic sherds recovered from the site indicate an Early Ceramic period (ca.
200 B.C. to A.D. 800) occupation, and the presence of ceramics, chipped stone tools, and lithic
debitage suggests that the site served as a floodplain campsite. No cultural features or organic
materials were found during the shovel testing and recording of site 41CE380.
Site 41CE380 is situated entirely below the 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation; as such, site
41CE380 stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. While
the apparent antiquity of the cultural deposits on site 41CE380 suggests that the site is ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to
evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under
Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE380 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient
data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE381

Site 41CE381 is a shallow, high-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
located on the distal edge of a prominent terrace on the western margin of the Mud Creek
floodplain (Figures 7-61 to 7-63; Appendix D, Figure D-3). The site is located approximately
1.4 kilometers (0.9 miles) south of US 79 and about 0.4 kilometers (0.2 miles) east of FM 1409.
No ceramic sherds or diagnostic lithic artifacts were observed during the recording of this site.
The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts among the recovered assemblage precludes
pinpointing the dates of occupation. As such, site 41CE381 can only be loosely defined as a lithic
scatter consisting of 13 small chert flakes recovered from shallow depths ranging from 0.0 to
35.0 cm (0.0 to 13.8 inches) below surface.
The site is situated on the distal edge of a prominent terrace lobe formed by the incision
of unnamed tributaries of Mud Creek to the north and south into the surrounding landscape. The
western portion of the site extends onto a relatively flat upland pasture dominated by thick
grasses, while the eastern half slopes down onto what appears to be an artificially terraced slope.
Elevation decreases gradually from about 98.5 meters (323.0 feet) amsl on the west to
approximately 94.5 meters (310.0 feet) amsl on the east. A total of 5 shovel tests were excavated
on the site, all of which contained buried cultural materials, revealing a thin surface stratum of
pale brown sand to silty loam underlain by yellowish-red to red clays encountered at depths
ranging from 30.0 to 50 0 cm (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface (Table 7-16).
Cultural materials were recovered from 6 closely spaced positive shovel tests, 5 of which
contained cultural materials, demarcating a site boundary that measures ca. 40.0 meters
(131.2 feet) north to south by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east to west (see Table 7-16). Site
boundaries were fully delineated based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests.
Thirteen small interior chert flakes were recovered from site 41CE381. These flakes were
fashioned from a variety of gray-, rose-, white-, and brown-colored cherts. The highest
concentration of artifacts occurs in the western portion of the site, which is situated in a relatively
level upland pasture, and shovel tests in this area yielded from 2 to 5 flakes each. The eastern
portion of the site slopes gradually down to the east toward the Mud Creek floodplain, and the
2 shovel tests excavated here produced only 1 flake each. Artifacts were recovered from between
0.0 and 35.0 cm (0.0 and 13.8 inches) below surface from a sandy matrix overlying clayey subsoil.
Site 41CE381 appears to be less than 50% intact, and modern disturbances in the vicinity
seem to have been relatively extensive. This site is situated on a ranch complex that has
undergone extensive landscaping and modern disturbance, including tree clearing, pasturage,
and possibly moderate agricultural activity with some artificial terracing evident moving downslope
toward Mud Creek. Given the extent of apparent disturbances, it is possible that the cultural
materials recovered from the site are not in their original context, though little can be inferred
based on the available data.
In summary, site 41CE381 consists of a shallow, high-density, subsurface scatter of
aboriginal lithic debitage recovered from 5 positive shovel tests on the distal edge of an old alluvial
terrace overlooking Mud Creek on the western valley margin. Based on the distribution of positive

and negative shovel tests, the site measures approximately 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) north to
south by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east to west. A total of 13 lithic flakes were recovered from
shallow sandy sediments at depths of 0.0 to 35.0 cm (0.0 to 13.8 inches) below surface, and
dense clay was generally encountered directly below this cultural zone. No diagnostic artifacts,
cultural features, or organic materials were observed during the recording of this site.
Site 41CE381 straddles the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation; as such, the site
stands to be at least partially submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment and
would be situated along the proposed future shoreline. Based on the antiquity of the aboriginal
cultural deposits on site 41CE381, the site is likely ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, and C. Given the relative shallowness of artifact-bearing sediment deposits on site
41CE381 and the extent of modern impacts, it is unlikely that site 41CE381 retains sufficient
integrity to contain data that would contribute to archeological analyses of the aboriginal past in
the Mud Creek basin. Although the density of artifacts on this site appears to be somewhat higher
than on most of the other sites recorded during the baseline archeological survey, the small size
of the site, combined with its questionable integrity, suggests that this site does not retain sufficient
potential to contribute to knowledge about the aboriginal past to qualify it for eligibility under
Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE381 is therefore recommended as ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as an SAL, and no further archeological investigations are
recommended on this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

SITE 41CE382

Site 41CE382 is a multiple-component site consisting of an aboriginal lithic scatter and a
historic-age industrial feature with an associated scatter of historic-age debris (see Figure 7-61,
Figures 7-64 to 7-69; Appendix D, Figure D-3). The aboriginal component consists of a lowdensity scatter of subsurface lithic debitage found in 2 shovel tests. The historic-age component
consists of a possible sandstone structure foundation , the base of a sandstone wall, a pile of

bricks and sandstone rocks, and an associated historic-age artifact scatter. The site is situated
on the distal edge of the remnants of a prominent alluvial terrace at the western edge of the Mud
Creek valley margin. The site is located approximately 1.9 kilometers (1.2 miles) southeast of the
intersection of US 79 and FM 1409, 0.6 kilometers (0.4 miles) east of FM 1409, and 100.0 meters
(328.0 feet) west of Mud Creek.
The site is located on the distal edge of an alluvial terrace remnant overlooking the
floodplain of Mud Creek at elevations ranging from 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) amsl along the
western boundary to about 85.4 meters (280.0 feet) amsl along the eastern site boundary at the
base of the slope. As such, the entire site falls within the impoundment boundary outlined by the
315.0-foot NVGD contour line. Numerous springheads occur along the eastern boundary of the
site, creating a marshy wetland. These springs appear to represent a perennial water source.
Large, riparian trees and associated underbrush dominate the eastern portion of the site. The
western portion of the site is situated on the edge of a cleared, open pasture. Shovel testing on
the site revealed a variety of brown, grayish-brown, and yellowish-brown sandy and silty loam
sediments at and near the surface. Underlying clays were encountered at depths as shallow as
5.0 cm (2.0 inches) in the northern portion of the site and from 40.0 to 70.0 cm (15.7 to
27.6 inches) below surface across the rest of the site.
A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE382, 3 of which contained
subsurface cultural materials (Table 7-17). Based on the distribution of positive and negative
shovel tests, surface finds, and observed features, the boundary of site 41CE382 measures
approximately 140.0 meters (459.2 feet) north to south by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east to west.
The northern, western, and southern boundaries of the site were fully delineated based on the
distribution of positive and negative shovel tests as well as historic-age features. The eastern
boundary was not fully delineated but has been arbitrarily considered to be coextensive with the
edge of a large, marshy wetland, fed by natural springs, that abuts the eastern edge of the site.
The aboriginal component of site 41CE382 consists of 3 pieces of lithic debitage, including
a chert flake, a piece of metaquartzite angular debris, and a quartzite flake, recovered from
2 shovel tests in the southern portion of the site located approximately 16.0 meters (52.5 feet)
apart. These artifacts were recovered from depths ranging from 20.0 to 60.0 cm (7.9 to
23.6 inches) below surface. Red, yellowish-red, black, and reddish-brown clays were
encountered directly below the cultural zone contained within the surficial sandy and loamy
sediments. While the recovery of chipped stone lithic artifacts is generally indicative of an
aboriginal presence on the site, relatively little else can be determined regarding the site type or
cultural affiliation based on the limited data recovered.
The historic-age component consists of a roughly rectangular mounded landform outlined
by sandstone boulders, the base of a sandstone rock wall, a pile of bricks and sandstone boulders,
and a historic-age artifact scatter. The rectangular sandstone feature, possibly the foundation of
a small structure, is located in the central portion of the site. The somewhat overgrown foundation
consists of a rectangular pile of cut sandstone slabs that measures approximately 6.0 by
3.0 meters (19.7 by 9.8 feet), with the long axis oriented east to west. The sandstone rock wall
is located approximately 17.0 meters (55.8 feet) east of and downslope from the foundation and
measures roughly 6.0 meters (19.7 feet) in length. The sandstone wall, likely constructed as a

retaining wall to retard erosion along the edge of the marsh, consists of a single course of cut
sandstone slabs, and the feature is surrounded by large trees, which has no doubt weakened the
structural integrity of the feature. The sandstone slabs comprising the foundation and the wall
appear to have been cut in the same fashion. Examination of historical USGS topographic maps
and aerial photographs indicates that no residential structures or outbuildings ever stood at this
location (NETR 2015).
A large pile of ceramic bricks and sandstone blocks is located approximately 60.0 meters
(196.8 feet) south of the structure foundation upslope from the headwaters of a natural spring. A
variety of bricks were observed, including soft, light red cut bricks and hard red bricks. Some of
the ceramic bricks are engraved with “TEXAS,” “STANDARD,” and “CORSICANA RED” maker’s
marks. It is possible that this brick pile derives from a former structure erected atop the
rectangular sandstone feature or a feature that was constructed to serve as an erosion deterrent
adjacent to the stream, as periodic episodes of flooding and erosion appear to be resulting in the
formation of erosional cutbanks along the edges of the wetland. Additional historic-age artifacts
that are apparently associated with the structural remains include industrial metal objects such as

HJN 050082 AR

173

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

pipes, mechanical wheels/rims, a possible iron leg, thin flat metal fragments, and long bolts.
These artifacts were scattered across the site with a higher concentration near the sandstone
foundation. Most of the historic-age materials associated with the structural foundation appear to
be machinery parts, which suggests that the structure may have served as a small industrial
facility, possibly sited to take advantage of the nearby water source.
Other observed historic-age artifacts include historic-age ceramic sherds and glass
shards. Two conjoining pieces of Bristol stoneware (probably from a ginger beer bottle base with
white glaze on the inside only) were found on the surface. Stoneware was typically a utilitarian
vessel and was produced over a long period of time. Bristol glazed stoneware was first produced
in Bristol, England, in 1835 and became common after 1890 (Greer 1981). One thin, clear glass
rim fragment was observed in ST JH301 at a depth of 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below
surface but was not collected. The glass fragment did not exhibit any diagnostic characteristics,
and it was the only historic-age artifact found in subsurface contexts on the site.
Site 41CE382 appears to be 75% intact, with few modern disturbances aside from tree
clearing and nearby agricultural activity, which has likely facilitated erosion. Despite these
impacts, the deposits seem relatively stable, allowing for a high degree of preservation.
Site 41CE382 is a multiple-component site consisting of a low-density, subsurface
aboriginal lithic scatter and a historic-age industrial feature or facility located at the edge of a
prominent alluvial terrace on the western margin of the Mud Creek floodplain. Based on the extent
of prehistoric and historic-age artifacts from 3 positive shovel tests, surface finds, and observed
features, the boundary of site 41CE382 measures approximately 140.0 meters (459.2 feet) north
to south by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east to west. The prehistoric component consists of a small
quantity of lithic debris recovered from sandy and loamy sediments overlying clay in 2 positive
shovel tests at depths ranging from 20.0 to 60.0 cm (7.9 to 23.6 inches) below surface. The
historic-age component consists of a possible structural foundation and a wall, both constructed
of cut sandstone slabs, and an associated historic-age artifact scatter. All of the historic-age
artifacts and features were observed in surface contexts, with the exception of a single clear glass
shard found in a shovel test at 40.0 to 50.0 cm (15.7 to 19.7 inches) below surface that was not
collected. The only diagnostic historic-age artifact found was a Bristol stoneware fragment
composed of 2 conjoining sherds found on the modern ground surface. Bristol stoneware was
manufactured from 1835, when Bristol stoneware ceramic technology was originally invented, to
the mid-20th century, which probably serves to frame the historic-age component on site
41CE382 within the late 19th to early 20th centuries.
Site 41CE382 is situated entirely below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation; as
such, the site stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. At
present, the eligibility status of site 41CE382 remains undetermined due to the lack of available
data required to satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Overall,
the prehistoric component is very diffuse and seems capable of contributing relatively little to
developing an understanding of prehistoric cultural systems in this region; as such, the aboriginal
component on site 41CE382 does not appear to contribute to the potential eligibility of the site
and is not recommended for further investigation. The historic-age component, however, contains
the remains of at least 1 structural foundation as well as a section of a sandstone slab retaining
174

wall and a scatter of historic-age artifacts, including metal, ceramic, glass, and brick artifacts,
some of which are temporally diagnostic of the late 19th to early 20th centuries. While limited
almost entirely to the modern ground surface, the historic-age component of site 41CE382 retains
a great deal of integrity and may have the potential to contribute to an understanding of the historic
past under Criterion D of the NRHP. As such, site 41CE382 is recommended to be of unknown
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be
necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE383

Site 41CE383 is a multiple-component, high-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal Early
Ceramic and Caddoan period ceramic sherds, lithic debitage, and burned sandstone situated on
a small terrace overlooking a channelized slough that forms a cutoff along a segment of the Bridge
Creek channel (Figures 7-70 to 7-73; Appendix D, Figure D-5). The site is located approximately
550.0 meters (1,804.0 feet) east of FM 4222 and 15.0 meters (49.2 feet) north of the artificial,
east-to-west-running slough that parallels a segment of Bridge Creek, an eastern tributary of Mud
Creek. Site 41CE383 contains a relatively high density of subsurface artifacts, including 2 sandy
paste ceramic body sherds of probable Early Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) age and
10 decorated and plain ceramic sherds indicative of a Caddoan occupation occurring sometime
during the Middle to Late Caddoan periods (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680).
The site is situated on a small terrace remnant on the north side of the Bridge Creek valley
that faces southward toward the Bridge Creek floodplain. Elevations across the site range from
91.5 to 95.1 meters (300.0 to 312.0 feet) amsl; as such, the entire site falls below the
impoundment boundary outlined by the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line. The site is located in a
cleared, open pasture dominated by short grasses, with riparian vegetation flanking the artificial
channel that forms the southern border of the site. The site area is circumscribed by a barbedwire fence that roughly coincides with the topography of the alluvial landform on which the site is
situated. Shovel testing on the site revealed surficial light brown, light reddish-brown, and light
gray sandy and loamy sediments underlain by reddish clays. Clay was encountered at depths
ranging from 35.0 to 70.0 cm (13.8 to 27.6 inches) below surface and was encountered in most
of the shovel tests excavated on the site. The cultural component on the site is contained within
the overlying 35.0 to 70.0 cm (13.8 to 27.6 inches) of alluvial sediments, and the bottom of this
component has been effectively defined across the site via shovel testing.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE383, 9 of which contained
subsurface cultural materials, demarcating a site boundary that measures approximately
65.0 meters (213.2 feet) in diameter (Table 7-18). The northern, western, and eastern boundaries
of the site were fully delineated based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests.
The southern boundary was not fully delineated due to the presence of an artificial channel of
Bridge Creek, which has been arbitrarily defined as the southern boundary.
A total of 12 ceramic sherds were recovered from this site, including 2 plain sandy paste
body sherds of probable Early Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) derivation and a small
assemblage of 10 sherds from a Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) occupation.
Four of the 10 Caddoan sherds are decorated, including 2 parallel brushed body sherds, 1 sherd

with a single straight incised line, and 1 sherd with possible tool punctations. The parallel brushed
body sherds are the most temporally distinctive ceramic type in the small assemblage. This style
began to dominate Caddo ceramic assemblages in the region around A.D. 1200 and continued in
use through the Late Caddoan period. Most of the ceramic sherds on site 41CE383 were
recovered from relatively shallow depths ranging from 0.0 to 35.0 cm (0.0 to 13.8 inches) below
surface, though 1 sherd was recovered from 65.0 cm (25.6 inches) below surface. The remainder
of the artifact assemblage is composed of 14 pieces of lithic debitage fashioned from chert,
quartzite, and metaquartzite—primarily small interior flakes found at depths ranging from 0.0 to
70.0 cm (0.0 to 27.6 inches) below surface—and a piece of burned sandstone found at 50.0 to
60.0 cm (19.7 to 23.6 inches). The highest concentration of artifacts occurs in the approximate
center of the site, where a suite of 5 shovel tests (STs JH314, JW297, JW299, MM063, and
MM065) each contained multiple artifacts. Shovel tests near the edge of the defined site area
(STs MA304, MA305, JH315, and MM067) each contained only a single artifact.
Site 41CE383 appears to be restricted to a small terrace remnant that overlooks the Bridge
Creek floodplain. The majority of the subsurface artifacts recovered from the site are vertically
situated within the upper 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) of sediment with only a few artifacts recovered
from deeper contexts, though all of the cultural materials are contained within the Holocene-age
alluvial sediments that overlie clayey subsoil. The relative depths of the cultural materials do not
clearly define separate occupation zones, though the presence of Early Ceramic and Middle to

Late Caddoan ceramic sherds indicates multiple occupations on the site. No cultural features or
organic materials were found during the shovel testing and recording of site 41CE383.
The site appears to be 75% intact, with few modern disturbances aside from the
construction of the artificial channel to the south. Tree clearing and moderate agricultural activity
may have impacted near-surface sediments and facilitated surficial erosion, but the cultural
deposits on site 41CE383 seem relatively stable, allowing for a high degree of preservation.

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

Site 41CE383 consists of a high density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal lithic debitage
and plain and decorated ceramic sherds on a small, cleared alluvial terrace just north of Bridge
Creek. Cultural materials are situated in a sandy matrix at depths ranging from 0.0 to 70.0 cm
(0.0 to 27.6 inches) below surface. Dense clays were encountered across the site at depths
ranging from 35.0 to 70.0 cm (13.8 to 27.6 inches) below surface, effectively framing the cultural
occupation within the overlying Holocene-age sediment matrix. The site measures approximately
65.0 meters (213.2 feet) in diameter, and diagnostic ceramic artifacts in the assemblage of
collected cultural materials indicate aboriginal occupations dating to the Early Ceramic (ca.
200 B.C. to A.D. 800) and to the later Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680) periods.
The Early Ceramic occupation would likely have been a small campsite, while the later occupation
was probably a small Caddoan hamlet. In addition to the ceramic materials, lithic debitage and a
single fragment of burned sandstone were recovered from the site. No stone tools, cultural
features, or organic materials were found during the shovel testing and recording of site 41CE383,
though the presence of burned rock suggests that cultural features may be present.
Site 41CE383 is situated entirely below the estimated 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation,
and the site stands to be entirely submerged by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment.
While the apparent antiquity of the cultural deposits on site 41CE383 suggests that the site is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently
available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of
the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE383 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility
for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to
obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE384

Site 41CE384 consists of a late 19th- to early 20th-century, historic-age farmstead
composed of a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor plan farmhouse, a ca. 1950 front-gabled barn, a cistern,
and an associated surficial and shallow subsurface scatter of historic-age artifacts, including glass
shards, metal objects, a ceramic figurine, and ceramic sherds (Figures 7-74 to 7-78; Appendix D,
Figure D-3). A single aboriginal lithic artifact, a possible perforator fragment, was recovered from
1 shovel test (ST MA326) in near-surface contexts, though historic-age cultural materials,
including a glass shard and a metal pin, were found below this prehistoric artifact in the same
shovel test, indicating that the sediment deposits are mixed and that the lithic artifact is not in
primary context. As such, an aboriginal cultural component has not been formally designated on
site 41CE384.
Site 41CE384 is located west of FM 1409 (Pine Oak Drive) on a two-track dirt road south
of Cannon Ridge Road. The primary historic-age resource on the site, located off the south side
of the dirt road, is a ca. 1890, hall-and-parlor plan farmhouse with numerous early additions (also
designated as Historic Site 7; see Chapter 8.0 for discussion of architectural features). Other
buildings on the property include a ca. 1980 manufactured home located north of the road and a
ca. 1950 front-gabled barn located southwest of the house. A cistern is situated near the
northeast corner of the dwelling.

This site is located on an upland knoll along the western margins of the Mud Creek
floodplain along the western edge of the APE. Most of the native vegetation has been cleared
from the site, with the exception of some short, mowed grasses and a few pine trees. The site is
situated at elevations ranging from approximately 96.0 to 99.1 meters (315.0 to 325.0 feet) amsl.
As such, site 41CE384 would be situated along the shoreline of the proposed Lake Columbia
reservoir, though it is likely that the site would not be permanently submerged. A total of 5 shovel
tests were excavated around the farmhouse, revealing predominately shallow sandy soils
underlain by clayey deposits at depths ranging from 20.0 to 70.0 cm (7.9 to 27.6 inches) (Table 719). The site boundary, measuring approximately 70.0 meters (229.6 feet) north to south by
60.0 meters (196.8 feet) east to west, encompasses the existing historic-era farmhouse, cistern,
barn, and artifact scatter, though the modern manufactured home is located about 30.0 meters
(98.4 feet) northeast of the site and is not included within the site boundaries.
As discussed in Chapter 8.0, the primary residence on site 41CE384 may have originated
as a 2-room, hall-and-parlor plan dwelling. This conjecture is based on the asymmetrical
placement of the red-brick chimney between the southernmost and middle rooms. The main body
of the house has boxed eaves, a refinement that pre-dates the popularity of the bungalow, while
the porch roofs and rear wing exhibit exposed rafter ends. The exposed rafters suggest that each
of these elements were added ca. 1920. One of the rear porches has been partially enclosed
with corrugated sheet metal. Overall, the unoccupied house is in fair condition.
Most, if not all, of the additions to the original house date to the historic period and have
therefore taken on significance of their own. The hall-and-parlor portion of the house is a simple
plan type commonly built by early settlers in East Texas, and this house may represent that early
settlement period. If this is the case, the 1890 date may be a conservative one. Later portions
and details, such as exposed rafter ends and tapered porch posts, appear to be early-20thcentury additions. The house retains many aspects of historic integrity, including materials,
workmanship, setting, association, and feeling. Although it’s original design has been altered,
the alterations fall within the historic period and exhibit substantial integrity to their periods of
construction. Thus, the house displays an evolution of building types and styles found in East
Texas from the mid- to late 19th century through the early 20th century (ca. 1920s).
Numerous historic-age artifacts are present on the modern ground surface near the
farmhouse and within 2 positive shovel tests excavated near the house. Historic-age surface
artifacts include cobalt blue glass, amethyst decorative glass, whiteware ceramic sherds, and
vanilla bottle glass. Subsurface historic-age artifacts include a porcelain doll’s foot, metal, glass
shards, and ceramic sherds recovered from depths of 20.0 to 35.0 cm (7.9 to 13.8 inches) below
surface. The subsurface artifacts appear to be concentrated near the southwestern corner of the
house, while most of the surface artifacts were observed on the west side of the house. The only
artifacts collected from site 41CE384 were found in 2 shovel tests (STs MA326 and MA327). The
collected artifacts include 26 glass shards, 2 ceramic sherds, 7 metal fragments, and 1 metal pin.
In addition, a porcelain doll’s foot, common from the mid-19th century until World War I (Tosa
1987:20), was recovered from the site.
A milky white Mason’s jar liner and a tin screw cap lid were recovered from ST MA327.
John L. Mason patented the zinc screw cap for jars in 1858. It continued to be used until the mid184

20th century. To remedy the metallic taste that the zinc screw cap produced, Lewis Boyd
developed the milky white glass liner to insert between the lid and the top of the jar. The liner
was introduced in 1869. The fragment of the liner that was recovered from site 41CE384 is
embossed with the letters “YD” and “CA.” Originally, the liner probably read “GENUINE BOYD'S
CAP FOR MASON JAR,” which was stamped on most liners (Toulouse 1971).
One piece of amethyst glass was recovered from the site. The amethyst color is a result
of solarization of glass with a manganese decolorizer. Archeologists typically date amethyst glass
between 1880 and 1914; however, recent studies have shown that these dates are only partially
accurate (Lockhart 2006). The first documented use of manganese as a decolorizer in the US
was as early as 1870 (Lockhart 2006). The use of manganese ceased with the production of the
Owens automatic bottle machine because it failed as a decolorizer in open tanks (Lockhart 2006).
Manganese was replaced by selenium.
Other glass artifacts recovered from site 41CE384 include 7 brown bottle fragments,
4 blue aqua bottle fragments, 10 clear bottle fragments, and 3 clear window glass shards. Only
2 historic-age ceramic sherds were found on the site. Both were from utilitarian stoneware
vessels. One has Bristol glaze and is a plate fragment. The other only has 1 finished side, which
has a gray salt glaze.
Most of the metal artifacts are nails, including machine-cut nails, which date between 1830
and 1890; however, the specimens are highly corroded. The remaining metal artifacts include
1 tin-covered roofing nail, 1 iron nut and bolt, and 1 iron rivet.

Site 41CE384 appears to be mostly intact. All structures and cultural features on the site,
including the primary residence, a barn, and a cistern, are still standing, and the scatter of historicage debris is reflective of historic-age domestic activity on the site. A prehistoric aboriginal
presence may be indicated by the recovery of a single chipped stone artifact found
stratigraphically above historic-age artifacts in 1 shovel test. Based on its morphology, this artifact
may be the broken tip from a chipped stone perforator, though the apparent bit on this possible
tool does not exhibit the rounding and polish that would be expected if the tool had been used as
a perforator. Alternately, this specimen may simply be a piece of angular chert shatter. It is likely
that the historic-age activity on the site agitated the shallow Holocene-age sediments, and there
is good reason to suppose that bioturbation; agricultural and construction-related activities; tree
clearing; and/or some degree of erosion have conspired to destroy the integrity of any aboriginal
cultural remnants that may be represented on this site.
Site 41CE384 is a historic-age farmstead with a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor plan house with
numerous additions indicative of modifications as recently as the 1920s. A ca. 1950 front-gabled
barn is located southwest of the house and a cistern is situated near the northeast corner of the
dwelling. Historic-age artifacts recovered from and observed on the site are consistent with a
residential occupation dating to the late 19th to early 20th centuries, an assessment that is
consistent with the construction dates of the main house on the property. The site boundary,
encompassing the house, barn, cistern, and associated artifact scatter, defines an area
measuring approximately 70.0 meters (229.6 feet) north to south by 60.0 meters (196.8 feet) east
to west. A possible prehistoric lithic artifact was recovered from near-surface contexts in a shovel
test excavated near the main house, which may be generally indicative of an aboriginal presence
on the site, but this artifact was found stratigraphically above historic-age artifacts and does not
retain any integrity of context.
Site 41CE384 is situated along the shoreline of the proposed Lake Columbia
impoundment. The primary farmhouse on site 41CE384, designated as Historic Site 7, has been
determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C in the area of Architecture
and Criterion A in the area of Settlement (see Chapter 8.0). The house retains many aspects of
historic integrity, including materials, workmanship, setting, association, and feeling. Although
it’s original design has been altered, the alterations fall within the historic period and exhibit
substantial integrity to their periods of construction. Thus, the house displays an evolution of
building types and styles found in East Texas from the late 19th through the early 20th centuries
(1920s), and this site contains the oldest documented dwelling in the survey area. Furthermore,
the site contains archeological deposits and cultural features associated with the historic-age
occupation. Further archival research and testing of the archeological deposits are recommended
in order to determine if additional data can be gathered that would contribute to the site’s overall
eligibility status under Criterion D of the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.

SITE 41CE385

Site 41CE385 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal Caddoan ceramic sherds
and lithic debitage located on the crest and eastern slopes of a series of sandy rises adjacent to
a bog on the western terrace of the broad Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-79 to 7-83; Appendix D,

Figure D-3). The landform is located on the “Off-Road Park” property 1.0 kilometers (0.6 miles)
north of the US 79 bridge across Mud Creek. Based on the artifact assemblage recovered from
the site, the occupation appears to have been a Caddoan hamlet based on the recovery of
7 conjoinable ceramic body sherds from 1 shovel test that exhibit a parallel brushing motif
indicative of a probable Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680) component at site
41CE385.
Site 41CE385 is situated on a series of rolling upland knolls west of a well developed bog
on the Mud Creek floodplain. The bog was probed during the baseline geomorphic study to
determine the depth of maximum peat accumulation—up to 3.0 meters (9.8 feet) of peat mass is
present within the bog, indicating a long history of continual inundation (see Chapter 6.0). The
knolls upon which the site is located appear to be ancient terrace remnants with a minimum of
80.0 cm (31.5 inches) of sand capping them. The higher portion (roughly the western two-thirds)
of the site spans elevations ranging from 97.6 to 115.9 meters (320.0 to 380.0 feet) amsl, which
places the majority of the site above the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation of 315.0 feet
NVGD as well as the 318.0-foot NVGD “purchase line.” The eastern portion of the site ranges in
elevation from approximately 86.9 to 97.6 meters (285.0 to 320.0 feet amsl) and would fall within
the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment area or along the shoreline. The landforms on which
the hamlet resides have been cleared for use as a modern campground that serves competitors
and spectators of off-road competitions held on the property. Primary vegetation on the site
consists of sparse, short grass, which is generally kept mowed. Natural climax vegetation,
including pines, cedar, and typical understory brush, exists on the fringes of the bog along the
eastern site boundary. Sediment strata encountered in shovel tests consist of loose sand
underlain by dense clay. Culturally sterile, transitional sediments of clay-stained sand, usually
containing ferrous inclusions, were encountered in several shovel tests between the overlying
Holocene alluvium and underlying clay structures. This transitional sediment was observed on
the modern ground surface at lower elevations, where overlying Holocene sediments appear to
have eroded away. The loose, light brown sand contained all of the subsurface cultural materials
recovered from the site. Most of the subsurface artifacts were recovered from relatively shallow
depths ranging from 10.0 to 35.0 cm (3.9 to 13.8 inches) below surface, though 1 piece of lithic
debitage was recovered from a depth of 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface. The underlying
clay stratum, which defines the bottom of Holocene-age alluvial sediments, was encountered at
depths ranging from 50.0 to 90.0 cm (19.7 to 35.4 inches) below surface, though many shovel
tests did not reach the clay subsoil at depths of up to 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface.
A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE385, of which 6 shovel tests yielded
cultural materials (Table 7-20). ST RC002 yielded 7 conjoinable ceramic body sherds at depths
of 0.0 to 25.0 cm (0.0 to 9.8 inches) below surface at the base of the toe slope that defines the
neighboring uplands, and ST DB001 contained 5 pieces of lithic debitage at depths of 0.0 to
110.0 cm (0.0 to 43.3 inches) below surface on the floodplain of Mud Creek. Four other positive
shovel tests, excavated at higher elevations, yielded 7 pieces of lithic debitage from depths

lithic debris occurred between 10.0 and 35.0 cm (3.9 to 13.8 inches) below surface. The

site, ca. 150.0 meters (492.0 feet), occurs along its northeast-to-southwest axis across the upper
elevations of the site where it sprawls across multiple terrace remnants, though only a narrow
finger of the site, measuring about 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) in width, extends into the APE below
the proposed 315.0-foot NVGD normal pool elevation. The site ranges in elevation from about
86.9 to 115.9 meters (285.0 to 380.0 feet) amsl. The site was delineated westward beyond the
315.0-foot NVGD contour, though the western boundary was not determined, and the site may
extend farther west. The northern and southern boundaries were determined based on the
presence of reddish-brown clay or the ferrous transitional sediment on the modern ground
surface, which indicates that the overlying sediments containing the cultural materials no longer
exist in these areas. The eastern site boundary was arbitrarily drawn at the edge of the well
established bog east of the site.
The artifact assemblage collected from site 41CE385 includes 12 lithic flakes collected
from 0.0 to 100.0 cm (0.0 to 39.4 inches) below surface, though most of these specimens were

recovered between 10.0 and 35.0 cm (3.9 to 13.8 inches) below surface, and 7 conjoining ceramic
sherds found in a single shovel test between 0.0 and 25.0 cm (0.0 and 9.8 inches) below surface,
indicating that the Caddoan cultural component on this site is relatively shallowly buried overall.
Most of the lithic artifacts are tertiary flakes, while 1 is a secondary flake, of chert and petrified
wood. The 7 ceramic sherds exhibit a brushed motif generally dating from the Middle to Late
Caddoan periods (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680). Based on the overall low densities of cultural material,
no obvious concentrations of material are discernable on the site. Rather, a widely spread,
relatively low-density scatter of artifacts was recovered from across the site. No cultural features
or organic materials were observed on site 41CE385.
Site 41CE385 seems to be situated on a prehistorically and historically stable landform;
however, as trees have been cleared to provide a campground for off-road park visitors, a certain
amount of sheet erosion has undoubtedly taken place. Many of the shallowly buried finds at this
site could easily have become horizontally translocated. These same erosive forces have
removed any sign of the light brown, culture-bearing sand deposits along the northern and
southern site boundaries. Judging from the presence of numerous rodent burrows on the surface,
some vertical translocation of materials likely has also occurred by virtue of a healthy local
population of gophers. At the lower clines near the bog at the eastern site boundary, construction
of mud pits for off-road racing has had some impact on subsurface deposits, and the transitional
sands and clays are visible on the modern ground surface in this area. Similar disturbances have
affected the bulk of the site to a small degree, though only the northern and southern site
boundaries have been greatly affected by destructive natural and artificial events.
Site 41CE385 consists of a Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680) hamlet on a
well drained upland landform adjacent to a well established bog. The site has so far yielded few
artifacts relative to its size, though the presence of 7 conjoinable, diagnostic ceramic sherds
permits the identification a definable prehistoric occupation. Based on the expansive site size,
the excavation of a total of 13 shovel tests is insufficient to be certain of the discovery of the full
range of archeological materials on this site, though the scale of investigations on this site was
kept intentionally limited as most of the site falls outside the boundaries of the APE. The
landforms upon which the site is located, which resemble knolls of differing sizes and elevations,
were presumably rather stable prior to tree clearing, and the culture-bearing, sandy sediment
deposits remain intact upon these landforms. The heaviest natural and artificial impacts have
taken place at the site’s northern and southern edges.
While the majority of site 41CE385 is situated outside the APE above the 318.0-foot NVGD
contour line, an elongated sliver of the site extends onto the Mud Creek floodplain below the
315.0-foot NVGD contour line. The portions of the site below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour stand
to be inundated by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. While the apparent age of the
cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE385 suggests that
the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are
currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research
potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE385 is recommended to be of
unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would
be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE386

Site 41CE386 is a multiple-component, low- to high-density surface and subsurface
scatter of aboriginal Early Ceramic and Caddoan ceramic sherds, lithic debitage, and groundstone
tools located within the narrow floodplain of an unnamed, eastern tributary of Mud Creek and on
an associated alluvial fan landform at the mouth of this tributary where it discharges onto the Mud
Creek floodplain proper (Figures 7-84 to 7-88; Appendix D, Figure D-2). The unnamed tributary
flows along the southeastern edge of a narrow, flat valley framed by prominent upland formations.
The site is located off the west side of FM 4301 and about 500.0 meters (1,640.0 feet) north of
the eastern end of the proposed Lake Columbia dam axis. Based on the artifacts collected, the
site appears to be an early Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) hamlet with an Early
Ceramic period (200 B.C. to A.D. 800) occupation represented.
Three activity loci were documented on the site based on localized areas of high artifact
density, including a small area near the head of the tributary valley, a small area on the Mud
Creek floodplain near the southwestern site boundary, and an area near the southeastern
boundary of the site. However, it should be noted that a low-density scatter of artifacts was
observed on the modern ground surface across the site and that the entire site area was not
systematically examined via shovel testing due to its large size. As such, the 3 high-density loci
simply represent activity areas that have been defined so far based on available information.
The main area of site 41CE386 is located on the narrow, level floodplain of a channelized
tributary on the east side of the Mud Creek floodplain between 2 steep upland ridges, and this
stream forms much of the southeastern boundary of the site. This tributary floodplain is used as
a driveway providing access from FM 4301 to the cattle pasturage located on the Mud Creek
floodplain, and a two-track road parallels the tributary. At present, the tributary stream flows along
the southeastern edge of its valley, but the hummocky appearance of the landscape within the
valley suggests that this stream formerly meandered across its floodplain. Now that it has been
channelized, the stream hugs the southeastern valley wall of the Mud Creek floodplain, flowing
away to the south to feed a low, marshy area in the vicinity of the proposed Lake Columbia dam.
Deposition of alluvial sediments on the Mud Creek floodplain by this stream appears to have
ceased since its channelization; in fact, erosional forces appear to have begun scouring the
alluvial sediments from the surface of the alluvial fan, and older clayey terrace remnants are
beginning to show on the modern ground surface in some portions of site 41CE386.
The second activity area identified on the site is situated toward the distal end of the
alluvial fan formed by the former discharge of the tributary stream onto the Mud Creek floodplain
prior to its channelization. Currently, this part of the site traverses a series of gently rolling alluvial
fan lobes that are being dissected by erosional rills and gullies. A cluster of shovel tests was
excavated about halfway across this alluvial formation between the valley margin and the current
channel of Mud Creek, and 2 of the shovel tests yielded subsurface artifacts.
The third activity area consists of a surficial scatter of ceramic sherds found in a hog
wallow along the southeastern boundary of the site, more or less due east from the second activity

area defined above. Surficial sediments in this area have been disturbed by hogs, revealing a
scatter of ceramic artifacts on the modern ground surface.
Near the distal end of the alluvial fan in the approximate center of the site is a prominent
hill that likely represents the former distal end of the nearby ridge on the north side of the tributary
that was cut off from its parent upland formation by former stream action (possibly a former
meander of the channelized stream). This hill takes the form of a large, natural mound with a thin
surface layer of sand and a hard substratum of ferrous sandstone. Sandstone bedrock crops out
on the modern ground surface in many areas on this landform. The ridge remnant is about
4.0 meters (13.1 feet) high at its apex and is visible on the USGS Jacksonville East 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle. Based on the presence of cultural materials on this landform, it was
apparently utilized by the aboriginal inhabitants of the site, but the mound appears to be entirely
natural in origin.
Most of the site has been cleared of vegetation and is currently being used as cropland
and cattle range. The floodplain of the channelized tributary is under cultivation and had been
recently plowed (though not yet planted) at the time of the survey, which resulted in the exposure
of abundant cultural materials on the modern ground surface. Surface inspection atop the nearby
upland formations indicates that cultural material is not present on them, suggesting that the site
is limited to low-lying floodplain environs or that any cultural materials once present on the
adjacent upland ridges have long since washed down into the valley. Vegetation along the fringes
of the site in uncleared areas includes pines, cedar, and typical pineywoods understory brush.
Short grasses and an occasional small pine tree typify vegetation within the site boundaries.
The site ranges in elevation from approximately 83.8 to 97.6 meters (275.0 to 320.0 feet)
amsl; as such, most of site 41CE386 is situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour and thus
below the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation, while a small area along the northwestern
edge of the tributary valley would be above the proposed reservoir shoreline. The site measures
approximately 975.0 meters (3,198.0 feet) northeast to southwest. The site’s width along its
northwest-to-southeast axis averages roughly 175.0 meters (574.0 feet), though the northeastern
half of the site is restricted to the narrow confines of the tributary valley, which is generally less
than 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) wide, and the site fans out toward the southwest, achieving a
maximum width of 275.0 meters (902.0 feet) on the Mud Creek floodplain. Site boundaries within
the tributary valley were defined based on the lack of cultural materials on the adjoining uplands,
the northeastern end is demarcated by FM 4301, and the boundaries on the Mud Creek floodplain
are marked by the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests and surficial artifacts in all
directions except to the south. The southern boundary on the Mud Creek floodplain has not been
delineated. The floodplain of the tributary stream northeast of FM 4301 was surveyed to
determine if the site extends east of the road, but surface inspection and shovel tests in this area
failed to produce any cultural materials.
The assemblage of cultural material recovered from site 41CE386 consists of 31 ceramic
sherds, 3 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 charcoal sample, and 3 groundstone tools. A total of
42 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE386, only 8 of which were positive (Table 7-21).
Most of the artifacts were recovered from the modern ground surface of the site, particularly from
the plowed field on the floodplain of the tributary valley, but shovel testing did produce limited

evidence of subsurface archeological deposits. Subsurface cultural materials were recovered at
depths ranging from 0.0 to 102.0 cm (0.0 to 40.2 inches) below surface. Due to the relative
sparseness of positive shovel tests within the site boundaries, 1 shovel test (ST DK030) was
excavated in an area within the floodplain valley in which a high density of surface artifacts was
observed. This shovel test was expanded from the typical 30.0-by-30.0-cm (11.8-by-11.8-inch)
shovel test size to approximately 50.0 by 70.0 cm (19.7 by 27.6 inches) to obtain more information
about the subsurface density of cultural materials in this area. The shovel test yielded 11 ceramic
sherds from a depth of 30.0 to 50.0 cm (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface from a sandy matrix
overlying a dense clay deposit that occurred at a depth of 64.0 cm (25.2 inches) below surface.
The sherds include a variety of ceramic types from at least 6 different vessels.
Of the 31 ceramic sherds recovered from site 41CE386, 18 sherds were found on the
modern ground surface and 13 were recovered from subsurface contexts in shovel tests. Two of
the sherds have a sandy paste, 1 of which has relatively deep and wide parallel incised lines, and
date to the Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800). The remaining 29 sherds are
associated with the Caddoan occupation, including 18 plain and 11 decorated sherds. The
11 decorated Caddoan sherds include 1 brushed-incised, 1 parallel brushed, 4 tool-punctated,
2 unidentified punctated, 1 diagonally incised rim, 1 body sherd with parallel and perpendicular
incised lines, and 1 engraved body sherd. The latter sherd has sets of possibly vertical engraved
lines, perhaps from a bottle form. Brushed sherds compose 18% of the sample of decorated
Caddoan sherds, which suggests that the Caddoan occupation dates closer to A.D. 1200 than to
A.D. 1400 within the Middle Caddoan period.
While much of the ceramic material recovered from the site was found on the modern
ground surface; ceramic sherds were recovered from 2 shovel tests. ST DK030 was excavated
within the floodplain of the tributary valley and yielded 11 sherds from a definable occupation lens
extending from 30.0 to 50.0 cm (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface. The remaining 2 subsurface
ceramic sherds were recovered from ST RC025 at a depth of 60.0 to 70.0 cm (23.6 to 27.6 inches)
below surface in association with a charcoal sample. Most of the observed impacts on site
41CE368, including plowing and cattle pasturage, are relatively surficial, and it possible that the
relatively deeply buried archeological deposits are intact. Shovel testing conducted within the
narrow tributary floodplain yielded potentially culture-bearing sandy deposits to depths of 60.0 to
80.0 cm (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Shovel tests on the alluvial fan demonstrated that
sandy culture-bearing sediments extend deeper than shovel tests were capable of penetrating in
some areas (ca. 110.0 cm [43.3 inches] below surface), though clayey remnants of older,
presumably Pleistocene-age alluvial structures are evident on the modern ground surface in other
areas where the overlying sandy mantle has begun to erode away. Natural impacts, including
root, gopher, and hog activity, have likely added to the effects of erosion and plowing, resulting in
some vertical and/or horizontal translocation of artifacts, though the deeply buried cultural lenses
observed on the site appear to be at least partially intact.
Three pieces of lithic debitage, recovered from depths of 35.0 to 102.0 cm (13.8 to
40.2 inches) below surface, were found on site 41CE368. Three groundstone tools, including
1 large metate, 1 nutting stone, and 1 unclassified fragment of ground or pecked stone, were

recovered from the modern ground surface at locations within the tributary valley as well as on
the Mud Creek floodplain.
The highest density of materials on site 41CE386 appears to occur within the narrow
tributary floodplain in the northeastern half of the site. This area has been under cultivation for
some time, and plowing appears to have impacted sediments to a depth of ca. 30.0 cm
(11.8 inches) below surface. Ceramic sherds were recovered from an identifiable subsurface lens
of cultural material in this area at depths of 30.0 to 50.0 cm (11.8 to 19.7 inches) below surface.
Potential for intact features situated below the plowzone in this area seems high. Another highdensity area, this time from a subsurface context only, occurs at the distal end of the alluvial fan
near the southwestern boundary of site 41CE386. This area yielded ceramic sherds from depths
of 60.0 to 70.0 cm (23.6 to 27.6 inches) below surface as well as a charcoal sample. The
sediments beneath these finds were loose, light brown sand that may be potentially culturebearing to a depth greater than attainable by shovel testing.
Site 41CE386 consists of a sprawling, early Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200
to 1400) hamlet with an Early Ceramic period (200 B.C. to A.D. 800) occupation represented.
Cultural material is contained within deep, Holocene-age alluvial sediments to depths ranging
from 35.0 to 102.0 cm (13.8 to 40.2 inches) below surface in different areas of the site, though
artifacts were also observed on the modern ground surface in many areas. Dense clay subsoil
was encountered in some areas of the site as shallow as 45.0 cm (17.7 inches) below surface,
though the culture-bearing sandy mantle extended deeper than 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below
surface in some areas of the site. Most of site 41CE386 is situated below the proposed Lake
Columbia pool elevation of 315.0-feet NVGD; as such, the site stands to be inundated by the
proposed reservoir, though a portion of the northwestern boundary of the site along the edge of
the tributary valley would be situated at a slightly higher elevation along the proposed reservoir
shoreline. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age
resources) on site 41CE386 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural
deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site
41CE386 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE387

Site 41CE387 represents the remains of a historic-age farmstead located on the crest and
west-facing upper slopes of a prominent upland ridge east of the Mud Creek drainage basin
(Figures 7-89 to 7-93; Appendix D, Figure D-2). The site is located about 200.0 meters
(656.0 feet) southwest of a bend in the right-of-way of FM 4301 and roughly 600.0 meters
(1,968.0 feet) east-southeast of the eastern end of the proposed Lake Columbia dam. As
documented during the survey, the site consists of a brick-lined well covered by a rusting box
spring and a pile of bricks. A small number of historic-age artifacts were recovered from
subsurface contexts on the site, but none of these cultural materials are sufficiently diagnostic to
clearly establish the dates of construction and occupation of the farmstead.

Site 41CE387 is situated on the crest and upper western slope of a high hill that overlooks
the Mud Creek floodplain on the eastern valley margin. The landscape slopes strongly down to
the southwest and northwest of the site. Coon Creek, a tributary of Mud Creek, flows
approximately 725.0 meters (2,378.0 feet) south of the site, discharging into Mud Creek
downstream of the proposed Lake Columbia dam location. Elevations across the site range from
100.6 to 109.8 meters (330.0 to 360.0 feet) amsl; as such, the site is situated well above the
proposed 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation. However, the site is situated within the area that would
be converted into the proposed Lake Columbia spillway at the eastern end of the dam.
A total of 5 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE387, most of which revealed deep
sandy deposits extending to depths in excess of 70.0 to 120.0 cm (27.6 to 47.2 inches) below
surface, though a shallowly buried B-horizon was observed in 1 shovel test at a depth of 14.0 cm
(5.5 inches) below surface (Table 7-22). The site was delineated by the distribution of positive
shovel tests as well as the positions of cultural features, which establish a site boundary
measuring approximately 120.0 meters (393.6 feet) southeast to northwest by 50.0 meters
(164.0 feet) southwest to northeast. Some of the climax vegetation had been recently cleared
from the site by the time the survey was conducted, as evidenced by tree throws and dirt piles
scattered across the site. The main site features were fringed by large pine and oak trees.
Bulldozer piles were overgrown with invasive species of vegetation.
The brick-lined well, which is located just west of the site’s center, was covered by a matrix
box spring and a tangle of branches at the time of the site’s discovery. The well is completely
intact and has not been back-filled. The well is constructed of red brick and mortar and is at least
9.1 meters (30.0 feet) deep, as evidenced by suspending a tape measure down the shaft. A
nearby pile of red bricks is located about 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) east of the well. Whatever
feature or outbuilding this debris pile may represent has either been demolished or removed from
the site.
Other than the pile of construction debris and brick-lined well, no cultural materials were
observed on the modern ground surface. Four of the 5 shovel tests excavated on the site

produced historic-age artifacts from depths of 0.0 to 111.0 cm (0.0 to 43.7 inches) below surface,
though most of the cultural materials were recovered from the upper 30.0 to 40.0 cm (11.8 to
15.7 inches) of sediments. Recovered cultural materials include 2 plain whiteware ceramic sherds
(a plate fragment with a molded rim and a plate base fragment), a cast iron stove or tractor part,
and 4 badly corroded tin can fragments, none of which are particularly time-sensitive.
While no standing structures are currently present within or in the vicinity of the
documented boundaries of site 41CE387, examination of historical USGS topographic maps and
aerial photographs provides some information about the probable dates of occupation of this site.
The 1945 and 1961 USGS topographic quadrangles show a structure, presumably the primary
residence, situated atop a prominent upland knoll approximately 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) east
of the documented site boundaries (NETR 2015). This structure is not present on the 1976 USGS
topographic map, and it is no longer standing, indicating that the house was moved or demolished
between 1961 and 1976. Historical aerial photographs show that the crest of the hill surrounding
the former house location was under cultivation in 1971, the date of the earliest available aerial
photograph, suggesting that the farm was still active at this time (NETR 2015). The area
surrounding the former location of the house was inspected for cultural resources during the
survey and 2 shovel tests were excavated in this area, though no evidence of the former house
or other cultural resources were observed. As such, site 41CE287 is located toward the western
periphery of the former farm that was located atop this upland formation. Based on the presence
of several overgrown bulldozer push piles on the site, it is possible that the debris pile observed
near the brick-lined well represents the remains of the demolished house, which may have been
pushed to the edge of the landform.
Site 41CE387 is a historic-age farmstead located on an upland formation on the eastern
valley margin of the Mud Creek drainage basin. While the cultural features and few artifacts
observed on site 41CE387 clearly indicate that this was the site of a historic-age homestead, very
little evidence remains of the site. Recent bulldozing and vegetation clearing have severely
disturbed near-surface sediments across most of the site. In addition, the landscape slopes
steeply down toward Mud Creek to the southwest and northwest, and this may have resulted in
some erosion of sandy sediments, though the sandy mantle remains quite deep across the ridge.
Based on examination of historical USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs, the
farmstead was extant by 1961 and agricultural fields were under cultivation as late as 1971,
though the primary residential structure on the site was moved or demolished by 1976. Thus,
while a historic-age 20th-century occupation of the site can be demonstrated based on inspection
of historical maps and aerial photographs, the available evidence is insufficient to estimate the
initial dates of occupation. The primary residence has been demolished or removed from the site,
and no outbuildings are present. Site 41CE387 is situated within the proposed location of the
eastern spillway of the proposed Lake Columbia dam; as such, this site stands to be impacted
during construction of the spillway and dam facilities. Based on the overall dearth of cultural
materials on the site, it is unlikely that site 41CE387 is eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D
based on its archeological potential. However, insufficient archival information is available to
determine the eligibility of the site under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. Site 41CE387 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an

SAL; further testing and/or archival research would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to
evaluate the site’s significance.

7.22

SITE 41CE388

Site 41CE388 is a low- to moderate-density, subsurface scatter of ceramic sherds and
lithic debitage situated on a sandy floodplain promontory adjacent to Mud Creek on the south side
of its confluence with North Caney Creek (Figures 7-94 to 7-98; Appendix D, Figure D-6). The
site is bounded by the Missouri Pacific Railroad trestle and a railroad borrow area along its
northwestern boundary, by Mud Creek on its northeastern side, and by the right-of-way of
FM 4223 to the south. The site is located within the triangle formed by the intersection of the
railroad tracks, Mud Creek, and FM 4223. Based on artifacts recovered during subsurface
investigations, the site appears to be the remains of a small Caddoan hamlet with a possible later
component dating to an unknown aboriginal timeframe. Decorative motifs observed on ceramic
sherds recovered from the site indicate that the Caddoan component dates to the Middle to Late
Caddoan periods (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680), though the only recovered evidence of the possible
later occupation on the site consists of undiagnostic lithic debitage.
The entire site is situated below the proposed 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation. Elevations
across the site range from approximately 88.4 to 91.4 meters (290.0 to 300.0 feet) amsl, with a
gradual grade sloping down to the northeast toward Mud Creek. The landform upon which site
41CE388 resides is a gently sloping terrace remnant in the Mud Creek floodplain, higher in
elevation than much of the area to the southeast or northwest. The elevation of the landform is
the probable reason for the establishment of the encampment here, and the relatively higher
landscape may also have influenced the decision to build the railroad crossing of Mud Creek at
this locality. Construction of the railroad trestle apparently involved mining borrow materials along
the right-of-way to construct the abutment berm for the tracks. This mining activity has apparently
impacted the northwestern boundary of site 41CE388, and it is unknown whether or not any intact
remnants of the site may be present below the railroad berm. Vegetation on the site includes
dense plantation pine, cedar, and typical pineywoods understory, including dense greenbrier.
Vegetation is sparse along Mud Creek and in the railroad borrow area.
While the northeastern and northwestern boundaries of the site are defined by the Mud
Creek channel and the railroad borrow area, respectively, the southern boundary of the site has
not been fully delineated. Rather, the southern boundary has been arbitrarily established by the
FM 4223 right-of-way, which passes about 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) south of the southernmost
positive shovel test excavated on the site. As documented during the survey, site 41CE388
measures 150.0 meters (492.0 feet) north to south by 75.0 meters (246.0 feet) east to west.
Shovel tests excavated south of FM 4223 failed to produce any subsurface cultural materials.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE388, 6 of which yielded subsurface
cultural materials (Table 7-23). Artifacts were recovered from 10.0 to 80.0 cm (3.9 to 31.5 inches)
below surface from a sediment matrix composed of pale brown to yellowish-brown sand to sandy
loam. Underlying reddish-brown clay was encountered at depths ranging from 42.0 to 70.0 cm
(16.5 to 27.6 inches) below surface in 2 shovel tests, though this culturally sterile subsoil was not

reached in the majority of shovel tests, in which sandy and loamy sediments extended to depths
of up to 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface.
Three pieces of lithic debitage and 9 ceramic sherds were recovered from the 6 positive
shovel tests on site 41CE388. All of the lithic debitage was recovered from the upper 10.0 to
20 cm (3.9 to 7.9 inches) of loose, brown, moist sandy sediments, while the ceramic material was
recovered from the same sediment deposit at markedly lower depths of 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to
31.5 inches) below surface. The apparent vertical separation of lithic and ceramic artifacts may
reflect the presence of 2 functionally and temporally distinct aboriginal occupations, though it is
possible that the shallowly buried lithic debitage was deposited during overbank flooding
subsequent to the initial occupation of the site indicated by the more deeply buried materials.
The small ceramic assemblage recovered from site 41CE388 includes 4 brushed body
sherds, 3 plain body sherds, 1 rim or body sherd with a possible broken suspension hole, and
1 engraved body sherd. The latter sherd has 2 parallel engraved lines with a large cross-hatched
triangle pendant from one of the lines. Such decorative elements were common during both the
Middle (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) and Late (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) Caddoan periods. The 3 pieces
of lithic debitage were of a gray to dark gray chert.

Aside from railroad construction disturbance and possibly some sheet erosion of surficial
sediments downslope in the northeastern portion of the site, the more deeply buried subsurface
artifacts recovered from site 41CE388 seem to be in context. Ceramic material was recovered
from depths of 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface, but 8 of the 9 sherds were
actually recovered from a discrete cultural lens between 40.0 and 60.0 cm (15.7 and 23.6 inches)
below surface. The scatter of lithic materials in near-surface contexts (ca. 10.0 to 20.0 cm [3.9 to
7.9 inches] below surface) may be the remains of an ephemeral campsite by a later aboriginal
group or simply be the byproduct of overbank flooding.
Site 41CE388 is interpreted as a Middle to Late Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680)
hamlet with a possible later component that consists of a light subsurface scatter of lithic materials
that may represent a short-term campsite by an unknown aboriginal group. The site is situated
on a well drained, elevated rise in the Mud Creek floodplain that is located in proximity to the
confluence of 2 major stream channels—Mud and North Caney creeks. No cultural features or
organic remains were encountered during the recording of the site, but the discreteness of the
subsurface deposits from which lithic and ceramic materials were recovered suggests that the
site remains largely intact despite limited impacts associated with nearby railroad tracks and road
construction.
Site 41CE388 is situated entirely below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour line; as such, the
site stands to be inundated by the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. While the apparent
age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE388
suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient
data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the
research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE388 is recommended to
be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing
would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE389

Site 41CE389 is a multiple-component Early Ceramic campsite and Middle to Late
Caddoan hamlet situated on a relatively flat remnant of an upland ridge on the western valley
margin of Mud Creek that also forms the northern valley margin of Club Lake Branch (Figures 799 to 7-105; Appendix D, Figure D-4). The site extends westward from a metal gate at which
FM 4218 dead-ends and consists of a moderate- to high-density scatter of surface and subsurface
artifacts. Ceramic sherds recovered from the site indicate a Middle to Late Caddoan (ca.
A.D. 1200 to 1680) period probable Frankston phase component mixed with a collection of sandy
paste ceramic sherds attributed to the Early Ceramic period (200 B.C. to A.D. 800).
Site 41CE389 is situated on a broad, flat ridge that projects out onto the broad Mud Creek
floodplain, forming a low upland divide between an active meander of Mud Creek and Club Lake
Branch. Vegetation on the landform consists of large plantation pine trees with relatively sparse
scrub understory. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE389, 9 of which
contained subsurface cultural materials (Table 7-24). As delineated by the distribution of positive
and negative shovel tests, the site measures approximately 250.0 meters (820.0 feet) east to west
by 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) north to south in the western half of the site and 50.0 meters

(164.0 feet) north to south in the eastern half. Three two-track roads cross the site at the southern,
eastern, and western site boundaries. A small, open pasture with a deer feeder is located south
of the site. The entire site is situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour corresponding to the
proposed pool elevation of Lake Columbia. Elevations across the site are relatively flat, ranging
only from about 94.5 to 95.7 meters (310.0 to 314.0 feet) amsl, sloping gradually down toward
the east.
Sediments in the eastern half of the site consist of a relatively thin, 30.0- to 40.0-cm- (11.8to 15.7-inch-) thick layer of reddish-brown fine sand over dense, reddish-brown clay. The
overlying sandy matrix contains the cultural materials recovered from site 41CE389. This culturebearing loose sand, however, was not fully penetrated via shovel testing in the western portion of
the site, where the sandy matrix is substantially deeper (depths in excess of 100.0 to 120.0 cm

[39.4 to 47.2 inches] were recorded in some areas). Notably, subsurface artifact counts were
highest from the western portion of the site where sandy sediments are deeper.
Artifacts collected from site 41CE389 consist of 44 ceramic sherds, 4 pieces of chipped
stone debitage, and a small metate that also exhibits characteristics of a nutting stone. Ceramic
sherds from the site include 41 sherds of Caddoan manufacture and 3 sandy paste sherds
attributable to an Early Ceramic occupation. Of the 41 Caddoan sherds, 20 are plain body sherds
and 21 sherds exhibit decoration. Sixty percent of the decorated Caddoan sherds exhibit
brushing, which suggests that the Caddoan component on this site dates to the Late Caddoan
period (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680) and represents a Frankston phase component. The other 40% of
the decorated sherds include 2 punctated body sherds; 1 single-line incised sherd; 2 engraved
sherds with unidentifiable elements; 1 body sherd with broad, diagonally incised lines; and 1 sherd
that may represent a fragment of a Poynor Engraved vessel. Lithic material recovered from the
site consists of 4 tertiary flakes of grayish-brown chert and dark brown metaquartzite. The single
groundstone artifact in the assemblage was recovered from a depth of 75.0 cm (29.5 inches)
below surface. This coarse sandstone tool was utilized as a metate on 1 side and as a nutting
stone on the other. The highest density of artifacts occurs near the western site boundary. Most
cultural materials were recovered from subsurface contexts, though 5 of the ceramic sherds
recovered from the site were collected from the modern ground surface.
Loose sandy sediments containing Early Ceramic and Caddoan period artifacts occur at
depths ranging from 0.0 to 120.0 cm (0.0 to 47.2 inches) below surface and appear to be mixed.
Vertical translocation of artifacts has likely taken place through gopher burrowing and tree root
growth, resulting in a mixing of the 2 cultural components on the site. No cultural features or
organic materials were observed during the recording of the site.
Site 41CE389 is a multiple-component Middle to Late Caddoan (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1680)
hamlet with a Frankston phase component in mixed deposits with an earlier Early Ceramic period
(200 B.C. to A.D. 800) campsite. The landform upon which the site sits contains deep, sandy
sediments extending beyond the reach of shovel tests in some areas, though a pre-cultural
reddish-brown clay subsoil is visible on or near the modern ground surface in the northern,
southern, and eastern portions of the site, curtailing any possibility of temporally stratified deposits
in these areas. No cultural features or organic remains were observed on the site, but the
recovery of a large number of chipped stone, ceramic, and groundstone artifacts hints at a wellestablished Caddoan element.
Site 41CE389 is situated entirely below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour of the proposed
Lake Columbia pool; as such, the site stands to be inundated by the proposed reservoir. While
the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site
41CE389 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C,
insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to
determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE389 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE390

Site 41CE390 is a large, multiple-component, low- to high-density, Early Ceramic and
Caddoan occupation situated upon an enormous upland ridge remnant on the Mud Creek
floodplain, west of the primary creek course (Figures 7-106 to 7-110; Appendix D, Figure D-4).
This landform is flanked on its east and south sides by the meandering Mud Creek channel and
on the north by Club Lake Branch, a major tributary of Mud Creek. Based on the artifact
assemblage collected from the site and the spatial distribution of positive shovel tests, site
41CE390 appears to consist of 1 or more small, Middle to Late Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to
1680) hamlets that may represent a larger village. The recovery of a sandy paste ceramic sherd
hints at the existence of a pre-Caddoan Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) occupation
on the site.
Site 41CE390 is located near the western valley margin of the Mud Creek floodplain. The
prominent landform on which the site is situated is a large, steep hill with deep sand deposits that
likely represents the former distal end of the upland formation that forms the western Mud Creek
valley margin, which was likely cut off from its parent formation by a former meander of one or
more of the tributaries of Club Lake Branch that currently flow north of the hill, or possibly even
by a former channel of Mud Creek itself.
Site 41CE390 ranges from a maximum of 100.6 meters (330.0 feet) amsl at the top of the
hill to approximately of 88.4 meters (290.0 feet) amsl along the western site boundary. The 315.0foot NVGD contour that represents the proposed elevation of the Lake Columbia normal pool
encircles the crest of the hill; as such, the central portion of site 41CE390 (about 50% of the site
area) would be situated above the proposed impoundment, while the other half of the site,
consisting of the eastern and western flanks of the site, would fall below the proposed
impoundment elevation. Two two-track roads cross the site that were apparently constructed to
provide access to various parts of this very remote landform for hunting and logging activities.
Land use upon this landform includes deer hunting and pine tree cultivation, and the presence of
several logging roads in the general vicinity points to tree farming as well. As much as 50% of
the surface of the large, floodplain hill is covered with second- or third-culling plantation pine
forest, and the average tree was well over 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) tall at the time the site was
recorded. Other vegetation includes occasional cedar trees and typical pineywoods understory,
including a healthy growth of greenbrier.
A total of 35 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE390, 15 of which yielded subsurface
cultural materials (Table 7-25). Only 7 shovel tests reached sterile subsoil deposits, identified by
red clay or sandstone bedrock. All other shovel testing was conducted to a depth of maximum
practicality with hand-operated equipment, ranging from 100.0 to 150.0 cm (39.4 to 59.1 inches)
below surface. The typically pale brown to reddish-brown sand deposits resting above the clay
and bedrock seemed relatively undisturbed throughout the site. Most shovel tests reached a
depth of well over 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) below surface within potentially culture-bearing matrices.
These sand deposits were very dry due to the excellent drainage the steep rise provides, making
the landform an ideal spot for prehistoric occupation.

The highest density of subsurface artifacts was recovered from the northeastern slope of
the massive landform at an elevation approximately corresponding to the 315.0-foot NVGD
contour. Shovel tests excavated in this portion of the site yielded the vast majority of the ceramic
material recovered from the site, and a relatively large quantity of lithic debitage was recovered
from this locus as well. Although artifacts were abundant elsewhere within the site, the distribution
of finds was diffuse and artifacts were scattered somewhat uniformly across the site. No other
areas of high density comparable to the aforementioned locus were discovered during the
recording of the site, but many areas of the site were scarcely investigated during the survey due
to the large size of the landform. Regardless, the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests
indicates that the site measures at least 600.0 meters (1,968.0 feet) northeast to southwest by
200.0 meters (656.0 feet) northwest to southeast. Site boundaries were not clearly delineated in
any direction via shovel testing, and the site may be considerably larger than documented. Mud
Creek flows along the southern margin of the large hill and forms a likely southern boundary.
Several negative shovel tests were excavated northeast of the documented site area, but another
archeological site (site 41CE392) is present about 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) to the east near the
confluence of Mud Creek and Club Lake Branch that may be associated with, or even constitute
an extension of, site 41CE390. Furthermore, 2 isolated artifact occurrences (IOs RD-002 and
RD-003) were documented to the north along Club Lake Branch, and it would appear that this
area is rich in archeological sites and localities resulting from aboriginal activity. The documented
northern site boundary is entirely arbitrary as few shovel tests were excavated north of the site,
and only 2 negative shovel tests were excavated beyond the documented western boundary.
The assemblage of artifacts collected from site 41CE390 includes 9 ceramic sherds,
25 pieces of lithic debitage, and 16 burned rocks, all recovered from subsurface contexts via
shovel testing. Sandstone bedrock was encountered in 1 shovel test at a depth of 50.0 cm
(19.7 inches) below surface, and an apparently pre-Holocene, dense red clay was reached in a
few shovel tests at depths ranging from 34.0 to 105.0 cm (13.4 to 41.3 inches) below surface, but
the majority of shovel tests were excavated to depths ranging from 100.0 to 150.0 cm (39.4 to
59.1 inches) below surface without ever reaching the bottom of the Holocene sandy mantle in
which cultural materials are contained.
Lithic debitage was recovered from depths ranging from the modern ground surface to the
practical bottom of shovel tests at depths down to 110.0 cm (43.3 inches) below surface, though
the majority of lithic finds came from approximately 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below
surface and seem to be centered on a buried cultural lens at about 50.0 to 60.0 cm (19.7 to

224

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

23.6 inches) below surface. Lithic debitage recovered from the site consists of 9 gray chert tertiary
flakes, 8 light brown chert tertiary flakes, 4 dark brown chert tertiary flakes, 2 red metaquartzite
tertiary flakes, 1 piece of gray chert shatter, and 1 piece of fire-reddened metaquartzite shatter.
Much of this material was found along the southeastern site boundary. This area may be
attributed to an earlier prehistoric component based on the absence of ceramic artifacts in this
area, or it may represent an activity area within the larger Early Ceramic and/or Caddoan
encampment.
Nine ceramic sherds were recovered from site 41CE390. The majority of this material
came from a high-density locus near the northeastern site boundary. The ceramic assemblage
consists of 6 decorated Caddoan sherds, including 1 parallel incised/overlapping brushed sherd,
4 parallel brushed sherds, and 1 sherd with parallel brushing intersected by a broad incised line;
2 undecorated Caddoan body sherds; and 1 sandy paste Early Ceramic sherd. The
2 undecorated Caddoan body sherds were recovered from a shovel test (ST JG039) excavated
near the apex of the landform. All other sherds were found within the high-density area along the
northeastern site boundary. One shovel test (ST JG041) excavated in this high-density area was
widened to 50.0 by 70.0 cm (19.7 by 27.6 inches) in size. This shovel test yielded ceramic sherds
as well as a possible burned rock feature visible in the sidewall. This possible cultural feature
appears to be a loose burned rock pavement situated approximately 60.0 to 65.0 cm (23.6 to
25.6 inches) below surface and measuring about 5.0 cm (2.0 inches) in thickness. Fifteen burned
sandstone fragments, measuring from 3.0 to 8.0 cm (1.2 to 3.1 inches) in diameter, were observed
in the wall of ST JG041, though these cultural materials were left in place to facilitate relocating
the feature in the future. Based on the presence of this possibly intact, buried feature, it can be
inferred that undisturbed, buried archeological deposits may exist on site 41CE390, at least in the
high-density area recorded near the northeastern site boundary. Four Caddoan ceramic sherds
and 1 piece of lithic debitage were found below the buried burned rock feature; interestingly, the
depth of this cultural feature (ca. 60.0 cm [23.6 inches] below surface) on the northeastern slope
of the hill may correspond to the approximate depth at which most of the lithic debitage was found
on the southern slope (ca. 40.0 to 80.0 cm [15.7 to 31.5 inches] below surface), centering on a
possible cultural zone situated ca. 50.0 to 60.0 cm (19.7 to 23.6 inches) below surface.
While some degree of surficial sediment erosion has undoubtedly occurred on the slopes
of the steep hill across which site 41CE390 sprawls, the deeper, culture-bearing sediments
appear to be in situ. Some vertical translocation of materials may have taken place due to the
actions of rodent burrowing and tree root growth and decay. The majority of cultural material,
however, was found at depths that are likely to have escaped the destructive forces of surficial
erosion.
Site 41CE390 is a Middle to Late Caddoan period (A.D. 1200 to 1680) occupation that may
represent multiple hamlets or even a village. An earlier Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to
A.D. 800) component is also represented by 2 sandy paste ceramic sherds. With a site area of at
least 120,000 m2, the level of work performed during the survey was not able to fully delineate the
nature and extent of aboriginal cultural deposits on site 41CE390, and site boundaries were not
fully determined in any direction. The site consists of a subsurface scatter of lithic debitage,
ceramic sherds, and burned rocks, and an apparently intact, buried burned rock cultural feature

was detected in 1 shovel test at depths of ca. 60.0 to 65.0 cm (23.6 to 25.6 inches) below surface.
This feature was encountered in a large shovel test excavated in a high-density locus near the
northeastern site boundary from which most of the ceramic artifacts were recovered. The site
appears to be largely intact, though periodic tree harvesting and some degree of erosion may
have impacted near-surface sediments in parts of the site.
The 315.0-foot NVGD contour that represents the proposed elevation of the Lake
Columbia normal pool encircles the crest of the hill across which site 41CE390 sprawls; as such,
the central portion of site 41CE390 (about 50% of the site area) would be situated above the
proposed impoundment. As such, the central portion of the site would form an island within the
proposed Lake Columbia reservoir and stands to be subjected to shoreline impacts. The eastern
and western flanks of the site stand to be inundated by the proposed reservoir impoundment.
While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources)
on site 41CE390 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B,
and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to
determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE390 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE391

Site 41CE391 is a sparse subsurface scatter of chipped stone lithic debitage situated on
a dissected alluvial fan on the Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-111 to 7-113; Appendix D,
Figure D-4). The landform is located west of the primary Mud Creek stream channel and north of
the meandering Club Lake Branch channel and its tributaries, approximately 800.0 meters
(2,624.0 feet) southeast of the point at which FM 4218 dead-ends at a metal gate. Based on the
limited amount of lithic material recovered from the site, the occupation appears to be an
ephemeral floodplain encampment dating to an undetermined aboriginal cultural period. No
cultural features were observed, and no diagnostic artifacts were recovered from site 41CE391
during the survey effort.
The landform upon which site 41CE391 is located slopes abruptly up to the northeast and
down to the southwest, though the overall slope of the alluvial fan remnant is down toward Mud
Creek to the southeast. The landform is loosely framed on the north side by a minor, unnamed
western tributary of Mud Creek, and the Mud Creek channel proper flows about 200.0 meters
(656.0 feet) southeast of the site. Club Lake Branch forms the southern edge of the landform.
The elevation of the site ranges from about 88.4 to 89.9 meters (290.0 to 295.0 feet) amsl; as
such, the entire site is situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour corresponding to the proposed
Lake Columbia pool elevation. The site was completely covered with dense bottomland
vegetation at the time of the survey, including stunted oaks, young pine trees, holly, yaupon, and
greenbrier. This very remote area has apparently seen little use by modern humans aside from
probable hunting activities.
A total of 3 positive shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE391, and 4 additional
negative shovel tests were excavated to the north and south (Table 7-26). As such, the site
boundaries have not been fully delineated; as documented, the site measures approximately

80.0 meters (262.4 feet) east to west by 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) north to south. The 3 positive
shovel tests yielded only 6 pieces of lithic debitage, including 1 large metaquartzite flake, 2 brown
chert tertiary flakes, 1 light brown chert tertiary flake, 1 dark gray chert tertiary flake, and 1 light
red quartzite tertiary flake, from depths of 20.0 to 100.0 cm (7.9 to 39.4 inches) below surface. A
possible cultural zone at an approximate depth of 50.0 to 60.0 cm (19.7 to 23.6 inches) below
surface may be indicated. Due to a total lack of ceramic material and the overall low artifact
density, the site seems to be an ephemeral aboriginal campsite, though the full dimensions of the
site have not necessarily been delineated. No organic materials or diagnostic artifacts were
recovered from site 41CE391.
Site 41CE391 sits upon the remnants of a low-lying alluvial fan near the confluence of a
channel of Mud Creek and Club Lake Branch. Given the perennial water supply and thick
vegetation cover, the Mud Creek basin likely teamed with game animals in the past, just as it does
today, and this locality would seem to represent an ideal location for a hunting or specialized task
camp focused on harvesting floodplain resources. Very little sheet erosion appears to have taken
place on the site; if anything, the site is in an area currently exhibiting surface deposition of sandy
deposits from the higher elevation to the west and possibly via flooding of multiple local stream
channels. The varying depths at which lithic materials were recovered on the site suggest that at
least some vertical translocation of cultural materials has occurred within the thick, homogenous
sandy matrix, but the depths at which artifacts were recovered in 2 of the 3 shovel tests may
suggest the presence of a buried occupation zone ca. 50.0 to 60.0 cm (19.7 to 23.6 inches) below
surface.
Site 41CE391 likely represents an ephemeral floodplain campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the diminutive data set so far yielded by this site. The site is situated in an area that would have
provided a reliable supply of water and game for a nomadic group passing through the drainage
basin or for a task-specialized logistical camp occupied by a group with a home base elsewhere
in the basin. While the site has rendered very few artifacts to date, its deep, sandy matrix may
contain intact, buried archeological deposits. Site 41CE391 is situated entirely below the 315.0foot NVGD contour representing the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation; as such, the site
stands to be inundated by the proposed reservoir. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits
(and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE391 suggests that the site is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently

available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of
the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE391 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility
for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to
obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE392

Site 41CE392 is a small, moderate- to high-density, subsurface scatter of chipped stone
debitage located at the eastern base of a prominent floodplain hill, likely a remnant of the nearby
uplands forming the western margin of the Mud Creek valley, at the confluence of Club Lake
Branch and a currently active channel of Mud Creek (see Figure 7-106; Figures 7-114 to 7-115;
Appendix D, Figure D-4). The site is located approximately 975.0 meters (3,198 feet) eastnortheast of a metal gate at which FM 4221 dead-ends. Based on the small quantity of lithic
material recovered from the site and the lack of ceramic artifacts, the occupation likely represents
a temporary floodplain encampment occupied during an undetermined prehistoric cultural period.
No diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the site during the survey, and no cultural features
were observed on the surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated at the site.
Site 41CE392 is located on the eastern toe of a prominent hill upon which site 41CE390
is situated. The confluence of Mud Creek and Club Lake Branch is located about 75.0 meters
(246.0 feet) to the east-southeast, and the site is on the west bank of an oxbow of Club Lake
Branch. The site slopes generally down toward the creek to the east, but it is relatively flat across
most of its surface, occupying an elevation of approximately 86.9 meters (285.0 feet) amsl. Thus,
the site is situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour corresponding to the proposed Lake
Columbia pool elevation. The site is covered with dense bottomland vegetation typical of the
lower elevations within the Mud Creek drainage basin. Vegetation types include stunted oaks,
young pine trees, holly, yaupon, and greenbrier. Leaf detritus blankets the site, obscuring the
ground surface. The area shows no signs of artificial disturbances.
A total of 4 shovel tests were excavated on the site, all of which produced cultural materials
(Table 7-27). Site boundaries were delineated in all directions based on the distribution of positive
and negative shovel tests, demarcating a site measuring approximately 60.0 meters (196.8 feet)
in diameter. Sediments revealed via shovel testing consist of pale brown sand and sandy loam
extending to depths in excess of 100.0 to 112.0 cm (39.4 to 44.1 inches) below surface, extending
beyond the reach of the shovel tests. This sandy matrix contained all of the cultural materials
recovered from the site, and an underlying subsoil was not encountered anywhere on the site. A
total of 9 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered from the 4 positive shovel tests at depths ranging
from 40.0 to 80.0 cm (15.7 to 31.5 inches) below surface, with a possible occupation horizon
evident at approximately 60.0 to 80.0 cm (23.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface. Bioturbation has
undoubtedly caused some vertical translocation of material at this site, though no evidence of
surface erosion was noted during the survey.
Artifacts recovered from site 41CE392 consist of 9 pieces of lithic debitage, including
4 dark brown petrified wood tertiary flakes, 2 brown metaquartzite chunks, 1 light brown chert
tertiary flake, 1 dark gray chert tertiary flake, and 1 light red quartzite tertiary flake. No organic
materials or cultural features were observed during the recording of site 41CE392.

Site 41CE392 sits upon the eastern edge of an enormous sandy hill on the west bank of
an oxbow of Club Lake Branch near the confluence of the latter stream and Mud Creek. The
omnipresent water supply and population of game animals would have made the spot ideal for a
hunting foray or other task-specific short-term encampment. Little disturbance is evident on the
site, and this very remote locality likely sees relatively little use by modern humans. Some vertical
translocation of cultural materials may have taken place due to rodent burrowing, though
overbank flooding of nearby streams has likely contributed to the deep packets of Holocene
alluvium that are evident on the site. The nearby oxbow channel is actively cutting into the eastern
edge of the site and will eventually disturb cultural deposits, if it has not done so already, as long
as the oxbow contains an active flow. However, no cultural materials were observed in the
cutbank of the stream course.
Site 41CE392 is interpreted as an ephemeral floodplain campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the limited available data. The site is situated in an area that would have provided a reliable
supply of water and game for a nomadic group passing through the drainage basin or for a taskspecialized logistical camp occupied by a group with a nearby home base. While the site has

designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE393

Site 41CE393 is a high-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal cultural materials situated
on an upland promontory on the western valley margin of the Mud Creek valley (Figures 7-116
to 7-120; Appendix D, Figure D-4). This landform is bounded on the north by Club Lake Branch,

a major tributary of Mud Creek, and on the south by an unnamed drainage that discharges into
Club Lake Branch to the east. The site is located approximately 450.0 meters (1,476.0 feet)
southwest of a metal gate at which FM 4218 dead-ends. Based on artifacts recovered from the
site, the site is likely a single-component, Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400) hamlet.
The recovery of faunal bone from the shovel testing on site 41CE393 indicates a high potential
for organic preservation.
The landform upon which site 41CE393 is located is basically a finger of a steep upland
terrace or ridge on the western valley margin of Mud Creek formed by Club Lake Branch and an
unnamed drainage to the north and south, respectively. The elevation on the top of the upland
formation where site deposits are found ranges from 96.0 to 100.6 meters (315.0 to 330.0 feet)
amsl, which places the majority of the site along the shoreline of the proposed Lake Columbia
impoundment marked by the 315.0-foot NVGD contour. The upland ridge finger measures
approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) north to south, and the edges of the formation slope
down at an approximately 30-degree angle toward the Club Lake Branch forks. Site 41CE393
does not appear to cover the entire upland; rather, it covers only the southern portion of the finger.
A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE393, all of which contained
subsurface cultural materials (Table 7-28). Based on the distribution of positive and negative
shovel tests, the site measures about 90.0 meters (295.2 feet) north to south by 50.0 meters
(164.0 feet) east to west. Site boundaries were fully delineated to the east and south though not
to the north and west, and the site may continue farther in the latter directions. Sediments on the
site consist of pale brown to yellowish-brown fine sand overlying reddish-brown clay that occurs
at depths from 32.0 to 80.0 cm (12.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface across most of the site. The
underlying clayey substrate was encountered in most shovel tests, though it eluded detection in
1 deep shovel test in which the overlying sandy mantle continued deeper than the shovel test was
capable of penetrating at a depth of 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface. The shallower sand
deposits were generally confined to the highest elevations on the site, which suggests that
surficial erosion has been working away at the sandy mantle. Areas of shallow sands over sterile
clays were also observed downslope of the site.
A two-track road runs north to south just downhill from and east of site 41CE393. The
only observable land use at the time of the survey was the planting of pine trees to the west of
the site but not within its boundaries. Due to a general lack of climax vegetation on the site, it is
possible that the entire ridge finger was cleared for pine planting but never planted. A few pines
grow along the northeastern and southern site boundaries. Other vegetation includes short
grasses, every manner of brier and bramble, and a lone cedar tree in the approximate center of
the site.
Of the total of 7 shovel tests excavated on the site, all yielded cultural material. From
these 7 positive shovel tests, a total of 67 ceramic sherds (the largest collection of ceramic sherds
from any of the sites documented during this survey), 3 burned clay fragments, 4 faunal bone
fragments, and 2 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered. The majority of the ceramic materials
collected from the site occurred at relatively shallow depths of 0.0 to 40.0 cm (0.0 to 15.7 inches)
below surface, though 1 shovel test yielded a dense concentration of 15 ceramic sherds from
depths of 70.0 to 80.0 cm (27.6 to 31.5 inches) below surface. The ceramic assemblage consists

entirely of grog-tempered ceramic sherds, including 56 plain body sherds, 2 plain rim sherds, and
9 decorated sherds. Among the 9 decorated sherds were 1 horizontal engraved rim sherd, 1 toolpunctated body sherd, 2 incised body sherds, 1 Poynor Engraved rim sherd with a hint of red
pigment within the engraved lines, 1 horizontal brushed body sherd from a Bullard Brushed jar,
and 1 brushed-incised-punctated body sherd. Forty-four percent of the decorated sherds from
site 41CE393 exhibit a brushed motif, which suggests that the Caddoan component dates to well
after A.D. 1200 in the Middle Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1200 to 1400). Three pieces of burned
clay were also recovered from 1 shovel test. Four calcined faunal bone fragments were collected
from depths of 0.0 to 60.0 cm (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below surface, indicating that site deposits have
good potential for organic preservation. Only 2 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered from the
site, 1 of which is a tertiary flake of gray chert, the other of which is a fragment of sugary brown
metaquartzite. No cultural features were discovered during the recording of site 41CE393,
although organic, stained sediment deposits were observed in the upper 30.0 cm (11.8 inches) of
1 shovel test (ST DB153), and the high density of subsurface artifacts from single shovel tests
strongly suggests the presence of intact, subsurface activity areas and/or cultural features.
While some amount of vertical translocation of material has likely occurred due to rodent
burrowing, horizontal translocation of artifacts is more difficult to define. The uniform color and
texture of the culture-bearing, pale brown sand on site 41CE393 makes it difficult to determine
how sediment matrices have moved on the site through time. One possibility is that sand deposits

Chapter 7.0: Results of Archeological Survey

have moved downslope, deflating the higher elevations and thickening deposits along the break
in slope at the edges of the ridge finger. This description of events would explain the deeper soil
along the site boundaries and the thinner culture-bearing soils at the top.
Site 41CE393 is a clearly definable Middle Caddoan (ca. A.D. 200 to 1400) upland hamlet.
The site contains a markedly high density of artifacts, especially considering its relatively small
size, and the site appears to have some potential to contain intact buried cultural features and/or
activity areas. The presence of faunal bone indicates that the site has excellent potential for
preserved organic remains conducive to radiocarbon dating. The majority of site 41CE393 is
situated above the proposed 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation; as such, the site stands to be
subjected to shoreline impacts associated with the proposed reservoir impoundment.
Furthermore, the eastern extremity of the site dips below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour and would
be subject to inundation. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack
of historic-age resources) on site 41CE393 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity
of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the
NRHP. Site 41CE393 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and
for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

7.28

SITE 41CE394

Site 41CE394 is a multiple-component site consisting of a possible historic-age industrial
facility consisting of 4 circular, bermed depressions and a surficial scatter of historic-age artifacts,
plus 2 shallowly buried aboriginal artifacts (see Figure 7-99; Figures 7-121 to 7-122; Appendix D,
Figure D-4). The site is located on the spine of an upland ridge remnant that protrudes from the
western valley margin onto the Mud Creek floodplain north of Club Lake Branch. The site is
located approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) southeast of a metal gate at which FM 4218
dead-ends. Aboriginal artifacts found on the site indicate a possible Early Ceramic component
(ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800) judging from a single sandy paste body sherd. The historic-age
component consists of 4 circular, berm-edged depressions of unknown function. The lack of
diagnostic historic artifacts leaves many unanswered questions as to the date of construction and
function of these features.
The upland ridge on which site 41CE394 is located is bounded on its northeast side by an
active, western meander of Mud Creek. Club Lake Branch bounds the ridge to the south. A dirt
roadway runs northwest to southeast along the spine of the ridge finger, passing through the
middle of the site. The western meander of Mud Creek can be seen to the northeast about
80.0 meters (262.4 feet) away from the roadway that traverses the site. Sediments on the site
consist of shallow, fine loamy sand that is much shallower at the top of the ridge than below on
the slopes to the northeast and southwest. Dense clays are present immediately below these
shallow sands at depths ranging from 13.0 to 45.0 cm (5.1 to 17.7 inches) below surface.
Prehistoric cultural materials, consisting of a single ceramic sherd and a piece of lithic debitage,
were recovered from depths of 0.0 to 20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface in the shallow

sandy deposits. The site was covered with small plantation pine trees and typical pineywoods
understory at the time of the survey. A fence line runs east to west just north of the site, and a
small hunting cabin stands about 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) north of the site.
Site 41CE394 is situated in a relatively flat area along the spine of the ridge remnant, and
elevations across the site are relatively flat, averaging about 95.1 meters (312.0 feet) amsl; as
such, the site is situated below the proposed 315.0-foot NVGD pool elevation. A total of 5 shovel
tests were excavated on site 41CE394 (Table 7-29). The location of shovel tests yielding
prehistoric artifacts and the positions of the depressions establish a site size of approximately
100.0 meters (328.0 feet) northwest to southeast by 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) northeast to
southwest. Subsurface cultural material was retrieved from only 2 shovel tests, including 1 piece
of lithic debitage and a single aboriginal ceramic sherd. Both specimens were recovered from
depths of 0.0 to 20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface. The lithic artifact is a light brown chert
tertiary flake, and the ceramic sherd is a fine-grained, sandy paste sherd attributed to an Early
Ceramic component. Historic-age materials observed on the modern ground surface, but not
collected, include brown and clear glass shards, common round metal nails, corrugated metal
sheeting fragments, a running board from an automobile (apparently 1930s vintage), and a
partially buried segment of cast iron piping running from 1 of the depressions. No subsurface
historic-age artifacts were found during shovel testing; however, the cast iron pipe was dug up to
determine its placement in relation to 1 of the circular depressions. The 4 circular depressions
range from 1.5 to 2.5 meters (4.9 to 8.2 feet) in diameter and are 50.0 to 80.0 cm (19.7 to
31.5 inches) deep. Earthen berms line the circumference of each depression, probably formed
from sediments removed during the excavation of these features. The historic-age cultural
materials and depressions suggest that the site was used for an industrial function, though the
nature of this activity and the date at which it occurred is uncertain.
Due to the steep slope down toward Mud Creek to the northeast, much of the sandy
sediment that presumably once blanketed the site has presumably washed downhill. The shallow

deposits remaining at the apex of the ridge on the site seem to bear this out. Erosion has likely
had some impact on the prehistoric component of site 41CE394, though the aboriginal component
documented on the site to date is too ephemeral to warrant much discussion. In any case, erosion
has apparently had little effect on the circular, berm-edged depressions found on the site.
Site 41CE394 is a multiple component site consisting of a potential historic-age industrial
facility of some kind and an ephemeral aboriginal Early Ceramic component represented by only
2 artifacts located on the spine of an upland ridge remnant that protrudes from the western valley
margin of Mud Creek. The recovery of only 1 aboriginal ceramic sherd and a single piece of lithic
debitage from near-surface contexts in shallow sandy sediments indicates either an ephemeral
aboriginal settlement or heavy post-depositional disturbances. The historic-age component on
site 41CE394 is represented by 4 cultural features and an associated artifact scatter. These
features are large, shallow, excavated depressions rimmed with earthen berms that were possibly
utilized for some industrial function. Other historic-age artifacts, including glass shards, a
segment of cast iron piping running from 1 of the depressions, and a 1930s-model automobile
running board, are present on the modern ground surface, though the presence of this automobile
part does little to help date the historic-age occupation of the site.
Site 41CE394 is situated entirely below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour and thus stands to
be inundated by the proposed impoundment of Lake Columbia. The eligibility status of site
41CE394 cannot be determined based on available information. The aboriginal Early Ceramic
component on the site is likely ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D as relatively
little potential appears to exist for intact archeological deposits within the disturbed, shallow,
sandy sediments in which the 2 aboriginal artifacts were found. Furthermore, due to the antiquity
of the aboriginal artifacts, the prehistoric component of site 41CE394 is likely ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C. Insufficient data are currently available to
assess the eligibility of the historic-age component for inclusion in the NRHP under any of the
NRHP criteria. Further testing and/or archival research would be necessary to obtain sufficient
data to evaluate the site’s historic-age component.

7.29

SITE 41CE395

Site 41CE395 is the remnants of a historic-age bridge that once served as a crossing over
the western channel of Mud Creek off of FM 4923 (Figures 7-123 to 7-127; Appendix D, Figure D11). The bridge remains are located on both banks of Mud Creek approximately 200.0 meters
(656.0 feet) north of SH 135 east of a bend in the FM 4923 right-of-way. The bridge appears to
have been a fairly small structure that was probably washed out during a flood surge at an
undetermined point in the past and was never replaced. No cultural materials contemporaneous
with the time the bridge was in use, other than structural components of the bridge itself, were
found on the modern ground surface or in either of 2 shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
structure (Table 7-30).
Remnants of the bridge structure exist on both banks of Mud Creek as well as within the
stream course itself. The natural first terraces of Mud Creek at the bridge crossing are relatively
flat and were less than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) higher than the water surface at the time of the survey.
The elevation of the second terrace, on which the approach berms were built, is approximately

93.0 meters (305.0 feet) amsl, well below the 315.0-foot NVGD elevation of the proposed Lake
Columbia pool. The second terraces, from which the approach ramps of the bridge were built,
are approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) above the stream course in elevation. Vegetation on the
site consists of short grasses and briers with an occasional pine tree within a few meters of where
the bridge was once situated.
Extant bridge elements on site 41CE395 include approach berms, steel I-beam footings
on both sides on the creek, steel scrap strewn downstream from the original bridge location, and
concrete piers that have eroded from the creek banks and tumbled down into the creek. The
earthen approach ramps are curbed on their northwest sides with cut sandstone blocks. Most of
these curb structures have been washed away by historical flood events. No evidence of the
curbing remains on the downstream side of the approach ramps. As no positive shovel tests
resulted from the survey, site size was determined by the location of the bridge’s structural
elements. This delineation produced a site size of approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) north to
south and 50.0 meters (164.0 feet) east to west. Examination of historical USGS topographic
maps dating to 1937, 1943, 1968, and 1976 shows that no formal roadways traversed Mud Creek
at this location; as such, this bridge may have been a small, privately constructed and owned
structure (NETR 2015).
Site 41CE395 is a collection of historic-age bridge remnants over the western channel of
Mud Creek. The bridge remnant is situated well below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour and therefore
will be inundated by the proposed impoundment of Lake Columbia. The NRHP eligibility of the
remnants of this historic-age bridge is undetermined based on survey-level data. The structural
collapse caused by a flood surge at some point in the past has severely impacted the integrity of
this structure, but insufficient information is available to assess its eligibility under any of the
4 NRHP criteria. Site 41CE395 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing and archival research would be necessary
to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE396

Site 41CE396 is a sparse, subsurface lithic scatter located on the northern edge of a
sprawling upland or old alluvial terrace remnant that forms an enormous upland lobe in the vicinity
of the confluence of Mud Creek and West Mud Creek (Figures 7-128 to 7-130; Appendix D,
Figure D-11). This upland formation appears to have been created by a relic stream channel

of the widely meandering course of Mud Creek. The site is located approximately 330.0 meters
(1,082.4 feet) north-northeast of the southeastern end of East Twin Peaks Trail, a private road
that terminates in the center of the large upland landform on which the site is situated. Based on
the small quantity and limited variety of cultural material recovered, the site appears to be a shortterm aboriginal encampment dating to an undetermined prehistoric time period. No cultural
features or diagnostic artifacts were observed on the site.
Site 41CE396 is situated on the northern edge of a large, roughly circular, upland landform
that appears to have been created by a meandering channel of Mud Creek. The relic creek
course now forms a low wetland surrounding the landform. The current stream course of West
Mud Creek, which flows into Mud Creek proper, is located north of the northern wetland area and
joins Mud Creek proper approximately 275.0 meters (902.0 feet) east of site 41CE396. Elevations
across the site range from 94.5 to 97.6 meters (310.0 to 320.0 feet) amsl. Most of the site is
situated above the 315.0-foot NVGD contour associated with the proposed Lake Columbia pool
elevation, though the easternmost extremity of the site dips down onto the floodplain of West Mud
Creek below the 315.0-foot NVGD elevation of the proposed Lake Columbia normal pool. The
site is located at the edge of an open cattle pasture, and the dominant vegetation on site 41CE396
is short grasses. Low areas nearest the creeks and wetlands are fringed with large stands of pine
trees.
A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE396, 3 of which yielded a small
collection of subsurface artifacts, including 1 piece of lithic debitage per shovel test, for a total of
3 lithic flakes (Table 7-31). Two of the shovel tests excavated on the site were terminated at the
sterile clay substratum at a depth of 48.0 to 80.0 cm (18.9 to 31.5 inches) below surface, though
the overlying mantle of pale brown to light yellowish-brown sand extended deeper than shovel
tests were capable of penetrating in the remaining shovel tests (often 100.0 cm [39.4 inches]
below surface). Based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests, site 41CE396
forms a thin, elongated band along the northern edge of the upland landform, measuring
approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) east to west by 25.0 meters (82.0 feet) north to south.
The site boundaries were not fully delineated in any direction.
Three chipped stone lithic artifacts, including 1 dark brown metaquartzite tertiary flake,
1 light brown chert tertiary flake, and 1 light red chert tertiary flake, were recovered from 3 shovel
tests at depths ranging from 0.0 to 60.0 cm (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below surface. Bioturbation,
erosion, and land-clearing practices have all had some impact on the upper 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to
15.7 inches) of sediment deposits on the site, though it is difficult to discern the integrity of more
deeply buried materials based on the limited number of artifacts recovered. No organic materials,
temporally diagnostic artifacts, or cultural features were observed or collected from site 41CE396
during the survey effort.
Site 41CE396 is interpreted as an ephemeral floodplain campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the limited available data. The site is situated in an area that would have provided a reliable
supply of water and game for a nomadic group passing through the drainage basin or for a taskspecialized logistical camp occupied by a group with a nearby home base. While the site has

rendered very few artifacts to date, its deep, sandy matrix may contain intact, buried archeological
deposits. Site 41CE396 is situated predominantly along the shoreline of the proposed Lake
Columbia reservoir; as such, the site would be subject to shoreline impacts associated with the
proposed reservoir impoundment. The eastern extremity of the documented site area extends
below the 315.0-foot NVGD elevation of the proposed normal pool and would be subject to
inundation by the proposed reservoir. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and
concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE396 suggests that the site is ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to
evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under
Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE396 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient

SITE 41CE397

Site 41CE397 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of lithic artifacts located on a sandy rise
at the southeastern edge of an enormous upland on the western valley margin of the Mud Creek
drainage basin (Figures 7-131 to 7-133; Appendix D, Figure D-11). This upland formation
appears to have been created by a relic stream channel of the widely meandering course of Mud
Creek. Artifacts recovered from the site consist of only 2 pieces of lithic debitage found at depths
of 0.0 to 60.0 cm (0.0 to 23.6 inches) below surface from 2 closely spaced shovel tests. The
modern ground surface on the site is marked by of a number of haphazard piles of sand, indicative
of heavy disturbance by earth-moving equipment, and it is therefore likely that the integrity of

archeological deposits has been impacted and that the 2 artifacts found on the site are not in
primary context.
Site 41CE397 is located at the southeastern edge of a vast upland lobe carved from the
western valley margin of the Mud Creek drainage basin by West Mud Creek and an old oxbow of
Mud Creek proper. To the south of the site is a low area, currently a well developed wetland, that
appears to be the relic Mud Creek channel. The current stream course of West Mud Creek, which
discharges into Mud Creek proper, flows along the northern side of the landform and joins Mud
Creek approximately 510.0 meters (1,672.8 feet) north of site 41CE397. The site is situated at
approximately 99.1 meters (325.0 feet) amsl, somewhat above the proposed pool elevation of
315.0 feet NVGD associated within the proposed Lake Columbia impoundment. Vegetation within
the disturbed site consists entirely of invasive species. The area has been cleared of natural
climax vegetation and a great deal of earth-moving has been conducted. Vegetation includes
every imaginable manner of brier, including greenbrier, dewberry, and cat’s claw acacia. Surface
visibility was nearly 0%.
A total of 3 shovels test were excavated on the site, 2 of which produced subsurface
artifacts, with additional negative shovel tests excavated in the surrounding area to delineate site
boundaries (Table 7-32). The sandy alluvial sediments that contain the cultural component
extended to depths of 55.0 to 105 cm (21.7 to 41.3 inches) or more below surface. A reddishbrown clay subsoil was encountered in 2 of the 3 shovel tests excavated within the site boundaries
at depths of 50.0 and 95.0 cm (19.7 to 37.4 inches) below surface, though the sandy mantle
continued in the third shovel test to a depth of 105.0 cm (41.3 inches) below surface with no signs
of the clay substratum. Artifacts recovered from the 2 positive shovel tests consist of a single
piece of lithic debitage from each of the tests, both of which are brown chert tertiary flakes. The
flakes were found at depths of 0.0 to 20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches) and 40.0 to 60.0 cm (15.7 to
23.6 inches) below surface in the 2 shovel tests, which were located about 10.0 meters (32.8 feet)
apart. The site boundaries were fully delineated by the distribution of positive and negative shovel
tests, outlining a site area measuring approximately 25.0 meters (82.0 feet) in diameter. Landclearing activities have dramatically impacted the sediment deposits of site 41CE397. Only the
deepest pockets of sand appear to have any chance of being undisturbed. No cultural features,
diagnostic artifacts, or organic materials were observed or collected from site 41CE397. Due to
the extremely low density of artifacts at the site, it is difficult to say much about the aboriginal
occupation of the site.
Site 41CE397 is interpreted as an ephemeral floodplain campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the limited available data. The site is situated in an area that would have provided a reliable
supply of water and game for a nomadic group passing through the drainage basin or for a taskspecialized logistical camp occupied by a group with a nearby home base. While the site has
rendered very few artifacts to date and surficial sediments have been disturbed by earth-moving
activities, the bottom of the sandy matrix that contains the cultural component was not reached
via shovel testing, and the deep, sandy matrix may contain intact, buried archeological deposits.

SITE 41CE398

Site 41CE398 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal chipped stone lithic
artifacts located on the northern slope of a high, sandy alluvial terrace jutting from the western
valley margin of the Mud Creek drainage basin (Figures 7-134 to 7-136; Appendix D, Figure D7). The site is located just south of a western meander of the Mud Creek stream course
approximately 600.0 meters (1,968.0 feet) west-southwest of Twin Lakes. A total of 4 pieces of
lithic debitage were recovered from the site at depths of 0.0 to 80.0 cm (0.0 to 31.5 inches) below
surface. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface
or within any of the shovel tests excavated at the site. Site 41CE398 appears to be an ephemeral
floodplain aboriginal encampment that dates to an unknown prehistoric cultural period.
Site 41CE398 is located at the northern toe slope of a high, sandy terrace that forms part
of the western Mud Creek valley margin. The landform is bounded by a meander of Mud Creek
on its northern and eastern sides and by Lavender Branch, a tributary of Mud Creek, to the south.
The confluence of Mud Creek and Lavender Branch is located about 530.0 meters (1,738.4 feet)
southeast of the site. The site is situated on the upper slopes of the landform and slopes down
abruptly toward the creek to the north approximately 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) away. A low wetland
is situated approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) northwest of the site. Site 41CE398 ranges from
about 91.5 to 97.6 meters (300.0 to 320.0 feet) amsl; thus, the site is situated largely below the
315.0-foot NVGD contour corresponding to the proposed Lake Columbia pool elevation, though
the southern boundary of the site may be situated along the proposed shoreline. The site is
located in an open cattle pasture fringed with pines, Ashe juniper, and oaks nearest the creek.

Typical wetland vegetation abounds in the low, wet area northwest of the site. The site itself is
covered with short grasses, reducing ground surface visibility to nearly 0%. The area shows no
signs of artificial disturbances other than vegetation-clearing activities and a two-track road near
the creek to the north.
A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE398, 4 of which each yielded 1 piece
of lithic debitage (Table 7-33). Sediments on the site consist of deep, loose, pale to reddishbrown sands that seem to be well drained overlying culturally sterile, red clay. At least 2 of the
shovel tests encountered dense red clay at a depth of 90.0 cm (35.4 inches) below surface,
whereas the remaining shovel tests either failed to fully penetrate the culture-bearing sandy
deposits or were terminated within a possibly transitional sandy clay at depths of 90.0 to 100.0 cm
(35.4 to 39.4 inches) below surface. A transitional sediment between the 2 primary strata,
consisting of a sandy matrix with hematitic inclusions, was observed in 1 shovel test, suggesting
that sterile clay may be present not much deeper than 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface in
this shovel test. The lithic artifacts, which consist of 1 reddish-brown petrified wood tertiary flake,
1 brown quartzite tertiary flake, 1 light brown chert flake, and 1 dark gray chert tertiary flake, were
retrieved from 2 seemingly discrete depths. Two of the artifacts were recovered from 0.0 to
20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches), while the other 2 came from between 60.0 and 80.0 cm (23.6 to
31.5 inches) below surface. The distribution of positive and negative shovel tests outlines a
relatively small site area measuring approximately 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) in diameter. Based
on the limited available information, site 41CE398 may contain 2 separate cultural components
at these respective depths; alternately, it is entirely possible that rodent burrowing and other
sources of bioturbation have resulted in some vertical movement of artifacts throughout the
sediment profile. No cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, or organic remains were observed on
the site.

Site 41CE398 is interpreted as an ephemeral floodplain campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the limited available data. The site is situated in an area that would have provided a reliable
supply of water and game for a hunter-gatherer group passing through the drainage basin or for
a task-specialized logistical camp occupied by a more sedentary group with a nearby home base.
While the site has rendered very few artifacts to date, its deep, sandy matrix may contain intact,
buried archeological deposits. Site 41CE398 is situated largely below the 315.0-foot NVGD

SITE 41CE399

Site 41CE399 is a substantial probable Late Archaic to Early Ceramic period (ca.
3000 B.C. to A.D. 800) campsite located on the north bank and associated terraces of Bear Creek,
a western tributary of Mud Creek (Figures 7-137 to 7-143; Appendix D, Figure D-9). The landform
upon which the site is situated is a terrace near a meander of the Bear Creek channel that slopes
gently down toward the creek. The site is located approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) east
of a wooden bridge that crosses Bear Creek. Based on the high density and large numbers of
cultural materials recovered from the site, including lithic debitage, burned rock, a single Goose
Creek Plain ceramic sherd, a Gary-like dart point, and charcoal, site 41CE399 appears to
represent a base camp or other substantial occupation. A buried burned rock pavement or
cooking feature was documented in 1 of the shovel tests excavated on the site, which strongly
suggests that archeological deposits on the site are largely intact.
Elevations across site 41CE399 range from about 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) amsl along the
southern edge of the site to about 103.7 meters (340.0 feet) amsl at the northern boundary. As
such, approximately the southern 25% of the site would be situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD
elevation that corresponds to the proposed Lake Columbia normal pool, and the remainder of the
site would be located along the proposed reservoir shoreline. A total of 17 shovel tests were
excavated on the site (Table 7-34), and the boundaries of the site have been fully delineated in
all directions. The southern boundary of the site is effectively formed by the channel of Bear
Creek, though the opposite side of Bear Creek was not surveyed. The northern, eastern, and
western boundaries were delineated based on the results of positive and negative shovel tests,
outlining a site measuring about 125.0 meters (410.0 feet) north to south by 75.0 meters
(246.0 feet) east to west.
The landform on which site 41CE399 is situated has undergone some degree of erosion
in some areas, though the area containing the deepest archeological deposits does not seem to

have been so affected. The higher elevations in the northern portion of the site exhibit moderately
deep culture-bearing sediment deposits within a sandy loam matrix overlying culturally sterile,
reddish-brown clay at depths of 30.0 to 70.0 cm (11.8 to 27.6 inches) below surface. This
underlying clay subsoil is exposed on the modern ground surface along the western boundary of
the site. Along the eastern periphery, clay deposits were encountered at ca. 90.0 cm (35.4 inches)
below surface. The deepest deposits encountered on the site occur in proximity to Bear Creek
near the southern site boundary. In the latter area, shovel testing was conducted to a maximum
depth of 120.0 cm (47.2 inches) below surface without coming upon the underlying clay substrate.
Cultural materials were recovered from depths ranging from 0.0 to 120.0 cm (0.0 to
47.2 inches) below surface from a sediment matrix composed of brown sandy loam overlying the
culturally sterile clays. Lithic debitage was ubiquitous across the entire site, but the vast majority
of chipped stone debris was found within 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) of the southern site boundary.
Based on the distribution of artifacts and the lack of any subsurface cultural materials on a small
peninsula south of the site cradled within the bend of the nearby creek channel, it is possible that
the channel of Bear Creek flowed straight west to east across the documented southern site
boundary at the time of the aboriginal occupation. In addition to a Gary-like dart point, a discrete,
intact, subsurface burned rock pavement or cooking feature was discovered along the southern
boundary of the site in ST RC217 at a depth of approximately 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below
surface. This area nearest the creek shows signs of sediment deposition, presumably from
overbank flooding of Bear Creek; during more recent times, though, erosion of sediments to the
west and north of the site may have resulted in some redeposition of sediments from upslope
portions of the site. Aside from the areas of highest concentration near the creek, a diffuse,
associated lithic scatter continues upslope.
Aside from the geomorphological processes described above, site 41CE399 appears to
have experienced relatively few disturbances. Some level of vegetation-clearing has been
conducted to make the property useful for cattle ranching, and bioturbation from rodent burrowing
and tree root growth, together with some degree of erosion at the higher elevations within the site,
have undoubtedly resulted in some impacts. The lower elevations of the site have probably
received soils eroding down from the higher elevations as well as from periodic overbank flooding.
Climax vegetation on the site consists of cedar trees along the banks of Bear Creek. Short
grasses prevail across the rest of the site.
The artifact assemblage recovered from site 41CE399 consists of 40 pieces of lithic
debitage, 2 pieces of burned sandstone, 1 sandy paste ceramic sherd, and 1 reworked Gary-like
dart point fragment. The lithic debitage consists of 5 gray chert tertiary flakes, 3 brown chert
tertiary flakes, 3 light brown tertiary flakes, 4 red chert tertiary flakes, 1 light brown tertiary flake,
3 red quartzite tertiary flakes, 1 brown quartzite tertiary flake, 3 brown metaquartzite tertiary
flakes, 1 dark brown metaquartzite tertiary flake, 1 dark brown petrified wood tertiary flake,
5 pieces of brown metaquartzite shatter, 3 pieces of red metaquartzite shatter, 3 pieces of dark
brown petrified wood shatter, and 4 pieces of gray chert shatter. Lithic debitage from shovel tests
excavated in close proximity to the creek (i.e., within ca. 20.0 meters [65.6 feet]) was retrieved
from approximately 40.0 to 120.0 cm (15.7 to 47.2 inches) below surface. There appear to be
1 or more possible lenses within this span of depths containing higher densities of cultural

material, though these possible buried occupation horizons seem to be buried at different depths
in different areas of the site and could not be effectively distinguished based on survey-level
information. A reworked Gary-like dart point fragment, a projectile point style prevalent during the
Middle and Late Archaic periods, was recovered from 1 shovel test (ST RC214) near the creek at
a depth of 40.0 to 60.0 cm (15.7 to 23.6 inches) below surface. This shovel test was expanded
to approximately 50.0 by 70.0 cm (19.7 by 27.6 inches) in size to provide a wider window on the
sediment strata and produced a large number of cultural materials, including the dart point
fragment, lithic debitage, and burned rocks, from throughout the entire sediment profile. A single
Goose Creek Plain (var. unspecified) sherd was recovered from 1 shovel test (ST DB210) at a
depth of 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. Goose Creek Plain pottery is
diagnostic of the Early Ceramic period in East Texas. Due to the comparable depths of recovery
of the Early Ceramic period ceramic sherd and the Gary-like dart point fragment, albeit from
different shovel tests, a Late Archaic association for the Gary-like dart point fragment is preferred
over a Middle Archaic assignment.
One buried burned rock feature was encountered in a shovel test (ST RC217) near the
southwestern site boundary at a depth of 50.0 cm (19.7 inches) below surface, immediately
overlying the transition between the cultural deposits in the overlying sand sediments and the
clayey substratum. This shovel test was expanded to approximately 50.0 by 50 cm (19.7 by
19.7 inches) in size to reveal more of the feature. This feature, possibly a burned rock pavement
or cooking feature, was cleaned off with small hand tools to expose the sandstone elements. At
least 2 of the rocks appeared to have been heat-fractured in situ, suggesting that the feature is
relatively intact. Lithic debitage was observed within the matrix of sand and burned rocks that
comprise the feature, but the cultural materials comprising the feature were left in place and
reburied to facilitate relocating the feature in the future. No organic remains, such as charcoal or
faunal bone, were observed in the portion of the feature examined, though a charcoal sample was
observed, but not collected, at a depth of 100.0 cm (39.4 inches) below surface in 1 shovel test
(ST JG120).
Site 41CE399 is interpreted as a fairly substantial Late Archaic to Early Ceramic period
(ca.3000 B.C. to A.D. 800) campsite situated on the northern bank of Bear Creek, a major tributary
of Mud Creek. While extensive erosion of the Holocene sandy mantle is evident in all directions
surrounding the site, the Holocene alluvial package within the site area is relatively deep and
appears to be largely intact. The site contains large quantities of chipped stone lithic debitage,
diagnostic Goose Creek Plain pottery, and a Gary-like dart point. Whereas Gary points are
considered diagnostic of a fairly broad swath of aboriginal prehistory in Texas, spanning the
Middle to Late Archaic periods, a Late Archaic period association for the Gary-like dart point on
site 41CE399 is preferred as it occurs at comparable depths below surface as an Early Ceramic
period ceramic sherd. The presence of an intact, subsurface burned rock feature testifies to the
possible integrity of archeological deposits on site 41CE399, and site conditions may be suitable
for organic preservation based on the observation of a piece of charcoal in 1 shovel test. Due to
the relative scarcity of intact Late Archaic to Early Ceramic period sites in the region, especially
Early Ceramic sites that are not overprinted by subsequent Caddoan settlements, site 41CE399
is likely eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D and for designation as an SAL based
on its research potential; however, insufficient information is currently available to fully evaluate

264

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

the potential significance of the site. The southernmost portion of the site, which appears to
contain the deepest and most intact archeological deposits, is situated below the 315.0-foot
NVGD contour that represents the proposed extent of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir; as
such, this portion of the site stands to be inundated by the proposed reservoir impoundment. The
remainder of the site lies above the elevation of the proposed impoundment and would be subject
to shoreline impacts. Site 41CE399 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient
data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE400

Site 41CE400 is a sparse surface and subsurface scatter of chipped stone lithic debris, a
chipped stone biface, and groundstone tools located on the western valley margin of the Mud
Creek drainage basin (Figures 7-144 to 7-148; Appendix D, Figure D-9). The site is located
approximately 600.0 meters (1,968.0 feet) east-southeast of a private property line at which
FM 4910 dead ends. The site sprawls across the toe slopes of a high terrace along the western
margin of the Mud Creek watershed below a modern mobile home situated at the edge of the
nearby uplands. Based on the artifacts recovered, site 41CE400 appears to represent the
remains of an aboriginal encampment. Erosion has been extensive on the site, very little of the
Holocene sediment matrix that likely contained the cultural component remains in situ, and most
of the artifacts recovered from the site were exposed on the modern ground surface. No cultural
features, temporally diagnostic artifacts, or organic materials were observed on the modern
ground surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated on the site.
Site 41CE400 is located on the eastern toe slope of a high terrace at the western valley
margin of the broad Mud Creek floodplain. The currently active western channel of Mud Creek
flows approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) east of the site along the base of the terrace
structure. An unnamed tributary of Mud Creek flows eastwards along the southern boundary of
the site. The site area slopes down gradually to the east and south toward Mud Creek and the
unnamed tributary, respectively, and elevations on site 41CE400 range from approximately
96.0 to 103.7 meters (315.0 to 340.0 feet) amsl. The approximate eastern boundary of the site is
situated along the 315.0-foot NVGD contour that corresponds to the proposed Lake Columbia
pool elevation; as such, the site would be situated along the shoreline of the proposed reservoir.
The majority of the site is covered with short grasses that obscure ground surface visibility in
some areas, and cedar and pine trees fringe the tributary to the south. Ground surface visibility
was generally quite good, ranging from 50 to 100% in the areas below the trailer house in the
northern half of the site. The site shows signs of artificial disturbances, mostly the results of landclearing on steep slopes that appears to have facilitated erosion of surficial sediments.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated on site 41CE400, 3 of which each produced
1 piece of lithic debitage from shallow depths of 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface
(Table 7-35). Sediments on the site consist of loose, pale brown sand and sandy loam that seem
to be well drained. These Holocene sediments are quite shallow along the western site boundary,
and the underlying reddish- to yellowish-brown, culturally sterile clay subsoil is exposed on the
modern ground surface in some areas. Based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel

tests and the locations of the stone tools found on the modern ground surface, the site measures
approximately 400.0 meters (1,312.0 feet) northeast to southwest by 125.0 meters (410.0 feet)
northwest to southeast. Only 1 cultural zone was discernable due to the homogenous nature of
the loose, shallow sandy sediments present on the site. Bioturbation has undoubtedly caused
some vertical translocation of materials, and evidence of massive surface erosion was noted
during the survey. The Holocene sediments that contain the cultural materials on this site have
been eroded away across most of the site, and all of the shovel tests excavated on the site
reached the culturally sterile clay substratum that underlies the sandy culture-bearing matrix. In
most of the shovel tests, clay was encountered at depths of 25.0 to 50.0 cm (9.8 to 19.7 inches)
below surface, though a few shovel tests encountered clay as deep as 75.0 to 80.0 cm (29.5 to
31.5 inches) below surface.
All of the subsurface cultural material found on the site, consisting of 3 pieces of lithic
debitage, was recovered from depths of 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface in a
tight cluster of shovel tests excavated near the southern end of the site; however, the majority of
artifacts were collected from the modern ground surface. Ground surface visibility was generally
good, and 3 groundstone tools, including a mano, a metate, and a pitted nutting stone; a chipped
stone biface; and 2 pieces of lithic debitage, were collected from the modern ground surface. The

3 pieces of lithic debitage recovered from shovel tests consist of 1 dark brown petrified wood
tertiary flake and 2 light brown chert tertiary flakes. Artifacts collected from the modern ground
surface consist of 2 brown chert flakes, 1 early-stage biface of brown chert, 1 sandstone nutting
stone, 1 sandstone metate, and 1 sandstone mano.
Site 41CE400 is interpreted as the remains of an aboriginal campsite occupied during an
undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest a preceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based on
the limited available data. While the diversity of stone tool forms on the site suggests that site
41CE400 may have been a relatively substantial encampment, massive erosion and land-clearing
activities have profoundly affected the integrity of the site. The remnant Holocene-age sandy
sediments that contain the cultural materials have been scoured from much of the site, and
deposits that remain are relatively shallow. The eastern boundary of site 41CE400 abuts the
315.0-foot NVGD elevation of the proposed normal pool, though none of the site extends below
the elevation of the proposed reservoir impoundment; as such, the site would be situated along
the proposed reservoir’s shoreline. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and
concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site 41CE400 suggests that the site is ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to
evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under
Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE400 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient
data to evaluate the site’s significance.

7.35

SITE 41CE401

Site 41CE401 is a low-density, subsurface scatter of aboriginal chipped stone lithic debris
located on the Mud Creek floodplain about 250.0 meters (820.0 feet) west of the primary creek
channel and approximately 750.0 meters (2,460.0 feet) northwest of the proposed Lake Columbia
dam (Figures 7-149 to 7-151; Appendix D, Figure D-2). The site is situated at the distal end of a
broad alluvial fan produced by deposition of alluvial sediments from a series of minor, intermittent
tributaries along the western margin of the Mud Creek valley. The property on which the site is
located has been extensively landscaped by the landowner, resulting in moderate to extensive
impacts to near-surface sediments on various parts of the alluvial fan landform. Artifacts
recovered from this site consist of 3 pieces of lithic debitage found at depths of 80.0 to 100.0 cm
(31.5 to 39.4 inches) below surface. The site is situated in an open cattle pasture, and nearsurface sediments exhibit signs of heavy disturbance by earth-moving equipment; however, the
3 pieces of debitage were found well below the maximum perceived depth of disturbance. Based
on the small quantity of lithic material recovered, the site appears to represent the remains of an
ephemeral, short-term floodplain encampment. No cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, or
organic materials were observed within any of the shovel tests excavated during the recording of
the site.
Site 41CE401 is situated at the distal end of a broad alluvial fan on the Mud Creek
floodplain. A total of 3 shovel tests were excavated within the site, 2 of which were positive, and
additional negative shovel tests were excavated beyond the documented site area (Table 7-36).

Sediments observed in shovel tests consist of brown to dark brown sandy loam extending to the
maximum depth of the shovel tests at 108.0 to 130.0 cm (42.5 to 51.2 inches) below surface.
Additional shovel tests were excavated in all directions but failed to produce any additional cultural
material, effectively delineating the boundaries of site 41CE401 to a limited area measuring about
30.0 meters (98.4 feet) in diameter. None of the shovel tests excavated in the vicinity completely
penetrated the overlying Holocene alluvial package, and culturally sterile clayey subsoil was not
encountered. The site is situated at an approximate elevation of 85.4 meters (280.0 feet) amsl;
as such, the site would be completely inundated by the proposed impoundment of Lake Columbia.
The site area has been cleared of natural climax vegetation, and vegetation across the majority
of the site consists of short grasses and wildflowers with a few scattered oak and pine trees. A
great deal of earth-moving and landscaping has been conducted. Due to the grasses covering
the site, surface visibility was nearly 0%.
Two positive shovel tests excavated on site 41CE401 yielded a total of 3 chipped stone
artifacts, including 1 light brown chert tertiary flake, 1 piece of light brown chert shatter, and 1 dark
brown petrified wood tertiary flake. The debitage was found at similar depths of 80.0 to 100.0 cm
(31.5 to 39.4 inches) below surface in both shovel tests. Near-surface disturbances deriving from
landscaping activities were observed to depths of 50.0 to 60.0 cm (19.7 to 23.6 inches) below
surface. No cultural features, diagnostic artifacts, or organic materials were observed during the
recording of site 41CE401.
Due to the extremely low density of artifacts at the site, it is impossible to say much about
the aboriginal occupation that produced the archeological deposits, though it is likely that site
41CE401 represents the remains of a short-term, ephemeral floodplain encampment occupied
during an undetermined point in the prehistoric past. The lack of ceramic artifacts may suggest
a pre-ceramic Archaic period occupation (ca. 7000 to 200 B.C.), but little can be concluded based
on the limited available data. The site is situated in an area that would have provided a reliable
supply of water and game for a hunter-gatherer group passing through the drainage basin or for
a task-specialized logistical camp occupied by a more sedentary group with a nearby home base.
While the site has rendered very few artifacts to date, its deep, sandy matrix may contain intact,
buried archeological deposits. Site 41CE401 is situated below the 315.0-foot NVGD elevation of
the proposed normal pool and would be subject to inundation by the proposed reservoir. While
the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of historic-age resources) on site
41CE401 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C,

insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits and to
determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the NRHP. Site 41CE401 is
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an

7.36

SITE 41CE402

Site 41CE402 consists of the remains of a historic-age bridge, including earthen bridge
approach berms and 7 bridge support piers, that once crossed a narrow channel of Mud Creek
along an unimproved dirt road that represents an abandoned road right-of-way that formerly
crossed the Mud Creek floodplain (Figures 7-152 to 7-154; Appendix D, Figure D-12). The roads
that approach the segment of abandoned, elevated roadway are FM 2185 to the west and
FM 3802 to the east; however, both of these roadways currently terminate on the uplands well
before they get to the Mud Creek valley margins. No remnants of the bridge superstructure were
observed. The bridge may have been damaged by floods at some point in the past and never
repaired, and the route consequently fell into disuse. Alternately, the Mud Creek channel may
have shifted, and a new bridge to cross the new creek channel was never built. No cultural
materials were observed on the site aside from the remnants of the earthen bridge approach
ramps and several bridge support piers. Currently, the Mud Creek channel is traversed via a lowwater crossing adjacent to the bridge.
The former ROW of FM 2185/FM 3802 traversing the Mud Creek floodplain currently
consists of an unimproved dirt road. The earthen bridge approaches adjacent to the former bridge
location achieve a maximum height of approximately 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) above the elevation of
the surrounding floodplain. The natural floodplain elevation on the site is approximately
94.5 meters (310.0 feet) amsl. The entire former roadway on the floodplain as well as the bridge
remnants that compose site 41CE402, are situated well below the 315.0-foot NVGD proposed
pool elevation. The bridge approach ramps are constructed of a sandy clay material available
everywhere within the Mud Creek floodplain, and borrow materials used to construct the berm
were likely obtained nearby. Vegetation in the area surrounding the site consists of every manner
of brier growing among plantation pine, oak trees, and an occasional cedar tree. Oak trees
growing atop the approach ramps measure up to 50.8 cm (12.0 inches) in diameter, which may
suggest that 30 or more years have passed since the bridge was unencumbered.
Remnants of the historic-age bridge include 2 approach ramps on either side of a small
area of standing water located off the north side of a current channel of Mud Creek as well as
7 round, wooden piers standing within the former creek channel. All signs of horizontal trussing
and planking of the bridge are gone, long-ago carried away by floodwaters or removed when the
Mud Creek channel shifted. A total of 4 shovel tests were excavated surrounding the former
bridge, with additional shovel tests in the surrounding area, but no subsurface cultural materials
were encountered (Table 7-37). Sediments in the vicinity of the bridge consist of red to reddishbrown clay on the modern ground surface and extending to the bottom of shovel tests at 10.0 cm
(3.9 inches) below surface. As no positive shovel tests resulted from the survey, site size was
determined based on the location of the former bridge’s structural elements. The site boundaries
drawn around the abandoned bridge structure, including the approach ramps and channel span,

(131.2 feet) northwest to southeast, though the actual bridge approach ramps and pilings only
measure about 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) in width.
Examination of historical USGS topographic maps shows that the former roadway of
FM 2185/FM 3802 that traversed the Mud Creek floodplain and utilized the former bridge structure
was in use until sometime between 1968 and 1976 (NETR 2015). The abandoned road right-ofway is visible on the 1937, 1943, and 1968 USGS topographic maps, but no longer appears on
the 1976 map, indicating that the roadway and bridge were abandoned between 1968 and 1976.
No earlier historical maps or aerial photographs were located, and the date of construction of the
original roadway and bridge structure is unknown.
Site 41CE402 is the remnants of a historic-age bridge that traversed a former channel of
Mud Creek. Extant features include small earthen bridge approach ramps on either bank of a
small pond of standing water that represents a former channel of Mud Creek and 7 standing,
wooden support piers.
The bridge was formerly located along the right-of-way of
FM 2185/FM 3802, which crossed the Mud Creek floodplain up until sometime between 1968 and
1976, at which time the roadway and bridge were abandoned. The bridge may have been
destroyed during a flooding event, or the roadway may have been abandoned when the Mud
Creek channel shifted southwards to its current location. In either case, the bridge was not
repaired or reconstructed. According to an anonymous local landowner, the “Old County Line
Road,” which this abandoned road segment and bridge reportedly represents, was a wagon trail
prior to being improved to carry automotive traffic. According to the informant, the road was in
use for at least 150 years, though the date at which the automobile route and bridge was
constructed is not currently known. Whether or not this account is true is unknown as the county
line between Cherokee and Smith counties is actually located approximately 0.5 kilometers
(0.3 miles) north of the site. However, it is worth noting that the Mud Creek floodplain is narrower
at this location than almost anywhere else within the APE, and it may have represented the best
available location at which to cross the floodplain. The remnants of the historic-age bridge are
well below the 315.0-foot NVGD contour and thus would be inundated by the proposed
impoundment of Lake Columbia. Due to severe structural collapse of diagnostic bridge features
caused by flood surges and/or intentional removal and the lack of archeological deposits, site

41CE402 probably does not retain sufficient archeological integrity to warrant eligibility for the
NRHP under Criterion D; however, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the site’s
potential significance under Criteria A, B, and C. Site 41CE402 is recommended to be of unknown
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; further testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate the site’s significance.

SITE 41CE403

Site 41CE403 is a subsurface scatter of lithic debitage, burned rock, charcoal, a diagnostic
Gary-like dart point, and a possible post hole feature located on a levee-like landform just east of
the currently active western channel of Mud Creek (Figures 7-155 to 7-158; Appendix D, Figure D6). The site is located in an open cattle pasture just north of the Mud Creek bridge on FM 2064.
This site was discovered in a backhoe trench (BT011), which was excavated during the initial
geomorphological investigations conducted following the archeological survey (see Chapter 6.0).
Based on the recovery of a Gary-like dart point, the site is likely a Middle to Late Archaic period
(ca. 5000 to 200 B.C.), or possibly Early Ceramic period (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 800), encampment,
although no ceramic sherds were observed during the recording of the site.
Site 41CE403 is located on a levee-like landform just east of a meander channel of Mud
Creek. This landform is situated on the first terrace of Mud Creek, and the levee slopes gradually
down to the west toward the creek. Loose, sandy sediments extend to a depth of 55.0 cm
(21.7 inches) below surface, below which a dark reddish-brown clay loam sediment extends to
the bottom of the trench at 120.0 cm (47.2 inches) below surface. The site is situated at an
elevation of approximately 89.9 meters (295.0 feet) amsl. Vegetation on the site consists of pine
trees and cedar trees along the creek to the west. Short grasses blanket the site, reducing ground
surface visibility to 0%.
Several backhoe trenches were excavated in the vicinity of site 41CE403 during the
geomorphologic study; however, cultural materials were discovered only in BT 011 (Table 7-38).
The boundaries of the site were not delineated during the geomorphic study, and the exact size
of the site is unknown. As such, the site boundary has been arbitrarily drawn as measuring
approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) in diameter surrounding BT 011. Artifacts recovered from
the trench include 1 brown quartzite flake, 1 light brown petrified wood flake, 1 light brown chert
flake, 3 burned sandstone fragments ranging from 3.0 to 8.0 cm (1.2 to 3.1 inches) in size, a
charcoal sample, a cluster of 14 small pebbles, and a Gary-like projectile point. All of these
artifacts were collected from Holocene-age, sandy sediments in a thin lens at depths of 47.0 to
50.0 cm (18.5 to 19.7 inches) below surface, suggesting that subsurface deposits on the site have
remained very stable. Additional fragments of burned sandstone were observed in the side wall
of the trench at depths ranging from 20.0 to 40.0 cm (7.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface. A stained
patch of sediment, measuring approximately 10.0 cm (3.9 inches) in diameter, was observed in
the eastern end of the trench just below the elevation at which the collected artifacts were
retrieved (ca. 50.0 cm [19.7 inches] below surface). Based on its proximity to the lens of buried
cultural materials, the stained patch of sediment may represent a post hole feature, though it is
also possible that is simply represents a burned root cavity or rodent burrow.

Land-clearing activities have apparently had little effect on the buried archeological
deposits on site 41CE403. Only the sediments in the shallowest 20.0 cm (7.9 inches) of the site
have a potential for impacts from land-clearing practices. Bioturbation surely has had some
impact on subsurface deposits, but little disturbance was observed at depth. The levee on the
eastern bank of the meander of Mud Creek on which the site is located appears to have been a
stable, aggrading landform to contain cultural materials in such a discreet and well stratified
deposit.

Site 41CE403 appears to represent the remains of Middle to Late Archaic period, or
possibly an Early Ceramic period, encampment on the Mud Creek floodplain represented by a
diagnostic Gary-like dart point, lithic debitage, burned rock, and charcoal in a stratified subsurface
archeological context. While the apparent age of the cultural deposits (and concomitant lack of
historic-age resources) on site 41CE403 suggests that the site is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criteria A, B, and C, insufficient data are currently available to evaluate the integrity
of cultural deposits and to determine the research potential of the site under Criterion D of the
NRHP. Site 41CE403 is recommended to be of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and
for designation as an SAL; further testing would be necessary to obtain sufficient data to evaluate
the site’s significance.

ISOLATED ARTIFACT OCCURRENCES

Whenever any cultural materials were observed during the survey, the find was delineated
to determine the nature, extent, and quantity of the materials. IOs represent isolated artifact finds
that did not appear to warrant formal designation as archeological sites as they were present in
extremely small numbers or lacked any contextual associations that would help identify the
functional or chronological associations of the items. In practice, any occurrence of a single,
isolated artifact in either surface or subsurface contexts that lacked any apparent associations
with other cultural resources or paleosols was designated as an IO unless exceptional
circumstances warranted its designation as a site (this occurred only in the case of site 41CE374).
Similarly, if very small numbers of artifacts were found within a single shovel test and
supplemental delineation shovel tests failed to produce any further evidence of cultural materials,
the artifacts from the single positive shovel test were designated as an IO.
A total of 25 IOs were recorded during the baseline archeological survey of the proposed
Lake Columbia’s APE. Table 7-39 summarizes the 25 IOs documented during the survey, and
Appendix D presents the location of each IO on the USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles
that comprise the Lake Columbia project area.
While the IOs encountered during the baseline archeological survey by definition lacked
sufficient manifestation of cultural resources to warrant designation as archeological sites, no
specific management recommendations are offered regarding the eligibility of these cultural
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Many of the IOs were found in
small clusters in proximity to 1 or more other IOs, in proximity to archeological sites, and/or in
proximity to landforms that may have represented possible locations for past habitation. Even
though additional delineation shovel tests surrounding these isolated finds failed to produce
additional cultural resources that would have resulted in recording the cultural materials as
archeological sites, the surface and subsurface scatters of cultural resources on many of the
archeological sites documented during this project were relatively sparse, and many sites
contained far more negative shovel tests (i.e., shovel tests lacking subsurface cultural resources)
than positive ones (i.e., shovel tests containing subsurface cultural resources). As such, in the
event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future, additional survey
efforts may be needed in the vicinity of the locations of IOs make sure nothing was overlooked.

8.0 RESULTS OF HISTORIC ARCHITECTURE SURVEY

This chapter presents the results of the historic architectural survey and historical/archival
research conducted for the baseline cultural resources investigations of the proposed Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. Terri Myers and A. Elizabeth Butman of Preservation Central,
Inc. (PCI), conducted the study under the guidance of Jeffrey D. Owens, Horizon’s archeological
Principal Investigator for the project. Terri Myers and A. Elizabeth Butman co-authored the
original version of this chapter presented as Chapter 5.0 in the interim report (Owens et al. 2006),
which has been reproduced below largely verbatim, aside from minor editorial changes, with the
following 2 exceptions. First, additional digital photographs from Horizon’s collection have been
included to supplement the photographs provided in the original chapter by PCI. Second, the
discussions of NRHP eligibility for each historic-age resource from the interim report (Owens et
al. 2006) have been updated herein with the final eligibility determinations made by the THC
based on its review of the interim report in a letter dated January 10, 2007.

8.1

INTRODUCTION

PCI, an Austin-based historic preservation consulting firm, was enlisted to conduct historic
architectural investigations and historical/archival research for the current phase of the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. PCI’s survey efforts were largely limited to historic-age
resources identified by Horizon as being of historic age during Horizon’s baseline archeological
survey, which had been completed prior to the initiation of the baseline historic architecture
investigations. Historian Terri Myers of PCI served as Principal Investigator for the historic
structures reconnaissance survey and supervised all aspects of the survey and production of the
chapter included in the interim report (Owens et al. 2006). Architectural historian A. Elizabeth
Butman, then of PCI, contributed substantially to field and archival investigations and prepared
physical descriptions for surveyed cultural resources. Both individuals meet the professional
qualifications for historians and architectural historians as specified by the Secretary of the Interior
in accordance with 36 CFR 66.
Ms. Myers and Ms. Butman collaborated on the survey report presented in this chapter.
The historical/archival research and windshield survey for the Lake Columbia project were
conducted in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for
Identification and Evaluation and guidelines for reconnaissance-level surveys set forth in
Architectural/Historic Resource Survey: A Field Guide.

SURVEY AREA DESCRIPTION

Cherokee and Smith counties lie in the central portion of East Texas. Smith County abuts
Cherokee County on the north, and, although a small portion of the Lake Columbia APE lies in
southern Smith County, the majority lies in northern and central Cherokee County. Cherokee
County is roughly bounded by the Neches River on the west and the Angelina River on the east.
The proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project would require the impoundment of a segment
of Mud Creek, a significant stream that flows across the northeast quadrant of the county before
emptying into the Angelina River. The proposed ca. 10,000.0-acre Lake Columbia reservoir
would lie in the north-central portion of Cherokee County and southern Smith County. As
described in this report, the APE covers a total area of 12,370.0 acres.

METHODOLOGY
Introduction

Ms. Myers and Ms. Butman carried out field investigations and conducted a literature and
archival search for sources concerning the historic resources and their inhabitants. The
consultants made 2 field visits and conducted research at libraries and repositories in Rusk,
Jacksonville, and Austin, Texas, including the Cherokee County Clerk’s office, Cherokee County
Tax Appraisal District, Cherokee County Historical Commission, Rusk Public Library, Texas State
Library and Archives, the General Land Office, and the Barker Texas History Collection at the
Center for American History of The University of Texas at Austin.
8.3.2

Field Investigations

PCI’s survey efforts targeted specific resources in the vicinity of the APE identified by
Horizon as being of historic age and potentially meriting further study. The historic structures
reconnaissance survey entailed documentation of these selected resources, most of which are
frame, front- or side-gabled bungalows and associated outbuildings dating to the 1910s and
1920s. A ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house and a ca. 1955 Ranch-style house, plus their associated
outbuildings, define the apparent temporal limits of historical development among the sampled
population of historic-age structures.
PCl performed the reconnaissance-level survey during 2 field visits on March 18 to 22,
2006, and May 30 to June 2, 2006. Ms. Myers made the initial visit and Ms. Butman accompanied
her on the second trip. Project personnel examined and documented 7 historic-age resources
identified by Horizon during their archeological field investigations. In addition to the individual
resources, PCI noted the surrounding physical environment in which the resources were built and
used. The field investigations were conducted to identify the salient features of the resources and
determine their NRHP potential for architectural significance. Archival and secondary-source
research established the historical ownership and use of some sites and their general relationship
to the historical development of north-central Cherokee and southern Smith counties.
In addition to the 7 historic-age structures initially identified by Horizon during the
archeological survey, PCI discovered an 8th historic-age resource—the African American
Freedman’s community of Pleasant Plains—which lies approximately 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles)

286

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:

east of the APE along FM 4727 in an upland setting between South Caney and Bridge creeks.
The community dates from the 1870s—the earliest identified resources are tombstones in a large
cemetery dating to the 1880s and the previously mentioned ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house. Due
to its potential significance and proximity to the APE, PCI conducted a windshield survey of
buildings and structures within the community. Full documentation of the resources was outside
the scope of this investigation; however, because this is a rare, largely intact Freedman’s colony,
further research and fieldwork may be warranted.
Site Visit 1—March 18 to 22, 2006
On March 21, 2006, Ms. Myers accompanied Horizon’s archeological Principal
Investigator, Jeffrey D. Owens, to Historic Sites 4 (the Henry Touchy Property) and 5 (the
Remington Property). Both sites are located just outside the APE on an upland interfluve between
the main channel of Mud Creek and North Caney Creek. Ms. Myers minimally documented the
resources and outbuildings to include property type, subtype, style (if any), materials, roof form,
condition, and preliminary NRHP eligibility assessment. She photographed each primary
resource, its outbuildings, and setting in color digital media and noted camera facings for each
view. Property descriptions are further detailed later in this chapter.

Historic Site 4—Henry Touchy Property
Historic Site 4 is located on the west side of FM 2064 just north of the FM 2750 junction.
The main site feature is a ca. 1910 frame, pyramidal-roofed bungalow owned by Henry Touchy.
The house once had a full-façade front porch typical of pyramidal-roofed houses of the period,
but it was reportedly in poor condition when Mr. Touchy purchased the property in the early 1950s
and ultimately fell in (Touchy 2006). Original siding has been replaced on 2 sides of the house.
Behind the house is a bell cistern. A large frame hen house lies nearby in the house yard.

Historic Site 5—Remington Property
Historic Site 5 is located on FM 4922 west of the FM 2064 junction. It is a ca. 1955 singlestory, side-gabled, Ranch-style dwelling with numerous outbuildings dating from the period of the
house’s construction. The property belongs to the Remington family. The house is a rambling
linear dwelling with several additions on the sides and a partially enclosed porch. It has a
rectangular stone chimney of the type popular for Ranch-style houses in the 1950s. A
garage/carport is attached to 1 side by a breezeway. A separate garage and other outbuildings
lie in the barn yard. The house looks out over a large stock tank, and cattle graze in the pasture
around it. Extensive board fencing encloses the barnyard and lines the two-track dirt driveway.

Historic Site 8—Pleasant Plains Community
On March 22, 2006, Ms. Myers conducted field investigations along FM 4227 and
minimally documented 9 related sites comprising the Pleasant Plains Community, a settlement of
African American families dating from the immediate post-Civil War era. The entire settlement
was assigned the designation of Historic Site 8, while individual features or homesteads were
given alphabetical designations. A cemetery with approximately 100 graves (Site 8A) was
documented as part of this community. Other sites include a graded lot that appears to be a

former house site (Site 8B); an intact, occupied farmstead that includes an L-plan house and
family cemetery (Site 8C); a barn and associated remains of a house (Site 8D); an abandoned 2room house (Site 8E); an abandoned, ca. 1920, front-gabled bungalow (Site 8F); an occupied,
ca. 1925, front-gabled bungalow (Site 8G); an abandoned, ca. 1975 church on a historic church
site with an abandoned ca. 1920 shed or parsonage (Site 8H); and an abandoned school (Site 8I).
These historical localities, along with several currently occupied manufactured houses,
comprise an existing largely African American community known as Pleasant Plains. The
cemetery (Site 8A) is known locally as Pleasant Plains Cemetery and contains about 100 graves
of African Americans. The earliest burial dates to 1883, with many in the 1890s. The cemetery
has been in continuous use to the present day, with the most recent burial in 2004 (as of PCI’s
field visit in 2006). Tombstones show a number of individuals who were born before
Emancipation, including Perry Bolling (b. 1830), Adline Bolling (b. 1832), Dorcas Ann Hicks (b.
1836), J.H. Hicks (b. 1854), Elder Sam A. Lacy (b. 1856), Lydia Chandler Lacy (b. 1862), Joseph
Tennison (b. 1852), Roy Coleman (b. 1865), Henry Sanders (birth date unknown), Rachel
Sanders (b. 1864), and Margaret Tilley (b. 1863). Since there were only 2 “free men of color” in
Cherokee County in 1860, these people were probably born into slavery. Other family members
are buried in the cemetery.
A historic “Negro” church and a school were referenced in old deed records. A new church
replaced the original sanctuary about 1975 (Site 8H). All were associated with the African
American community. A large, currently vacant, 2-story frame building near the church served as
a school and/or parsonage at one time. Ms. Myers interviewed Rene Browning, a descendant of
one of the earliest African American residents, Waldo Tennison (associated with Site 8F). Ms.
Browning supplied substantial information about the Pleasant Plains area (Browning 2006).
Site Visit 2—May 30 to June 2, 2006
Ms. Myers and Ms. Butman traveled to Cherokee County on May 30, 2006, and visited
additional historic-age sites identified by Horizon archeologists. On May 31 and June 1, 2006,
the PCI team followed directions given by Horizon to identify and document these resources,
including Historic Site 1, a bungalow and large horse barn on FM 4916; Historic Site 2, a
farmstead with a bungalow, barn, and outbuildings on FM 4903; Historic Site 3, a farmstead next
to Historic Site 2 with a bungalow, barn, and outbuildings; Historic Site 6, a yellow bungalow with
an on-site manufactured house on FM 1409; and Historic Site 7, a ca. 1890, cross-hipped, halland-parlor plan house also located along FM 1409. PCI revisited sites identified and documented
by Ms. Myers during the first field visit on March 21 to 22, 2006. More detailed information was
collected for Historic Site 4, the Henry Touchy bungalow and hen house; Historic Site 5, the
Remington farmstead with a Ranch-style house and outbuildings; and Historic Site 8, the Pleasant
Plains Community.

Research Methodology

PCI received a copy of the original Draft SOW (Owens 2005) for the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project on February 10, 2006. Ms. Myers and Ms. Butman reviewed the document with
particular interest given to the document’s chapters on cultural background and references. Ms.

Myers conducted general research on Cherokee and Smith counties before traveling to the project
area for the first field visit. Ms. Myers and Ms. Butman conducted research at repositories in Rusk
and Jacksonville in conjunction with the field visits and collected further information on the area
from repositories in Austin.
On March 20 and 22, Ms. Myers conducted primary research at the Cherokee County
Clerk’s office and the County Tax Appraisal District. Tobin maps showing property ownership ca.
1960 are on display at the County Tax Appraisal District. Ms. Myers copied names associated
with parcels in the APE from the maps for future deed and census research. She conducted
primary and secondary research at the Rusk Public Library, which has a small local history section
that includes cemetery records for the project area. Ms. Myers identified a 1.0-acre cemetery
shown on a 1962 map near the southwest corner of FM 4227 and FM 4222 east of the APE.
On March 21, 2006, Ms. Myers met with Anne Chandler, director of the Cherokee County
Historical Commission, in Jacksonville (Chandler 2006). She reviewed vertical files, historic
maps, and other records and purchased several general histories of the area at the Cherokee
County Historical Commission. Ms. Chandler provided directions to stone-lined creeks and stone
bridges in the City of Jacksonville, west of the APE. According to Ms. Chandler, these were built
by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1933. Ms. Myers found and photographed the
stone structures and concluded that they were likely built by the WPA or Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) during the 1930s.
Between March 19 and 22, 2006, Ms. Myers conducted informal interviews with Anne
Chandler, director of the Cherokee County Historical Commission; Rene Browning, a resident of
Pleasant Plains; and Henry Touchy, a homeowner in the vicinity of the APE. The purpose of the
interviews was to obtain more information about the kinds and types of historic development in
the project area.
Between May 30 and June 2, Ms. Myers, accompanied by Ms. Butman, undertook a
second site visit and research trip. The consultants returned to the Pleasant Plains Community,
where they copied names and birth/death dates from tombstones in the cemetery on FM 4227.
Inferring from related family names and photographs mounted on the tombstones, the cemetery
appears to be entirely African American.
The consultants then traced the names in deed records at the Cherokee County Clerk’s
Office to learn more about the community and its inhabitants. This research placed some of the
African American residents in the area by 1870. Deed research and subsequent census research
shows that a substantial number of African American families lived close together in the Pleasant
Plains area in the immediate post-Civil War era. The community constituted a Freedman’s
Village. References in the deed records to a school and church further verify this conclusion. The
consultants followed the names found on cemetery tombstones and in deed records to locate the
community in the census record. Information in the census and agricultural census records further
fleshed out the composition of the community. In Austin, the PCI team collected tax and census
information on early residents of the Pleasant Plains Community and obtained early maps of the
area at the GLO. The tax and census research indicates that African Americans lived in the
Pleasant Plains Community as early as the 1870s, in the immediate post-Civil War era following

Emancipation. Ultimately, the Pleasant Plains district is perhaps the only historic-period
community, complete with dwellings, fields, outbuildings, a school, church, parsonage, and
cemeteries, in the vicinity of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s APE. Its identification as
a possible rare, surviving Freedman’s Village adds to its significance and potential NRHP
eligibility.

8.4

IDENTIFIED HISTORIC-AGE ARCHITECTURAL SITES

Much of the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project APE consists of low-lying lands along
Mud Creek and its tributaries in far-south Smith and north-central Cherokee counties. The Mud
Creek basin forms a large, inverted V-shape in north-central Cherokee County. The county’s
major settlements were established on high ground along the rim of this basin, with the towns of
Troup and New Summerfield to the east, Bullard and Jacksonville to the west, and the county
seat of Rusk to the south. No major settlements occur within the basin, although small hamlets
and individual farms are scattered on higher ground throughout the adjacent uplands.
Mud Creek, a tributary of the Angelina River, is itself fed by narrow tributaries that course
through the APE. The slow-moving rivulets tend to pond throughout the APE, creating standing
pools of stagnant water that preclude extensive agricultural development. The basin supports
some grasslands, and both pine and deciduous forests exist. Overall, however, the land is
undesirable for most agricultural endeavors. As a result, few settlements that thrive on agricultural
commerce emerged in the vicinity of the project area. The Pleasant Plains Community on
FM 4227 is an exception, possibly because it was settled by emancipated slaves who had few
opportunities for land ownership in the post-Civil War era.
Although Anglo-American settlement took place in present-day Smith and Cherokee
counties as early as the 1820s, and a colony formed at nearby New Summerfield by the 1840s,
limited evidence of early 19th-century habitation was found within the APE. Several resources in
the vicinity are late-19th to early 20th-century properties, including a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor
dwelling (Historic Site 7) and a ca. 1910, pyramidal-roofed bungalow (Historic Site 4). Most
historic-age resources in the area, however, appear to date to the 1920s, suggesting an increase
in development during that time and a corresponding decline thereafter. Pleasant Plains, which
dates from the 1870s, is the oldest known community verging on the APE. Surviving resources
in the community may date to the late 19th century, but most extant properties appear to have
been built in the 1910s and 1920s. One modern, ca. 1970 community church observed in the
area is currently abandoned, which is suggestive of the community’s declining population from its
late 19th- and early 20th-century numbers. Appendix D contains maps depicting the locations of
the historic-age sites recorded during the reconnaissance survey.
Today, the area remains sparsely settled. Historic-age resources in the vicinity of the APE
consist primarily of individual farmsteads, typically containing an early 20th-century bungalow and
domestic outbuildings and agricultural properties such as barns, chicken coops, and sheds.
Pleasant Plains is composed of a handful of small farmsteads with bungalows and outbuildings,
a ca. 1970s church that replaced an earlier church on the site, a historic-age school, and a large,
still-active cemetery. A small family cemetery lies on one farmstead within the community. Other
such cemeteries may exist within the community, but none were specifically observed.

8.4.1

Historic Site 1

The primary features of Historic Site 1 include a ca. 1925, front-gabled bungalow and a
contemporaneous, 1.5-story, windowed animal barn. The site is located at the eastern terminus
of FM 4916, just south of the Cherokee-Smith county line, and abuts the western edge of the APE
(Appendix D, Figure D-12). A two-track dirt road extends eastward across the property from the
county road to Mud Creek. The house is sited south of the road roughly 457.3 meters
(1,500.0 feet) from the entrance, with the barn slightly farther to the west on the north side of the
road. Most of the site is forested with pine trees, and the house is concealed in a dense thicket
of trees and underbrush. The house and barn are associated with early 20th-century agricultural
development in the Mud Creek basin.
The house is a frame, 1-story bungalow clad in false-beveled wood siding (Figures 8-1
to 8-3). It rests on a brick pier-and-beam foundation and is surmounted by a corrugated metal
roof with exposed rafter ends. The front façade has a gabled roof, accented by a partial-width
gabled porch with box columns. At the rear of the house, the roof takes a hipped form, and a
small shed roof underneath shelters paired doors. The front and rear openings have wood 5paneled doors, and windows throughout the house are 4-over-4 light wood sash. The interior
arrangement consists of 4 interconnecting rooms, a typical plan for modestly sized bungalows. A
red brick fireplace and chimney are present in the northwest room, denoting its use as a parlor or
living room. The yellow brick piers, which appear to be of newer construction than the chimney,
may indicate foundation repairs. Behind the house is an uncapped concrete cistern (Figure 8-4).
No fencing around the house and yard is evident.
Northwest of the house, the 1.5-story frame barn faces south toward the road (Figures 85 to 8-6). Clad in false-beveled siding, the exterior of the barn is punctuated by square, 4-light
casement windows. The front-gabled roof, covered with corrugated metal, has exposed rafter
ends, and 5 triangle knee braces support each overhanging gable. These elements reflect a
modest influence of the Craftsman style and date the barn as contemporaneous with the house
(ca. 1925). The use of decorative features, glass windows, and milled siding reflect a level of
refinement uncommon in most utilitarian Texas barns.
Large, rectangular entries on either end of the barn define a central passageway through
the ground level; above, narrow openings provide access to the hayloft. Over these are louvered
vents. On the south elevation, an asymmetrically placed rectangular opening has been cut above
the main entryway at the level of the hayloft floor; lacking trim, it likely represents an alteration to
the barn. Casement windows flank the main entryway and hayloft opening on the south façade.
The sides of the barn each feature 2 rows of 5 windows. The lower row opens high on the interior
walls, while the second row provides light and ventilation to the attic level.
The interior of the barn has exposed structural members and a packed dirt floor. West of
the central passageway, the barn is open between cedar post supports; east of the passageway,
it is divided into a series of animal stalls. The walls and doors of the stalls consist of widely spaced
boards. At the north end of the barn, 2 enclosed rooms with wood floors flank the passageway.
The ground slopes from south to north within the barn, and the storage rooms, elevated on cedar
piers, have hatches that may have been used to load feed into a wagon or truck bed. The

passageway, closed by a board gate at the north end, opens onto a small corral to the south.
Fencing for the corral is built of cedar posts, horizontal boards, and square wire mesh. Two metal
pipe gates open the corral onto the road and pastureland to the north.
Both buildings are vacant and consequently in fair to poor condition. Though the barn
appears structurally sound, settling and foundation problems are evident. In both the house and
barn, most of the window glass is gone or broken and a number of windows have missing muntins.
Despite their condition, the house and barn retain historic materials and clearly exhibit integrity of
design, workmanship, and feeling. The setting of the barn has been somewhat compromised by
gas wells located immediately to the west. Despite this, the barn is an exceptional agricultural
historic resource in the project area. Archeological potential and significance are not apparent,
and the property was not recorded as an archeological site by Horizon as it falls outside the
boundaries of the APE for the baseline archeological survey.
8.4.2

Historic Sites 2 and 3

Historic Sites 2 and 3 are located on either side of a private, two-track dirt road past the
eastern terminus of FM 4903 (Appendix D, Figure D-7). The sites consist of 2 small farmsteads,
each with a front-gabled bungalow and outbuildings, including an animal barn, vehicle barn, and
sheds. The buildings are arranged along the periphery of an upland ridge that drops to the east,
north, and south toward Mud Creek and 2 of its tributaries, Lavender Branch and Birches Creek.
Between the 2 sites lies an open, sweeping meadow; and dense oak and pine trees around the
perimeter mark the shift in terrain near the creek banks (Figure 8-7). The sites are discussed
together since they appear to be related; possibly, friends or family members purchased adjacent
land on which they built nearly identical houses and established farms at the same time. Both
sites are associated with the early 20th-century agricultural development of the Mud Creek basin.
North of the dirt road, Historic Site 2 consists of a house, vehicle barn, shed, and animal
feeder. The house is a ca. 1925, front-gabled bungalow set at a distance from the road, with the
primary façade facing south (Figures 8-8 to 8-9). Its exterior materials include false-beveled wood
siding and corrugated metal roofing. The house rests on concrete piers that undoubtedly replaced
the original wood post or brick piers. Fenestration consists of 4-over-4 light wood windows. The
roof features exposed rafter ends typical of Craftsman-influenced bungalows of the 1920s. A halffaçade front porch is inset at the southeast corner of the house. Based on comparison with a
similar dwelling at Historic Site 3, the house is presumed to have an inset back porch at the
northwest corner, though it was not inspected due to overgrown foliage.1 The plan consists of
4 interconnected rooms, with a fireplace and chimney on the east side of the house. To the
northeast of the house is a capped concrete cistern.
A 2-bay, front-gabled vehicle barn is set east of the house, closer to the creek (Figure 810). Also constructed ca. 1925, the barn is clad in board-and-batten siding and has a corrugated
metal roof with exposed rafter ends. The 2 vehicle bays have low openings with chamfered

Author’s Note: A photograph taken by Horizon prior to PCI’s site visit when the foliage was not as overgrown shows
that the bungalow on Historic Site 2 does not, in fact, have a back porch (see Figure 8-9).

corners; above, a small attic loft is accessed by a hinged door. South-southeast of the house and
vehicle barn is a ca. 1945, front-gabled shed clad in corrugated sheet metal (Figure 8-11). The
south elevation has paired doors covered with corrugated metal; rectangular openings on the
west and north sides appear to have once had shutters. In front of the shed is a metal animal
feeder. It consists of a raised central portion with a gabled cover and open shed-roofed feeding
bays on each side.
Historic Site 3 encompasses a bungalow, shed, animal barn, and stock pond. Past
Historic Site 2, the dirt road forks, and 1 path curves to the south. The animal barn is sited east
of the road at this bend. Farther south, the house is located on the west side of the road, with the
shed to the southwest, behind the house. A small stock pond is west of both farmsteads, on the
south side of the road near the entry gate. It was formed by man-made earthen embankments
on all sides. Though the bungalow on Historic Site 3 is oriented facing east rather than south, it
possesses characteristics nearly identical to the dwelling at Historic Site 2 (Figures 8-12 to 8-14).
Mirrored in plan, it has porches on the southwest and northeast corners. The back porch was
originally screened above a half-height wall enclosure; the screens have deteriorated and are
largely gone. Behind the house, the ca. 1925, front-gabled shed also faces east toward the road
(Figure 8-15). Clad in board-and-batten siding, it has a front-gabled roof with exposed rafter ends
and corrugated metal roofing. The front wall of the shed is set back under the roofline to provide
a covered shelter. Squared wooden posts support the roof.

Northeast of the house and shed is a ca. 1925, front-gabled animal barn with a shedroofed side addition (Figure 8-16 to 8-17) The main body of the 1.5-story barn is clad in vertical
wood boards, with horizontal boards in the gable ends. The addition, clad with corrugated metal
on 1 side, is open on both ends. Both the original barn and side extension have corrugated metal
roofing. Two hinged doors on the north elevation access an enclosed storage area, and a small
door in the south gable opens onto a hayloft. The south and east sides of the barn are largely
open, providing a large covered shelter for animals. The south façade consists of 2 openings with
chamfered corners, while the southern end of the east elevation has 4 open bays between
squared posts. Connected metal pipe panels create a corral around this end of the barn, with a
squeeze chute at the northeast corner. Between the chute and barn is a small fire pit used to
heat branding irons, and a variety of brands have been burned into the wood on that corner of the
barn.
All of the buildings on Historic Sites 2 and 3 are in fair to poor condition. The houses,
vehicle barns, and sheds are currently used for storage and appear to have been abandoned to
the elements. Though the animal barns appear to remain in use, they are only in fair condition.
Despite the general disrepair of the buildings, both sites maintain integrity of location, setting,
feeling and association to a large degree. Integrity of materials, design and workmanship are
somewhat compromised due to deterioration, but very little of the original architectural fabric has
been removed or replaced. The adjacent farms and their resources are all recognizable to their
period of significance. Archeological potential and significance are not apparent, and neither
property was recorded as an archeological site by Horizon as they fall outside the boundaries of
the APE for the baseline archeological survey.
8.4.3

Historic Site 4

The primary features of Historic Site 4 include a ca. 1910, pyramidal-roofed bungalow and
an early to mid-20th-century chicken coop. The site is located on the west side of FM 2064 just
north of the FM 2750 junction, between SH 135 and US 79, northwest of New Summerfield in
northern Cherokee County (Appendix D, Figure D-8). A short, two-track dirt road extends about
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) westward from FM 2064 to the historic-age house site. A front-gabled,
half-story chicken coop lies to the northeast of the house near the property line. The road
continues west, past the pyramidal roofed house to a ca. 1965 dwelling concealed in a grove of
trees. Most of the site around the historic house is cleared of brush and foliage except for a ring
of large, well placed deciduous trees positioned around the house to provide shade. The house
and chicken coop are associated with early 20th-century agricultural development in the Mud
Creek basin. The ca. 1965 house was not considered to be of historic age and was not evaluated.
The pyramidal-roofed bungalow, nearly square in plan, rests on a brick pier-and-beam
foundation and is surmounted by a corrugated metal roof (Figures 8-18 to 8-19). A brick chimney
emerges from the apex of the roof. Cladding consists of a variety of wood siding types. The front
and rear façades, on the east and west sides, respectively, are sheathed in false-beveled wood
siding, while the sides, on the north and south elevations, are covered in plywood with false
battens. Property owner Henry Touchy replaced the original siding with plywood due to
deterioration. He also added the broad band of inverted pickets that either cover or replace the

original fascia. An attached, full-façade porch reportedly once extended across the front of the
house but was removed in the early 1950s due to collapse and was not replaced.
A central door flanked by paired 6-over-6 light wood windows enters directly into the living
room. Paired 6-over-6 light wood windows appear on the west and south façades; a single 6over-6 light window and a pair of 4-over-4 light windows punctuate the north façade. The original
windows were likely 4-over-4 lights like the one remaining on the house. The property owner
replaced many of the original windows in the 1950s. None of the windows display decorative trim;
their surrounds are flat boards with shallow sills.
Northeast of the house lies a front-gabled chicken coop clad in board-and-batten siding
and capped by a corrugated metal roof (Figure 8-20). A single, hinged door on 1 end offers
access to the half-story building. One long side has a hinged screen to retrieve eggs.
Both the house and chicken coop are currently vacant and are consequently in fair to poor
condition. Though the house appears sound on its foundation, it suffers from damaged siding
and skirting. Most of the windows retain their glass and some are covered in screens. The
chicken coop leans to 1 side, and both the siding and roof need repair. Despite their condition,
the house and coop retain integrity of location, setting, feeling, and association and are
recognizable to their period of significance. However, loss of original fabric, including siding,
windows, roofing material, and characteristic porch, compromises the integrity of design,
materials, and workmanship.

Historic Site 4 is a typical frame house of the early 20th century and is not necessarily
associated with broad trends in history. It is not associated with any persons known to have made
a significant contribution to local, state, or national history. Archeological potential and
significance are not apparent, and the property was not recorded as an archeological site by
Horizon as it falls outside the boundaries of the APE for the baseline archeological survey. The
property does not appear to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D;
furthermore, because the house is not a stellar example of its type and has lost significant historic
architectural fabric, it is not eligible under Criterion C.
8.4.4

Historic Site 5

Historic Site 5, located on FM 4922 just west of FM 2064, consists of a ca. 1955, Ranchstyle house and associated agricultural buildings and landscape features (Appendix D, Figure D6). Other features on the site include corrals, roads, a large stock pond, and pastures.
The site consists of a 1-story, ca. 1955, side-gabled, Ranch-style dwelling with numerous
outbuildings dating from the period of the house’s construction to the present. The property
belongs to the Remington family. The house is a rambling, linear dwelling with several additions
on the sides and a partially enclosed porch (Figure 8-21). It has a rectangular stone chimney of
the type popular for Ranch-style houses in the 1950s (Figure 8-22). A garage/carport is attached
to 1 side by a breezeway (Figure 8-23). A separate garage and other outbuildings lie in the
barnyard. The house looks out onto a large stock tank, and cattle graze in the pasture around it
(Figure 8-24). Extensive board fencing encloses the barnyard and lines the dirt driveway
(Figure 8-25).
The house rests on a slab foundation and is surmounted by a composition-shingle roof.
Weatherboard cladding has been replaced with vinyl siding. The front porch, comprising most of
the primary façade, has been enclosed with metal sash windows. Fenestration throughout the
rest of the house consists of 6-over-6 light wood sash windows. Two chimneys, on the rear and
side elevations, are built of random ashlar limestone. A breezeway connects the house with a
sizable 2-car garage.
The original portion of the house is indicative of the popularity of Ranch-style houses in
the early post-World War II era, but it is not necessarily associated with broad trends in history.
It is not associated with any persons known to have made a significant contribution to local, state,
or national history. Archeological potential and significance are not apparent, and the site was
not recorded as an archeological site as it falls outside the boundaries of the APE for the baseline
archeological survey. All features on the site appear to have been established since the 1950s.
Therefore, the Remington property does not appear to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, or D. Because the house has received numerous additions and renovations, it no
longer reads as a good example of a 1950s Ranch-style house. These additions obscure the
original design and layout of the house, and it is therefore not eligible under Criterion C for
architectural merit.

Historic Site 6

Historic Site 6 is located on the east side of FM 1409 (Pine Oak Drive) north of Cannon
Ridge Road just east of the APE (Appendix D, Figure D-3). Built features identified on the site
consist of 2 houses. The first, a ca. 1965, side-gabled house, addresses the county road. A
private dirt road north of this house extends east onto the property, and a ca. 1940, front-gabled
bungalow is located on the south side of the road (Figures 8-26 to 8-27). The site is wooded with
pine trees.
The newer, side-gabled house faces west towards FM 1409. Built ca. 1965, the house
has vertical hardboard cladding and a standing-seam metal roof. It rests on a pier-and-beam
foundation with pressed metal skirting. A shed-roofed wooden deck extends across the primary
elevation, and a front-gabled carport is sited in front of the house near the north end. Few of the
original windows remain. The original 2-over-2 horizontal light aluminum sash windows have
largely been replaced by 6-over-6 light anodized metal windows. At the time of the survey, this
house was not a historic-age resource.
Located northeast of the ca. 1965 house is a ca. 1940 front-gabled dwelling that faces
north towards a dirt access road (see Figures 8-26 to 8-27). Its simple form, slight roof overhang,
and lack of stylistic details suggest that it is a late example of a bungalow-plan house, likely dating
to ca. 1940 to 1950. The loss of decorative details makes it difficult to positively date the house.

The house rests on a pier-and-beam foundation with sheet metal skirting and is capped
by a composition-shingle roof. Vinyl siding encases or has replaced the original weatherboard
cladding. Exposed rafter ends, a defining characteristic of Craftsman-influenced bungalows, have
been enclosed with siding, and window trim has been covered or removed. Fenestration
throughout the house has been replaced by 2-over-2 light aluminum windows. The partial-façade
front porch has a gabled roof with aluminum supports, and a large, shed-roofed wooden deck has
been added to the rear of the house (see Figure 8-27).
Due to the extent and type of alterations, this historic-age house retains little integrity of
design, workmanship, feeling or association and virtually no integrity of materials. Archeological
potential and significance are not apparent, and the site was not recorded as an archeological
site.
8.4.6

Historic Site 7

Historic Site 7 is located west of FM 1409 (Pine Oak Drive) on a two-track red dirt road
south of Cannon Ridge Road just east of the APE south of US 79 (Appendix D, Figure D-3). The
primary resource on the site, located on the south side of the dirt road, is a ca. 1890 hall-andparlor plan house with numerous early additions (Figures 8-28 to 8-29). Other buildings include
a ca. 1980 manufactured home north of the road and a ca. 1950 front-gabled barn located south
of the house. A cistern is found near the northeast corner of the dwelling.
The house, clad in drop siding, rests on a pier-and-beam foundation with brick and
concrete block replacement piers. It is capped by a cross-hipped, corrugated metal roof. In plan,
the dwelling consists of a central, 3-room portion with a 1-room rear wing. The long axis of the
house is oriented north to south, with the primary façade facing east towards FM 1409. A hippedroof porch, supported by 5 tapered box columns, spans most of the width of the façade. Beneath,
2 windows flank a series of 3 doors. Windows throughout the house consist of original 4-over-4
or replacement 6-over-6 light wood sash. Hipped roof porches flank either side of the rear wing.
The house may have originated as a 2-room, hall-and-parlor plan dwelling. This
conjecture is based on the asymmetrical placement of the red brick chimney between the
southernmost and middle room (Figure 8-30). The main body of the house has boxed eaves, a
refinement that pre-dates the popularity of the bungalow, while the porch roofs and rear wing
exhibit exposed rafter ends. The exposed rafters suggest that each of these elements were added
ca. 1920. One of the rear porches has been partially enclosed with corrugated sheet metal
(Figure 8-31). Overall, the unoccupied house is in fair condition.
Most, if not all, of the additions to the original house date to the historic period, and they
have therefore taken on significance of their own. The hall-and-parlor portion of the house is a
simple plan type commonly built by early settlers in Northeast Texas, and this house may
represent that early settlement period. If that is the case, the 1890 date may be a conservative
one. Later portions and details, such as exposed rafter ends and tapered porch posts, appear to
be early 20th-century additions. The house retains many aspects of historic integrity, including
materials, workmanship, setting, association, and feeling. Although it’s original design has been
altered, the alterations fall within the historic period and exhibit substantial integrity to their periods

of construction. Thus, the house displays an evolution of building types and styles found in
Northeast Texas from the mid- to late 19th century through the early 20th century (i.e., 1920s).
This property is the oldest of the dwellings sampled in the current study. As archeological deposits
are present in the yard surrounding the primary structure, this site was also documented as an
archeological site (41CE384); as such, it represents the only historic-age structure that was also
recorded as an archeological site (see Chapter 7.0).

Historic Site 8

PCI identified 9 resources along FM 4227 that appear to be associated with the Pleasant
Plains Community, a 19th-century African American settlement northwest of New Summerfield
(Figures 8-32 to 8-33; Table 8-1). The multiple-acre Pleasant Plains Cemetery (Site 8A), located
on the east side of FM 4227, serves as the cornerstone of the community. Among the graves are
those of the Bolling, Chandler, Lacy, and Tennison families, as well as other founding members
of the community. Farther to the south and west along FM 4227 are scattered a handful of
historic-age dwellings, only 2 of which appear to be currently occupied; a vacant church and the
ruins of a parsonage (Site 8H); and an abandoned, 2-story school building (Site 8I). Other
resources identified in the Pleasant Plains Community consist of individual houses and
farmsteads and evidence of others now demolished. Historic dwellings range in type from a ca.
1900 L-plan house (Site 8C); to a ca. 1920 hall-and-parlor house (Site 8E); to 2 ca. 1920, frontgabled bungalows (Sites 8F and 8G). Additional buildings, such as barns, garages, and sheds,
are present throughout the area. Site 8C also contains a small family cemetery.
Although the community once supported a church, parsonage, school, community
cemetery, and scores of families (judging by census records and birth dates on tombstones), only
a handful of buildings survive, and only a few of them are occupied today. A manufactured house
stands on the site of a historic-age bungalow that is now vacant and in disrepair.

Site 8A—Pleasant Plains Cemetery
Pleasant Plains Cemetery is a large, multiple-acre, open tract of land dotted by family plots
and individual headstones (Figures 8-34 and 8-35; see Figure 8-32). Surrounded by a chain-link
fence, the cemetery contains 2 distinct sections of graves separated by a central pathway. The
southern grouping contains many of the older headstones, including those of Perry Bolling (18301916) and his wife Adline (1832-1897), Elder Sam A. Lacy (1856-1932) and his wife Lydia
Chandler Lacy (1862-1925), and Joseph Tennison (1852-1909), all prominent founders of the
African American Pleasant Plains Community. Numerous Bolling, Lacy, and Tennison graves,
among other family names, are found clustered together in family plots. Only a few trees stand
within the cemetery. The cemetery is mowed and in very good condition, indicating that it is still
in use and cared for by descendants. The earliest identified grave dates to 1883 and the most
recent to 2004 (as of PCI’s field visit in 2006). Burials span the entire period in between, indicating
that this has been an active cemetery for more than a century.
Headstones are primarily stone or marble and are typical of cemeteries of the period.
Some headstones bearing 19th-century dates appear to be replacements for earlier markers. A
number of markers feature photographs of the deceased (Figure 8-36). From the photographs
found on tombstones scattered throughout the cemetery, it appears to be an exclusively African
American burial ground.

Site 8B—Abandoned House Site
Across FM 4227 from the entrance to the cemetery (i.e., on the west side of road) lies a
cleared lot that may be a former site (Figure 8-37; see Figure 8-32). It appears to have been
recently graded. A house may have been moved from the site or have been demolished on-site
and the ground subsequently graded. The house doubtless was part of the Pleasant Plains
Community. The site lacks architectural integrity but may contain some archeological value,
though this locale is located outside the boundaries of the APE investigated during the
archeological survey.
Site 8C—L-Plan House and Farmstead
FM 4231 forms the southern boundary of the Pleasant Plains Cemetery and continues
southeastwards and then southwards to a small farm complex consisting of a small, ca. 1900, Lplan house, several outbuildings, and a small family cemetery (Figures 8-38 to 8-39; see Figure 832). The road rises above FM 4227 and terminates in a circular drive with the house and cemetery
on 1 side and the outbuildings on the other side of the circle.
The house is a vernacular, cross-gabled, L-plan house with a projecting side gable that
extends from the rear of the house. The rear gable wing forms a bay with windows on all 3 sides.
The house is sheathed in clapboard siding and features 1-over-1 light wood sash windows
throughout. The windows, door, and screens are original to the house. A transom surmounts the

front door, and 1 front corner is chamfered with a 1-over-1 light window. The attached, partial
façade front porch is supported by aluminum columns, possibly installed in the 1950s or 1960s.
The house has Folk Victorian aspects, such as the L-plan, bay window, and chamfered corner
that date it to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. The gables are very low-pitched for a Folk
Victorian, however, and the roof may have been altered at one time. Corrugated metal roofing
covers the original wood shingles. Despite relatively minor alterations, most of which occurred in
the historic period, the house is in good condition, is currently occupied, and retains its historic
integrity to a large degree.
Site 8C also contains several outbuildings, only one of which was clearly visible from the
public right-of-way. It is a front-gabled garage sheathed in corrugated metal with a standing-seam
metal roof and double hasp-hung doors. It is in only fair condition but retains its historic character
to a degree.
A small family cemetery with about 6 graves lies to the west of the house. Several granite
markers are visible and flowers and other memorabilia mark other graves within a chain-linkfenced enclosure.
Site 8C appears to be one of the most intact farmsteads in the Pleasant Plains area.

Site 8D—House Ruins and Barn
On the west side of FM 4227, just south of its intersection with FM 4231, lie a barn and
the ruins of a house that was likely associated with it (Figures 8-40 to 8-41; see Figure 8-32). The
barn is a large, 1-story, front-gabled, agricultural building with wood siding and a standing-seam
or V-crimp metal roof with exposed rafter ends. A house site is evidenced by remnants of brick
foundation piers, part of a brick chimney, and iris plants around the footprint of the house. A frontgabled bungalow with orange trim lies on a wooded hill east of the barn, but no access could be
found. The roof pitch, materials, and exposed rafter ends indicate that the barn dates from the
1920s to 1950s, but it possesses no other distinguishing features and is in poor condition. As
stated previously, only pieces of the former house survive, and another house on or near the site
is inaccessible from FM 4227.
Site 8E—Hall-and-Parlor Plan House
On the north side of FM 4227, across the street from the barn on Site 8D, lies a small, 2room house (Figure 8-42; see Figure 8-32). It is a side-gabled, hall-and-parlor plan, frame
dwelling with flush wood siding and corrugated metal roof with exposed rafter ends. The windows
are boarded over, but their dimensions indicate that they were probably 1-over-1 light wood sash.
The door is a typical early 20th-century paneled door with glazing in the upper half. Although the
hall-and-parlor plan type was common in Northeast Texas in the mid-19th century, the materials
of this resource indicate that it is of early to mid-20th-century construction. It is vacant and in poor
condition but retains integrity of design, materials, location, setting, and association.

Site 8F—Waldo Tennison House
The Waldo Tennison House is a large, front-gabled, frame bungalow with an almost full
façade, front-gabled porch supported by aluminum porch posts that replaced the original wooden
posts (Figure 8-43; see Figure 8-32). The roof is composition shingle with metal flashing, and the
house features exposed rafter ends typical of Craftsman-influenced bungalows of the 1910s and
1920s. The main entry, centered in the primary elevation, is a wood-panel door with glazing in
the upper half. It is flanked by 2 large windows, 1 of which may have been enlarged into a door
opening into another front room. The main window type is 1-over-1 light double-hung sash. A
red brick chimney emerges from the ridgeline about halfway through the house.
Waldo Tennison, the descendant of one of the community’s early founders, built this house
in the 1920s, according to his granddaughter, Rene Browning (Browning 2006). Tennison was
active in the church and other civic activities of this agricultural community. The house is vacant,
but descendants still own the property and have a manufactured house on the site. Despite its
poor to fair condition and the removal of the original porch posts, the house retains significant
integrity of design, materials, location, setting, feeling, and association.
Site 8G—Front-Gabled Bungalow
To the southwest of the Waldo Tennison House lies a second, somewhat smaller, frontgabled bungalow of the same period (Figure 8-44; see Figure 8-32). The half-façade porch is

inset under the gabled roof. Entry to the house is from the porch but was not visible due to its
distance from the public right-of-way. Originally, the siding was some type of weatherboard like
that on the Waldo Tennison House, but it has been covered with asphalt sheeting patterned to
look like brick. The roofing material is composition shingle, and a red brick chimney pierces the
slope toward the rear of the house. Windows are 1-over-1 wood sash. The porch is supported
by a single wood post at the corner. Although the siding has been replaced, the house retains
sufficient integrity to be recognizable to its period of significance.
Site 8H—Pleasant Plains Church and Parsonage
The Pleasant Plains Church is a ca. 1970, front-gabled frame building with a small, frontgabled, vestibule-like porch supported by paired 4-by-4 posts (Figure 8-45; see Figure 8-32).
Clad in aluminum siding, the sanctuary is capped with a composition-shingle roof. The current
building replaced a historic church on this site. A small-frame building in poor condition lies on
the church site and may date to the previous church. Historical records reference a “parsonage,”
but the small-frame building appears to have been a storage shed. The church is not a historicage property at the time of the survey and was therefore not evaluated. The “parsonage” is in
such poor condition that it no longer retains integrity of design, materials, workmanship or feeling.

Site 8I—Pleasant Plains School
Accessed only by a trail through the woods, a 2-story, frame school house stands among
the underbrush about 68.6 meters (225.0 feet) east of the church (Figure 8-46; see Figure 8-32).
Now vacant, this was once the most substantial building in the Pleasant Plains Community.
Teachers may have lived in the building as well. The school house is a 2-story, frame structure
clad in weatherboard siding and capped by a front-gabled, corrugated metal roof with exposed
rafter ends. Windows throughout are 4-over-4 light wood sash. Historic deed records indicate
that the school lot dates to the 19th century, though this building most likely was built in the early
20th century, possibly about 1920. Although in only fair to poor condition, the school retains
integrity of location, design, materials, setting, feeling, and association. This is a very significant
property in the context of the Pleasant Plains Community.
No single building or structure within the Pleasant Plains Community is individually eligible
for listing in the NRHP due to alterations and/or condition. As surviving Freedmen’s Villages are
rare and fast disappearing from the Texas landscape, however, and because little is known about
African American lives in the early years after Emancipation, the Pleasant Plains Community
possesses extraordinary historical significance. The community therefore may be eligible for
listing in the NRHP as a historic district, and individual properties may be considered contributing
or noncontributing elements of the district. Among the district’s contributing features are the
Pleasant Plains Cemetery (Site 8A), the L-Plan House and Farmstead (Site 8C), the Hall-and-

Parlor Plan House (Site 8E), the Waldo Tennison House (Site 8F), the Front-Gabled Bungalow
(Site 8G), and the Pleasant Plains School (Site 8I), all of which are related to this Freedman’s
village. As the Pleasant Plains Community is located beyond the physical edges of the APE,
none of the contributing properties were recorded as archeological sites, though it is possible that
1 or more of these resources possess archeological significance.

8.5

HISTORIC CONTEXT

The sample of historic-age resources described in this chapter derive from 2 different
settlement initiatives—(1) the establishment of a Freedman’s colony by emancipated African
Americans in the 1870s and (2) widely dispersed Anglo-American farmsteads dating to the early
20th century. As settlement began in the nearby New Summerfield area as early as the early
19th century, it is possible that earlier historic-age resources exist in the vicinity.
Although the Spanish explored parts of what are now Smith and Cherokee counties during
a late 17th-century (1691 to 1693) expedition to the Red River, they lost interest in the area until
they learned of French trading ventures among the Caddo Indians in 1705. Spanish authorities,
wishing to establish a strong and permanent presence to discourage French incursions in the
area, sent Captain Domingo Ramon to establish a line of missions and a presidio in East Texas.
Ramon founded a mission among the Neches Indians. Between 1716 and 1721, the Spanish
occupied, abandoned, and reoccupied Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas Mission.

HJN 050082 AR

325

Chapter 8.0: Results of Historic Architecture Survey and Historic/Archival Research

Ultimately, the Spanish left the mission in 1730 but established a foothold in Northeast Texas at
Nacogdoches.
Settlement of the far-flung territory was slow. The Spanish made land grants to American
merchants William Barr and Peter Davenport in 1798, but the 2 men declined to settle the grants.
About 1820, Indians, including Cherokees, Delawares, Shawnees, and Kickapoos, began moving
into lands above the Camino Real. Within a few years, Anglo-Americans began settling on
Cherokee claims, and the Mexican government, recently independent of Spain, had to settle title
disputes between the rival groups. The Mexicans favored the Americans’ claims, and, in 1826,
the government gave empresarios David G. Burnet and Joseph Vehlein title to the lands in
Nacogdoches County north and south of the Camino Real, respectively. Another decade passed
before substantial American settlement took place in the region.
In 1834, George May and William F. Williams were among the first to attempt settlement
in the William Gates Survey, which may lie within the proposed Lake Columbia APE. The 2 men
and their families were forced out by Cherokees (Templeton 1986:9). Land disputes between
Indians and American settlers led to violence and the eventual expulsion of Indians from
Nacogdoches County in 1839. White settlers quickly occupied abandoned Indian farms and
several small communities arose. Cherokee County was carved out of Nacogdoches County on
April 11, 1846. A county government was organized on July 13 of that year, and the town of
Rusk, then home to only a single family, was named as the county seat.
The prospect of statehood and the outcome of the Mexican War (1846 to 1848)
encouraged more settlement in the county. Anglo settlers first occupied the improved farms
vacated by the Cherokee and then settled along the creeks. Much like the Cherokees before
them, who brought their traditions with them from Georgia and the Carolinas, the new settlers
built log houses, cultivated small patches of vegetables and grains, maintained livestock
(including cattle and swine), and hunted game such as deer and wild turkey (Templeton 1986:13).
Two years after statehood, Cherokee County was the third-largest county in Texas with a
population of 6,673. Like the Cherokee, most of the new settlers hailed from the American South,
bringing with them the economic traditions and social customs of that region. Most were small
farmers who owned but a few slaves. By 1850, the agricultural census showed 454 established
farms in Cherokee County. Most were tracts, averaging only 42.0 acres apiece, but
14 encompassed 200.0 acres or more. Cotton was not yet a dominant crop in 1850—3 farmers
produced a total of 60 bales that year, but most grew none. In fact, Cherokee County agriculture
could be characterized as subsistence-level in those first years after statehood. Forty percent of
the county’s farms grew large quantities of peas and beans, and all of the farmers raised corn for
corn meal and livestock consumption. Corn meal was so essential to the pioneer diet that grist
mills were usually the first industries established within a community (Templeton 1986:14).
By 1860, the county’s population nearly doubled to a total of 12,098 residents, more than
one-third (3,250) of whom were slaves. Two were free persons of color, and 14 bore Spanish
surnames. Less than one-third (29%) of the Anglo families owned slaves. However,
32 plantations in Cherokee County counted 20 or more slaves, and 7 families owned more than
40 slaves. Since 1850, cotton had risen to become a principal crop in East Texas, and families

326

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

with large numbers of slaves likely grew cotton, a labor-intensive cash crop. In 1860, Cherokee
County produced 6,251 bales of cotton, a marked increase over 1850. Grain crops far exceeded
cotton production; however, farmers grew 21,000 bushels of wheat and 496,000 bushels of corn,
much of which was used to feed livestock.
After the Civil War, central Cherokee County continued to be a land largely populated by
small farmers. This trend continued well into the early 20th century. The census of 1920
counted 37,633 residents in the county, many of whom lived on the 7,230 recorded farms.
A little more than 4,000 farmers were native-born whites and 1,568 were African
Americans. Only 12 farms were run by foreign-born whites. Apparently some farmers
cultivated more than one farm. Individual farms were relatively small in size, ranging
between 20 and 50 acres and averaging about 42 acres apiece. Nearly 500 farms
contained less than 20 acres, barely enough land for a good-sized garden. Only five farms
in the county were larger than 1,000 acres in 1920 (Fourteenth Census of the United
States, Agriculture, 1920, II, 690).

An increase in the county’s population, combined with an increase in the price of farmland,
resulted in the rise of tenant farming in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1920, the
number of tenant farmers (2,825) slightly exceeded the number of farmers who owned and
occupied their own land (2,819). White farmers were more likely to own their own land, with
2,200 farms owned by white farmers and 520 owned by African Americans (Fourteenth Census
of the United States, 1920, II, 690). Whites apparently had greater educational opportunities as
only 8.5% of the white population was illiterate while 24% of the African American population
could not read or write (Fourteenth Census of the United States, Population, 1920, p. 993).
8.5.1

New Summerfield

The community from which New Summerfield takes its name emerged in the 1840s with
the arrival of Anglo-American farmers and their households, including slaves. The community
resulted from the merging of several small settlements consisting of related families and friends
who came to Texas about the same time. Early pioneers in the area included the Dodsons, Jays,
Morrises, Gills, and Tennisons. Those who lived east of Mud Creek were listed as residents of
Lone Star because of their proximity to the Lone Star post office. The earliest recorded church in
the area was Union Methodist Church, established sometime before 1878.
It was not until 1897 that the name Summerfield came to be associated with the
community. Two years earlier, Caley Amos Summers had donated land on his farm for a school
to be located near the Rusk-Troup Road. The school grew to become one of the county’s most
important educational centers east of Mud Creek. In 1906, it was relocated near Union Chapel
Methodist Church, and its descendant school continues to serve the community.
In 1897, Summers sold a piece of his property near the school to Isaac Tipton. In
December of that year, the US Postal Service approved a post office at Tipton’s store. Because
the post office was on land previously owned by Summers, it was dubbed Summerfield, and the
surrounding community embraced the name. The post office was short-lived, however, and was
discontinued in 1905, and area mail was routed through Ponta. In 1938, when the need for a post
office was reestablished, another Summerfield, Texas, already existed, so the residents of the

area renamed their community “New Summerfield.” The school, store, and post office formed the
nucleus of the dispersed village and other businesses opened around this core.
8.5.2

Pleasant Plains Community

The Pleasant Plains Community is located about 24.1 km (15.0 miles) northeast of Rusk,
the county seat of Cherokee County. It is centered on a bend in FM 4227, west of SH 110 and
northwest of the town of New Summerfield, east of the proposed Lake Columbia APE. It may
have been one of several small antebellum farming communities that jointly comprised presentday New Summerfield; however, the origin of the community and the name Pleasant Plains is
unknown. In the post-Civil War era, Pleasant Plains became associated with an African American
farming community, or Freedman’s Village.
Among the earliest known inhabitants of the Pleasant Plains Freedman’s colony were
Perry Bolling (a.k.a. Bowling), Sandy Chandler, and Theofilas Lacy, all of whom registered to vote
in 1867 as “colored” people (Cherokee County Voter Registration Records, August 2, 1867).
Bolling was listed as being from Alabama, Chandler from Mississippi, and Lacy from Tennessee.
It is not known if they came to Texas before or after the Civil War, but it is almost certain that all
3 were emancipated slaves. Bolling eventually came to own more than 500.0 acres of land in the
Gates League. The Tennisons were another prominent African American family in the
community. A doctor named Matthew Tennison lived in the New Summerfield area (Lone Star)
as early as the 1840s, and the African American Tennisons may have been associated with this
family before the war.
The first record of African Americans in the Pleasant Plains area is a deed from Andrew
J. Smith and his wife, Anna Bowman Smith, to Perry Bowling dated December 23, 1871. Bowling
was noted as a “Free Man of Color.” Bowling paid $424 as a down payment with a promise of
another $250 for a 109.0-acre tract of land “on the waters of Mud Creek” out of the William Gates
League. The deed references a “school lot” adjacent to the parcel in question, and this is likely
the lot set aside as a school for African American children (Deed Record 339).
By 1896, 43 children were enrolled in the school. During the mid-1930s, the settlement
had a church, school, cemetery, and a number of houses (Long 2006). It is not known when the
school closed, but the abandoned 2-story frame building is still extant in the woods behind the
church. In the 1970s, the original church, known both as Pleasant View Church and Earl’s Chapel
for Colored People, was replaced with the current building on FM 4227 (Browning 2006). By the
1990s, the replacement church was vacated. Today, a few historic-age houses and a few
manufactured houses still stand along the road. The cemetery remains active, and the grounds
are well maintained.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following conclusions were derived from physical inspection of historic-age resources
during the baseline historic structures reconnaissance survey conducted for the Lake Columbia
Water Supply Project. PCI examined 7 historic-age resources identified by Horizon personnel
during the archeological survey of the APE and identified 1 additional resource, the Pleasant

328

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Plains Community, which consists of 9 related historic-age sites. PCI visited these sites;
examined them in the field; compared them with similar, contemporaneous properties in the
region; and conducted primary and secondary source research to determine significant historical
associations, if any. PCI examined resources associated with the Pleasant Plains Community,
which may possess considerable historic significance as a Freedman’s settlement. Only
resources accessible from FM 4227 or identified by Pleasant Plains residents were examined for
this project. However, future survey efforts in the area may be warranted due to the rare and
significant nature of the community and its proximity to the proposed Lake Columbia APE.
Although lands within the Mud Creek basin were surveyed and assigned to grantees as
early as the 1830s (e.g., the William Gates Survey in the APE was surveyed and recorded on
June 2, 1835), none of the identified historic-age resources appear to date from this period
(Survey Records, Vol. A). In fact, little Anglo settlement took place in the APE or its environs
before the 1840s. Based on archival and deed records and the extant resources in the project
area, land in the APE probably wasn’t developed until the post-Civil War period. The earliest
extant dwelling in the APE appears to be Historic Site 7, a hall-and-parlor plan house
conservatively dated to 1890. It may be older, but it probably does not pre-date Reconstruction,
when an influx of people from the old South began to filter into Texas and settled previously
undeveloped tracts of land. Later additions to the house, including the porch and primary façade,
date to the 1910s or 1920s.
Pleasant Plains may be among the earliest communities in or adjacent to the APE, with
known occupation by 1871 (Perry Bolling). Archival and deed records indicate a thriving
Freedman’s community from the 1870s through the 1930s. Headstones in the cemetery indicate
burials as early as 1883, and unmarked graves are probably older still. No other cultural
resources from this period, such as dwellings, barns, sheds, or wells, were identified, but the
survey was not comprehensive. A ca. 1900, cross-gabled, L-plan house (Historic Site 8C) is the
oldest identified dwelling in the Pleasant Plains Community. Again, judging by the late 19th- to
early 20th-century population of the community, other early resources may exist off the main road
of FM 4227.
With the exception of Pleasant Plains, itself a farming community, the remaining historicage resources are grouped on fairly isolated, individual farmsteads within the APE. The majority
of historic-age resources identified in the APE are farm or ranch houses with agricultural
resources such as hay barns, horse barns, vehicle barns, chicken coops, cisterns, feeding
troughs, and sheds grouped behind or beside them in a farm yard complex. In all cases, the
primary house is accessed by an unimproved two-track or dirt road leading from a public road to
the building complex. Almost all have metal or wire mesh gates denoting private property. In
most cases, the house is the first resource seen from the private road; it presents the “public” face
of the farm to the visitor. Several houses have cisterns or their remains. Small auxiliary features,
such as sheds, might be located near the house, but the principal agricultural resources, such as
vehicle or animal barns, corrals, and work sheds, are usually grouped at a small distance from
the main house. Few landscape features were found other than walkways, but some plantings
around house foundations were noted. Some sites were abandoned and overgrown, while others
were still occupied, with livestock and pastureland in use.

Chapter 8.0: Results of Historic Architecture Survey and Historic/Archival Research

Historic Site 1 consists of a ca. 1925 frame bungalow and a large horse or dairy barn.
Both resources were overgrown with vegetation, and related features, such as wells or cisterns,
were not observed. Historic Sites 2 and 3 are nearly identical, consisting of ca. 1925 front-gabled
bungalows and associated agricultural buildings, including barns and sheds. A single road
accesses these 2 sites, and small two-track lanes peel off the main dirt road in opposite directions
to the 2 farmsteads. Historic Site 4 is a ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow and chicken house.
Historic Site 5 consists of a ca. 1955 Ranch-style house and contemporaneous agricultural
outbuildings. Historic Site 6 contains a ca. 1940 front-gabled bungalow and a ca. 1965 sidegabled house (the ca. 1940 house is the newest of the frame bungalows in the project area and
was likely a pre-World War II farm house). Historic Site 7 is a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor plan house
with a hipped porch and exposed rafter ends more common to bungalows of the early
20th century; like the other dwellings in the APE, this was probably a farm house.
Historic Site 8, the Pleasant Plains Community, contains the only civic properties observed
during the survey and appears to represent a rare example of an African American Freedman’s
village formed after Emancipation. It consists of several farmsteads (Sites 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F, and
8G) with houses dating from ca. 1900 to ca. 1925, a cemetery (Site 8A) with headstones ranging
from 1883 to 2004, a possible former house site (8B), a ca. 1970 church situated on an earlier
church site (Site 8H), and a ca. 1920 school (Site 8I). Barns, sheds, and other agricultural
resources dating to the 1920s and 1930s stand near the houses on their 10.0- to 20.0-acre plots.
From the apparent construction dates, this community appears to have been founded in ca. 1870,
peaked in the 1920s, and declined thereafter, though it is still a functioning community today. The
only post-World War II construction in the community consists of a single manufactured house
erected on Site 8F and a now-vacant church building (Site 8H) constructed in the 1970s. The
Pleasant Plains Community is located approximately 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) east of the APE
along FM 4727 in an upland setting between South Caney and Bridge creeks. While this resource
is located at some distance from the APE, the resource was nevertheless recorded in order to
evaluate the impact of any potential indirect effects of the development of the proposed Lake
Columbia reservoir.
In Horizon’s interim report describing the results of baseline survey activities, Historic
Site 8, the Pleasant Plains Community, was recommended as being potentially eligible for listing
in the NRHP as a historic district (Owens et al. 2006). Historic Sites 1, 2, 3, and 7 were
recommended to be of unknown eligibility for listing in the NRHP (Owens et al. 2006). Further
research was recommended to determine the historic significance of these resources and to make
final recommendations regarding NRHP eligibility. Because of their age, condition, and/or
extensive alterations, Historic Sites 4, 5, and 6 were recommended as ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP (Owens et al. 2006). The recommendations presented below are the original
recommendations from Horizon’s interim report (Owens et al. 2006). The THC’s final
determinations of eligibility, presented in its comment letter on the interim report dated January 10,
2007, are summarized at the end of this chapter.

330

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Historic Site 1—Bungalow and Large Barn (ca. 1925)
Due to its poor condition and loss of historic fabric, the house does not appear to be eligible
for the NRHP; however, the barn retains its architectural integrity to a large degree and,
furthermore, is a distinctive example of its type. The barn may be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion A, for its historic associations with the agricultural development of
Cherokee County, and under Criterion C, for its architectural merit. Further historic research
would be necessary to make this determination.
Historic Site 2—Bungalow and Agricultural Resources (ca. 1925)
The house is a modest and typical example of an early 20th-century bungalow, is in poor
condition, is not architecturally distinguished, and is not associated with any known historic
persons or events. The 2-bay vehicle barn is a good example of its type but, on its own, is not of
sufficient significance to be NRHP-eligible. Other features on this farmstead lack sufficient
distinction to warrant listing on the NRHP. Individually, none of these resources are eligible for
NRHP listing; however, together with the resources on Historic Site 3, they may contribute to a
potential historic district. Further research would be necessary to make this determination.
Historic Site 3—Bungalow and Agricultural Resources (ca. 1925)
The bungalow on this site is almost identical—a mirror image—to the one across the lane
(Historic Site 2); however, it, too, is in poor condition and lacks architectural merit. On the same
site are a board-and-batten shed and 1.5-story barn and corral, none of which are outstanding
examples of their types. None of the resources on this site merit individual recognition for NRHP
listing; however, as a group with Historic Site 2, they may contribute to a historic district. Further
information regarding property ownership and use would be necessary to determine NRHP
eligibility.
Historic Site 4—Pyramidal-Roofed Bungalow (ca. 1910)
This early 20th-century bungalow has suffered integrity loss by removal, replacement, or
deterioration of original building fabric. Two sides of the building have had their original siding
removed and replaced with plywood and false battens. The original full-façade front porch, a
character-defining feature of this type of bungalow, collapsed years ago and has subsequently
been removed, and the original 4-over-4 light windows have been replaced. As a result of these
alterations, the house lacks sufficient integrity to merit listing in the NRHP under any criteria.
Historic Site 5—Ranch Style House and Outbuildings (ca. 1955)
This mid-20th-century, Ranch-style house has been altered by several additions, including
a screened porch across the front façade and the replacement of significant building materials,
such as siding and windows. It retains its original stone roof, which is a good example of its type
and a character-defining feature of houses from this era; however, other alterations preclude its
listing on the NRHP.

HJN 050082 AR

331

Chapter 8.0: Results of Historic Architecture Survey and Historic/Archival Research

Historic Site 6—Bungalow (ca. 1940) and Side-Gabled House (ca. 1965)
The ca. 1965 house was not of historic age at the time of PCI’s survey in 2006 and was
therefore considered not eligible for the NRHP. The ca. 1940 bungalow has had almost all of its
original building fabric, including siding and windows, replaced; is a late and undistinguished
example of its type; and is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Historic Site 7—Hall-and-Parlor House (ca. 1890)
This hall-and-parlor house is conservatively dated to ca. 1890 and may be much older.
Even at ca. 1890, it is the oldest of the houses examined and represents the region’s early AngloAmerican settlement period. Although it has received numerous additions, including a hippedroof front porch, the modifications appear to date to the historic period and have therefore taken
on significance of their own. More research is necessary to document the history of this building
and determine if it is eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Historic Site 8—Pleasant Plains Community
Visible resources along FM 4227 indicate that the Pleasant Plains Community may be
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district. It is a rare surviving example of a
Freedman’s colony and warrants further research and documentation. Table 8-2 lists the
contributing/noncontributing status of individual resources identified in the potential district.
Based on its review of Horizon’s interim report (Owens et al. 2005), the THC determined
in a comment letter addressed to the USACE dated January 10, 2007 that a portion of Historic
Site 1 (ca. 1925 bungalow only), Historic Site 2 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources),
Historic Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidalroofed bungalow), Historic Site 5 (ca. 955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), and Historic
Site 6 (ca. 1940 bungalow and ca. 1955 side-gabled house) were ineligible for listing on the
NRHP.

The THC further determined that the ca. 1925 barn on Historic Site 1 is a very unusual
building, exhibiting a level of refinement not typical in vernacular agricultural structures, and is
eligible for listing on the NRHP under Criterion C in the area of Architecture. The THC also stated
that the ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house on Historic Site 7 is eligible for listing on the NRHP under
Criterion C in the area of Architecture and Criterion A in the area of Settlement. Finally, the THC
concurred that Historic Site 8, which retains a number of intact buildings, including a school and
a cemetery, is eligible for listing on the NRHP under Criterion A in the areas of Settlement and
Ethnic Heritage/Black for its association with the Freedman’s community of Pleasant Plains.

9.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Baseline cultural resources investigations conducted for the Lake Columbia Water Supply
Project included initial archeological, geomorphological, and historic structures surveys and
limited historical and archival research. The goal of the baseline investigations was to survey a
sample of environments within the Lake Columbia APE in the interest of obtaining representative
information about the types of cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE.
For reasons discussed in Chapter 1.0, the purpose of this sample survey strategy was to provide
the USACE with enough information to characterize the types of cultural resources that are likely
to occur within the APE rather than to provide an exhaustive listing of all cultural resources that
actually exist within the APE. As this survey was not designed to provide 100% intensive survey
coverage of the project area, it has been designated as a baseline, or “Phase 1a,” cultural
resources study to distinguish the current phase of survey-level investigations from any future
survey activities that may be necessary to develop a comprehensive inventory of cultural
resources within the proposed Lake Columbia’s APE.

9.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

At the survey level of investigation, the principal objectives of cultural resources
management are to inventory the cultural resources in the APE of the proposed undertaking and
to collect sufficient data to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the cultural
resources possess significance. As the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project falls under both
federal and state jurisdiction, the significance of cultural resources would be evaluated based on
their eligibility for listing on the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Thus, the primary cultural
resource management goals of the baseline investigations were as follows:



Locate all historic-age and aboriginal (i.e., prehistoric, protohistoric, and early historic)
cultural resources that occur within the sampled portions of the APE.



Evaluate the significance of these resources based on their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development and
the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.
While a historic-age resource is required to be evaluated against NRHP criteria under
Section 106 of the NHPA, there are other categories under which a historic-age resource may be
evaluated, such as Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHL), locally designated resources,

336

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHM), and cemeteries. These 4 types of resources must also
rise to the level of significance using NRHP criteria to be considered eligible for NRHP listing.
Historic-age resources with an RTHL designation, local designation, or those with historical
markers or cemeteries are not automatically considered eligible for NRHP listing under
Section 106. None of the surveyed resources has been listed in the NRHP or as an RTHL, SAL,
or OTHM.
To qualify for listing in the NRHP, a resource must be historically significant; that is, it must
represent a significant part of the history, architecture, archeology, engineering, or culture of an
area, and it must have the characteristics that make it a good representative of resources
associated with that aspect of the past. NRHP Criteria A, B, C, and D were applied in the
evaluation of the historic-age resources documented in this report, looking for resources that are
representative of the historic contexts (Criterion A); are associated with the life of an important
person, such as those mentioned in the historic contexts (Criterion B); are associated with
architectural and/or engineering qualities (Criterion C); or have the potential to yield information
about human history (Criterion D).
Criterion A—Events
To be considered for listing under Criterion A, a property must be associated with one or
more events important in the defined historic context. Criterion A recognizes resources
associated with single events, such as the founding of a town, or with a pattern of events, repeated
activities, or historic trends, such as the gradual rise of a port city's prominence in trade and
commerce. The event or trends, however, must clearly be important within the associated context
of settlement, in the case of the town, or development of a maritime economy, in the case of the
port city. Moreover, the property must have an important association with the event or historic
trends, and it must retain historic integrity.
Criterion B—Persons
Criterion B applies to resources associated with individuals whose specific contributions
to history can be identified and documented. Persons “significant in our past” refers to individuals
whose activities are demonstrably important within a local, state, or national historic context. The
criterion is generally restricted to those resources that illustrate (rather than commemorate) a
person's important achievements.
Criterion C—Design or Construction
This criterion applies to resources significant for their physical design or construction,
including such elements as architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, and artwork. To
be eligible under this criterion, a property must meet at least one of the following requirements—
embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; represent the work
of a master; possess high artistic value; or represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction.

HJN 050082 AR

337

Chapter 9.0: Summary and Recommendations

Criterion D—Information Potential
Certain important research questions about human history can only be answered by the
actual physical material of cultural resources. Criterion D encompasses the resources that have
the potential to answer, in whole or in part, those types of research questions. The most common
type of property nominated under this criterion is the archeological site (or a district composed of
archeological sites). Buildings, objects, and structures (or districts composed of these property
types), however, can also be eligible for their information potential. Criterion D has
2 requirements, which must both be met for a property to qualify—the property must have, or
have had, information to contribute to our understanding of human history or prehistory, and the
information must be considered important.
For listing on the NRHP, a property must meet at least one of the criteria described above
and must also possess enough integrity to convey a sense of a particular time and place. These
considerations of integrity include the following.
Location
Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the
historic event occurred. The relationship between the property and its location is often important
to understanding why the property was created or why something happened. The actual location
of a historic property, complemented by its setting, is particularly important in recapturing the
sense of historic events and persons. Except in rare cases, the relationship between a property
and its historic associations is destroyed if the property is moved.
Design
Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure, and
style of a property. It results from conscious decisions made during the original conception and
planning of a property (or its significant alteration) and applies to activities as diverse as
community planning, engineering, architecture, and landscape architecture. Design includes
such elements as organization of space, proportion, scale, technology, ornamentation, and
materials.
Setting
Setting is the physical environment of a historic property. Whereas location refers to the
specific place where a property was built or an event occurred, setting refers to the character of
the place in which the property played its historical role. It involves how, not just where, the
property is situated and its relationship to surrounding features and open space.
Materials
Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular
period of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a historic property. The choice
and combination of materials reveal the preferences of those who created the property and
indicate the availability of particular types of materials and technologies. Indigenous materials

338

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

are often the focus of regional building traditions and thereby help define an area's sense of time
and place.
Workmanship
Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during
any given period in history or prehistory. It is the evidence of artisans' labor and skill in
constructing or altering a building, structure, object, or site. Workmanship can apply to the
property as a whole or to its individual components. It can be expressed in vernacular methods
of construction and plain finishes or in highly sophisticated configurations and ornamental
detailing. It can be based on common traditions or innovative period techniques.
Feeling
Feeling is a property's expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period
of time. It results from the presence of physical features that, taken together, convey the
property's historic character. For example, a rural historic district retaining original design,
materials, workmanship, and setting will relate the feeling of agricultural life in the 19th century.
Association
Association is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic
property. A property retains association if it is the place where the event or activity occurred and
is sufficiently intact to convey that relationship to an observer. Like feeling, association requires
the presence of physical features that convey a property's historic character.
Historic integrity is crucial if a resource is to illustrate significant aspects of the past.
Resources should resemble their historic appearance by retaining materials, design features, and
construction from the period of significance, conveying a sense of a particular period in history.
When assessing the integrity of a resource, the NRHP does consider entities whose
components may lack individual distinction, but, over time, harsh environmental exposure,
vandalism, abandonment, and neglect have caused the deterioration of various individual
components. Historians assessed eligibility in terms of the 4 criteria for listing and assessed the
integrity of each historic-age resource within the applicable NRHP contexts.

9.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,

HJN 050082 AR

339

Chapter 9.0: Summary and Recommendations

city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are eligible
for designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethnic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under
Section 26.8 of Part 2 of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may
designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;

SUMMARY OF BASELINE INVENTORY RESULTS

The baseline cultural resources inventory survey resulted in the documentation of
37 previously unrecorded archeological sites, including 30 aboriginal sites, 4 historic-age sites,
and 3 sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural components. The historic
structures reconnaissance survey resulted in the recording of 8 historic resources, including
1 historic structure that was also documented as an archeological site (i.e., Historic Site 7 and
site 41CE384 are the same). Seven of the historic structures sites are stand-alone properties,
while 1 resource—the African American Freedman’s community of Pleasant Plains—consists of
9 related historic-age sites.

Archeological Survey Results
During the baseline survey investigations, Horizon documented 37 previously unrecorded
archeological sites, including 30 aboriginal sites, 4 historic-age sites, and 3 sites containing both
aboriginal and historic-age cultural components. Based on available information, cultural
components on aboriginal sites consist of approximately equal numbers of ceramic sherd and
lithic artifact scatters that likely represent a range of Caddoan campsites, hamlets, and villages
on the one hand, and lithic artifact scatters that may represent aceramic Caddoan or earlier
PaleoIndian or Archaic period encampments on the other hand. In addition, Early Ceramic period
components are suspected to exist on several sites that also have Caddoan components, and 1,
or possibly 2, single-component Early Ceramic period sites were also identified. Based on
available data, aboriginal Archaic, Early Ceramic, and Caddoan components are likely
represented among the archeological sites, providing evidence of aboriginal occupation in the
Mud Creek basin as early as the Early or Middle Archaic period (ca. 4500 to 3000 B.C.) and
extending through the Late Caddoan period (ca. A.D. 1400 to 1680). No obvious cultural
components associated with earlier PaleoIndian or Early Archaic periods were documented,
though any of the lithic scatter sites may be found to date to these early periods, and an isolated
Calf Creek projectile point recorded as site 41CE374 may suggest either an Early or Middle
Archaic period presence . Similarly, no clear evidence of protohistoric or early historic aboriginal
components has been observed to date. Many of the aboriginal sites appear to contain multiple
cultural components, but these often cannot be clearly separated based on available information.
Historic-age components on multiple-component sites and on exclusively historic-age sites
include historic farmsteads, possible industrial features, and bridges, dating mostly from the late
19th to early 20th centuries.
Based on data gathered during survey-level investigations, 36 of the 37 archeological sites
(41CE367-380 and 41CE382-403) recorded during the baseline archeological survey were
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Section 106 of the
NHPA and for designation as SALs under the Antiquities Code of Texas. One site (41CE381)
was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No
further investigations were recommended on site 41CE381, but further testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining 36 sites.
It should be noted that a standing historic-age structure present on site 41CE384, a ca. 1890 halland-parlor house, was determined by the THC to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion C in the area of Architecture and Criterion A in the area of Settlement (see below);
however, the archeological deposits on this site are of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D based on their research value.
The THC concurred with these
recommendations, which were presented in Owens et al. (2006), in a comment letter addressed
to the USACE dated January 10, 2007.

In addition to the 37 archeological sites, 25 IOs were recorded during the baseline
archeological survey. In general, whenever any cultural materials were observed during the
survey, the area surrounding the initial find was further shovel tested to determine the nature,
extent, and quantity of any associated cultural materials. By definition, IOs are cultural resources
localities that did not warrant formal designation as archeological sites because cultural resources
were present in extremely small numbers and lacked any contextual associations that would help
identify the functional or chronological associations of the items. In practice, any occurrence of a
single, isolated artifact in either surface or subsurface contexts that lacked any apparent
associations with other cultural resources or datable paleosols was designated as an IO unless
exceptional circumstances warranted its designation as a site (which occurred only in 1 instance
in the case of site 41CE374). Similarly, if very small numbers of artifacts were found within a
single shovel test and supplemental delineation shovel tests failed to produce any further
evidence of cultural materials, the artifacts from the single positive shovel test were designated
as an IO.
While the IOs encountered during the baseline archeological survey by definition lacked
sufficient manifestation of cultural resources to warrant designation as archeological sites, no
specific management recommendations are offered regarding the eligibility of these cultural
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs. Many of the IOs were found in
small clusters in proximity to 1 or more other IOs, in proximity to archeological sites, and/or in

344

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

proximity to landforms that may have represented possible locations for past habitation. Even
though additional delineation shovel tests surrounding these isolated finds failed to produce
additional cultural resources that would have resulted in recording the cultural materials as
archeological sites, the surface and subsurface scatters of cultural resources on many of the
archeological sites documented during this project were relatively sparse, and many sites
contained far more negative shovel tests (i.e., shovel tests lacking subsurface cultural resources)
than positive ones (i.e., shovel tests containing subsurface cultural resources). As such, in the
event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future, additional survey
efforts may be needed in the vicinity of the locations of IOs make sure nothing was overlooked.
Geomorphological Reconnaissance Survey Results
The baseline geomorphological investigations principally consisted of a limited
subsurface/stratigraphic examination of late Quaternary deposits at sample locations along Mud
Creek within the APE in order to form an impression of the temporal activity of the stream and the
potential of these deposits to contain prehistoric archeological sites.
The stratigraphy of Mud Creek was examined by means of subsurface investigations in
3 distinct areas in the lower, middle, and upper reaches of the APE (designated as Areas 1, 2,
and 3, respectively), and efforts were made to obtain a cross-section of the valley floor deposits
in each one of these areas by means of limited backhoe trenching and soil coring. The
geomorphic reconnaissance identified 3 alluvial stratigraphic units within the APE of the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project. Unit 1 consists of a sandy Pleistocene terrace, Unit 2 consists
of first terrace fill, and Unit 3 is recent alluvium. Although none of these deposits were directly
dated, the field evidence suggests that 2 of the 3 units are of Holocene age and have a potential
for buried archeological sites. More detailed work within the APE may discover additional alluvial
units and allow for mapping of the units already identified, thereby helping to refine expectations
about the locations and depths at which cultural resources sites might be encountered in areas
outside the high-probability zones identified prior to the initiation of the baseline archeological
survey.
Historic Structures Survey Results
The historic structures survey and accompanying historical and archival research
examined and documented 7 historic-age resources identified by Horizon during archeological
field investigations (including 1 archeological site containing a historic standing structure—
41CE384). In addition, architectural historians discovered an 8th historic-age resource—the
African American community of Pleasant Plains—which consists of 9 related historic-age sites.
Historic Site 1 consists of a ca. 1925 frame bungalow and a large horse or dairy barn.
Both resources were overgrown with vegetation, and related features, such as wells or cisterns,
were not observed. Historic Sites 2 and 3 are nearly identical, consisting of ca. 1925 front-gabled
bungalows and associated agricultural buildings, including barns and sheds. A single road
accesses these 2 sites, and small two-track lanes peel off the main dirt road in opposite directions
to the 2 farmsteads. Historic Site 4 is a ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow and chicken house.
Historic Site 5 consists of a ca. 1955 Ranch-style house and contemporaneous agricultural

HJN 050082 AR

345

Chapter 9.0: Summary and Recommendations

outbuildings. Historic Site 6 contains a ca. 1940 front-gabled bungalow and a ca. 1965 sidegabled house (the ca. 1940 house is the newest of the frame bungalows in the project area and
was likely a pre-World War II farm house). Historic Site 7 is a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor plan house
with a hipped porch and exposed rafter ends more common to bungalows of the early
20th century; like the other dwellings in the APE, this was probably a farm house.
Historic Site 8, the Pleasant Plains Community, contains the only civic properties observed
during the survey and appears to represent a rare example of an African American Freedman’s
Village formed after Emancipation. It consists of several farmsteads (Sites 8C, 8D, 8E, 8F, and
8G) with houses dating from ca. 1900 to ca. 1925, a cemetery (Site 8A) with headstones ranging
from 1883 to 2004, a possible former house site (8B), a ca. 1970 church situated on an earlier
church site (Site 8H), and a ca. 1920 school (Site 8I). Barns, sheds, and other agricultural
resources dating to the 1920s and 1930s stand near the houses on their 10.0- to 20.0-acre plots.
From the apparent construction dates, this community appears to have been founded in ca. 1870,
peaked in the 1920s, and declined thereafter, though it is still a functioning community today. The
only post-World War II construction in the community consists of a single manufactured house
erected on Site 8F and a now-vacant church building (Site 8H) constructed in the 1970s. The
Pleasant Plains Community is located approximately 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) east of the APE
along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 4727 in an upland setting between South Caney and Bridge
creeks; as such, it represents the only cultural resource documented during the baseline cultural
resources investigations that is not physically located within the APE. The resource was
nevertheless recorded in order to evaluate the impact of any potential indirect effects of the
development of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir.
The THC determined in a comment letter addressed to the USACE dated January 10,
2007, that a portion of Historic Site 1 (ca. 1925 bungalow only), Historic Site 2 (ca. 1925 bungalow
and agricultural resources), Historic Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources),
Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow), Historic Site 5 (ca. 1955 ranch-style house
and outbuildings), and Historic Site 6 (ca. 1940 bungalow and ca. 1955 side-gabled house) were
ineligible for listing on the NRHP. The THC further determined that a portion of Historic Site 1
(ca. 1925 barn only) and Historic Site 7 (ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) were eligible for listing
on the NRHP and that Historic Site 8 (the Pleasant Plains Community) was eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP as a historic district.

SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO CULTURAL RESOURCES
Lake Columbia Impoundment

Construction of the proposed Lake Columbia reservoir would result in the impoundment
of approximately 22.5 kilometers (14.0 miles) of the Mud Creek basin up to the 315.0-foot NGVD
elevation contour. Any cultural resources located at or below this elevation within the APE would
be subject to permanent inundation and may be disturbed as a result of ongoing erosive actions.
Twenty-two of the 37 recorded archeological sites are situated entirely at elevations lower than
315.0 feet NGVD and would be impacted by proposed reservoir impoundment. If any of these
22 archeological sites should be determined to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and/or for

346

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

designation as SALs, construction of the proposed reservoir impoundment would constitute an
adverse effect on any such historic properties.
One historic structures site (Historic Site 6) is similarly situated below 315.0 feet NGVD;
however, this site has been determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and would
therefore not constitute an adverse effect on historic properties.
Ongoing erosive forces associated with proposed reservoir impoundment may have
adverse cumulative effects on any historic properties located at or below the elevation at which
the normal pool would be maintained.
Additional survey would be necessary to inventory all cultural resources that exist within
the proposed impoundment area, and additional archeological testing and/or archival research
would be necessary to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of any known cultural resources
within the proposed impoundment area that are currently of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the
NRHP and for designation as SALs.
Lake Columbia Shoreline
The normal pool of the proposed reservoir would be maintained at an elevation of
315.0 feet NGVD, and ANRA would maintain additional acreage up to the 318.0-foot NGVD
elevation as a management zone. Three archeological sites and 6 historic structures sites are
located above the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation of the proposed reservoir but would be
located on or adjacent to the proposed shoreline. Eleven additional archeological sites would be
situated partially underwater (i.e., below the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation) and partially
along the shoreline (i.e., above the 315.0-foot NGVD normal pool elevation).
One of the 14 shoreline archeological sites (41CE381) was determined to be ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL and would therefore not constitute an
adverse effect on historic properties. However, the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining
13 shoreline archeological sites is currently unknown; additional eligibility testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to establish their significance.
Of the 6 historic structures sites located along the proposed shoreline, portions of Historic
Site 1 (the ca. 1925 barn) and Historic Site 7 (a ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) were determined
to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP; as such, any impacts to these resources would constitute
an adverse effect on historic properties. The remaining historic structures within the shoreline
area, including a portion of Historic Site 1 (the ca. 1925 frame bungalow) as well as Historic Site 2
(ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and
agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed bungalow), and Historic Site 5
(ca. 1955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), were determined to be ineligible for inclusion in
the NRHP; as such, any impacts to these resources would not constitute an adverse effect on
historic properties.
Ongoing erosive actions along the shoreline of the proposed reservoir impoundment may
have adverse cumulative effects on any cultural resources sites located in shoreline areas. In
addition, increased accessibility to the proposed reservoir shoreline may increase the potential

HJN 050082 AR

347

Chapter 9.0: Summary and Recommendations

for vandalism to cultural resources sites located in shoreline areas and may result in adverse
cumulative effects to any NRHP- and SAL-eligible historic properties. Any NRHP- and SALeligible historic properties located along the proposed reservoir shoreline may experience
cumulative viewshed impacts as a result of proposed reservoir impoundment. In addition,
construction or ongoing use of any ancillary facilities associated with the proposed reservoir
located along the shoreline may result in cumulative direct or indirect impacts to any historic
properties situated in shoreline areas.
Additional survey would be necessary to inventory all cultural resources that exist within
the proposed shoreline area, and additional archeological testing and/or archival research would
be necessary to determine the significance of any known cultural resources within the proposed
shoreline area that are currently of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for
designation as SALs.
Dam and Spillway
Construction-related impacts within the dam and spillway area may create adverse effects
for 1 archeological site (41CE387) located on the uplands overlooking Mud Creek on the eastern
side of the channel. However, based on available data, site 41CE387 is currently of unknown
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL; additional eligibility testing
and/or archival research would be necessary to establish the significance of this cultural resource.
During the baseline cultural resources survey, 100% of the upland settings and immediately
adjacent sideslopes of the Mud Creek floodplain on which the proposed spillway facilities would
be built have been surveyed for cultural resources. However, virtually none of the floodplain
settings along the dam axis have been surveyed, and it is unknown whether or not any cultural
resources exist within the area in which the proposed dam would be constructed. It should be
noted that landscaping activities undertaken by a local landowner have resulted in fairly extensive
prior impacts to surface and near-surface sediments across most of the proposed dam axis area,
though it is currently unknown how deep these impacts may extend.
A total of 6 cultural resources sites, including 5 archeological sites (1 of which is also a
historic architecture site) and 1 additional historic architecture site, are situated within the APE
south of US 79, which is located about 4.8 kilometers (3.0 miles) north of the proposed dam axis.
Portions of the APE south of US 79 have been suggested to represent possible sources of fill
material to construct the proposed dam. Borrow acquisition conducted in this area would
potentially have adverse effects on cultural resources located within borrow excavation areas or
along haul roads.

9.6

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

A baseline cultural resources inventory, including initial archeological, geomorphological,
and historic structures surveys, has been completed for the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project.
Based on its review of Horizon’s interim report (Owens et al. 2006), the USACE concluded that
the survey was sufficiently extensive to develop a profile of the types of cultural resources that
are likely to exist within the APE or that would be affected by construction of the proposed
reservoir. One hundred sixty high-probability landforms, which cover approximately 10% of the

348

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

land area within the APE, were identified prior to initiating baseline survey activities, and most of
this land area was surveyed for cultural resources. However, many of these areas were covered
in a deep, sandy mantle that likely dates to the Holocene period and, therefore, potentially
contains deeply buried, subsurface cultural resources. Shovel testing was unable to penetrate
below the depth of sandy Holocene sediments in all areas, and backhoe trenching was not
conducted during the archeological survey due to landowner permission and accessibility
restrictions.
A total of 37 archeological sites, 7 historic-age architectural sites (1 of which was also
documented as an archeological site—41CE384), 1 historic-age community composed of
9 related historic-age sites, and 25 IOs were documented as a result of the survey. The baseline
cultural resources survey was conducted to provide the USACE with sufficient information to
characterize the types of cultural resources likely to occur within the APE, though it was beyond
the scope of the approved SOW to develop an exhaustive inventory of all cultural resources
located within the APE. The preliminary survey activities were sufficient to establish the range of
cultural resources that can be expected to occur within the APE, though a 100% survey of the
APE would be necessary to locate all cultural resources that may be potentially affected by
proposed project development in the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves
forward in the future. Furthermore, additional eligibility testing investigations and/or historical and
archival research would be necessary on the 36 archeological sites that are currently of unknown
NRHP and SAL eligibility to determine their significance.
Based on data gathered during baseline survey investigations, 36 of the 37 archeological
sites (41CE367-380 and 41CE382-403) recorded during the baseline archeological survey were
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP under Section 106 of the
NHPA and for designation as SALs under the Antiquities Code of Texas. One site (41CE381)
was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No
further investigations were recommended on site 41CE381, but further testing and/or archival
research would be necessary to determine the NRHP and SAL eligibility of the remaining 36 sites
(Owens et al. 2006). The THC concurred with these recommendations in a comment letter
addressed to the USACE dated January 10, 2007.
All of the 25 IOs encountered during the baseline archeological survey lack sufficient
manifestation of cultural resources to warrant designation as archeological sites. Based on their
lack of integrity and/or ephemeral presence, all 25 IOs in the APE are recommended as ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs.
Based on data gathered during baseline survey investigations, a portion of Historic Site 1
(ca. 1925 bungalow only), Historic Site 2 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic
Site 3 (ca. 1925 bungalow and agricultural resources), Historic Site 4 (ca. 1910 pyramidal-roofed
bungalow), Historic Site 5 (ca. 1955 ranch-style house and outbuildings), and Historic Site 6 (ca.
1940 bungalow and ca. 1955 side-gabled house) are ineligible for listing on the NRHP. A portion
of Historic Site 1 (ca. 1925 barn only) and Historic Site 7 (ca. 1890 hall-and-parlor house) are
eligible for listing on the NRHP, and Historic Site 8 (Pleasant Plains Community) is eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district.

Chapter 9.0: Summary and Recommendations

In the event that the Lake Columbia Water Supply Project moves forward in the future,
additional cultural resources investigations, including 100% completion of the cultural resources
survey, additional geomorphological studies, eligibility testing of cultural resources for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SAL, supplemental historical and archival research, and/or data
recovery mitigation studies, may be required to comply with applicable federal and state laws.
However, no further cultural resources studies have been conducted in connection with the Lake
Columbia Water Supply Project since 2006, and the regulatory agencies and project sponsor
have concurred that it seems unlikely that such studies will be authorized within the timeframe
covered by the existing Texas Antiquities Permit. As such, no specific recommendations for
project clearance or for future studies are offered here; rather, this report is being prepared in
order for ANRA and Horizon to meet their mutual obligations under the existing Texas Antiquities
Permit, which requires that ANRA and Horizon complete the draft and final reports describing the
results of the baseline cultural resources investigations conducted to date and to prepare project
records for permanent curation. Thus, while additional cultural resources investigations may be
necessary in the event that the proposed undertaking moves forward in the future, this report
serves to fulfill ANRA’s and Horizon’s obligations under the existing Texas Antiquities Permit and
to bring to a close the current chapter of cultural resources studies for the Lake Columbia Water
Supply Project.

APPENDIX E:

Shovel Test Data

Cultural Resources Baseline Studies:
Lake Columbia Water Supply Project, Cherokee and Smith Counties, Texas

Appendix E contains a compilation of shovel test data gathered during the baseline
archeological survey of the proposed Lake Columbia Water Supply Project’s Area of Potential
Effect in Cherokee and Smith counties, Texas. A total of 2,526 shovel tests were excavated
during the baseline archeological survey. The master shovel test database is included as a
Microsoft Excel (2013 version) spreadsheet on the accompanying CD-ROM attached to the inside
back cover of this report. The CD-ROM also contains an electronic Portable Document Format
(PDF) file originally prepared in Microsoft Word (2013 version) that summarizes all 2,526 shovel
tests. Shovel tests are arranged in alphanumeric order based on the shovel test number, which
is composed of the first and last initials of the excavator followed by a unique numeric designation.
