PREFACE
The following report, concerned with evaluating the potential
conflicts of specified transmission line routes with definable
archeological and historical resources, is organized in three
segments.
Part I details the results of a literature search and
on-site archeological inspection; Part II presents a brief his­
torical overview of the areas crossed by the proposed constructions
and an assessment of known areas or features in the vicinity of
the transmission line corridors; and Part III provides conclusions
and recommendations for minimizing possible effects of these con­
structions on these resources.

PART I:
INTRODUCTION
This report details the results of a cultural resource survey
and assessment of areas to be affected by the modifications of
STP transmission lines in Matagorda, Colorado and Fayette counties,
Texas.
This study, carried out by the staff of the Texas Archeo­
logical Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, is the third in
a series of assessments directed at the proposed STP transmission
line system.
Previous surveys were reported to the Houston Lighting
and Power Company in 1974 and 1975*.
The present study was concerned with two specified route
changes:
(1)
the STP-Blessing preferred and alternate routes in
Matagorda County; and (2) the Tie Point-Holman route in Colorado
and Fayette counties.
The general location of these corridors is
illustrated in Figures I and 2.
The STP-Blessing route emanates
from the STP Site in Matagorda County, runs westerly through level
portions of the Coastal Plain to a
point just west of Tres Palacios
Creek, turns north and ends at the existing Blessing Substation.
The Tie Point-Holman segment begins south of the town of Columbus
in central Colorado County, runs northerly to a point near Glidden
and hence northwesterly (generally paralleling the Colorado River)
to the ternunus at Holman Substation in southeastern Fayette
County.
The latter route traverses higher, rolling portions of
the inner Coastal Plain.
Field work associated with thi.s cultural resource impact study
was carried out at intervals i.n November and Decemher, 19.78, and
January, 197i, by MarthB Doty Freeman, Duford W. Skelton, and David
S. Dibble.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The investigation of possible conflicts of these transmission
line routings with significant archeological resources included
both a consultation of pertinent archival records and published
reports and, most definitively, an on-the-ground inspection of
the proposed corridors.
The locations of these line routings
,were provided by the sponsor in the form of marked aerial photo­
graphs at a scale of 1"=1000' (STP-Blessing segment) and USGS
7.5 Quad maps (Tie Point-Holman).
Additional definition on the
Tie Point-Holman corridor was made available by the City of Austin
Electric Department in the form of 1"=200' aerial photo mosaics.
County archeological site records kept at the Texas
,Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin, provided the basis for the background archival study.
Examination of these records suggested that, with the possible
:exception of a previously surveyed area in the vicinity of
:Harveys Creek in Colorado County (Nunley 1963), neither line
corridor appeared to encroach closely on previously recognized
archeological sites.
Generally, however, ~it was found that
the areas traversed by the proposed lines have not been
subjected to professional level surveys in the past.
On-site inspections of the line corridors followed the
basic design for coverage in previous South Texas Project
archeological surveys carried out by the Texas Archeological
Survey (Hall et aZ. 1974; Dillehay 1975).
This design incorporated
:a,flexibility in coverage keyed to variations in the extent and
itype of modern land modification characteristic of areas traversed
!by the proposed corridors as well as their topographic relation­
iships.
"Intens i ve coverage If involving on-f 00 t surf ace insp ec t ions
iand a limited amount of hand tool probing was carried out chiefly
lin areas of stream crossings (including valley margins or associated
'Iterrace systems) or land surfaces which had not been heavily
~isrupted by modern land developments.
The intensive surface
iinspection included zig-zag transects intended to provide visual
rcoverage of 100-200 foot corridors -- usually well in excess of
it he proposed corridor widths.
Remaining portions of the trans­
~ission line corridors, primarily segments heavily disrupted by
~gricultural or industrial development, were given more cursory
!inspection.
The relative percentages of intensive and "recon­
~aisance"
surface coverage, as well as the specific areas observed
'in these manners are indica ted in Tables 1 and 2.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
STP Site - Blessing
This proposed transmission line segment includes generally
paralleling "preferred" and "alternate" routes and traverses
level areas of the outer Coastal Plain.
The area has been
heavily modified in recent times, primarily by activities
associated with wet rice agriculture and petroleum extraction.
Surface modifications associated with agriculture which have
,probably affected the original archeological record include
deep plOWing, terracing, levee construction and stream channel
rectification.
The major stream drainage crossed by this line
is Tres Palacios Creek.
Intensive coverage of the preferred
(13.4 mile) and alternate (14.7 mile) routes amounting to
27.6% and 28.5% of the total line lengths were concentrated in
Tres Palacios Creek and tributary crossings and in areas of
relatively less modified land west of Tres Palacios Creek (Table
1). No archeological sites or features were observed in this
line corridor.

Tie Point - Holman
This segment traverses predominantly rolling topography
drained by the Colorado River.
Intensive coverage of the
approximate 23 mile length of the proposed corridor in
Colorado and Fayette counties amounted to 26.1% of the total.
Particular attention was devoted to line crossings of Ratliff
Creek, Harveys Creek and South Fork of Harveys Creek (Table 2).
Three prehistoric sites, 41 CD 64, 41 CD 65, and 41 CD 66
were recorded in areas of 200 to 400 feet of the proposed
route corridor west of the town of Glidden (see "Archeological
Site Summaries" below).

Archeological Site Summaries
A total of three archeological sites were discovered and
recorded during our investigation of the Tie Point-Holman line
segment in Colorado County STP modified transmission line segments.
As will be discussed, all of these localities were found to lie
near, but not within, the proposed construction corridors.
The
sites were documented on standard University of Texas survey forms,
located on appropriate USGS 7.5' quad maps, and photographed. This
documentation has been deposited with the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, Balcones Research Center, The University of
Texas at Austin.
Site numbers were assigned by this research unit.
No collections of associated artifacts or other materials found at
the sites were made.

A concentration of fire-fractured rock and chert flakes ex­
posed on the surface of a partially forested knoll.
The surface
exposed sediment is sandy; little or no depth to the cultural
deposits is evident.
Site is located approximately 2.2 miles
west of Glidden.
The transmission line (centerline) approaches
to within 200 ft. eN) at its nearest point.
Area of site: 50 x
100 meters.

A concentration of fire-fractured burned rock and a thin
scatter of chert flakes.
Site situated near the edge of bluffs
enclosing valley of Colorado River.
Site has been damaged par­
tially by dirt road construction.
This exposure indicates a
depth of 10-20 cm. to the deposit at one point.
The locality is
aboue 3.3 mi. west of Glidden; the centerline is 250 ft. north of
the nearest site boundary.
Area of site:
25 x 50 meters.

Scattered fire-fractured rock and chert flakes exposed on
slope of ridge overlooking a short tributary of the Colorado
River.
The area has recently been disturbed by stock tank and
ranch road construction.
No definitely intact cultural deposits
were observed.
The site is approximately 4.2 miles west of
Glidden; the corridor centerline is 400 ft. north of the nearest
site boundary.
Area of site:
25 x 25 meter.

PART II.
INTRODUCTION
During December 1978 and January-1979, a brief assessment of
historic sites in Matagorda, Colorado, and Fayette counties was
carried out in order to ascertain whether or not any significant
or potentially significant historic sites or features might be
adversely affected by the construction of transmission lines ema­
nating from the South Texas Project. The specific line segments
have been identified earlier. The assessment was accomplished by
reviewing published histories of the three counties, searching the
files of the Texas Historical Commission, contacting members of
the State Historical Commission in each county, and by windshield
survey of the areas to be affected.
Sole reliance for identif~­
cation of archeological sites was placed upon field archeologists
who walked the proposed transmission line corridors.
The completion of the assessment for historic sites and struc­
tures revealed that:
1. No sites or structures currently on the National Register
of Historic Places lie directly in the path of the proposed trans­
mission line segments.

2. Three sites which have been recognized by the Texas
Historical Commission occur within a distance of one mile from
the line.
3. Two significant structures and one historic site which
have not been noted by the Texas Historical Commission lie within
250 feet of the power line.
4. The line passes through a portion of Fayette County which
has been inadequately surveyed by the local historical commission,
the State Commission, or the Capitol Area Planning Council survey
done during 1978. While four of the five structures or clusters
of structures recorded during the course of the TAS study do not
lie directly in the path of the transmission line, they do fall
within a half-mile corridor on either side of the proposed line.
5. As was pointed out by Grombacher (Hall, et al 1974), local
historical commissions and the Texas Historical Commission have not
necessarily identified all significant sites which exist within
given counties.
"Some committees [commissions] are more active
than others. Some concentrate their work on developing a few
attractive sites in the area, while others gather information on
many sites without plans for developing local attractions ••••
Thorough architectural surveys of many parts of Texas have n~t been
made, and pending these the National Register may not be considered
complete for Texas."

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
While the three counties surveyed for historic 'sites during
December and January differ widely in terms of topography and
climate, they share many historical attributes.
Colorado and
Matagorda counties were both crossed by seventeenth- and
eighteenth-century French and Spanish expeditions:
Ren~ Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle's party camped on Skull Creek in
present-day Colorado County on January 2, 1687; Alonso de Leon,
Jr's., fourth expedition probably crossed Colorado County in
search of Fort St. Louis in 1689; Martin de Alarc~n traversed the.
area on, his way to La Bahia del Espiritu Santo in 1718; and Marquis
de Rubi crossed the Colorado River near present-day Columbus in
1767. European visitors to the Matagorda County area included
Fran~ois Simars de Be1lisle in 1719.
~

~

By the first third of the nineteenth century, all of the
area under survey was contained within the territory granted by
the Mexican government to Stephen F. Austin for his colony.
Boundaries of the colony included the Old San Antonio Road on the
north, a line which ran from the OSR crossing at Bastrop south to
the vicinity of Gonzales and included an area on both sides of the
Navidad River near Texana, and a line on the east which ran near
the beginning of the Trinity River watershed (Ray 1970: 7).
Matagorda, Fayette, and Colorado counties were included within
these boundaries; all contained some of the earliest land grants
made by Mexico to Anglo-American colonists.
After the Texas Revolution, Fayette, Colorado, and Matagorda
were among the earliest counties to be designated by the Republic
of Texas: Fayette was created in 1837 and organized in 1838;
Colorado was created in 1836 and organized in 1837, as was Matagorda
County. Subsequent development followed a general pattern similar
to that which occurred in many other Texas counties.
Initial
Anglo-American immigration during the early l830s and l840s was
followed by an influx of substantial numbers of German and eastern
European farmers; and the early agricultural development of the
pre-Civil War period, when cotton was a favored crop, was followed
·in turn by the conversion of plantation holdings to large cattle
ranches.
Following is a listing of historic areas and historic sites
recognized by the Texas Historical Commission, mentioned in pub­
lished county histories, noted by local historical commission
members, or recorded during a windshield survey.
All areas and
sites lie within a two-mile corridor (one-mile distance on either
side of the proposed transmission line).

13.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF HISTORIC AREAS
Fayette County
Ammansville, situated about one mile east of the proposed
transmission line, was started by A. Amman who settled a short
distance west of the present town in March 1870.
Soon, he was
joined by the families of Alonzo Runnels, Peter Smajtra, Charles
Munke, and a Mr. Duve (Williams 1976: 317-320). The town which
developed includes numerous structures which were recorded during
the course of a 1978 CAPCO survey performed for the Texas Historical
Commission.
ColoradoCo"un<ty
The northwestern portion of the County, through which the
proposed transmission line may pass, is the most sensitive area
along the entire length of the route.
The nearby site of Jesse
Burnam's 1820 trading post makes this one of the regions of earli~
est Anglo-American settlement in Texas.
Much of the land crossed
by the proposed transmission route lay within the grant made to
Henry Austin, brother of the famous author, Mary Austin Holley,
and cousin of Stephen F. Austin.
The area's proximity to Burnam's
post and to the route used by General Sam Houston as he marched to
San Jacinto in 1836, makes it highly likely that any demolition or
construction activity within the vicinity of Old Osage may result
in th~ discovery of significant historic sites dating from the pre­
1840 period in Texas.
Matagorda Countl
The range for El Rancho Grande, a ranch owned by J.E. and A.H.
("Shanghai") Pierce lies generally east of Blessing and is crossed
y the proposed transmission line.
No structures connected with
the ranch appear to be endangered by the transmission route, and
the significance of the range chiefly derives from its association
ith the Pierce brothers.
One of the most famous of all Texas
attlemen, "Shan.ghai ll Pierce eventually acquired a 2S0,OOO-acre ranch,
ade significant steps toward identifying the cause of Texas fever,
nd initiated the idea that Brahman cattle might be immune to the
isease. After his death in 1900,the Pierce estate imported India
rahman cattle and thus furnished Texas with the base stock from
hich its large herds of Brahmans originated.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF HISTORIC SITES
Fayette Couutl
41 FY 129

A farmhouse located on a county ro~d about one mile south of
the Holman Substation and lying approximately 3,000 feet west of
the proposed transmission line.
The house is a story-and-a-half,
wood frame, Victorian cottage with an ell-shaped addition on the
back. Dating from approximately the l870s or l880s, the structure
probably has a central hallway.
A porch spans the width of the
front of the house where six columns support the roof overhang and
terminate in ornate brackets. Windows under the porch have shutters.
A dormer is on the south slope of the roof.

41 FY 130

A residence located on a county road about one-and-a-quarter
miles south of the Holman Substation and lying about 2,000 feet
west of the proposed transmission line.
The house was inaccessible
because of a locked gate which prevented entry to the property.
However, from the county road the structure appeared to be a two­
story frame building dating from the 1890s.

41 FY 131
A farmhouse and associated structures (barns, etc.) located
on a county road about two miles south of the Holman Substation
and about 1,500 feet southwest of the proposed transmission line.
The residence is a late nineteenth-century story-and-a-half frame
building on piers with a small attached porch on the front and a
salt box-type addition on the back.

41 FY 132
A farmhouse located on a county road about one-and-a-half
miles south of Ammansville and lying about 2,000 feet east of the
proposed transmission line.
Dating from the late nineteenth
century, this structure is a wood frame, story-and-a-half residence
with a porch.

15.

41 FY 133
A residence located on a county road about two miles south­
east of Ammansville and 200 feet northeast of the proposed trans­
mission line.
The house is a two-story, wood frame structure on
piers with a one-story attached ell.
On the front of the main
structure is a two-story gallery porch with railing.
Four columns
are equally spaced across the front of the house which faces south­
east. Weatherboard siding provides the external sheathing, and
shutters cover the windows which are two over two on the ell
addition. The inside walls near the ceiling are decorated with
stenciling.
The building appears to be a transitional structure
built sometime between the Classic Revival and Victorian periods
in Texas.

Colorado County
41 CD 67
A residence located on a county road about one mile southeast
of Old Osage and 100 feet east of the proposed transmission route.
The structure is a one-story Classic Revival, wood frame home with
a salt box profile and six-over-six windows which are covered by
shutters. A Classic Revival portico covers the entrance which is
flanked by sidelights.

41 CD 68
A rock structure dating from the l840s or l850s and recognized
by a member of the Colorado County Historical Commission as being
a significant site.
Although an informant recalled that the build­
ing was used as a spring house, its actual and original function
was that of a lime kiln.
The structure is located on the bank of
a small stream and is made of cut and faced limestone.
It is highly
significant not only because it is in excellent condition, but also
because it is the only known lime kiln within the general Colorado
County area.

41 CD 69
An unidentified house site located about two-thirds
of a
ile west of Old Osage and near Site 41 CD 68.
Although there
.ar~ few surficial artifacts associated with the site, an informant
'tentatively dated it to the period of the Republic.
It is possible
that the lime kiln located nearby was built to produce the lime to
lay up the stones and handmade brick scattered around the site.

16.

H.M. Goode, Sr., Residence
The residence of H.M. Goode, Sr., was not located in the field.
However, a comparison of a map of the Henry Austin Hacienda on
which the building is designated with a contemporary USGS map,
revealed that the house was built on a tributary of Harvey's Creek,
and may be as close as a tenth of a mile to the proposed transmis­
sion line.

Old Osage and Osage Cemetery
Old Osage and the nearby Osage Cemetery have been designated
with an official Texas marker.
Located about 3,000 feet northeast
of the proposed transmission route, the town was the earlier site
of an 1820 trading post run by Jesse Burnam whose ferry on the
Colorado River was used by General Sam Houston to reach San Jacinto
in 1836. The town itself was started in the l850s and became a
Civil War recruiting center.

Old Spanish Trail
Old Spanish Trail, also designated as Highway 90, the VFW
Highway, and the Jefferson Davis Highway, was a national highway
completed in the 1920s which ran from St. Augustine, Florida, to
San Diego, California.
The designation is a modern appellation,
although the Highway does appear to follow an unnamed trail which
existed between what is now Houston and San Antonio, and which
appeared on a map drawn by Stephen F. Austin in 1829. The proposed
transmission line crosses the trail approximately four miles west
of Columbus.

Matagorda County
Blessing
Blessing, located about one-and-three-quarter miles east of
the proposed line, was established as a post office in 1902 at the
junction of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico,
and the Texas
and New Orleans railroads.
It was named by Jonathan E. Pierce,

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The described study directed at assessing the probable
impact of specified transmission line construction on prehistoric
and historic resources has identified some areas of concern.
However, on the assumption that significant changes in the
currently proposed line routes in Matagorda, Colorado and Fayette
counties are not made and that reasonable care is exercised in
construction activities lateral to the actual line corridors,
it is apparent that no significant adverse effects on these
identifiable cultural resources will occur.
Specific prehistoric
and historic localities, described in the foregoing discussion
as being situated near the Tie Point-Holman line segment were
defined as a result of this assessment.
The archival study
established that no sites previously listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, or under current consideration
for such listing, will be affected by the proposed constructions.
The following recommendations are offered:
1)

Three prehistoric localities, sites 41 CD 64, 41 CD 65,
and 41 CD 66 (see "Archeological Site Summaries"), are
located within distances of 200 to 400 feet of the Tie
Point-Holman corridor west of the town of Glidden.
Although these sites do not appear to meet the criteria
for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places they are of archeological interest and should be
saved from inadvertent damage resulting from construction
activities lateral to the corridor.

2)

Although the proposed transmission lines do not closely
approach historic sites or structures currently recognized
by the Texas Historical Commission, two localities found
to be situated close to the Tie Point-Holman corridor
are considered to be of architectural merit.
These sites,
designated 41 CD 67 and 41 FY 133 (see "General Description
of Historic Sites") are in the vicinity of Harveys Creek
line crossing in Colorado County and the community of
Ammansville in Fayette County.
In both cases, construction
activities lateral to the presently proposed line corridor
would endanger these structures.
Additionally, it has
been pointed out that the vicinity of the site of "Old
Osage" is known as the locale of significant early Anglo­
American settlement.
It is thus highly recommended that
particular caution be exercised during construction in
these areas.

3)

Although the proposed transmission line segments appear
to be without adverse effects defined as a result of this
survey, it is possible that surface modifications during
construction would expose features of significant interest.
It is hence recommended that any discovery of recognizable
archeological material made in the construction phase be
reported to the office of the State Historic Preservation
Office, Texas Historical Commission.
