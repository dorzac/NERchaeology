ABSTRACT

National Park Service-funded archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations in 2010, supplemented by earlier volunteer archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations in 2008, at the J. T.
King site (41NA15) have shown that it is an early 18th century Caddo habitation site located directly on the
northern route of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in western Nacogdoches County, Texas.
The investigations indicate that the site may have preserved evidence of at least 10 Caddo habitation/domestic
structures, arranged around a small courtyard or plaza, with outdoor activity area and areas where trash deposits accumulated outside and behind the habitation structures and courtyard. Post hole and pit features are common in the archaeological deposits.
The 10 possible Caddo structures that have been detected in the initial archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site are round to sub-round in shape and range from 3.7 to 12.5 m in diameter.
Seven of them have anomalies situated in or close to their center that are interpreted as central hearths or
large post holes (i.e., center posts) inside domestic structures. None of the possible structures have complete geophysical signatures and it is not possible to make out an entranceway or easily discern the orientation of the structures. The courtyard area, or open space, is between two clusters of house structures.

INTRODUCTION AND PROPOSED SCOPE OF THE ARCHAEOGEOPHYSICAL AND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
This report discusses the archaeogeophysical and archaeological findings of 2010 investigations we
carried out at an early Historic (late 17th-early 18th century) Caddo site situated along El Camino Real de
los Tejas. At the request of the National Park Service (NPS), Archaeo-Geophysical Associates, LLC, and
Archeological & Environmental Consultants, LLC, prepared a research design in support of a 2009 NPS
Challenge Cost Share Project proposal entitled âArchaeogeophysical Research at an 18th Century Caddo Site
in Nacogdoches County, Texas, along El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail.â In this document,
subsequently reviewed and approved by the NPS and the Texas Historical Commission, we proposed to
conduct archaeogeophysical surveys utilizing multiple techniques at the J. T. King site (41NA15), a late
17th to early 18th century Caddo habitation site (Middlebrook 2007, 2008; Walker 2009; Walker et al. 2009)
located directly on the northern route of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in western
Nacogdoches County, Texas (Figure 1). It is about 1.2 km west of the small town of Douglass, Texas, on
an alluvial terrace along the west side of King Creek, and about 5 km east of the Camino Realâs northern
crossing of the Angelina River.
It is the principal objective of this multi-disciplinary work to obtain unique data on the spatial organization of a Caddo settlementâparticularly archaeological information on the layout of buildings, courtyards,
granaries, and other domestic featuresâthat was occupied at the time of the Spanish use of the trail. Preliminary archaeogeophysical findings (see Middlebrook 2007, 2008; Walker et al. 2009) and archaeological
ground truthing indicated that geophysical anomalies were present at the site that have archaeological significance, including a number of likely Caddo habitation structures (Walker 2009). At the conclusion of the Challenge Cost Share project, it was our intent to have obtained the first better understanding of how one Caddo
group was living in the 18th century in this part of East Texas.
In this report, we first discuss the regional and archaeological context of Historic Caddo settlement
in the areas of East Texas crossed by El Camino Real de los Tejas, then review the relevant archaeological information concerning previous archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations conducted as
a volunteer effort on the historic Caddo settlement at the J. T. King site (41NA15), on private property
in Nacogdoches County, Texas. That section includes a review of the initial archaeogeophysical findings from the December 2008 investigations (see Walker 2009; Walker et al. 2009). The next section, the
project research design, outlines the archaeogeophysical and archaeological methodologies we intended
to employ in the proposed investigations at the J. T. King site under the Challenge Cost Share contract to
better understand the spatial organization of this Historic Caddo site located in the immediate vicinity of
El Camino Real de los Tejas when it was in use by Spanish colonists. We also discuss in the research design how we intended to handle the processing and analysis of the archaeogeophysical data as well as the
recovery, analysis, and curation of recovered artifacts from archaeological ground truthing investigations
at the site, along with providing a discussion of report preparation tasks arising from the archaeogeophysical investigations, and the contents of the final report.
The heart of this report are two sections that summarize in detail the results of the 2010 archaeogeophysical and archaeological investigations at the J. T. King site. In them we review both the identification
and likely character of geophysical anomalies across the site as well as the results of shovel testing and
hand excavations in and adjacent to major geophysical anomalies (i.e., interpreted as domestic structures)
and different parts of the archaeological deposits. That work identified archaeological features, an abundant material culture record, as well as well-preserved animal bones and charred plant remains. These archaeological data proved to be illuminating with respect to the organization and character of the domestic
use of the J. T. King site by Caddo peoples.

The final section of this report has two parts. The first is a summary of the projectâs
archaeogeophysical and archaeological findings at the J. T. King site, and the second part offers
recommendations to the National Park Service concerning future work that could be conducted at the site
as a means of enhancing the publicâs understanding of the significance of El Camino Real de los Tejas in
East Texas.
Also included in the report are two appendices. Appendix 1 provides descriptions of the sediments
encountered in the 2010 shovel tests, and Appendix 2 presents the detailed analysis of a sample of the ceramic vessel and pipe sherds recovered at the J. T. King site.

REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOLGICAL CONTEXT

The J. T. King site (41NA15) is an early 18th century Allen phase Caddo site that was first recorded in
1931 by The University of Texas at Austin archaeologists. That initial work, and much more recent archaeological investigations carried out in 2006 and 2008 (Middlebrook 2007, 2008; Walker 2009; Walker et al.
2009), have demonstrated that the J. T. King site is a substantial (ca. 2.5 hectares) Historic Caddo habitation
site, with well-preserved archaeological deposits, on El Camino Real de los Tejas (present-day Highway 21 at
the northern end of the site).
Archaeological investigations carried out in East Texas since the early 20th century confirm that Caddo communities in late prehistoric and early historic times were widely dispersed throughout all of the
major and minor river valleys of the region. The most intensive settlement of the region appears to have
been after ca. A.D. 1400 by the ancestors of the Hasinai Caddo, especially in the Neches-Angelina River
basin (Story 1995; Perttula and Nelson 2006; Middlebrook 2007). By the mid-1600s, the Hasinai Caddo
peoples of East Texas were referred to by the Spanish as the âGreat Kingdom of the Tejasâ because they
were considered to be a populous and well-governed people.
When Europeans began to venture into East Texas in the 1680s and 1690s, the territory of the various
Hasinai Caddo tribes became well understood (see Berlandier 1969; Jackson 1999; R. H. Jackson 2004).
The area known to have been occupied by the Caddo in the late 17th century was also called âTejasâ by
the Spanish, while the French called the Caddo in this area the âCenis.â The Hasinai Caddo tribes lived in
the Neches and Angelina River basins, and El Camino Real de los Tejas came to and through this territory
from the late 17th to the early 19th century (Corbin 1991; Cunningham 2006; McGraw et al. 1991).
In historic times, the archaeology of the Hasinai Caddo groups is associated with the Allen phase (ca.
A.D. 1650-early 1800s). âThe Allen phase is believed to have developed out of the Frankston phase [ca.
A.D. 1400-1650], and more importantly, to have shared the same form of organization, kinds of intergroup interaction, and settlement patternsâ (Story and Creel 1982:34). The groups who during the Allen
phase occupied the Neches (the Rio aux Cenis) and Angelina river basins were direct ancestors of the
Hasinai tribes who were living in or near the Spanish missions that had been periodically established and
maintained in the region between ca. 1690-1731, and they continued to live there until the 1830s (see
Jackson 1999:Plate 98).
Story and Creel (1982:32) have suggested that the Allen phase populations were organized in a
âweakly hierarchical structureâ analogous to the socio-political organization of the Hasinai confederacy
(see Swanton 1942). Allen phase components are found in the Neches and Angelina River basins in Cherokee, Anderson, Houston, Rusk, and Nacogdoches counties (Erickson and Corbin 1996; Marceaux 2007;
Middlebrook 2007; Perttula 2005; Perttula and Nelson 2006; Story 1982, 1995). These Historic Caddo
sites contain small amounts of European trade goods found in village contexts, along with a variety of
decorated and plain Caddo ceramic wares, triangular and unstemmed arrow points, elbow pipes, ground
stone tools, and bone tools. Most Allen phase sites were apparently occupied for only short periods of
time, perhaps only an average of 20 to 40 years (Good 1982:67-69).
Allen phase Caddo communities were apparently composed of many farmsteads spread out over a
considerable distance. Individual Hasinai Caddo families lived in their farmsteads, and a number of farmsteads were organized into rancherias spread out over about 15-30 leagues (ca. 39-78 miles) of stream
valleys and arable lands. Each rancheria was separated from the others by unoccupied lands and hunting
territory (Foster 1998:208).

The Spanish were determined to have effective control of the East Texas lands, thus minimizing the
French influence, and bring missions to the Caddo peoples (R. H. Jackson 2005:22-23, 26; Wade 2008:107113). Between 1690 and 1719, the Spanish established a number of missions among the Hasinai Caddo in
East Texas, with most of them situated in the middle of Caddo communities and along what became the
Camino Real de los Tejas. Despite the efforts of the missionaries, the Caddo refused to congregate in the
vicinity of the missions, and no Caddo peoples were converted to Christianity; baptisms âwere administered
to [Caddo] people who had died or were dying, half of whom were childrenâ (Wade 2008:112).
Mission Purisima Concepcion (1716-1719, 1721-1730) was established near one of the Angelina
River trail crossings of the Camino Real, and perhaps not far from the J. T. King site. A presidio, Presidio
Nuestra Senora de los Dolores de los Tejas (1716-1719, 1721-1730), was also established in 1716 by the
Spanish near Mission Concepcion and one of the Camino Real de los Tejas trail crossings of the Angelina
River. The precise location of this mission has recently been established near the Angelina River, a few
miles southwest of the J. T. King site (Tom Middlebrook, 2010 personal communication).
In the 1720s-1750s, the Hainai Caddo, one of the tribes in the Hasinai confederacy, lived to the east
on the Angelina River, apparently in the vicinity of the Camino Real. The J. T. King site may have been
occupied during this era. At these times, Spanish missionaries were living in the midst of certain Caddo
peoples at Mission Nuestra Senora de los Nacogdoches and Mission Nuestra Senora de Ais. Because
of the regular outbreaks of epidemics among the East Texas Caddo, especially outbreaks at the Spanish
settlement of Nacogdoches in the late 1770s and early 1780s, Caddo populations declined precipitously
through the colonial era. Caddo groups moved their villages, or coalesced into one village for protection.
The Hasinai Caddo groups remained in their East Texas homelands, living in the early 1800s outside of
the Spanish settlements of Nacogdoches, west to the Neches River, and apparently north of El Camino
Real. Between about 1836 and 1839, the Hasinai tribes had all been forcibly pushed out of East Texas.

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL
INVESTIGATIONS AT THE J. T. KING SITE

The J. T. King site is located west of Douglass on Highway 21, along King Creek, a southward-flowing
tributary to the Angelina River. One route of the NPS-plotted El Camino Real de los Tejas runs along the
northern perimeter of the site (see Figure 1). The 1931 University of Texas investigations located one burial
with associated ceramic vessels as well as an assortment of Allen phase ceramic vessel and pipe sherds (including Patton Engraved and King Engraved, a newly defined Historic Caddo ceramic type, see Middlebrook
[2008:4]) from habitation deposits, and a number of European glass trade beads from surface contexts.
In November 2006, the J. T. King site was relocated by Middlebrook (2007, 2008), at which time a
surface reconnaissance of the site area (in pasture) was made, and two shovel tests were excavated that
contained Historic Caddo ceramic vessel sherds. In May 2008, Middlebrook (2008) completed more
intensive work at the site, including surface collections in four areas, the excavation of four more shovel
tests, and the excavation of six 1 x 1 m units to 30 cm bs in one area in the eastern part of the site with
evidence of well-preserved habitation deposits. One small pit feature (Feature 2) was defined between 3042 cm bs in Unit 1 (N160 W90).
These initial excavations recovered ceramic sherds (n=1364), lithic debris and chipped stone flake
tools (n=150), a copper or brass tinkler cone fragment, and animal bone (n=305), as well as charred plant
remains. The overall character of the collected material culture assemblage correlates well with several
Allen phase sites in western Nacogdoches County along Bayou Loco, Legg Creek, and the Angelina
River (Middlebrook 2007; Perttula 2007)

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas
Archaeogeophysical survey investigations were first conducted at the J. T. King site (41NA15) on
December 8-9, 2008, as part of additional archaeological investigations (Middlebrook 2009). During
these further archaeological investigations, 19 shovel tests (ST 7-25) and five 1 x 1 m units were
excavated in the eastern part of the site. The additional shovel tests were designed to identify areas of
intensive habitation debris within the site; the 1 x 1 m units were placed to either investigate previously
located features or well-preserved habitation deposits, or were placed specifically to evaluate the
archaeological character of identified geophysical anomalies.
A total of 10 cultural features were identified during the December 2008 work, all apparently post
holes from Caddo structures. These features were well-defined between 20 and 30 cm bs (Figure 2ad), and contained a dark brown loam fill with charcoal and bone flecks. One of the post hole features

(Feature 11) contained a lead ball from a flintlock musket, and excavations also recovered an early 18th
century white olive-shaped glass bead, along with quantities of Allen phase ceramic vessel sherds (these
sherds have not been tabulated or analyzed to date) (Middlebrook 2009).
The geophysical survey was conducted by Archaeo-Geophysical Associates, LLC of Austin, Texas, as
one component of a larger cooperative and volunteer effort by several Caddo archaeologists working on
Historic Caddo sites in Nacogdoches County in East Texas. The archaeogeophysical area surveyed at the
J. T. King site covered 2.5 ha, ca. 6.1 acres (Figure 3). Data was collected using a Bartington Fluxgate
gradiometer. The gradiometer was used to collect the area twice: once using a sub-centimeter GPS to
position the readings, and a second time using the traditional gridded method. GPS collection methods
proved to be a more efficient way to gather geophysical data and did not require intensive site preparation
or surveying in collection grids.
The GPS-guided collection was conducted with the Bartington magnetometer mounted on a two
wheeled cart. Data was streamed out to an Allegro field computer and interfaced with GPS data. Magnetometer data was collected at 10 reading per second and GPS data was collected at 2 readings per second. Gridded magnetometer data was collected by carrying the Bartington magnetometer back and forth
across 20 x 20 m collection grids. Non-magnetic flags were used to guide the instrument back and forth
in uniform traverses. A total of eight readings per meter were collected during the magnetometer survey.
As previously mentioned, Figure 3 presents the entire geophysical data set collected in 2008 with the
GPS method. The preliminary interpretative map of the magnetometer data is provided in Figure 4a. This is
our best assessment to date of the Historic Caddo community structure at the J. T. King site. A magnetically
quiet area (see Figure 3), i.e., an area with a drop in background magnetic activity, in the central part of the
eastern collection area is proposed as a possible courtyard that is flanked by structures of different shapes
and sizes (Figure 4a). The red areas outline possible Caddo structures, the areas in yellow are areas with
possible metal objects, the brown areas are positive magnetic readings, and the blue are negative magnetic
readings. On the western side of the site is a fair amount of historic disturbances from burned late 19th-early
20th century Anglo-American houses to buried pipes, with one large area of magnetic enhancement (Figure
4b). A second area of magnetic enhancement is associated with the Historic Caddo occupation in the eastern
side of the GPS-guided collection; this area of magnetic enhancement closely overlaps with the principal
extent of the Historic Caddo archaeological deposits at the site (see below).
There are 10 possible Caddo structures that are detected in the initial archaeogeophysical investigations: they are round to sub-round in shape and range from 3.7 to 12.5 m in diameter (see Figure 4a).
Seven of the possible structures have anomalies situated in or close to their center that are interpreted as
central hearths or large post holes (i.e., center posts) inside Caddo domestic structures. None of the possible structures have complete geophysical signatures and it is not possible to make out an entranceway
or easily discern the orientation of the structures. The courtyard area, or open space, is between two clusters of house structures (see Figure 4a). These open spaces or court yards on Caddo sites in the Neches
and Angelina River basins often contain archaeological features and show signs of community activity.
A few magnetic anomalies were successfully ground truthed at the J. T. King site in December 2008.
There proved to be positive correlations between magnetometer anomalies and the occurrence of Caddo
architectural features. Test Unit #10, for instance, was placed over a negative magnetic anomaly in the
area of a domestic structure identified in the archaeogeophysical investigations. This test unit contained
two features, one extending into the western wall of the unit and one located just north of the center of
the unit (see Figure 2c-d). This feature in the center was a large post hole, as was the feature exposed
in the western wall profile. The negative magnetic signature in this area was caused by the presence of a

negative relief feature containing a matrix of organic material that is less magnetic than the surrounding
ferrous subsoil. A large diffuse positive magnetic anomaly was also tested with a shovel test and later
opened into a 50 x 50 cm unit. A charcoal stain was defined in the unit, but the thermal feature could
not be fully defined because of a heavy rain. Thermally altered features would be identified as positive
magnetic anomalies, and depending on the intensity and the amount of weathering, such thermal features
could produce a much larger geophysical signature than their actual size. It is also possible that this
feature will expand into something larger, or if the excavation unit was expanded horizontally, it would
prove to be part of a larger cluster of thermally altered features.
Two points are worth emphasizing on the basis of the limited ground truthing completed at the J. T.
King site by the end of December 2008: (1) there is less detail in the magnetometer image than was recovered in the 2008 test units. This pattern will more than likely continue in further investigations, especially
for low magnetic negative relief features where the surrounding magnetic fields of the ferrous subsoil can
easily overpower that of the smaller pits and posts; and (2) the locations of magnetic anomalies and archaeological features will more than likely not be a strictly 1 to 1 correlation. Depending on the amplitudes
of the various magnetic fields of the feature and the magnetic fields surrounding the feature, there will be a
different offset between the size of the magnetic anomaly and the actual location of the feature.

RESEARCH DESIGN: PROPOSED ARCHAEOGEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND
ACCOMPANYING ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK AT THE J. T. KING SITE

Archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King were proposed to the NPS as part of a 2009-2010
Challenge Cost Share project for El Camino Real de los Tejas National Heritage Trail to collect geophysical data with additional instruments such as electromagnetic induction, GPR, and resistivity, and continue
with additional archaeological ground truthing of geophysical anomalies. The first task of that work would
be to determine what geophysical equipment to employ at the site, and then to re-establish the December 2008
grid. The second task proposed would be to carry out the geophysical survey investigations with the necessary
equipment (likely magnetometry, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and ground penetrating radar). The third
task would be then to process the geophysical data sets, and set about identifying and interpreting geophysical
anomalies that may have archeological significance.
Archaeogeophysical Investigations
We proposed for this project to expand the magnetometer collection at the J. T. King site to include any remaining portions of the landform with Historic Caddo archaeological deposits that were
not collected during the initial field investigations. We would also collect data with additional sensors,
including electromagnetic induction (EM) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). An EM survey would
be conducted using a Geonics EM38B electromagnetic induction meter. The EM38B records both the
conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of the soil. EM would be used over the entire site and would
be guided by the RTK GPS. Key anomalies, such as possible structures and pits, located in the magnetometer and EM surveys would then be targeted for collection with GPR, which would also be guided
by the RTK GPS. GPR is unique in that it provides information regarding an objectâs or anomalyâs
depth. Using multiple geophysical instruments increases the potential to locate and define archaeological deposits by expanding the range of physical properties of the sediments and archaeological deposits
that are being investigated.
Magnetometer
Magnetometer and gradiometer surveys are non-invasive and passive techniques that measure slight
variations in the magnetic properties of soil. Magnetometers and gradiometers have become the primary
tool for archaeogeophysical study due in part to the fact that geophysical data can be collected and processed rapidly and efficiently, and when conditions are right due to the properties of specific soils, magnetometers and gradiometers have proven useful in locating negative relief features such as pits and post
holes as well as thermally-altered features such as fire hearths and burned structures (Gaffney 2008; Gaffney et al. 2000; Kvamme 2006b).
Magnetometers and gradiometers record the minute fluctuations that sediments and objects have on
the earthâs magnetic field. This is known as induced magnetism because the object does not maintain its
own magnetic field. If the effects of this induced magnetism are strong enough compared to the magnetism of the surrounding soil matrix, even small pit features or post holes can be identified or resolved in
the geophysical data along with the larger-sized features (i.e., structures). A second type of magnetism
called remnant magnetism is created when an object maintains its own magnetic field. In prehistoric
archaeological examples, this occurs when objects themselves are thermally altered, thus creating a
magnetic state called thermoremanent magnetism (Kvamme 2006a:207). The properties of the specific
magnetometer proposed for use in the current studyâa Bartington 601-2 Fluxgate Gradiometerâare discussed in detail by Bartington and Chapman (2004).

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

Magnetic Susceptibility
Magnetic susceptibility is a measurement of a materialâs ability to be magnetized (Dalan 2006:161).
Changes or contrasts in the magnetic susceptibility of sediments are the results of a conversion of weakly
magnetic oxides and hydroxides to more strongly magnetic forms (Dalan 2006:162). The magnetic enhancement of anthropogenic soils can be caused by burning episodes (both natural and human-caused) as
well as organic and inorganic pedogenic processes (Dalan 2006:162-163).
Magnetic susceptibility instruments differ from magnetometers in that they only measure fields resulting from induced magnetism, as compared to a magnetometer that records the net effect of induced
and remnant magnetism (Dalan 2006:162; Kvamme 2006b:207-210). The differences between these two
instruments produce data sets that are both complementary and unique. They are complementary in that
magnetic susceptibility data can aid in the interpretation of magnetometer data (Dalan 2006:162-163),
and magnetic susceptibility data are unique in that they can be used to address entirely different research
questions, such as tracking broad magnetic changes across the landscape.
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
GPR is an active, non-invasive technique that uses a shielded surface antenna to transmit pulses of
radar energy, generally high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) waves, that reflect off buried objects, features, or geological bedding contacts and are detected using a receiving antenna (Conyers 2004:23-28).
The waves detected by the receiving antenna are recorded in nano seconds (ns) that reflect the two-way
travel time of the radar energy. Fairly accurate approximations of depth of recorded anomalies can be determined through velocity analysis (see Conyers 2004).
While GPR is one of the more widely used techniques in archaeological geophysics, its success, like
that of the other archaeogeophysics techniques discussed herein, is largely based on such site conditions
as soil type, sediment mineralogy, and moisture content (Conyers 2004). For example, ideal soil types for
GPR include dry homogenous soils with minimal clay. On the other extreme, radar energy will become
attenuated more quickly in more conductive mediums such as dense clay and poorly drained soils or in
mediums with high magnetic permeability (Conyers 2004).
Field Methods
We proposed to the NPS that the radiometer data would be collected at the J. T. King site using an
RTK GPS system to position the readings. The gradiometer would be zeroed out and then attached to
a two wheeled non-magnetic hand cart. Real time data output would be stored in an Allegro CX field
computer and integrated with the GPS coordinates. A grid projected on the display of the field computer
would be adjusted to the parameters of the survey area. The field surveyor would walk along these grid
lines to ensure complete coverage. The gradiometer would be set to ouput data at 10 Hz and the GPS
would be set to output data at 2 Hz. The data collection software interpolates the GPS positions for the
gradiometer data points that fall between the 2 Hz GPS cycle.
GPR data would be collected using the RTK GPS to position the data points. A GPS to GPR data
bridge would be used to store GPS data, outputted at 1 Hz. At the start and stop of each GPR file, the
SIR 3000 communicates with the data bridge and uses a time sync to log a GPS coordinate. A GPR survey wheel is used to calculate the exact length of the GPR data file. Then, at the end of the file, the GPR
communicates with the data bridge again and positions the GPS coordinates appropriately along the GPR
file, using the start and end points as well as the survey wheel information.

Data Processing

All geophysical data from the J. T. King site are to be processed and filtered to remove extraneous
false readings (spikes and drop-outs). Data processing levels the datasets so adjacent grids are combined
into a single image with no âgrid lines.â Datasets are to be processed to enhance the visibility of the target features and geophysical anomalies through statistical manipulation of the recorded data as well as
through image processing of the image file output.
The general goal of data processing is to lessen the effects of background ânoiseâ and to enhance the
quality of the âsignalâ or âtarget.â In field geophysics in general, and archaeogeophysics in particular,
the term noise is used to discuss any measured return that is not a result of the object under investigationâthe latter being referred to as the âtargetâ or âsignal.â Hence, in some cases what is discussed as
noise can in another case become the signal or target (Milsom 2005:13-14). Accuracy of the geophysical
readings are not as important for resolving targets in the data as is the contrast between the target and its
surrounding matrix. Steps outline by Kvamme (2006b:236) are to be followed in the general approach to
data processing. After each processing step, the results will be closely compared to their previous state to
assure that data manipulation is not in fact decreasing the clarity and quality of the data, and thus insuring that the findings are not products of data processing.
GPS-guided gradiometer data from the proposed work would be processed using a zero median destripping filter. De-stripped data would then be imported into Surfer 9.0 and gridded, projected as a raster image, and exported as a Geo Tiff world file. The raster would then be imported into ArcGIS 9.2 for
the production of vector polygon interpretive maps. The GPR data would be processed in GPR Slice 6.0.
ESRI World Files of GPR time slices would be imported into ArcGIS 9.2. Finally, EM data are proposed
to be processed using ArchaeoSurveyor 2.0 and imported as GeoTiff files into ArcGIS.
Archaeological Investigations
The next task proposed in the NPS-approved research design would be to carry out the archaeological ground-truthing of selected geophysical anomalies at the J. T. King siteâparticularly anomalies that
may represent domestic structures (or portions of them), large storage pits, and hearthsâusing carefully
placed suites of closely-spaced shovel tests across specific areas of anomalies, as well as hand-excavated
units (either 50 x 50 cm or 1 x 1 m units) situated atop or within the boundaries of these anomalies. We
anticipated that between 8-10 hand-excavated units would be excavated to examine identified areas (using the GPS coordinates from the geophysical results for locational purposes) of geophysical anomalies
thought to have archaeological significance.
Shovel tests (we estimated that 20-25 shovel tests were to be excavated during the project) approximately 35 cm in diameter would first be excavated in key geophysical areas at the J. T. King site as well
as systematically across the area of known Historic Caddo archaeological deposits. Hand-excavated units
would follow the analysis of the findings from the shovel testing, including presence or absence of cultural features; the character of the archaeological sediments; and the kinds and density of recovered archaeological material remains, animal bones, and charred plant remains.
The shovel tests would be dug in 20 cm arbitrary levels to an approximate depth of 100 cm below surface, unless the clay B-horizon is encountered below that depth, and all sediments would be
screened through 1/4-inch mesh to recover artifacts at known depths. GPS readings would be taken at
each of the shovel tests with hand-held GPS units (GPS coordinates at each of those locations would
also be obtained with the RTK GPS), and their locations would then be plotted on site maps, along

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

17

with the locations of all hand-excavated units, that would be prepared at the conclusion of the investigations. Distributions of artifacts from the shovel testing (as well as the artifact data from the previously excavated shovel tests, if that information is available, see Middlebrook 2008, 2009) would also be
entered into ArcGIS and overlaid on the various geophysical datasets. This information would then be
used, along with the distribution of geophysical anomalies, to help decide where to strategically locate
areas to place excavation units.
The hand-excavated units to be placed in areas of geophysical anomalies, or other areas of archaeological significance recognized on the basis of the shovel testing, would be excavated in arbitrary10
cm levels until the clay B-horizon was reached (expected to be reached between 20-30 cm bs), as there
is apparently no recognizable cultural stratigraphy in the archaeological deposits (Middlebrook 2008,
2009). Unit excavation forms would be used to record the provenience and depth of any artifacts plotted
in place, the locations and depths of cultural stains and defined features, as well as to record the profiles
along at least one wall of every unit.
We expect to encounter numerous features in our work at the J. T. King site, based on the findings
from the earlier excavations (Middlebrook 2008, 2009). When features are identified, they are to be first
defined in plan view, then cross-sectioned for a detailed profile. This information, and other data about
the character of the feature fill, including the presence or absence of charred plant remains, animal bones,
and other associated artifacts, would be recorded on a Feature Form for each defined feature. The matrix
from the defined features would be collected for fine-screening and/or flotation, depending upon the apparent density of charred plant remains in the feature fill and the kind of feature (i.e., small post holes
tend to be unproductive with respect to the recovery of charred plant remains from flotation analysis,
given the small amount of feature fill in a typical post hole).
Recovery, analysis, and curation of recovered artifacts
During the archaeological ground-truthing investigations, we expect to recover temporally and/or
culturally diagnostic artifacts (Allen phase ceramics, particularly Patton Engraved sherds, and European
trade goods) from the J. T. King site, along with relatively undiagnostic pieces of lithic debris, animal
bones, etc. These artifacts are likely to be found in both shovel testing and the hand-excavated units.
We proposed to the NPS that recovered artifacts would be bagged by provenience from shovel tests
and hand-excavated units, then washed and sorted by material category (i.e., metal, glass, ceramic, etc.).
Their analysis would follow the analysis methods specified in Perttula and Nelson (2006:35-36) in their
study of Historic Caddo archaeological sites from the Neches River basin in East Texas. For recovered
Caddo ceramic sherds, the analysis would emphasize the acquisition of information on their stylistic and
technological character, focusing on the definition of recognizable decorative elements, paste characteristics, non-plastic inclusions, surface treatment, and firing conditions for each sherd in the sherd assemblages. The analysis of any recovered lithic artifacts would focus on the identification of the range of
chipped and ground stone tools in the siteâs lithic assemblage to characterize the stylistic, functional, and
morphological attributes of the tools for documenting local and regional affiliations of the Caddo peoples
living at the site. In the analysis of any recovered European trade goods as to their age and likely function, we proposed to rely on previously published studies of trade goods found on late 17th to early 19th
century Caddo sites in Texas and northwestern Louisiana (cf. Blaine 1996; Jelks 1967; Perttula 2005).
Accordingly, metal artifact analysis for this project would depend upon comparisons with the detailed
analysis of gun parts, knives, and horse gear completed by Blaine (1996). If any beads are recovered,
their classification would follow Kidd and Kidd (1970) and Perttula (2005:88-90).

Artifacts recovered during the archaeogeophysical and ground-truthing investigations at the J. T. King
site, which will be on private land, will be recovered for analysis and documentation, and then returned to
the private landowner, the rightful owners of these materials. We would propose to advise the landowner
of the benefits to the study of the local archaeology by the donation of artifacts for curation, and if they
so request, artifacts recovered from the J. T. King site on their property could be curated as a direct donation to an acceptable accredited curation facility, likely the Archaeology Laboratory at Stephen F. Austin
State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.
Report Preparation
The final result of this project is to be a published report (the present document) that summarizes
the archaeogeophysical and archaeological findings at the 18th century Caddo settlement of J. T. King
(41NA15), located directly on the northern section of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic
Trail. We proposed that the report would also discuss the archaeogeophysical and archaeological groundtruthing methods and techniques that were employed to identify and document the geophysical and archaeological character of this Historic Caddo site. In addition to summarizing our archaeogeophysical and
archaeological findings, the final report will present maps of the geophysical findings across the areas of the
J. T. King site that were the subject of this archaeological project, would offer recommendations about the
archaeological and historical significance of the Historic Caddo site, and detail future archaeogeophysical and
archaeological efforts that could be conducted at the J. T. King site and other known Historic Caddo sites that
could promote the understanding and appreciation of El Camino Real de los Tejas trail.
The final report document would also present information on any temporally and/or culturally diagnostic artifacts found during the archaeological ground-truthing. Finally, the document would discuss
how the J. T. King site archaeogeophysical findings are suited to promoting the understanding and appreciating the nature and character of Historic Caddo sites along the National Historic Trail.
The draft of the final report will be submitted to the National Park Service for their review and comment. The Texas Historical Commission and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma are also expected to review
and/or comment on the draft report, after it is provided to them by the National Park Service. All review
comments will be taken into account in our preparation of the final report.
Copies of the final report will be made available to the National Park Service, local interested parties,
and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.

RESULTS OF THE ARCHAEOGEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS
AT THE J. T. KING SITE,
by Chester P. Walker, with contributions by Timothy K. Perttula
Geophysical investigations were conducted January 21-24th and May 5-6, 2010, at the J. T. King site
(41NA15) under our National Park Service (NPS) contract. This work included a magnetometer system
towed behind an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) with data collection positioned by an RTK GPS system, an
EM meter recording both the quadrature phase (conductivity) and the in phase (magnetic susceptibility),
and a resistivity meter.
The 2008 geophysical survey and archaeological testing that was done prior to the initiation of the
NPS contract revealed that the area of the King property to the east of the driveway and north of the well
pad contained the highest concentration of intact subsurface archaeological deposits. For this reason,
the 2010 geophysical investigations were focused in this eastern portion of the property. The 2010 geophysical investigations included a recollection of 0.9 ha (2.2 acre) of the eastern portion of the site with
a fluxgate gradiometer (Figure 5). This data was collected with an updated version of the data collection
software that was originally used during the earlier 2008 investigations. During the 2010 investigations,
the magnetometer system was towed behind an ATV (Figure 5). An RTK GPS system was used to guide
the collection. Topographic data was also recorded during the 2010 magnetometer collection.
The 2010 magnetometer survey produced similar results to the 2008 survey. Nine of the 10 possible
Caddo structures recorded previously were located within the 2010 survey area (possible structure F is located to the west of the driveway). Improvements in how the data collection software records offsets from
the GPS antenna do not appear to have made a significant difference to the data. The 2008 magnetometer
data set was recorded with a small bug in the collection software that has been corrected for the 2010 collection work; the effects of this bug on the data quality are negligible.
Subsets of the larger magnetometer survey area were collected using ground penetrating radar (GPR),
resistivity, and EM. The GPR collection did not yield data that was useful for archeological interpretation. At the time of the GPR survey the soils at the J. T. King site were water-logged, thus increasing their
conductivity. The soils at the King site are also rich in iron oxides and thus quite conductive: wet and
highly conductive soils do not allow for successful GPR surveys.
A 40 x 40 m collection grid was positioned in the general area where artifact and feature recovery
were both high and the magnetometer data suggested the possibility that Caddo structures were present
(Figure 6). The entire 40 x 40 m unit was collected with the EM recording both quadrature phase (conductivity) and in phase (magnetic susceptibility) (Figures 7 and 8). The southwest 20 x 20 m corner of the
40 x 40 m collection area was surveyed with a resistance meter (Figure 9).
The conductivity data consists of an area of high conductivity (shown in black) that fades into an area
of lower conductivity (shown in white) (see Figure 7). This geophysical trend reveals areas with deeper
soils. This also possibly correlates to the presence of highly conductive anthropogenic deposits in the
northern portion of the EM collection area. These trends become more obvious when they are discussed
below in relation to their topographic setting. The magnetic susceptibility and resistivity datasets did not
reveal much in the way of useful information to aid in the interpretation (geologically or archaeologically) (see Figures 8 and 9). The various geophysical results demonstrate the need for including multiple
geophysical techniques in archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations. Using multiple instruments allows for a greater chance of a successful survey in the event that one or more of the techniques
do not yield informative data.

Results of the Geophysical Investigations at the J. T. King Site
Geophysical field surveys conducted at the J. T. King site on three occasions between December 7-8,
2008, and May 5-6 2010, covered a total area of 2.5 ha (ca. 6.1 acres). These investigations include multiple geophysical instruments, and in the case of the magnetometer, multiple surveys were done of subsets
within the 2.5 ha area that used different instrument settings. Data from these three field investigations
will be discussed below. Preliminary results from the December 2008 field investigations have been summarized in earlier sections of this report (see also Walker 2009b; Walker et al. 2009).
Some magnetometer anomalies were interpreted as possible structures primarily on the basis of their
similarities to anomalies from other geophysical surveys from Caddo sites so interpreted (Creel et al.
2004; Perttula, ed., 2008; Walker and Perttula 2008; Walker 2009a). Some of these arcs and sub-rectangular patterns are subtle. In our opinion, even partial arcs of magnetic anomalies that meet the general shape
and size of a Caddo structure (ca. 6-8 m for a domestic structure) located at a site with known Caddo
architectural remains are a clear indicator of the presence of Caddo architectural remains. When this geophysical data can be bolstered with the spatial co-association of certain kinds and distributions of artifacts
and other remains (i.e., faunal remains) recovered by excavations, it can be argued that the next step is to
begin to discuss the larger spatial and cultural patterns that reveal themselves through the fusion of the
various archaeological and archaeogeophysical data sets. At the J. T. King site, these data sets are beginning to reveal the spatial organization of an Historic Caddo community.
As previously mentioned, Figure 3 presented the entire geophysical data set collected with the GPS
method. The interpretative map of the magnetometer data is provided in Figure 4a. This is our best assessment of the Historic Caddo community organization of domestic structures and other features at the
J. T. King site. A magnetically quiet area (see Figure 3; i.e., an area with a drop in background magnetic
activity) in the central part of the eastern collection area has been proposed as a possible courtyard that
is flanked by structures of different shapes and sizes (see Figure 4a). The red areas on Figure 4a outlined
possible Caddo structures; the areas in yellow are areas with possible metal objects; the brown areas are
positive magnetic readings; and the blue are negative magnetic readings. On the western side of the site is
a fair amount of historic disturbances from burned late 19th-early 20th century Anglo-American houses
to buried pipes, with one large area of magnetic enhancement (see Figure 4b). A second area of magnetic
enhancement is associated with the Historic Caddo occupation in the eastern side of the GPS-guided
collection; this area of magnetic enhancement closely overlaps with the principal extent of the Historic
Caddo archaeological deposits at the site (see below), and signifies the widespread distribution of domestic trash and discarded artifacts, most notably sherds from fired ceramic vessels.
Topographic data recorded during the 2010 magnetometer survey of the eastern portion of the property can be used to show the relationships between the details of the landform and the various geophysical
datasets. The magnetometer data has been corrected for topography and shown at an oblique angle to enhance the 3D effect (Figure 10). The locations of the possible structures in this portion of the site are also
shown to provide a spatial perspective. The area between possible structure B and E has been discussed
as the location of a possible courtyard or plaza due to a subtle change in the background magnetic trends
across this area. The topographically-corrected data indicates that this area is clearly a low and possibly
eroded swale area. This presents, then, an additional possibility that account for the subtle changes noted
in the magnetic data, suggesting that this area is perhaps the result of erosion and not a former courtyard
or plaza. This is a difficult interpretation to make because of the possibility that erosion here may have
negatively affected any supporting archaeological evidence.

26

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

Another interesting correlation between the
topographic and magnetometer data is the high contrast
magnetic anomaly that is located directly to the west
of possible structure B. This anomaly is located
on the crest of the landform at the edge of the low
swale (see Figure 10). This trend is also apparent in
the conductivity data that has been topographically
corrected (Figure 11). The same high contrast
magnetometer anomaly corresponds to the area of the
highest conductivity. As one move down the landform
into the erosional swale, the soils are less conductive,
thus producing a clear pattern of high conductivity on
the crest of the landform and low conductivity in the
eroded swale area.

Figure 10. Topographically corrected
magnetometer data.

In summary, 10 possible Caddo structures have been detected in the initial archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site: they are round to sub-round in shape and range from 3.7 to 12.5 m in diameter
(see Figure 4a). Seven of the possible structures have anomalies situated in or close to their center that are
interpreted as central hearths or large post holes (i.e., center posts) inside Caddo domestic structures. None
of the possible structures have complete geophysical signatures and it is not possible to make out an entranceway or easily discern the orientation of the structures. The courtyard area, or open space, is between
two clusters of house structures (see Figure 4a). These open spaces or court yards on several Caddo sites in
the Neches and Angelina River basins often contain archaeological features and show signs of community
activity (Perttula, ed. 2008; Story 1982, 1995).
Archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site have the unique potential to fully define the
community structure of a Historic Caddo site occupied at the time of the use of El Camino Real de los
Tejas. There are only a few other Caddo sites from the area where community structure data has been obtained through laborious and costly hand and machine-excavations, namely two Middle Caddo sitesâthe
Tallow Grove (41NA231) and Beech Ridge (41NA242) sites excavated by as part of the Lake Naconiche
project on Naconiche Creek (Perttula 2008, ed.)âand the Deshazo site (41NA27), the well known Allen
phase Caddo site on Bayou Loco (Story 1982, 1995) near the NPS-plotted El Camino Real de los Tejas
crossing of that stream.
The Tallow Grove site has two grouping of
structures, with a northern group consisting of three
structures, a cemetery, and a midden/outdoor use area
(Figure 12a). There is an open area that is flanked
on the southwest by another structure and an associated midden deposit (Perttula 2008, ed.:Figure 5-29).
The Beech Ridge site also consisted of two groups of
structures: a northern group consisting of two round
structures and associated pits and hearths and outdoor
work areas as well as a single burial. An open area
was present between the northern group of structures
and their associated domestic debris and a southern
area with one sub-round structure with associated
storage pits and a single burial (Figure 12b, see also
Perttula 2008, ed.:Figure 5-49).

Figure 12. Archeological examples of prehistoric and historic Caddo community structure in the NechesAngelina river basin: a, Tallow Grove.

Area D at the Deshazo site contained eight structures in two clusters: a northern cluster of three overlapping circular structures and a southern cluster of five circular structures (three of which overlap) separated by a large open area. A large midden deposit used by the entire community is situated immediately
to the south of the southern cluster of house structures (Figure 12c, see also Story 1995:Figure 82).
The archaeological findings from the Tallow Grove, Beech Ridge, and Deshazo sites are very similar
in that they have house structure clusters flanking open areas, sometimes with associated midden deposits. The initial archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site has defined a comparable pattern of
community structure.
A few magnetic anomalies were successfully ground truthed at the J. T. King site in December 2008
and then during the NPS-sponsored work. There proved to be positive correlations between magnetometer anomalies and the occurrence of Caddo architectural features. Test Unit #10, for instance, was placed
over a negative magnetic anomaly in the area of a domestic structure identified in the archaeogeophysical
investigations. This test unit contained two features, one extending into the western wall of the unit and
one located just north of the center of the unit (see Figure 2c-d). This feature in the center was a large
post hole, as was the feature exposed in the western wall profile. The negative magnetic signature in this
area was caused by the presence of a negative relief feature containing a matrix of organic material that

is less magnetic than the surrounding ferrous subsoil. A large diffuse positive magnetic anomaly was also
tested with a shovel test and later opened into a 50 x 50 cm unit. A charcoal stain was defined in the unit,
and thermally altered features can be identified as positive magnetic anomalies; depending on the intensity and the amount of weathering, such thermal features could produce a much larger geophysical signature than their actual size.
Two points are worth emphasizing on the basis of the limited ground truthing completed at the J. T.
King site during the 2008 and 2010 investigations: (1) there is less detail in the magnetometer image than
was recovered in the test units. This pattern will more than likely continue in further investigations, especially for low magnetic negative relief features where the surrounding magnetic fields of the ferrous subsoil
can easily overpower that of the smaller pits and posts; and (2) the locations of magnetic anomalies and archaeological features will more than likely not be a strictly 1 to 1 correlation. Depending on the amplitudes
of the various magnetic fields of the feature and the magnetic fields surrounding the feature, there will be a
different offset between the size of the magnetic anomaly and the actual location of the feature.

RESULTS OF THE SHOVEL TESTING AND HAND EXCAVATION
INVESTIGATIONS AT THE J. T. KING SITE,
by Timothy K. Perttula,
Bo Nelson, and Mark Walters
During the course of the January 2010 archeological investigations, in addition to the
archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site, we completed more traditional subsurface
archaeological investigations at the site employing carefully placed shovel tests (35 cm in diameter) and
hand excavation units (1 x 1 m in size). In January 2010, the site was in a well-maintained and fenced
pasture (Figure 13).
In total, 34 new shovel tests were excavated at the site (25 shovel tests had been excavated at the site
previously (see Middlebrook 2008, 2009), along with 7 1 x 1 m units (1.77 m3 of archaeological deposits).
Ten 1 x 1 m units had been excavated at the site previously (see Middlebrook 2008, 2009) (Figure 14a-b).
The main goals of the shovel testing and hand excavation units were to: (1) independently establish
the specific spatial distribution and density of Historic Caddo artifacts and plant and animal remains

across the site as a whole, and also their distribution in relationship to previously defined structural and
feature anomalies (see Figure 4a), and (2) archaeologically ground-truth selected geophysical anomalies at
the J. T. King siteâparticularly anomalies that may represent domestic structures (or portions of them), large
storage pits, and hearthsâusing carefully placed suites of closely-spaced shovel tests across specific areas of
anomalies, as well as hand-excavated units situated atop or within the boundaries of these anomalies.
All 34 shovel tests excavated at the J. T. King site for the NPS CCSP grant contained archaeological materials, particularly an abundance of sherds from fine ware and utility ware vessels (Table 1). There is considerable variability in the distribution of artifacts from shovel tests dispersed across the site. With respect to
ceramic sherds, the densities range widely from 1-42 sherds per shovel test, or ca. 8-336 sherds per m2. The
density of lithic debris ranges only from 1-4 pieces per positive shovel test (ca. 8-32 pieces per m2), while
single examples of stone tools were recovered in only 9% of the shovel tests (Table 1). Fire-cracked rock was
found in only one shovel test. Other material culture remains, including ceramic pipe sherds, burned clay,
and a few 19th century historic artifacts (cut nail, a crimped piece of iron, and green glazed stoneware)
were found in 18% of the shovel tests. Wood charcoal and charred nutshells were present in only 9% of the
shovel tests, while animal bones were more widely dispersed, being recovered in 47% (including the shovel
tests reported by Middlebrook [2008, 2009]) of the shovel tests (see Bush and Schniebs, below). The density
of animal bones ranges from 1-12 pieces per positive shovel test (ca. 8-96 pieces per m2).

During the shovel testing, as we discuss in more detail below, four shovel tests encountered features
or apparent feature deposits (ST 45, 47, 49, and 62, see Figure 14a). These occurred in a ca. 15 x 10 m
area marked by positive geophysical anomalies east and northeast of geophysical structural anomaly D
(Areas 1 and 3, see below) and the possible courtyard. These features may be related to extra-mural or
outdoor activities at the J. T. King site rather than marking evidence for other structures.
The 7 1 x 1 m units (Units 11-17) were placed in areas with identified positive anomalies (Unit 11);
in and immediately adjacent to geophysical structural anomalies E, H, and I (Units 13, 14, and 16); in
non-geophysical structural areas where features were identified in shovel testing and are apparent as areas of positive anomalies (Units 12 and 17); and in an area where a possible European green coarse ware
sherd was recovered in shovel testing (ST 55) in a midden area west of geophysical structural anomaly D
(Unit 15) (see Figure 14a). An outdoor pit feature (Feature 14) and two post holes (Features 12-1 and 131) were identified and excavated in Units 11-13, respectively (see below).
The excavation of shovel tests and 1 x 1 m units has documented that archaeological deposits at the
J. T. King site ranging between 20-50 cm in thickness (see Tables 1 and 2). The archaeological materials occur predominantly in an Attoyac fine sandy loam A/E horizon soil (that developed in a forested
habitat) that ranges from red to dark yellowish-brown in color, overlying a red to reddish-brown ironrich clay Bt horizon (Figure 15a-b) (Dolezel 1980:15). In several shovel tests (ST 53 and ST 55) and
Unit 15 (see Figure 14a) in the western part of the site, however, the A/E horizon sandy loam deposits
are dark brown to very dark brown in color, with charcoal and bone flecks; these apparently mark trash
midden deposits.
The most notable artifact found in the work was a piece of a French copper kettle, probably a
fragment of a tinkler cone, from Unit 11. There are also high densities of ceramic sherds in each of the 1
x 1 m units, with densities ranging from 76-325 sherds per m2 (Table 2). Sherds account for almost 76%

of the recovered artifacts in the hand excavations at the J. T. King site, followed by wood charcoal and
nutshells (14%), lithic debris (7.6%), and stone tools (0.8%). The density of lithic debris ranges from
7-27 pieces per m2, and the density of tools (both chipped and ground stone) is 0-5 per m2.
Spatial Density of Artifacts and Animal Bone
The spatial density of various kinds of artifacts and animal bones on the J. T. King site provide a singular archaeological view of the distribution of material culture remains that cluster and are concentrated
in different parts of the site. This variability in spatial patterning provides hints to the intra-site organization of the Historic Caddo community that occupied the site, especially the location of midden areas and
possible outdoor activity areas. This information, when viewed in conjunction with the locations of different kinds and sizes of geophysical anomalies, or areas suspected to represent a possible courtyard, and
identified cultural features exposed in hand excavations, leads to more definitive insights into the overall
spatial character of the Historic Caddo community at the J. T. King site.
Including the results of earlier archaeological investigations as well as the 2010 work, Historic European trade goods are rare (n=4) in habitation contexts at the J. T. King site (Figure 16). These goods
include a glass bead east of geophysical anomaly D, a lead ball between geophysical anomalies F and
G, a cupreous or copper-base tinkler cone fragment from Unit 5, midway between geophysical structural
anomalies D and E, and a second cupreous or copper-base tinkler cone fragment from the same area as

Figure 16. Distribution of Historic European trade goods.

38

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

the lead ball. None of these trade goods were found in feature contexts, nor were they within the larger
geophysical anomalies of structure-size. The concentration of features in these same areas, however (see
below), suggest that there may have been structuresâperhaps ramadas, arbors, or elevated work areasâ
in these areas as well as outdoor work areas.
The shovel testing defined moderate (greater than 80 sherds per m2) and high densities (greater than
135 sherds per m2) of ceramic sherds in several areas of the site (Figure 17). The largest area, and including
shovel tests with moderate to high densities of sherds, is a ca. 40 x 40 m area in the south central part of the
site; this area has numerous positive geophysical anomalies (see Figure 4a), and is situated between geophysical structural anomalies D, G-H to the east, and geophysical anomalies F and J in the southern part of
the site. In the main, this density of sherds appears to mark an outdoor work area, where vessels were used
and broken, rather than an accumulation of sherds from inside habitation structural features. There are apparent midden deposits in the western part of this sherd distribution area. A second area of moderate sherd
density is specifically noted from shovel tests within and outside the boundaries of geophysical structural
anomaly I (Figure 17). The last area of moderate sherd density is from a single shovel test about 20 m east
of geophysical structural anomaly A, and these sherds are not apparently from a structural context.
It may be significant that there are not moderate or high densities of sherds in the area identified as a
possible courtyard. The absence of significant densities of artifacts or animal bones in the possible courtyard
area may also be a product of the fact that few shovel tests were excavated there, but most shovel tests to the

immediate north or south of the possible courtyard also do not have many artifacts (see Figures 17-20).
Stone tools (both chipped and ground stone) from the shovel tests are concentrated in only one area
of the J. T. King site: shovel tests immediately south and from within geophysical structural anomaly B
(Figure 18), north of the possible courtyard. These stone tools were not discarded in the one large and apparent outdoor work area south and west of the courtyardâwhere the ceramic sherds are concentrated, as
are animal bones and midden deposits.
Evidence of chipped stone tool manufacture at the J. T. King site is marked by the distribution of
pieces of lithic debris; the overall density (see Tables 1 and 2) of lithic debris suggests that chipped stone
tool manufacture was not a common activity at the site. There are two areas at the site with higher densities (ca. 24-32 pieces per m2) of lithic debris, one between the possible courtyard and geophysical structure anomaly D (Figure 19), in an apparent outdoor work and trash disposal area (see Figure 17), and the
other at the southern end of the site. This latter area, about 40 x 20 m in size (Figure 19), partially overlaps with geophysical structural anomalies H and I, and may mark the chipped stone knapping activities
of the occupants of geophysical structural anomalies G-I.
Burned and unburned animal bone was also relatively abundant in a number of shovel tests,
particularly in non-geophysical structural anomaly areas (Figure 20). This suggests that the distribution
of bone may mark the locations of midden deposits or more concentrated trash disposal areas. The

highest densities (ca. 60 bones per m2) of bone occurs between geophysical structural anomaly D and
geophysical structural anomaly G. The area of ST 55 (and Unit 15) also has a substantial density of
animal bones in the archaeological deposits.
Of the 59 shovel tests that have been excavated at the J. T. King site between 2008-2010, four of them (ST
24, 36, 38, and 54) have animal bone from within geophysical structural anomalies (i.e., B, G-I), while another 24 shovel tests outside of structural anomalies have animal bone. Most of the latter are in the area between
geophysical structural anomalies D and G, or are in an area about 10 m south of geophysical structural anomalies H and I (see Figure 20). This clearly suggests that animal bone was discarded as trash in outdoor contexts,
such as a midden or work area, but not far from domestic structures.
Features encountered in the archaeological investigations
A considerable number (n=17) of cultural features or possible cultural features have been identified
to date at the J. T. King site from the work completed under the NPS Challenge Cost Share contract as
well as the earlier volunteer work reported by Middlebrook (2008, 2009). Features have been found in
five different areas of the site, including an area (Area 1) between geophysical structural anomalies D and
E; Area 2 between geophysical anomalies F and G (Area 2); just west of the possible courtyard (Area 3);
in geophysical structural anomaly D; and in geophysical structural anomaly I (Figure 21 and Table 3).
These include four pits, a small pit or a large post hole, and 12 post holes.

Figure 20. Distribution of the highest density of animal bones in shovel testing.

The pit features are found only in Areas 1 and 2. These areas are interpreted as outdoor work areas
between geophysical structural anomalies. The pits range from 25-45 cm in diameter, and are marked by
dark organically-enriched stains as well as flecks of animal bone and charred plant remains/wood charcoal
(Figures 22a-b, 23, and 24). The use of these pits is not known with any certainty, but if indeed they are situated outside of structures, then they are the remnants of outdoor work activities (i.e., cooking and heating
of foods, processing hides and other goods, stone tool manufacture) as well as plant food storage (and later
trash disposal) in basin-shaped pits. Cluster of post holes amidst pit features may mark the location of a
small (ca. 3-4 m) ramada or work platform (cf. Kelley 1997:Figure 20; Trubowitz 1984:91-92).
The post hole features are found in Areas 1, 2, and 3 (see Table 3 and Figure 21), as well as in geophysical structural anomalies D and I. The post holes tend to range from 14-25 cm in diameter. This size
range is consistent with their use in wall post supports, particularly post holes used in Caddo house construction. One post hole (Feature 7) and a possible post hole or pit (Feature 11) range from 31-35 cm in
diameter. In the case of the Feature 7, this may well be a roof support post associated with geophysical
structural anomaly D. The Feature 11 post hole, if it is situated outside of a structure in an outdoor work
area, may mark part of an everyday ancillary facility (i.e., part of a screen or rack), although some large
posts on Caddo sites to mark special deposits, such as buried and burned structures, graves, or plaza areas
(cf. Creel et al. 2004; Perttula 2005 [ed.]; Perttula and Sherman 2009:83-86).

In summary, the cultural features at the J. T. King site testify to the permanence, perhaps for one or
two generations given the estimated durability of Caddo wood structures (cf. Good 1982), of the Historic
Caddo occupation along El Camino Real de los Tejas. The features are domestic in nature, relating to
house construction and use, likely the heating and cooking using a fire hearth (geophysical anomalies interpreted as central hearths have been identified), cooking and baking foods in earthen pits outside structures in activity areas, and food storage in basin pits either inside or outside house structures. The pits,
both small and large, would also have served as convenient receptacles for trash disposal.
Material Culture Remains
A large quantity of archaeological material culture remains have been recovered from the J. T. King
site during the work reported on here. This includes many ceramic vessel sherds, as well as ceramic
pipe sherds, pieces of burned clay, chipped and ground stone tools and debris, artifacts of European or
American manufacture, and well-preserved paleobotanical and faunal remains. Each of the different
kinds of archaeological materials belonging to these artifact categories is discussed in more detail below.

Leslie Bush and LeeAnna Schniebs present analyses of the paleobotanical remains and faunal remains,
respectively.
Artifacts of European or American Manufacture
A single piece of a cupreous or copper-base (Ehrhardt 2005) kettle fragment was recovered from Unit
11 (13-15 cm bs) at the J. T. King site. The piece has folded edges, is 44.2 mm in length, 20.7 mm in
width, and 1.7 mm thick (Figure 25a), and is probably a discarded piece of kettle scrap that was perhaps
intended for tinkling cone manufacture (see Ehrhardt 2005:Figures 6.6a and 6.10). The other tinkler cone
fragment is from Unit 5 (0-10 cm bs) (Figure 25b).
More recent 19th century historic artifacts at the J. T. King site include two cut nail fragments
(1820-1891, Wells 2000) from ST 34 (0-20 cm bs) and Unit 17 (15-20 cm bs) (Figure 26a-b), a small
piece of crimped iron (ST 28, 0-20 cm bs), and a green glazed stoneware sherd from ST 55 (0-20 cm bs)
(Figure 26c). The green glazed stoneware sherd is from a wheel-made jar, has a gray paste, and a thin
green lead glaze, possibly an alkaline glaze (cf. Greer 1981), on both interior and exterior vessel surfaces. The sherd does not resemble more than superficially the late 17th-early 18th century green glazed
Saintonge Plain or other French green glazed coarse earthenwares (cf. Reese 2007: Figures 7, 9-10).
These artifacts are not associated with the Historic Caddo occupation. Rather, they appear to represent a
transitory use of the J. T. King site after ca. 1820 by an unknown group that may have constructed a log
cabin somewhere on the site.

Aboriginal Ceramic Vessel Sherds
There are 574 plain sherds (including six rims) and 1120 decorated sherds from the 2010 investigations at
the J. T. King site; Middlebrook (2008:Table 3) reports that 208 plain sherds and 844 decorated sherds were
recovered in the first part of the earlier investigations at the site (see above). The plain to decorated sherd ratio
(P/DR) in the 2010 assemblage is 0.51 (but 0.25 in the Middlebrook inventoried sample), generally consistent
with an early Historic Allen phase occupation in the Angelina River basin. At the apparently contemporaneous
Deshazo site in the Bayou Loco drainage, the P/DR is only 0.29 (Fields 1995:Table 63).
All sherds in the assemblage were categorized by sherd type and ware type (i.e., plain, utility, and fine), as
well as the kind of decorative method and element identified on them. Appendix 2 of this report provides the
detailed analyses of temper, firing condition, surface treatment, rim and lip form, and vessel wall thickness of a
representative sample of 247 sherds (14.6% of the total assemblage) from the J. T. King assemblage.
Utility ware sherdsâwet paste decorated jars and bowls with coarse tempersâcomprise approximately 88% of the decorated wares at J. T. King (Table 4), and 70% of all the rims. In the Middlebrook
(2008:Table 3) sample, more than 90.5% of the decorated sherds are from utility wares. Fine waresâcarinated bowls, bowls, and bottles with post-firing engraved decorations, and typically with a finely crushed
temperâaccount for another 17% of the rims but just over 11.7% of all the sherds, while plain rims represent 12.8% of the J. T. King rim sherd sample.

Plain Sherds
The relative high frequency of plain rims (12.8%) among all the rim sherds at the J. T. King site indicate that plain vessels (see Table 4)âprimarily bowls, but likely other vessel forms as well (cf. Fields
1995:181)âmay comprise a substantial part of the vessels made and used by the Caddo inhabitants of
the site. Most of the plain rims are from vessels that have a direct or vertical profile with a rounded lip.
Utility Ware Sherds
Brushed rim and body sherds dominate the utility wares from the J. T. King site (Table 5). Almost
89% of all the utility ware sherdsâas well as 42% of the utility ware rimsâhave brushing decorations
on them, either as the sole decoration or in combination with incised, punctated, or appliqued decorations. It is likely that the brushing covered both the rim and the body, with the brushing marks reaching
to just above the base. Similar proportions of brushed pottery are noted at the contemporaneous Deshazo
and Henry M, sites, where 85.6% and 88%, respectively, of all the decorated pottery has brushing marks
(Fields 1995:Table 63; Perttula et al. 2010:Table 2). In the Middlebrook (2008:Table 3) sample of decorated sherds from the J. T. King site, those with brushing comprise 96.4% of the sample of utility wares.

All of the brushed rims have horizontal brushing marks (Figure 27b), but one brushed-punctated rim
has both horizontal and diagonal brushing. This includes those rims that also have tool punctations under
the vessel lip, punctations in rows on the rim that have been pushed through the brushing (Figure 28), or
that have a horizontal appliqued fillet under the vessel lip (see below).
The body sherds that just have brushing as the sole decoration have primarily parallel brushing
(n=834, 98.5% of the body sherds with identifiable brushing patterns) (see Figure 27a, e-f); the orientation of the brushing is uncertain, but it is likely that the brushing extended vertically from the rim to the
vessel base. Other brushing decorations included overlapping brushing marks (n=8, 0.9%, see Figure
27d) and opposed brushing (n=5, 0.6%, see Figure 27c).
The brushed-punctated sherds include five rims and three body sherds (Table 6 and see Figure 28).
The rims are either horizontal or horizontal-diagonal brushed, with rows of tool or linear tool punctates
under the lip and above the brushing, or pushed through the brushing itself (see Fields 1995:Figure 61a-e;
Perttula et al. 2010:Figure 10a-c). In each case, the punctates are made by tools whose shaped end was
pushed into the wet clay after it had been brushed.
The brushed-appliqued sherds from the J. T. King site include one rim and four body sherds with horizontal or parallel brushing and appliqued elements (see Table 6). The one rim has a horizontal appliqued

fillet placed over the brushing or between areas with brushing (Figure 29d; see also Fields 1995:Figure
60g-h). Two of the four body sherds have parallel brushed areas adjacent to or amidst either a single
straight appliqued fillet or ridge; the fillet or ridge may have divided the body into panels filled with
brushing. The remaining body sherd has an appliqued node amidst areas with parallel brushing marks.
Because of the absence of rims among the brushed-incised sherds from the site (see Table 6), this
decorative method was probably confined only to the body of utility ware jars. Most of these sherds have
intermingled parallel or opposed brushed and parallel incised lines. Other brushed-incised sherds from
the J. T. King site include two with parallel brushing and overlapping parallel incised lines that overlie
and cut through the brushing.
There are five distinctive brushed-incised body sherds of Spradley Brushed-Incised in the J. T. King
ceramic assemblage (see Table 6 and Figure 29a, c). This is a new utility ware type of Historic Caddo
age in the Angelina-Neches River basin in East Texas defined on the basis of a number of such brushedincised sherds at the Spradley site (41NA206). These sherds have parallel brushing overlain with closelyspaced perpendicular incised lines. Spradley Brushed-Incised sherds have also been recovered at the Deshazo site (see Fields 1995:Figure 61i) and Henry M. (Perttula et al. 2010:Figure 10d), and a number of
other Allen phase sites (Shawn Marceaux, November 2008 personal communication).
Approximately 6.8% of the utility wares have incised decorative elements; this includes only one rim
sherd, however (see Table 5). The incised sherds have simple straight, opposed, diagonal, and geometric
decorative elements (Table 7). The one rim has horizontal incised lines.
Parallel (Figure 30e), cross-hatched (Figure 30c), and opposed incised line decorative elements are
represented in the incised body sherds, along with many sherds with only a single straight incised line
(see Table 7). Notably absent are curvilinear or circular incised elements in the J. T. King utility wares;
there are a few such sherds in the Deshazo decorated sherd assemblage (Fields 1995:Figure 72c, f).
The three incised-punctated sherds include one rim and two body sherds (see Table 7). The rim has
horizontal incised lines encircling the vessel, with single rows of punctations between the horizontal

lines. One of the body sherds has parallel incised lines adjacent to at least one area or row of tool punctations, while the other body sherd has a row of tool punctates both above and below parallel incised lines;
the incised lines probably formed triangular zones filled with punctates that are divided by several parallel incised lines (see Fields 1995:Figure 74e).
The punctated sherds only comprise 2.2% of the utility wares from the J. T. King site, with a brushed
to punctated sherd ratio of 40:1; at the Henry M. and Deshazo sites, the brushed to punctated sherd ratios are a very similar 42.8:1 and 54:1, respectively (see Perttula et al. 2010; Fields 1995). At the J. T.
King site, all of the punctated sherds have tool punctates. The punctations, regardless of the form of the
punctation, occur in rows, probably restricted to the rim and/or upper body of utility ware jars (see Figure
30a, d). The rows of punctations on the rim sherds are found in a single row under the vessel lip (see also
Fields 1995:Figure 73a) or in multiple rows from the top to the bottom of the rim.
Approximately 0.5% of the utility ware sherds at the J. T. King site have a grooved decoration (see
Table 5). The rim and body sherds from the J. T. King site simply have horizontal or parallel grooves (see
Figure 30b). Very similar decorated sherds have been recovered at several other historic Caddo sites in
the Angelina and Neches River basins in East Texasâincluding at the Deshazo site (Fields 1995:199-200
and Figure 75d-e) and the Henry M. site (Perttula et al. 2010:Figure 12a-b)âand this kind of grooved
utility ware has recently been dubbed Lindsey Grooved because of its abundance at the Lindsey site
(41CE293). Although categorized as âridgedâ pottery at the Deshazo site, Fields (1995:199-200) describes

55

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

the decorative technique as âthe manipulation of the vessel surface to form shallow horizontal grooves
alternating with mounded ridges. The grooves are trough shaped and the ridges are not appliqued.â To avoid
confusion with the Belcher Ridged type, and its very different form of ridged decoration, the horizontal
grooves were chosen as the defining criteria for this new Caddo utility ware type.
The appliqued sherds from the J. T. King site (n=11, 1.2% of the utility wares, see Table 5) have
straight appliqued fillets (see Figure 29b, e) or appliqued ridges; the straight appliqued fillet is the most
common appliqued decorative element on body sherds at the Deshazo site (Fields 1995:199 and Figure
75a) as well as the Henry M. site (Perttula et al. 2010). One body sherd has a cluster of small appliqued
nodes, and the single rim sherd has appliqued nodes on it.
Finally, there are two body sherds (0.2% of the utility wares, see Table 5) with parallel rows of pinching. The pinching is likely oriented vertically on the bodies of Killough Pinched jars (Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 46f-h).
Fine Ware Sherds
The 130 fine ware sherds from the J. T. King site (see Table 4) include sherds from vessels with engraved
(n=128), engraved-brushed (n=1), and engraved-punctated (n=1) elements. Slightly more than 17% of all
the rims from the site are from fine ware vessels (see Table 4), indicating that fine ware vessels were in common use by its Caddo residents during the occupation of the site. Engraved vesselsâcarinated bowlsâwith
engraved rim panels and brushed vessel bodies are also present (0.8%) in the fine ware assemblage, but not
nearly as commonly represented as they are at the Henry M. site (see Perttula et al. 2010:Table 5).
The most distinctive of the fine ware ceramics from the J. T. King site are sherds from Patton Engraved bowls and carinated bowls (Table 8). Fifty percent of the fine ware rim sherds are from Patton Engraved vessels, and 32.3% of all the engraved sherds from the site can be identified as belonging to this

type (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 59). The decoration on Patton Engraved vessels consist primarily of
a series of simple horizontal or curvilinear engraved lines with tick marks on the vessel rim, either triangular-shaped tick marks (n=40, 95%), linear tick marks (n=1, 2%), or oval-shaped (n=1, 2%) tick marks.
All four of the rim sherds of Patton Engraved (Figure 31c) have horizontal lines with tick marks (possibly
from Patton Engraved, var. Allen or var. Fair, see Perttula 2008c:Figure 2). None of the Patton Engraved
sherds can be identified as being from a vessel with a brushed body.
Body sherds of Patton Engraved have parallel, opposed, straight/diagonal, rectilinear, and straight
lines with tick marks (see Figure 31a-b, d-g); sherds with multiple parallel engraved lines with ticking are
consistent with Patton Engraved, var. Allen. Several of the Patton Engraved body sherds also have curvilinear lines with tick marks (see Table 8).
King Engraved and Poynor Engraved vessel sherds are also present in the J. T. King fine ware assemblage, but they are much less common than Patton Engraved vessels. King Engraved sherds comprise
5.4% of the engraved fine wares, while Poynor Engraved sherds account for only 1.5% of the engraved
fine wares (Table 9). There is also an engraved-punctated rim sherd in the J. T. King collection, but it is
not currently typeable (Figure 32e).
The King Engraved type have cross-hatched engraved zones, either in panels, panel dividers, or in
large bands apparently oriented in several directions on the rim panel (Figure 33a-b, e). Similar sherds

have been documented at the Deshazo site (Fields 1995:Figure 70d, j-l), the Henry M. site (Perttula et al.
2010:Figures 14b and 15b), as well as in other Historic Caddo ceramic assemblages in the Angelina River
basin (Shawn Marceaux, November 2008 personal communication). The two Poynor Engraved sherds
from the J. T. King site (Figure 33c-d) have either hatched or cross-hatched hourglass-shaped panel divider or bracket elements (cf. Poynor Engraved, var. Hood or var. Freeman).
The remainder of the fine wares from the J. T. King site include three rim sherds and 75 body
sherds (Table 10). The rim sherds have horizontal engraved lines, but the full stylistic motif is not apparent. One body sherd from a possible Taylor Engraved carinated bowl has a portion of a hooked
arm scroll and an excised bracket element (see Figure 32d). One distinctive body sherd has zig-zag
lines, and a sherd with the same decorative element has been identified from a possible Natchitoches
Engraved vessel in a late 18th-early 19th century context at 41NA223 (see Perttula 2008a:Figure 1e).
Another sherd may be from a Hume Engraved vessel because it has a row of larger (i.e., larger than
tick marks) engraved triangles (but not apparently hatched) that may be pendant to a straight line. The
vessel sherds with pendant triangles are probably from Hume Engraved, var. Allen bowls (Perttula
2008c:Figure 2f). Similar vessels are present at the Henry M. site (Perttula et al. 2010:Figure 16a-c),
and may be present at the Deshazo site (Fields 1995:Figure 65j), where they are identified as sherds
from Patton Engraved vessels, however.

Other engraved sherds at the J. T. King primarily have simple geometric elements. These include
sherds with horizontal lines, diagonal lines, opposed lines, parallel lines, curvilinear lines, brackets, and
single straight lines (see Figure 32a-c and Table 10).
Less than 1% of the engraved sherds from the site are from carinated bowls that also have brushed
bodies (see Table 10). The one sherd from the J. T. King site has horizontal lines on the rim panel of a
carinated bowl, and the body has horizontal brushing marks. At the Henry M. site, several engravedbrushed sherds have cross-hatched engraved zones on the rim panel, while the others have simple geometric engraved elements, probably part of simple scrolls or the defining lines of the rim panels themselves (see Perttula et al. 2010:Figure 15a).
Engraved bottle sherds are rare at the J. T. King site, comprising approximately 1.5% of the fine
wares. These body sherds have curvilinear lines.
Only 1.5% of the engraved sherds have a clay pigment rubbed in the engraved decoration. In each
instance, the clay pigment is a white kaolin clay mixture. One of the sherds with pigment is from a Patton Engraved rim sherd with horizontal engraved lines, one of which has triangular tick marks (see Table
8 and Figure 31c), and the other has an engraved-punctated decorative element ladder motif on it (see
Figure 32e). Less than 1% of the fine wares at the Deshazo site have evidence of pigment use (see Fields
1995:183-197), and 2.4% of the engraved sherds from the Henry M. site have pigment rubbed into the designs, but in both cases a white kaolin clay pigment was employed to enhance the decorative motif. The
use of a white kaolin clay pigment for decoration in Allen phase vessels is a color preference that was

60

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

first noted by Campbell (1936); earlier Late Caddo fine ware vessels more commonly had both red and
white pigments (Perttula 2008d).
Use of Tempers
Several kinds of materials were chosen by Caddo potters for use as temper in the manufacture of the
ceramic vessels used and broken at the J. T. King site (Table 11). Approximately 90.9% of the sherds analyzed for temper have grog (crushed sherds or fired clay) inclusions, either as the sole temper (typically
in the fine wares), or in combination with crushed and burned bone or crushed hematite/ferruginous sandstone fragments.
Crushed pieces of hematite or ferruginous sandstone and bone are both common aplastics in the J.
T. King vessel sherds, being present in 17.4% and 19%, respectively, of the sherds analyzed in detail
(see Table 11). In an analysis of Historic Caddo sherds from the Henry M. site (41NA60), Perttula et al.
(2010) found that the plain wares and utility waresâused for every-day tasks and for cooking and storageâhad higher percentages of sherds with hematite or ferruginous sandstone temper, and these wares
generally had a coarser paste than did the fine wares because of their more durable character. This was
also apparent in the Henry M. sherd assemblage in the relative frequency of sherds by ware that had
crushed and burned bone temper (see Perttula et al. 2010:Table 10). The plain wares and the utility wares
had the highest proportions of this temper, and the fine wares at the Henry M. site had very little bone
temper. Shell-tempered sherds at the J. T. King site are present only in miniscule proportions (0.4%).
Considerable numbers of sherds at the J. T. King site are from vessels with a sandy paste: 25.2% (see
Table 11). A naturally sandy alluvial clay was likely used by Caddo potters to manufacture many of the vessels
at the site, provided that the sandy clay was tempered with grog, hematite, or bone to hold the paste together.
One coarsely-textured sandy paste sherd from the site appears to be from a Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified vessel. This type is diagnostic of a Woodland period (ca. 2500-1200 years B.P.) occupation of
the Mossy Grove Culture (Story 1990; Perttula 2008 [ed.]), and it is a characteristic material culture feature of Woodland period occupations in the southern part of East Texas (i.e., south and west of the Sabine
River to as far west as the Neches River valley), but occur also in abundance in Southeast Texas sites as
far south as the Gulf Coast. These sites are part of the Mossy Grove Culture defined by Story (1990:Figure 39), and one of the areas where Mossy Grove Culture sites are specifically found in abundance is the
Neches-Angelina River area of East Texas.
Firing Conditions
The ceramic vessels at the J. T. King site were fired in several different ways, but not necessarily in a
regular or well-controlled fashion, as determined by the analysis of firing conditions (see Teltser 1993).
This is indicated by the presence of sherds that are from vessels that were incompletely oxidized during firing or were possibly re-heated/sooted/smudged (Table 12). These categories of firing account for
16.1% of the sherds analyzed in detail from the site (see Appendix 2).
Overall, the sherds are primarily from vessels that were fired in a reducing or low oxygen firing
(70.9%), with many of these that were then subsequently cooled in the open air (60%) (see Table 12).
This left one or both surfaces of the vessel with a lighter color than the vessel core. About 13% of the
sherds come from vessels that were fired and cooled in a high oxygen environment, producing some vessels that were uniformly a light red, reddish-brown, or yellowish-brown color. Only 10.9% of the sherds
came from vessels with a gray, dark gray, or black interior and exterior surface color (see Table 12).

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas
Ceramic Comparisons between the J. T. King Site and other Historic Caddo
Sites in Nacogdoches County, Texas

Archaeological investigations at a number of Historic Caddo sites in Nacogdoches County, Texas,
including the J. T. King (41NA15), David King (41NA321), Henry M. (41NA60), Deshazo (41NA27),
and Spradley (41NA206) sites (see Middlebrook and Perttula 2008; Perttula et al. 2010; Perttula, Nelson,
and Walters 2010; Fields 1995), have led to the recent study of the stylistic and technological character of
Historic Caddo ceramic assemblages in East Texas. The J. T. King and David King sites, within 1 km of
each other, are on King Creek, the Henry M. and Deshazo sites are on Bayou Loco, and the Spradley site
is on Lanana Creek. It is suspected that differences and similarities in the range and diversity in ceramic
styles of utility ware and fine ware vessel sherds from contemporaneous Historic Caddo sites not only
provide clear evidence of the intensity and extent of interaction and cultural transmission practices that
may have been in effect at the site, but also the character of local ceramic traditions. Furthermore, it is
possible to also suggest that they represent different but clearly related social groups or communities of
Caddo peoples living in the Angelina River basin (Corbin 2007; Perttula 2007:78).
How do these sites compare with each other with respect to the decorative classes present in the utility wares and fine wares? All five sites are dominated by brushed utility wares (Table 13). At Spradley,
however, brushed pottery (i.e., sherds with brushing, irrespective of other decorative methods) comprises
53.4% of the decorated sherds (including the distinctive Spradley Brushed-Incised type) compared to
72.7-85.6% of the decorated sherds from J. T. King, David King, Henry M., and Deshazo. Incised, punctated, and incised-punctated decorative classes, moreover, are only abundant in the Spradley ceramic assemblage (30.8%), but much rarer in the utility wares from the other four sites (less than 8.3%).
Fine waresâespecially Patton Engravedâcomprise between 11.4% and 15% of the decorated sherds
at the J. T. King, David King, Spradley, and Henry M. sites (see Table 13), suggesting that fine wares were

Bolded and underlined entries represent significant similarities between sites in relative proportions
+=percentage; *present, but not quantified in Fields (1995); **robust sample from the site

equally abundant and regularly accessible to the inhabitants at each of these Historic Caddo sites. The exact proportion of engraved sherds cannot be determined at the Deshazo site because engraved and incised
sherds were not quantified separately in the analysis by Fields (1995). Based on the proportions of decorative classes in Table 13, however, engraved sherds can constitute no more than 13.7% of the Deshazo decorated sherds, comparable to the other sites, but this proportion is likely to be somewhat less than that amount
(recent reanalysis by Shawn Marceaux of the Deshazo decorated sherds will clarify the matter).
The J. T. King, David King, Henry M., and Deshazo ceramics are primarily grog-tempered (80.691.9%) (Table 14). Bone-tempered pottery, conversely, is much more abundant at the Spradley site, suggesting the existence of a different tradition of ceramic manufacture there when compared to the widespread use of grog temper at the two King Creek and two Bayou Loco sites. Shell-tempered pottery is
rare in each of these assemblages (less than 0.9%). Later (ca. post-1750) Caddo ceramic assemblages in
the Angelina River basin have higher percentages of shell-tempered wares: 5.4% at 41NA223 (ca. 17501800, Perttula 2008a) and 8.3% at the DâOrtolan site (41NA299, ca. 1790-1820, Perttula 2008b).

When the ceramic comparisons are extended to a broader part of Nacogdoches County (Table 15),
employing several categories of decoration proposed by Middlebrook (2007:Table 1) as a means to differentiate contemporaneous ceramic assemblages, it may perhaps be possible to begin the effort to distinguish different Caddo groups and communities living in the area. In Table 15, we employ selected Historic Caddo ceramic assemblages with more than 196 total sherds, and list them by drainage.

* Except for 41NA223, the sherd data from the other listed sites is from Middlebrook (2007: Table 1). **% Brushed is
the percentage of all sherds with brushing as the only surface treatment; Brushed/Plain is the ratio of brushed sherds to
plain or undecorated sherds; and % Brushed/Brushed + Plain is the percentage of the sherds with brushing compared to
all the sherds in a collection that do not have âmore elaborate decorative styles such as incised, engraved, or punctatedâ
(Middlebrook 2007:101).

An inspection of Table 15 indicates that (1) the closest ceramic comparisons between the J. T. King
site and all the other known Nacogdoches County historic Caddo sites is with various sites along Bayou
Loco, including 41NA21, 41NA22, and 41NA23; (2) Bayou Loco and Angelina River sites are dominated by brushed utility wares. In the case of the Bayou Loco sites, they can be divided into two groups
based on the relative proportion of brushed wares, one group with proportions ranging from 43-48.7%
and the other with proportions between 59.8-69.4% (see Table 15); and (3) the Lanana Creek Caddo sites,
the Legg Creek site, and the Attoyac Bayou site are part of different local ceramic traditions, a tradition
where brushed pottery is a much less important part of the utility ware assemblages, particularly in Caddo sites on Attoyac Bayou and Lanana Creek (see Table 15).
Table 15 makes clear that there are distinct spatial groupings of Allen phase sites in Nacogdoches
County. Table 16 reshuffles the sites to regroup them by proportional similarity in the percentages and
ratios expressed in the same ceramic attributes previously employed in Table 15, irrespective of stream

drainage, leading to the recognition of five distinct groupings of generally contemporaneous Historic
Caddo sites: Group I on Lanana Creek, Group II on the lower Bayou Loco, Group III on the upper part of
Bayou Loco and other streams draining into the Angelina River, including the David King site on King
Creek, Group IV sites on the upper Bayou Loco, King Creek (the J. T. King site), and Legg Creek, and a
single site (Group V) near the confluence of Attoyac Bayou and the Angelina River (41NA67).

Pipe Sherds
The Caddo peoples that lived at the J. T. King site made and smoked ceramic elbow pipes, typically
with flaring rim bowls (cf. Napoleon 1995; Perttula et al. 2010), and they were often decorated on the bowl
as well as the stem with punctated, engraved, or incised elements. There are a total of three sherds in the assemblage, two from the bowl (Unit 11, 10-20 cm bs and Unit 17, 10-15 cm bs) and one from the area where
the bowl and stem were attached on the pipe (ST 53, 10-20 cm bs). Differences in temper and firing conditions, as well as decorative styles, suggest these small sherds may each be from different pipes.
The pipes were tempered with grog, and one had a noticeably sandy paste. All three sherds are from
pipes fired in a reducing or low oxygen environment, but two of them were cooled in the open air, leaving
a brown oxidized outer surface. Bowl rims were 3.2-3.3 mm in thickness.

Burned Clay

Small amounts of burned clay pieces (n=19) have been recovered from the shovel testing and the
1 x 1 m unit excavations (Table 17). The burned clay may be preserved remnants of clay-lined hearths or
earth ovens, or simply the product of the accidental heating and burning of earth from outdoor fires at the
site. The highest densities of burned clay (ST 55 and Unit 15) are from investigations in the western part
of the site.

Chipped Stone Tools
The chipped stone tools (n=10) from the site include four flake tools or scrapers with use wear, two
Jowell knives (cf. Jones 1968, Unit 13, 10-20 cm and ST 42, 0-20 cm bs), a Perdiz arrow point (Unit 12,
0-10 cm bs), and three dart points. The tools are made of various cherts from non-local sources (70%), as
well as quartzite (10%) and petrified wood (20%) from local raw material sources.
Three of the flake tools from the J. T. King site are expedient tool forms (Table 18); that is, they are
âflake/blade blanks that have not been altered prior to their use in the performance of a task (e.g., the use
of an unmodified flake as a knife or scraper)â (Tomka 2001:209). Tomka (2001:208) suggests that expedient flake tools were more likely used for tasks and activities that emphasized the âprocessing of smaller
quantities of resourcesâ than would formal knapped tools. Each of the tools has evidence in the form of
micro-edge flaking from tool use. Utilized lengths on the expedient flake tools range from 8.2-11.3 mm.
A single chipped stone scraping tool, likely a formal hafted tool (see Tomka 2001:209-210), is
present in the stone tool assemblage from the site, comprising 10% of the chipped stone tools from the
site. Other Allen phase sites (cf. Girard 1995; Perttula and Nelson 2007; Perttula et al. 2010) have considerable numbers or proportions of flake scraping tools, suggesting that the butchering and processing
of large game animals was an important activity during Historic Caddo times in parts of the NechesAngelina River basins. The generally small overall size of the majority of scraping tools at these sites
when compared to those found on contemporaneous Southern Plains villages, where large numbers of
bison were butchered and processed (cf. Odell 2008; Perkins et al. 2008), also suggests that the focus
of Caddo butchering and processing activities was on medium-sized prey that was being hunted, such
as deer.

Two Jowell knives, one fragmentary and fractured longitudinally (Figure 34), are among the chipped
stone tools found at the J. T. King site in the 2010 investigations. Both are made from a non-local gray
chert (Table 19). The Jowell knives are bifacially chipped to shape, have areas of use wear along the edges and/or tips of the tools, and have rounded or bi-pointed proximal and distal ends (see Cole 1975:183);
the blade of one tool has been resharpened, probably after the tool became dulled.

These distinctive chipped stone tools are known from burial contexts at several Allen phase sites
in the upper Neches River basin, including the Jowell and Cecil sites (Cole 1975:Figure 13). Jones
(1968:184 and Plate 29) also identified Jowell knives from one Historic Caddo Kinsloe phase cemetery
site in the Sabine River basin, and described them as having âground edges. All are made of foreign light
and dark colored cherts and flints.â
The one arrow point from the 2010 investigations at the J. T. King site is a petrified wood Perdiz
point (Figure 35 and Table 20). The point is bifacially chipped, with a narrow contracting stem, a serrated
blade, and small downward-projecting barbs.
At the Deshazo site, 96% of
the arrow points (n=123) are of the
Perdiz type, followed by Cuney
(2.4%) and Turney (1.6%) types.
(Girard 1995). However, the frequency of unstemmed triangular
points at the Henry M. site (61.6%)
is very different, as is the relative frequency of the Cuney type
(23.1%) as well as the near absence
of stemmed Perdiz points (7.7%).
These differences in the proportions of the main arrow point types
in Historic Caddo archaeological
contexts suggests either a wide diversity in the styles of arrow points
made and used by contemporaneous Allen phase Caddo groups,
orâmore likelyâthat these propor- Figure 35. Perdiz arrow point from the J. T. King site.
tional differences represent rapid
changes in arrow points over time, with the Henry M. site most likely younger in age than the Deshazo
settlement because of the much higher frequency of unstemmed triangular (i.e., âmissionâ style, cf. Hester 1989:220-221 and Figures 13-1 and 13-2) arrow points at Henry M.
There are three dart points from the J. T. King site in the 2010 collections (Table 21); another was
reported by Middlebrook (2008) from a surface collection. The range of dart points documented at the J.
T. King site indicates the likelihood that the site was periodically occupied during the Late Paleoindian
(ca. 10,400-9800 years B.P.), the Late Archaic (ca. 4000 years B.P.), and during the Woodland period (ca.

tools. This is considered unlikely because there is no persuasive evidence that these dart points have been
extensively reworked, other than the typical blade resharpening that was done when the dart points were
originally made and used.

The Dalton point, made and used between ca. 10,400-9800 years B.P. (Koldehoff and Walthall
2009; Ray et al. 2009), is complete, except for a small part on the tip and blade that was removed because of a 17.2 mm long impact fracture (Figure 36c). The lanceolate-shaped point has been bifacially
chipped, has a resharpened blade, and a concave base with evidence of basal grinding. There are single
flutes on both sides of the point, ranging from 6.9-17.1 mm in length. The point is made from a nonlocal white chert with iron oxide stains or flecks, and has a low luster. The raw material best resembles
various cherts from the western Ozarks, including Roubidoux and Warsaw cherts (cf. Ray 2007:81),
and southeastern Oklahoma (Banks 1990), but this has not been established through definitive provenance studies. Fluorescence analysis suggests, instead, that this white chert is a variety of Edwards
chert from Central Texas rather than the Ozarks (Tom Middlebrook, 2010 personal communication; see
also Shafer 2011:121).
The Late Archaic Bulverde point (see Figure 36b) has a parallel stem, a flat base, small rectangularshaped barbs, and a resharpened blade. It is made from a dark gray chert that likely originated in a Central Texas source area. The Gary point from Unit 14 is made from a local quartzite (see Figure 34a). It has
been bifacially chipped to shape, has a contracting stem, small rectangular-shaped barbs, and a resharpened blade. Blade thickness and stem width of this point (see Table 21) suggests it is probably a Gary,
var. Camden, a style of Woodland period point thought to have been made and used between ca. 17001200 years B.P. (Schambach 1982).

Ground Stone Tools

Ground stone tools (n=6) are well represented in
the Allen phase archaeological deposits at the J. T.
King site, just as they were at the contemporaneous
Henry M. site. This abundance indicates that the processing of food stuffs at that time was regularly done
with the gritty and coarse-grained ground stone tools,
not just with wood pestles and mortars or other softer
grinding and pulverizing tools, and that stones used as
a source of pigment were worked at the site.

a

The six ground stone tools include one and twosided manos (n=2) or hand grinding tools, mano or
grinding slab fragments (n=2), a grinding slab fragment
(n=1), and a pigment tablet (n=1). Specific attributes of
these classes of tools are provided in Table 22.
b

Approximately 83% of the ground stone tools are
made from a local ferruginous sandstone raw material. The
pigment tablet is made from a local hematite/limonite.

c

Lithic Debris
A total of 169 pieces of lithic debris and cores were
recovered from the J. T. King site during the shovel
testing and the hand excavations (see Tables 1 and 2).
The cores include a opposed platform core of local
petrified wood (Unit 14, 10-20 cm bs), and a gray chert
core fragment (Unit 16, 0-10 cm bs).

Local raw materials represented in the debris and cores include: petrified wood (n=58/36% cortical,
smoothed and roughened cortex surfaces); quartzite (n=4/25% cortical, smoothed cortex surface); brown
chert (n=4/50% cortical, smoothed cortical surface); red chert (n=2/0% cortical); and a reddish-brown
chert(n=1/0% cortical). Local lithic debris comprises 41% of the assemblage sample, and almost 35%
of the local pieces have cortical surfaces; the latter indicates that on site manufacture of chipped stone
tools took place at the J. T. King during the occupation. These local lithic debris have both smoothed and
roughened surfaces, suggesting that local stream gravel beds and bedrock formations (in the case of some
of the petrified wood lithic debris) were sources of local raw material for occasional tool manufacture.
Non-local raw materials in the lithics are well represented by cherts of various colors, some of which
are translucent or have a limestone-covered cortex, that suggest they are primarily from Central Texas
and Edwards Plateau sources or associated gravels in the Brazos, Navasota, Trinity, and Neches River
channel fills (see Girard 1995:66; Shafer 1973). The non-local lithic debris accounts for 59% of the assemblage sample. Only 6% of the non-local lithic debris have cortical surfaces (sometimes limestonecovered), which is more indicative of on-site resharpening and maintenance knapping of completed tools
or thinned bifacial implements rather than core reduction and tool manufacture on-site. These non-local
cherts are: light gray chert (11/0% cortical); gray chert (n=34/2.9% cortical, smoothed cortical surface);
banded gray chert (N=1/0% cortical); grayish-white chert (n=1/0% cortical); brownish-gray chert (15/0%
cortical); grayish-brown chert (n=3/66.7% cortical, smoothed cortex surface); dark gray chert (20/10%
cortical, smoothed limestone cortical surface); dark gray-blue chert (n=2/0% cortical); yellowish-gray
chert (n=1/0% cortical); white chert (n=2/0% cortical); white-red chert (n=1/100% cortical, smoothed
limestone cortex); whitish-gray chert (n=3/0% cortical); grayish-black chert (n=1/0% cortical); and black
chert (n=3/0% cortical). There also is a honey-colored or âbeeswaxâ (Miller 2008:27) chert (n=2/0% cortical) that may be from the same region.
As previously mentioned, the J. T. King chipped stone lithic debris is dominated by chert raw materials, much of it from non-local sources. The generally contemporaneous Deshazo site component is
strikingly different in the use and discard of raw materials by Allen phase knappers. There, 71.7% of the
lithic debris is petrified wood, followed by local cherts, quartzite, and non-local cherts (Table 23). Nonlocal cherts are 15 times more abundant at both the J. T. King and the Henry M. sites, and seven times
more abundant at the David King site, clearly indicating that the Caddo that lived at both these places
had ready access to Central Texas chert raw materials. It is suspected that the Caddo that lived at the J. T.
King and Henry M. sites either had trade partners that lived in the Central Texas and east central Texas
prairies from whom they obtained lithic raw materials and/or completed tools, or they had direct access to
those raw material sources and/or tool makers, probably by horse travel. The Caddo in East Texas already
had considerable numbers of horses by the mid-1680s (see Foster 1998).
Fire-cracked rock
Finally, there are three pieces of ferruginous sandstone fire-cracked rock in the lithic artifact assemblage (see Tables 1 and 2). The occurrence of fire-cracked rocks suggests that at least one hot rock cooking feature is present at the J. T. King site.

Standard zooarchaeological identification techniques were employed in this analysis, using comparative skeletal collections. Attributes that were examined for each of the bone fragments include taxon, element and portion of that element, and symmetry. This analysis is concerned with identifying the character
of Historic Caddo animal exploitation at this specific site in the East Texas Pineywoods.

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

75

Despite the high proportion of unidentifiable faunal remains, the taxonomic recovery from the J. T.
King site is nevertheless quite diverse, demonstrating the Caddoâs utilization of many of the rich animal
food resources available in the area. Aquatic species (fish and pond turtle) were easy to obtain as the site
is located near King Creek, a permanent flowing tributary to the Angelina River. The wooded edges that
would have been present provided habitat for the cottontail, turkey, and deer. The woodlands and bottomlands were hunted for the squirrel, swamp rabbit, and bear. The pocket gopher prefers the sandy soils.
Most of the animals identified in the J. T. King faunal assemblage suggest that most of the hunting was
carried out during the warmer months, when animal activity and their availability were high. However,
the bears were hunted primarily in the winter months because they were fat and when rendered, the fat
could be stored in pottery vessels for long periods of time (Newcomb 1993; Swanton 1942), or collected
in vessels for eventual trading.
White-tailed deer is undoubtedly the main meat source of the Caddo diet, as attested to by ethnographic accounts (Newcomb 1993; Swanton 1942) as well as zooarchaeological analyses of prehistoric
and historic Caddo sites in East Texas. At the Deshazo site, an Historic Caddo site on Bayou Loco in
Nacogdoches County, Texas, deer comprised 86% of the total meat yield represented by the faunal assemblage (Henderson 1982:Table 24). The approximate edible meat weight of a single deer is about 35
pounds (White 1953). It is possible that more than one individual is actually represented as MNI estimates are usually numerically conservative. The 336 unidentifiable large mammal fragments are small
pieces from larger bones and most of them are probably the remains of deer, but some could represent the
bear as well. The bear would have provided several useful items such as meat, grease from the fat, and
hides. Bears were one of the Caddoâs favored game animals (mainly for their fat), and dogs were often
used to rout them out (Newcomb 1993); bear grease was also traded by the Caddo to Europeans for goods
and foodstuffs. The drum also would have provided a nice meal. Based on the otolith measurements,
the individual recovered had a body length of 37.7 cm, with a body weight of 740 grams (Witt 1960). A
pocket gopher can weigh as much as 1 kg in live weight, and rodents often supplemented the diet (Yates
1999).
The faunal sample demonstrates that hunting activities played a clear role in the diet of the Caddo
peoples living at the J. T. King site, although animals were only âa subsidiary part of the food supplyâ
according to Newcomb (1993:293). Previous investigations at other Caddo sites in East Texas have identified similar resource utilization patterns in existence as early as ca. A.D. 1000, as well as a comparable
species composition of procured animals (see Yates 1999; Schniebs 2008, 2009; Walters 2008; Perttula
et al. 2010:Table 34). Environmental areas exploited by Caddo hunters included aquatic and riparian
habitats, forests, and open meadows with wooded edges. Further investigations at this site, as well as the
analysis of the faunal collections obtained during Middlebrookâs (2008, 2009) earlier work at J. T. King,
would certainly provide additional information on Historic Caddo subsistence preferences.
Macrobotanical Remains from J. T. King, An Early 18th Century Caddo Site,
by Leslie L. Bush
The J. T. King Site (41NA15) lies on a terrace overlooking King Creek, which drains into the Angelina River about 7 km to the southwest. The shortest route to the current channel of the Angelina
River is about 5.5 km due west along Highway 21. In this area, the highway approximates the route of
El Camino Real de los Tejas. The site was occupied by Caddo Indians in the early 18th century (Walker et al. 2009).

76

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas
Ecological Setting

East Texas is largely synonymous with the Pineywoods vegetative zone. The Pineywoods can be
divided into two general zones, one dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and one by shortleaf
pine (P. echinata) and hardwoods (Braun 1950; Diggs et al. 2006). Longleaf pine forests in Texas form
a rough half-circle centered on the easternmost point in Texas (northern Newton County) and reach into
southern Nacogdoches County. The remainder of the Texas Pineywoods, in which J. T. King is located, is
dominated by shortleaf pines and deciduous hardwoods. Pine forests in the United States are maintained
by fire, and fire suppression contributes to greater representation of hardwood species (Abrahamson and
Harnett 1990; Frost 1993). American longleaf pine forests, in the outer coastal plain, are associated with
large tracts of land lacking natural firebreaks, and they probably experienced fire every two or three years
(Frost 1993:21). Areas of shortleaf pine and hardwoods are those where natural barriers result in lower â
but still significant â fire frequency (Frost 1993:21).
Upland forests around J. T. King would have been mixed stands of shortleaf pine and dry-site oaks
and hickories with sparse understories. Occasionally pure hardwood stands are found in the Pineywoods, with oaks, hickories, elms, black gum, and black cherry being the common species (Diggs et al.
2006:89). In steep ravines and tributary streams protected from fire, hardwoods mixed with loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) rather than shortleaf pine (P. echinata). A list of species common in these communities is
given in Table 26. Larger streams in the Pineywoods would have also supported loblolly pine mixed with
moderately flood-tolerant hardwoods such as white oak (Quercus alba), water oak (Q. nigra), sweet gum
(Liquidambar styraciflua), beech (Fagus grandifolia), and magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) (Diggs et al.
2006:89-90). Joutel makes special note of a tree that was apparently sweet gum (Foster 1998:202). More
distant, downstream communities would have supported wetter species of oak as well as bald cypress
(Taxodium distichum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) and water elm (Planera aquatica) (Diggs et al.
2006:90).
Pollen studies indicate that the character of the modern vegetation zones described above is appropriate for understanding the plants and attendant animal resources available to occupants of the J. T. King
site during the late 17th to early 18th century A.D. Weakly Bog, situated in what is now the Post Oak
Savannah vegetation region to the west of Nacogdoches County, provides some of the best data for vegetation reconstruction in the eastern half of Texas during the last 3000 years. Pollen profiles from this bog
indicate that oak and later oak/hickory woodlands were the primary plant communities, suggesting that
modern plant communities generally provide good analogs for historical Texas plant communities during
the last 3000 years. Some fluctuations in rainfall and temperature have taken place (Bousman 1998:204),
but even decades-long fluctuations in rainfall patterns seem to be part of the natural background of Late
Holocene climate patterns in eastern Texas (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995). The years 1717 and 1718,
when the J. T. King site may have been occupied, are known drought years (Hatcher 1927:150).
Soil survey maps show several soil types in the general site area, but most are sandy loams of the
Nacogdoches-Trawick soil unit (Dolezel 1980), with loamy sands, loams, and fine sands making up the
rest (Soil Survey 2009).
Laboratory Methods
Samples from the J. T. King site were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification. Wood charcoal and grass stem fragments were snapped to reveal a transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial

sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of inter-vessel
pitting, and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
Larger floral remains such as wood charcoal, nutshell, and corn are not typically included in macrobotanical analysis when they are small enough to pass through a 2 mm mesh (Pearsall 2000). When present,
these small fragments were identified for this project, however. No corn fragments smaller than 2 mm
were recovered. Wood charcoal fragments smaller than 2 mm were present, but identification was only
attempted for those larger than 2 mm. The most common type of flora smaller than 2 mm was nutshell.
Fragments larger and smaller than 2 mm were treated separately. In general, the additional material added
substantially to numbers of fragments counted but added very little to the weights.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials
in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference works
(e.g., Core et al. 1979; Hoadley 1990; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Schopmeyer 1974). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2010).
Results
Sorting and identification of the J. T. King material resulted in the identification of 74 sub-lots. A
total of 763 items weighing 25.54 grams were identified, of which 715 items and 18.21 g were botanical.
Identifications, counts, and weights of material in the J. T. King samples are given by lot in Table 27. The
few non-botanical items identified are shown in Table 28.

Wood charcoal
One hundred twenty five wood charcoal fragments weighing 2.90 g were recovered in the twelve lots
from the J. T. King site. Identification was attempted for seventy-seven wood charcoal fragments weighing 2.65 g. Wood charcoal recovered from the J. T. King site is believed to represent fuel wood. Individual lots rarely contain only a single type of wood charcoal, as would be expected if burned posts were sampled. It is possible that some wood charcoal fragments may represent construction material, but historic
accounts of Caddo house construction do not mention fire-hardening or charring of structure posts, so this
is considered a less likely possibility (Hatcher 1927:154-156; Swanton 1996:148-154). As primarily fuel
wood, the material should reflect local vegetation (Asch and Asch 1986; Shackelton and Prins 1992).
Roughly 74% of the wood charcoal recovered from the site belongs to the three genera that dominate
the uplands: oak, hickory, and pine (Figure 37). Dogwood, an understory tree in East Texas sandy areas,
makes up another 8% of the wood charcoal. The remaining trees (elms, sweetgum, and magnolia) prefer
wetter ground, indicating they were collected from areas near streams. Among Caddo sites, the wood
charcoal from J. T. King compares best to that from 41HS588. Pine Tree Mound (41HS15), Henry M.
(41NA60), and even 41HS231 have far fewer mesic trees (Bush 2008; Perttula et al. 2010). It should be
noted that the wood assemblage from J. T. King is by far the smallest by quantity of the sites, however.
Nut resources
A total of 550 fragments of carbonized nutshell weighing 14.35 g were recovered from the site (Table
29). If fragments smaller than 2 mm are excluded, 444 fragments weighing 14.15 g were recovered. The
vast majority of the nutshell was thick-shelled hickory. One nutshell from Unit 15 (20-30 cm bs) was ap-

proximately 30% complete and was identifiable as either shagbark hickory or black hickory (Carya ovata
or C. texana). Black hickory is more likely, since it is the most common the hickory in the area. Other
nutshell consisted of black walnut and fragments that could be identified only as the hickory/walnut family. Acorn shell, thinner and more delicate than hickory nutshell, is not as easily preserved in the soil or
recovered by screening. Nonetheless, four fragments of acorn shell were recovered; only half of them
were larger than 2 mm.
The nut shell: wood ratio at J. T. King is somewhat high compared to those elsewhere in East Texas
(4.95, by weight). In the American Bottom in Illinois (see Johannessen 1984), low nut shell: wood ratios
act as a proxy indicator of reliance on agricultural products, as agricultural products replace wild food
plants and agricultural activities restrict time available for nut collection. There, nut shell: wood ratios decline from 2.5 to less than 0.5 from the Archaic through Mississippian period times (Johannessen 1984).
In East Texas, however, nut shell: wood ratios vary considerably and do not seem to provide meaningful assessments of agricultural activity at different sites across the region. It may be that nut shell: wood
ratios are best examined at a more local scale to understand changes in land use patterns. At both the
Broadway site (41SM273) and 41HS588, nut shell: wood ratios decline in relative terms through time
(Bush 2008; Dering 2004). Site 41HS588 shows a slight rebound in nut shell: wood ratios during the historic period. The relatively high nut shell: wood ratio at the J. T. King site may also reflect greater nut use
during the historic era. Alternatively, the nut shell: wood ratio at J. T. King may be more influenced by a
local abundance of nut resources or the season of deposition for the particular features and archaeological
deposits that were sampled in the 2010 excavations.
Corn
Corn was identified from two lots at the J. T. King site. Three corn kernel fragments were recovered
from Feature 14, and one cupule was recovered from the north cross-section of Feature 12-1.
Cane
Fifteen fragments of river cane stem weighing 0.20 g were recovered from three samples at J. T.
King, all in Unit 12. Three other fragments of large grass stems were also recovered in these samples,
but their reconstructed diameters were not large enough to confidently identify them as cane. One fragment had a measurable diameter of 1.8 mm. These specimens may represent small cane stem fragments,
but they may also represent grasses such as switch grass (Panicum virgatum) or giant cut grass (Zizaniopsis miliacea).

Summary
Macrobotanical remains recovered from the J. T. King site reflect the Caddo exploitation during the
late 17th-early 18th centuries of the local forests for fuel wood and nut resources, the cultivation of corn,
and the collection of cane or other grass stems probably for construction or craft projects. The sample is
small and biased toward larger remains, but it provides a starting point for further understanding of Historic Caddo plant use at the site.

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas
SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR FUTURE WORK AT THE J. T. KING SITE

Archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations in 2010, supplemented by earlier volunteer archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations in 2008, have shown that the J. T. King site (41NA15) is an early
18th century Caddo habitation site located directly on the northern route of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in western Nacogdoches County, Texas. The investigations have shown that the site may
have preserved evidence of at least 10 Caddo habitation/domestic structures, arranged around a small courtyard
or plaza, with outdoor activity area and areas where trash deposits accumulated set outside and behind the habitation structures and courtyard. Post hole and pit features are common in the archaeological deposits.
The 10 possible Caddo structures that have been detected in the initial archaeogeophysical investigations at the J. T. King site are round to sub-round in shape and range from 3.7 to 12.5 m in diameter. Seven
of them have anomalies situated in or close to their center that are interpreted as central hearths or large post
holes (i.e., center posts) inside domestic structures. None of the possible structures have complete geophysical signatures and it is not possible to make out an entranceway or easily discern the orientation of the structures. The courtyard area, or open space, is between two clusters of house structures. These open spaces or
court yards on several Caddo sites in the Neches and Angelina River basins often contain archaeological
features and show signs of community activity.
The archaeological deposits are well-preserved, containing an abundance of domestic ceramic wares,
including plain wares, utility wares, and fine wares, but the mainly grog-tempered ceramic assemblage as
a whole is dominated by brushed jars and Patton Engraved carinated bowls. Other identified types include
King Engraved and Hume Engraved in the fine wares and Spradley Brushed-Incised and Lindsey Grooved
utility wares. The closest ceramic comparisons between the J. T. King site and all the other known Nacogdoches County historic Caddo sites are with various sites along Bayou Loco, including 41NA21, 41NA22,
and 41NA23. The Bayou Loco and Angelina River sites are dominated by brushed utility wares. Differences
and similarities in the range and diversity in ceramic styles of utility ware and fine ware vessel sherds from
contemporaneous Historic Caddo sites seem to provide clear evidence of the intensity and extent of interaction and cultural transmission practices that may have been in effect at any of the sites n the region, but also
the character of local ceramic traditions. Furthermore, it is possible to also suggest that they represent different but clearly related social groups or communities of Caddo peoples living in the Angelina River basin
(e.g., Corbin 2007).
The 10 chipped stone tools recovered from the J. T. King site include four expedient flake tools or
scrapers with use wear, two Jowell knives, a Perdiz arrow point, and three dart points. The tools are made
of various cherts from non-local sources (70%), and quartzite (10%) and petrified wood (20%) from local
sources. The ground stone tools (n=6) include one and two-sided manos or hand grinding tools, mano or
grinding slab fragments, a grinding slab fragment, and a pigment tablet. The J. T. King chipped stone lithic
debris is dominated by chert raw materials, much of it from non-local sources. The Caddo that lived at the J.
T. King site had ready access to Central Texas chert raw materials. It is suspected that the Caddo that lived
there either had trade partners that lived in the Central Texas and east central Texas prairies from whom they
obtained lithic raw materials and/or completed tools, or they had direct access to those raw material sources
and/or tool makers, probably by horse travel. The Caddo in East Texas already had considerable numbers of
horses by the mid-1680s (see Foster 1998).
Plant and animal remains are well-preserved at the J. T. King site. Macrobotanical remains recovered
from the archaeological deposits and selected features at the site reflect the Caddo exploitation during the
late 17th-early 18th centuries of the local forests for fuel wood and nut resources (hickory, walnut, and

Investigations at a Historic Caddo Site Along El Camino Real De Los Tejas

85

acorn), the cultivation of corn, and the collection of cane or other grass stems probably for construction or
craft projects.
The animal remains are quite diverse, as the Caddo utilized many of the animal food resources available
in the area. This included fish and pond turtle, cottontail, turkey, and deer, as well as squirrel, swamp rabbit,
and bear. Most of the hunting was carried out during the warmer months, except for bears, who were hunted
primarily in the winter months because they were fat and when rendered, the fat could be stored in pottery
vessels for long periods of time, or collected in vessels for eventual trading.
The archaeological and archaeogeophysical investigations at the King site have expanded our limited
knowledge of the Historic Caddo cultural landscape as well as provided new insights into their community
organization as seen through the detailed examination of one site. This project has already provided much
needed data regarding both of these two points. As with any archaeological investigation, the findings of the
work almost invariably lead to the exploration of current and new research questions and problems that are
worth pursuing through additional investigations, and the J. T. King site work is no exception.
In the future at the J. T. King site, another round of archaeogeophysical survey is warranted to refine
the underlying magnetic character of the areas of the possible structures, the small courtyard, and individual
anomalies scattered around these major features. Renewed archaeogeophysical investigations at the site
could consist of the completion of a more intensive magnetometer survey over each of these areas of anomalies and possible features by altering the density of the dataset through narrowing the traverse interval and
the sample interval. Analysis of the magnetic data and identified anomalies in these areas could then lead to
the employment of multiple instrumentsâincluding electromagnetic induction meter (conductivity and susceptibility) and ground penetrating radarâto enhance the possibility that geophysical data can be collected
from discrete areas to better detect archaeological features and important buried archaeological deposits.
Geophysical data could be collected with additional sensors, including electromagnetic induction (EM) and
ground penetrating radar (GPR). An EM could be used over the entire site, guided by the RTK GPS, and
especially over key anomalies, such as possible structures and pits. These same areas could be targeted for
collection with GPR, also to be guided by the RTK GPS. GPR is unique in that it provides information regarding an objectâs or anomalyâs depth. Using multiple geophysical instruments at the J. T. King site in specific targeted areas would increase the potential to locate and define archaeological deposits by expanding
the range of physical properties of the sediments and archaeological deposits that were to be investigated.
Future archaeological investigations at the J. T. King site could be pursued in the context of obtaining more detailed and temporally-specific information about the occupational history and character of the
site, concentrating on particular areas or particular kinds of deposits (i.e., possible courtyard area, outdoor
activity areas and trash deposits, and features vs. habitation areas). That work might focus on each of the
areas within the site that have habitation deposits and associated magnetic anomalies suggestive of domestic
Caddo structures. To limit the disturbances to the archaeological deposits, a future round of archaeological
investigations could consist of (a) more closely-spaced shovel testing across each of the site areas of interest; and (b) if concentrated archaeological deposits and/or cultural features (or the possibility that cultural
features are present) are identified in any of these areas, particularly features that represent evidence of
domestic occupation, that a small set or small block of units are excavated there. The purpose of this work
would be to collect a representative sample of the associated material culture and ecofactual remains from
Historic Caddo habitation locales across the J. T. King site, as well as investigate a range of habitation features (post holes, pits, and hearths, as well as midden deposits) that may be present in each of the various
habitation areas. Both sets of data would provide the means to compare and contrast the uses of the various
habitation areas at the site, and to ascertain if the habitation areas are associated with strictly domestic use
by Caddo peoples and/or are also the result of use by the elites that may have lived at the site.
