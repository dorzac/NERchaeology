ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape of Houston, Texas have completed an intensive pedestrian
cultural resources survey and mechanical deep testing for the Southern Crushed Concrete,
LLC (SCC) proposed sandpit and plant facility on approximately 246.59 acres (99.79
hectares) and conducted surface inspection over 83.02 acres (33.59 hectares) of property
proposed for wetland mitigation in Montgomery County, Texas immediately west of the
San Jacinto River. The total area surveyed as part of the intensive pedestrian cultural
resources survey, mechanical deep testing, and surface inspection encompassed 329.61
acres (133.38 hectares), which defines the Archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE).
This cultural resources investigation was conducted as part of the United States Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) permit application process.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the proposed
development would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36
CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were
located within the project’s APE. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed
with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (NHPA) guidelines.
All work related to the project is being held entirely on private property and therefore did
not require the issuance of a Texas Antiquities Permit prior to undertaking fieldwork.
A total of 47 shovel tests were attempted, although only 43 were excavated, and
25 mechanical deep tests were excavated across the project area. No new or previously
identified cultural resources or historic structures were located within the project APE.
No further work is recommended within the proposed project area. HRA Gray & Pape
recommend cultural resources clearance and that this project be cleared to proceed as
planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Southern Crushed Concrete, LLC (SCC) proposes to excavate a sandpit and
construct a plant facility on approximately 246.59 acres (99.79 hectares) of property in
Montgomery County, Texas immediately west of the San Jacinto River. In addition,
shallow excavation for wetland mitigation on 83.02 acres (33.59 hectares) is proposed.
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) completed an intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey on the 246.59-acre (99.79-hectare) tract proposed for
the sand pit operation and plant facility location and conducted surface inspection over
the 83.02 acres (33.59 hectares) proposed for wetland mitigation. The total area surveyed
as part of the intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey and surface inspection
encompassed 329.61 acres (133.38 hectares) as part of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) permit application process.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if the proposed
development would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36
CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were
located within the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and
federal (NHPA) guidelines. All work related to the project is being held entirely on
private property and therefore did not require the issuance of a Texas Antiquities Permit
prior to undertaking fieldwork.
Fieldwork was conducted in three mobilizations encompassing a reconnaissance
of the project area, the intensive pedestrian survey and surface inspection, and
mechanical deep testing. All work was conducted between October and December 2006
and required approximately 152 person hours to complete.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The proposed project area is located immediately east of Interstate Highway (IH)
45 at the Farm to Market Road (FM) 1488 junction, west of the San Jacinto River. It is
found on the Tamina 7.5-minute United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic
quadrangle map in Montgomery County, Texas (Figure 1). The project will include the
excavation of a sandpit, the construction of a plant facility, and shallow excavation for
wetland mitigation. Subsurface disturbance associated with the excavation of the
proposed sandpit is expected to reach a maximum depth of approximately 14.7 meters
(47 feet) below the natural ground surface. The APE for this project is defined the
329.61 acres (133.38 hectares) of property proposed for some construction or alteration.
The property consists primarily of secondary shrub and scrub growth as well as several
dispersed wetlands.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

This section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological characteristics
found in Montgomery County. It is followed by a discussion of soil morphology in the
area.

GEOLOGY & GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain is part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The coastal plain
is characterized by a low topographic relief and extends from Florida to Mexico. The
Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far
west as the Balcones escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphological
characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas, which includes Harris
County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the combined action of sea
level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and
subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s
rivers. Montgomery County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and
unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001;
Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott
2001; Aronow 1992; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of longterm human occupation in modern-day Montgomery County include the Willis, Lissie
(also called Montgomery) and Beaumont formations, and younger Late Pleistocene to
early Holocene units such as the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, positioned
stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date to
between one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as
consisting “of up to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence
of)…large looping meander scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action
and discharge markedly greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these
deposits are relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the Montgomery
County area by alluvial or eolian factors.

SOILS
According to the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
United States Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA), the proposed project area
contains soils consisting primarily of Tuscumbia clay, frequently flooded; Kosse soils,
frequently flooded; Bruno loamy fine sand and; Lucy loamy fine sand.

4

Tuscumbia clay, frequently flooded is part of the Tuscumbia Series that consist of
nearly level, deep, poorly drained, clayey soils that developed on the floodplains of
streams. The A horizon ranges from 4-12 inches (10-30 centimeters) in thickness and is
very dark gray to gray in color. The Bg and Cg horizons range from 6 inches (15
centimeters) in depth to 63 inches (160 centimeters) in depth. These soil horizons range
in color from very dark gray to gray and contain dark reddish brown, yellowish red, dark
brown or dark yellowish brown mottles (SSS NRCS USDA).
The Kosse soils, frequently flooded belong to the Kosse Series which consists of
nearly level, deep, somewhat poorly drained, loamy soils that are also found on the
floodplains of streams. These soils have A, B, and Cg horizons. The A horizon ranges
from 10-20 inches (25-50 centimeters) in thickness and is very dark grayish brown to
very dark gray in color and is clay loam to fine sandy loam in texture. The B horizon
ranges from 7-26 inches (18-66 centimeters) in thickness and is clay loam to sandy clay
loam in texture. It has dark grayish brown, dark gray, or dark yellowish brown mottles.
This horizon is sometimes layered with fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand. The C
horizon is approximately 16 inches (41 centimeters) in thickness and is light gray to
grayish brown sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam that has dark yellowish brown,
yellowish red, or strong brown mottles (SSS NRCS USDA).
Bruno loamy fine sand is associated with the Bruno series, which consists of
nearly level, deep, excessively drained, sandy soils on natural levees, next to channels on
the floodplains of streams. These soils contain an A horizon and multiple C horizons.
The A horizon ranges from 7-22 inches (18-56 centimeters) in thickness and dark grayish
brown to brown in color. The C horizons range in thickness from 11-31 inches (28-79
centimeters) and are very pale brown to pale brown in color. Bruno loamy fine sand
often contains dark brown or dark yellowish brown mottles (SSS NRCS USDA).
Lucy loamy fine sand, part of the Lucy Series, consists of nearly level to gently
sloping, deep, well-drained sandy soils to a depth of 21-36 inches (53-91 centimeters).
These soils contain an A horizon, two B horizons, and a C horizon. The A horizon
ranges from 21-36 inches (53-91 centimeters) in thickness and is brown to light brown or
very pale brown in color. The B horizons generally range from 40-60 inches (101-152
centimeters) in thickness and are dark red to red in color. The C horizon is pink or pale
brown and contains thin layers of sandy loam or sandy clay that are red or yellowish red
in color (SSS NRCS USDA).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING

Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural
regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an
interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines,
both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological
record of this region as “Woodland.” This categorization is not meant to literally invoke
the exact cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east.
But as Aten (1984:74) states, “it loosely connotes activities by populations on a
geographic as well as a cultural periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.” Under this
framework the prehistoric archaeology of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of
diffused technology and local innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of southeast Texas is
distinctive enough to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The “Mossy
Grove” cultural tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared
by groups in this region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain,
sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic
through Early Historic periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined
the Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and
suggests that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and
Atakapa groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion
suggest a number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic
inland/coastal cycle of the Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San
Jacinto River basin, may suggest that archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area
are affiliated with this group. Alternately, these remains may be associated with the
Bidais who occupied territory immediately to the north of the Akokisa groups. At this
time, it is not possible to identify the cultural affiliation of the groups that inhabited the
inland subregion. In part, this is a function of the dynamic nature of this region in which
a number of cultural traditions met and diffused.
The southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and
artifact types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited
inland resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on
the coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS

Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six
archaeological time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in
general, these include the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late
subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian.
Archaeologists within the region agree on the general framework of cultural time periods,
while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of these periods. Patterson’s (1995)
chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian (10000-8000 B.C.), Late
Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (30001500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600),
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic
Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) Periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8,000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8,000-5,000
B.C.), Middle Archaic (5,000-1,000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1,000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early
Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these
differences, the chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in
projectile point technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is
generally recognized that a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was used
throughout all time periods.

Paleoindian Period
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation; much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from around the state
of Texas and across North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters
crossed the Bearing Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America
(Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands
(Culberson 1993) and were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein
derived from mammoths, mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried
with them an easily recognizable stone tool material culture, though admittedly, little is
known about their wooden or bone tools or their clothing types. Diagnostic points such
as fluted Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview points can be used to identify the Paleoindian
component of a site, and the nature of these points demonstrate the nature of the hunting
style. The above points are large and designed to be attached to a spear. No evidence of
bow and arrow hunting has been found associated with this period (Culberson 1993;
Newcomb 1961).

7

Archaic Period
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna, upon
which the Paleoindian peoples depended, gradually became extinct. This shift in food
supply is seen as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods
(Culberson 1993; Biesaart et al. 1985; Newcomb 1961). Culberson (1993) places the
beginning of the Early Archaic at 8000 B.C. Aten (1984) states that the transition from
Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100. There are three
progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: Early, Middle, and Late.
Currently, research indicates that Early Archaic peoples were small, isolated
bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984).
With the loss of the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the
hunting of smaller game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging
(Culberson 1993). The material record fits the transitional makeup of this period because
there was a dramatic shift from the large spear points of the Paleoindian period to a
reliance on smaller “Dart” type points. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San
Patrice, Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde,
Martindale, Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are
relatively crudely made compared with the Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use
on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the
number of stone tools used. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant
foodstuffs (Culberson 1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation
and procurement. Gravers, scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone
tools, also known as ground stone tools, began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb
1961). Diagnostic points such as Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere,
Pedernales, Marshall, Williams, and Lange predominate the spectrum of dart points from
the Middle Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect
[Newcomb 1961]). The advent of the atlatl also seems to be placed within this period
(Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of
Native American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna
intensified, as did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984).
Late Archaic peoples began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and
hunting small game such as deer, rabbits, raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and
birds. Groups became socially more complex than earlier periods and the result was an
increasing intercommunication with neighboring groups. Culberson (1993: 55) states
that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in which stone artifacts were made from exotic
materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate, etc.) acquired from sources great
distances away. These materials were fashioned into an increasingly complex array of
household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones, mortars and pestles, and
pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the occurrence of sandstone bowls
(Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are difficult to distinguish from those
8

of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain prevalent in southeast Texas, while
other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel, Mahomet, Fairland, and Castroville
also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).

Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Periods
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. Turner and Hester
(1993) see the first signs of village sites in the lower Pecos valley as well as the
preliminary stages of Caddo development in the east. The advent of the bow and arrow is
believed by most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961; Turner and Hester 1993)
to be from this period, though some place it later. Most importantly for archaeological
investigations, the first evidence of pottery began to emerge at sites from this period.
Although the amount and variety of pottery intensified during the Late Prehistoric,
pottery is an excellent way of determining the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing,
bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora intensifies beyond the level of the Late
Archaic period during this stage, but there is no sufficient data to demonstrate the initial
advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic points of this period are Catahoula,
Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue
from the end of the Archaic period to the historic period brought in by the Spanish
Missions and Anglo-American settlers. During this period there is a shift to a near total
use of arrow points such as Perdiz and Scallorn (Turner and Hester 1993), and the
majority of groups had pottery. According to Aten (1984), approximately 18 different
types of pottery from this period are currently identified for the east Texas Coast based
on temper, paste, and design. It is during this period that peoples known today as the
Caddo, Atakapan, and Bidai, are identifiable both culturally and materially. This is
mostly due to the historical sources of the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries
that aid in the reconstruction of the past cultures in the area.
In order to better understand the complexity of the region’s cultures, researchers
turn to historical sources for an understanding of the peoples who first occupied the
southeast Texas. Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region
during his expedition in 1542; it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples.
The first expeditions by La Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth
century by Europeans continued to document the presence of Native American groups in
the area (Aten 1984). French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai,
also known as the Neches Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the
western Apache tribes (Newcomb 1961).
The loose cultural group, known as the Atakapan, dominated Montgomery
County. Their language group extended from the Gulf coast to the Trinity and San
Jacinto Rivers, and they had much in common with the coastal group known as the
Karankawa (Aten 1984). The Atakapan group was subdivided into regional subgroups.
The Akokisa dwelled primarily on the shores of the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers. The
9

Patiri group occupied the land north of the San Jacinto valley. The Bidai group
dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the small group known as the
Deadoso. Most of what is known about the Atakapan culture comes from the early
accounts of the French explorer DeBellise.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the
Native American groups as pawns in the two nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb
1961). Most destructive for all native groups in the region was the influx of European
diseases. When Euro-American settlers began moving into the area in mass around the
1850s, disease and warfare decimated the groups to near extinction.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
It is believed that the first European to enter the Montgomery County area was the
French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, in approximately 1687 (Long
1999). This expedition forced the Spanish overlords of the region to mount retaliatory
expeditions to the region to reclaim the land. Though the Spanish did manage to
establish three missions along Spring Creek, which is within the boundaries of
Montgomery County, they did not establish permanent settlements. The missions were
abandoned in approximately 1756 and only sporadic settlement occurred until the
issuance of land grants by the Spanish and Mexican authorities to Stephen F. Austin.
Euroamerican settlers began to inhabit the area and nearly 42 families obtained legal land
titles from the government in the 1800s. One important early settler to the area was
Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post at the Loma del Toro crossroads.
This trading post soon grew into the town of Montgomery, which became the county seat
in 1837.
Montgomery County was created by the Texas Legislature in 1837 and was
named after the largest city in the area. It was the third county established by the
Republic of Texas. The original boundaries of the county extended from the Trinity
River on the east, to the Brazos River on the west, the Old San Antonio Road to the
north, and the San Jacinto River to the south. Today, Montgomery County is bounded by
Walker and San Jacinto Counties to the north, Harris County to the south, Waller and
Grimes Counties to the west, and Liberty County to the east.
Situated at the juncture of the East Texas Timberlands/Piney Woods region and
the Texas Coastal Plain, the nineteenth century landscape consisted of dense forests
situated on exceptionally fertile soil. This attracted many settlers who immediately began
to clear the land in order to exploit it for agricultural production and cattle grazing.
Ranching and basic subsistence farming were the region’s primary agricultural enterprise
until the 1850s when cotton production occurred in large volume. The cotton industry,
driven by slave labor and the plantation economy system, experienced a great boom prior
to the Civil War, partially by exploiting overland trade opportunities with Houston and
Galveston.

10

It was not until the post-war era that the region faced its first economic downturn.
Without the wartime demand for agricultural goods and the loss of slave labor, planters
who had overextended themselves to meet the increased demand for cotton found
themselves without a market and in possession of lands with depleted soils. Recovery for
the county did not occur until the construction of several railroad lines in the 1870s. The
International-Great Northern Railroad built a line across Montgomery County, and the
Houston and Texas Central built a railroad line through Navasota and Montgomery
Counties. These lines missed the City of Montgomery, which was at that time the county
seat, although they intersected at the small community of Conroe. In a similar fashion,
the Gulf, Santa Fe, and Colorado railroad lines also intersected in Conroe. Shortly
thereafter, in 1889, the county seat was moved to the City of Conroe were it remains.
With the construction of the railroads throughout Montgomery County, the region
experienced development of the lumber industry. Long (1999) states that roughly 45
steam-powered sawmills were in operation throughout the county in 1882. In 1914, the
Delta Land and Timber Company built the South’s largest timber mill near Conroe. The
timber industry remained the largest revenue source for the county until the 1920s when
there was a steep decline in the amount of available timber within the region due to
uncontrolled logging. In the 1870s, the county had 80 % forest coverage, but the county
was deforested over the next 4 decades (Long 1999).
The deforestation of Montgomery County opened the land to an increase in
ranching and farming. Despite a brief resurgence in cotton production, by the 1910s,
many farmers had began growing fruits and vegetables in order to meet the demands of
the nearby coastal cities of Houston and Galveston. The region experienced another
downturn during the Great Depression. This downturn continued until the post-World
War II period. Though the regional farmers did not benefit, the county prospered in the
1930s due to the discovery of oil near Conroe in 1932. The discovery of oil brought
unimaginable wealth to the region as well as a massive population increase. With oil
fields discovered throughout Montgomery County, it soon became one of the richest oil
producing regions in the United States. To date, oil remains the primary source of
income for the county, while the majority of agricultural income comes from livestock.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Site file research indicated that two previously recorded archaeological sites
(41MQ183 and 41MQ184) are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current
project area, although several sites (41MQ1, 41MQ55, and 41MQ124) are located just
outside of this study radius.
Site 41MQ183 was recorded by HRA Gray & Pape in 2003 during a cultural
resources survey (Baird et al. 2003). The site is located southwest of the current project
area. The site was composed of a single dart point preform recovered 30 centimeters
below the ground surface and a single lithic flake recorded 100 centimeters below the
ground surface. No additional cultural materials were recorded in association with this
site. Site 41MQ184 was recorded during the same survey and was composed of a single
sherd of historic white earthenware (Baird et al. 2003). Survey efforts indicated that no
additional historic or prehistoric material was observed at the site. Both sites were
considered ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Several archeological investigations, primarily survey efforts, have been
conducted near the project area in response to flood control related projects and other
public works projects. The online Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, maintained by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) provided only limited data regarding each of these
surveys. It is unclear which agencies were responsible for these surveys and whether or
not they resulted in the identification of any new cultural resources. The earliest
archaeological area survey conducted was completed in 1980 on behalf of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development south of the current project area. In
1986, a linear survey was conducted at the behest of the Galveston Corps of Engineers. It
does not appear that the survey resulted in the identification of any new archaeological
sites. In 1990, a survey was conducted southeast of the current project area for a project
involving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It does not appear that any new
sites were recorded as a result of this investigation. In 1992, a survey was conducted for
a project involving the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) along the west side of
IH 45. The Archaeological Sites Atlas did not indicate that any new cultural resources
were located during this survey. No additional information or report references were
available for the above-referenced surveys on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas.
In 2003, HRA Gray & Pape conducted a survey of 6.87 hectares (17 acres) west
of IH-45 southwest of the current project area (Baird et al. 2003). As discussed above,
the survey resulted in the identification of two new archaeological sites (41MQ183 and
41MQ184) within 1.6 kilometers (one mile) of the project area. These sites were not
shown on the map available on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, but were
documented on the available survey abstract and in the final report.

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Prior to fieldwork mobilization site file research and a review of the literature
surrounding the project area were conducted. Based on this information, the intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey was designed to identify and assess whether any
cultural resources may be impacted by the proposed project.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Site file research was performed in order to
identify all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1-mile) of the
project areas, and all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing located adjacent
to the project APE. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to the
archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to
provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area,
and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history
of the area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Montgomery
County’s prehistory and history.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN FIELD METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and
historic, within the defined project boundaries. Archaeological methods employed during
this survey consisted of a controlled walkover and surface inspection in the area proposed
for wetland mitigation, pedestrian survey augmented by systematic shovel testing and
mechanical deep testing in the areas proposed for the plant facility and excavation of
sand.

Project Study Areas A, B, C, D, E, and F
The project area was then divided into six discrete study areas (A, B, C, D, E, and
F) on a 30-meter (100-foot) grid based on cleared paths visible on aerial maps (Figure 2).
Using the grid, Study Area A was divided into eight west-east transects spaced 30 meters
(100 feet apart) with shovel tests to be excavated along the odd-numbered transects at 90meter (295-foot) intervals while surface inspection was to be conducted along the evennumbered transects. Study Areas B, C, D, and E were each assigned a discrete set of
north-south transects, with shovel testing to be conducted along the odd-numbered
transects and pedestrian survey to be conducted along the even-numbered transects.

Study Area F is proposed as the wetland mitigation area, and survey in this area was
limited to a controlled walkover and surface inspection.

Shovel Testing Methodology
At the onset of shovel testing in Study Areas B and C, it was discovered that the
vegetation was too dense to efficiently navigate through on the pre-assigned transects.
Instead, shovel tests in Study Area B were placed along a previously cleared two-track
path and were spaced approximately 60 meters (197 feet) apart in a west to east pattern
from the western boundary of the project area to the eastern boundary of the project area
close to the river. Shovel testing was attempted along the eastern boundary of Study
Areas B and E closest to the San Jacinto River and in Study Area D although dense
vegetation prohibited access without the use of a brush hog. Although, 47 shovel tests
were attempted, only 43 shovel tests were excavated Study Areas A, B and C.
Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) in diameter and
were excavated to an average depth of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) into dense, wet clay.
Removed soils were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth where possible and hand
sorted when screening was not practical. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed
standard terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional information
concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each
shovel test excavation (Appendix A). Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing
standing water, or in areas of excessive slope (greater than 20 percent).
Due to the nature of shovel testing in thick, wet clay soils, and because of the
geomorphological character of the project area situated primarily on an deep alluvial
floodplain deposits of the San Jacinto River, shovel testing was stopped after an
evaluation of the data. Based on some potential for the soils along the river to contain
deeply buried sites within the lower clay horizons, it was decided that mechanical deep
testing across the project area was should be the focus of the investigation. Deep testing
was conducted by mechanical trenching with a backhoe equipped with a 1.10-meter
(3.60-foot) wide smooth-edged bucket.

Deep Testing Methodology
The number, location, and orientation of backhoe trenches (BHTs) was determined
by the size project area, proximity to the San Jacinto River, and to study whether paleosols
may be present. A total of 25 BHTs were excavated across the project area. The BHTs
were designed for human entry, and applicable standards adopted by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Texas Health and Safety Code were
observed. Every BHT that was excavated to a depth exceeding 120 centimeters (47.24
inches) was evaluated by a Competent Person and classified as an OSHA Class A, B or C
trench. This was done to determine if BHTs could be safely entered for inspection. Each of
the 25 BHTs was classified as either an OSHA Class B or Class C trench, deemed unsafe to
enter.
15

Deep testing was focused in close proximity to the San Jacinto River in Study Areas
B, E, and D. However, BHTs were placed across all study areas with the exception of Study
Area A, which did not require mechanical deep testing based on the results of the shovel test
data. All BHTs were approximately 10 meters (32.80 feet) in length and approximately
1.10 meters (3.60 feet) wide. The BHTs were excavated to a minimum depth of 150
centimeters (59.05 inches) and to a maximum of 350 centimeters (137.79 inches) below the
ground surface.
Samples of clayey trench backfill were hand sifted and samples of alluvial deposits
were screened using ¼-inch hardware cloth. Due to the unsafe condition of each BHT
characterized by deep unstable alluvial sand covered by dense clay soils, none were entered.
After each 20-centimeter (7.87-inch) bucket-full of soil was removed, the walls and floors of
the BHTs were monitored from a safe distance on the ground surface for changes in soil
color or texture potentially related to the presence of cultural features. One wall of each
BHT was profiled and photographed.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN INVESTIGATIONS

This section provides a discussion of the results of the surface inspection
conducted within Study Area F and the results of shovel testing and mechanical deep
testing conducted within project Study Areas A, B, C, D, and E. No new cultural
resources or historic structures were identified within the project area during the intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey.

RESULTS OF SURFACE INSPECTION
A controlled pedestrian survey and surface inspection was conducted across Study
Area F, which is proposed for wetland mitigation (Figure 3). Study Area F encompassed
83.02 acres (33.59 hectares). Study Area F consisted of dense secondary growth
primarily made up of young hardwood saplings spaced closely together with thick briar
and bramble bushes on the ground surface with interspersed some palmetto plants.
Overall, 13 transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart were visually inspected from west
to east terminating approximately 15.24 meters (50 feet) west of the San Jacinto River.
Several large wetland areas were observed scattered across the central portion of the
study area. The surface survey across Study Area F did not result in the identification of
any cultural resources or historic structures.

RESULTS OF SHOVEL TESTING
Shovel testing within the project area consisted of the excavation of 43 shovel
tests, although 47 were attempted (Figure 3). Study Area A consisted of tall hardwood
trees and numerous palmettos and other short bushes and grasses as well as several large
wetland areas. The majority of the area appears to be frequently inundated as evidenced
by the high frequency of palmetto plants that are generally associated with wetlands. A
total of 20 shovel tests were attempted in Study Area A, although three of these were not
excavated due to the presence of standing water and noted disturbances including push
piles of soil and piles of decaying vegetation (Figure 3; Appendix A). Shovel tests in
Study Area A ranged from brown (10YR5/3) sand to reddish brown (10YR4/4) sandy
clay (Appendix A). Shovel tests in this study area were excavated to a minimum of 30
centimeters (11.81 inches) below the surface in instances of thick sandy clay to a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters (39.37 inches) below the surface in fine sand. No
new archaeological sites or historic structures were recorded in Study Area A.
A total of 17 shovel tests were attempted in Study Area B although only 16 were
excavated due to the presence of standing water at one location (Figure 3; Appendix A).
Shovel tests were placed adjacent to an existing west-east oriented two-track path due to
the very thick vegetation that prohibited walking along the pre-determined transects
across the study area. Soils excavated in shovel tests within Study Area B were

homogenous and ranged from very dark gray (10YR3/1) loamy clay to clay (Appendix
A). Shovel tests in this study area were excavated to a minimum of 10 centimeters (3.93
inches) below the surface in instances of very moist clay to a maximum depth of 50
centimeters (19.68 inches) below the surface in loamy clay to clay. No new
archaeological sites or historic structures were recorded in Study Area B.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated in Study Area C (Figure 3; Appendix
A). Shovel tests were placed immediately south of an existing west-east oriented twotrack path and in a north-south pattern along paths cut by a brush hog that was monitored
by an archaeologist. Soils excavated in shovel tests within Study Area C were also
homogenous and ranged from dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay to very dark gray
(10YR3/1) clay (Appendix A). Shovel tests in this study area were excavated to a depth
of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) below the surface due to the presence of blocky and very
sticky sandy clay and clay that prohibited deeper excavation. No new archaeological
sites or historic structures were recorded in Study Area C.
Based on the results of the results of shovel tests excavated within Study areas B
and C, it was determined that shovel testing in Study Areas D and E would not be
productive. It was determined that mechanical deep testing would be more efficient and
would produce more data regarding the geomorphological history of the project area.
RESULTS OF DEEP TESTING
Deep testing consisted of the excavation of 25 BHTs in Study Areas B, C, D, and
E (see Figure 3). Prior to clearing vegetation, the location of each BHT was covered with
dense secondary forest and thick understory vegetation. Clearing of vegetation was
conducted using the wide flat face of a bulldozer just above the ground surface. An
archaeologist monitored the clearing process, and the surfaces of cleared areas leading
trenching sites were inspected for artifacts using close interval pedestrian survey
methods. No cultural materials were detected in surface disturbances caused by the
bulldozer or the backhoe.
On average, the BHT profiles contained five soil strata, with the upper four layers
composed of dark gray sandy clay to clay followed by dark gray coarse sand mottled with
yellowish brown sand and gravels (see Appendix B for the range of Munsell [2000]
colors and soil textures). BHTs 2, 3, 4, and 5 located in Study Area D were the most
unstable of all the BHTs, due to a very thin layer of Tuscumbia Clay soil that recently
formed over shallow, very wet, sandy alluvium in an area with very low-lying
topography. Based on this data, no additional BHTs were excavated in Study Area D.
All 25 BHTs were negative for cultural resources. None of the BHTs suggested
that a paleosol had been covered by sandy alluvium, although BHTs 24 and 25 did
indicate that these locations had been subjected to recent heavy flooding as indicated by
the presence sandy alluvium on top of the clay soil. Representative descriptions of the
BHT profiles (BHTs 1, 7, 9, 14, 15, 18, and 24) are provided in Figures 4-10 below. A
table of all BHT profile descriptions is provided in Appendix B.

CHAPTER VIII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources
management survey, surface inspection, and deep testing conducted on approximately
encompassed 329.61 acres (133.38 hectares) of property proposed for a sandpit mining
operation in Montgomery County, Texas. Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background
literature and site file search was conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near
the project area. The search indicated that two previously recorded archaeological sites
are located within 1.6-kilometers (1 mile) of the current project area. No previously
recorded cultural resources were identified in or adjacent to the project area.
When attempting to identify intact cultural deposits, researchers working on
prehistoric sites in this region are faced with a difficult problem. Namely, cleanly
stratified archaeological deposits are seldom encountered in much of Montgomery
County, Texas. The site formation processes that contribute to this situation are worthy
of independent study, but in general when environmental conditions such as the slow
development of sandy soils interspersed with episodes of severe flooding and lateral
stream movement are combined with human activities such as historic land modification
and modern urbanization, it is no wonder that relatively few well defined cultural
deposits have been identified and studied in this area. These factors have complicated
the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing chronologies
associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations.
Field investigation within the project area consisted of a combination of walkover,
shovel testing, and deep testing. Subsurface tests included excavation of 43 shovel tests
within the project area, although 47 shovel tests were attempted. Shovel testing was
supplemented by deep testing. The deep tests included the excavation of 25 trenches
with focus in close proximity to the San Jacinto River.
Prehistoric or historic archaeological materials were not encountered during
walkover of the project area or during shovel test excavation and deep testing. No
evidence of cultural features was observed in any of the soil profiles examined in shovel
test profiles or trench walls.
During this investigation, cultural remains or features were not located within the
project area. Soils data collected during survey indicates that paleosols are not located
within the parcel and that young Tuscumbia Clay soils eventually developed on top of
sandy gravel-laden alluvium. The relatively young formation of these clayey soils
coupled with the low-lying topography of the area, suggest that the project area was
topographically lower than today, and likely unsuitable for long-term human habitation.
