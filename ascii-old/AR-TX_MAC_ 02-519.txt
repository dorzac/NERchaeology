ABSTRACT
On October 11 and November 2, 2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an approximately 720 ft (ca. 219 m) of shoreline along
Robinson Bayou in Galveston County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to
prepare management recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations
were conducted for Corinthian Development, under Texas Historical Commission Section 106
guidelines, in anticipation of the submission of a permit application to the U.S. Corps of
Engineers (COE), Galveston District. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project APE was
conducted, and included both surface and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 31
shovel tests were excavated.
The survey determined that significant portions of the project area have been disturbed, most
likely during pond construction, and by the land’s previous use for agriculture. The northeastern
half of the tract (north and east of the pond) consists of an inundated, marshy area that could not
be shovel tested. In the southern portion of the tract, a small prehistoric site, 41GV161, was
identified along the upland edge. Recovered cultural materials indicate the site contains a low
density of artifacts, and a limited range of artifact diversity. The shallow nature of the deposits
and the limited density and diversity of artifacts suggests that the site fails to meet the criteria for
site significance, and does not rate inclusion in the National Register. Consequently, no further
work is recommended for site 41GV161. At the completion of the project, the recovered artifacts
will be curated at TARL.
In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered in other areas during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
The project area is depicted on the
League City, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). It consists of an
approximately 720 ft by 300 ft (ca. 5 acres)
of shoreline along Robinson Bayou
immediately northeast of League City,
Texas. The project is in preparation for
streambank modifications and dredging.
The dredging will only occur in an area and
to a depth previously dredged in the past.

On October 11 and November 2,
2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately 720 ft (ca.
219 m) of shoreline along Robinson Bayou
in Galveston County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and
identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0780) were conducted for Corinthian
Development, under Texas Historical
Commission Section 106 guidelines, in
anticipation of the submission of a permit
application to the U.S. Corps of Engineers
(COE), Galveston District.
Prior to
fieldwork,
consultation
with
COE
determined that a standard pedestrian survey
with shovel testing would be needed along
the narrow zone of the bayou bank (APE),
and should include deep trenching if
Pleistocene soils were unreachable.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project APE was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figures 2, 5, 6;
see Appendix 1 for details). A total of 31
shovel tests were excavated. The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Brian Vagi. Roger Moore served
as the project’s principal investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
Galveston County is located within
the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

271 frost-free days per year. Snow, sleet,
and freezing rain are uncommon.

The Project Area is depicted on
sheet 2 of the Soil Survey of Galveston
County, Texas (Crenwelge et al. 1988). The
single soil type within the project area is
identified as Verland silty clay loam (Ve).
All three soil types are described as
somewhat poorly drained with very slow
runoff (Crenwelge et al. 1988:47). Abbott
(2004) identifies Verland soils as upland
loamy ancient (pre-Holocene) alluvium with
a low potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites.

Flora and Fauna
Galveston County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

Rainfall varies from 7 centimeters in March
to 11 centimeters in December, with July to
December rainfall often supplemented by
tropical fronts and storms. The rainfall
records are 45 centimeters in 1917 and 185
centimeters in 1917. Prevailing winds are
usually from the southeast, except during the
winter months when ‘Northers’ sweep into
the area.
Hydrology
The project area is located on the
east
bank
of
Robinson
Bayou,
approximately 2000 ft (ca. 610 m) south of
its confluence with Clear Creek. A large,
unnamed artificial canal marks the northern
boundary of the property. In addition, a
large artificial pond is located in the project
area.

Climate
The modern climate of the project
area can aptly be characterized as hot and
wet for most of the year. The mean annual
temperature for the region is about 20
degrees Centigrade, with mean rainfall of
117 centimeters.
Summer temperatures
average about 34 degrees Centigrade, with
temperatures above 100 degrees common
during July and August (Carr 1967). The
average winter temperature is a mild 18
degrees Centigrade. Freezes are infrequent
and of short duration, with an average of

may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant

faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy

1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
76 prehistoric and two historic sites were
identified.
They noted a bimodal
distribution of sites (McGuff and Cox
1973:2, Figure 1), with concentrations
located in the lower reaches of the creek
near Clear Lake (between miles 2-5), and in
the upper reaches (between miles 23-28).
This latter group of sites was located on
terraces alongside an incised meander, and
consisted of 41 pimple mound sites and four
terrace sites (McGuff and Cox 1973:18-19).
They reported that no sites were located
west of this concentration, though they
attributed
this
lack
to
previous
channelization. A similar lack of occupation
for the upper portion of Clear Creek has
been reported by Howard et al. (1992). They
identified three types of sites (shell middens,
terrace sites, natural mound sites) that
corresponded
to
topographic
and
environmental zones mapped along the
creek. Based on their geomorphological
assessment of the Clear Creek waterway,
there is an implication that the lack of sites
in the upper reaches is due more to the
relatively steep nature of the stream profile,
and the resultant increased surface erosion
(Howard et al. 1992:4.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in, or within the immediate
vicinity (½ km) of, the project area.
The earliest work in the Clear Creek area
was conducted by avocational archeologists
during the 1950s (from Howard et al. 1992).
During the late 1960s, a professional survey
was conducted by the Texas Archaeological
Salvage Project (Corbin and Hester 1968).
The survey, which was limited to the lower
portion of the stream, located 10 sites in
Galveston County. Beginning in the early
1970s, a series of efforts by the Houston
Archeological Society examined a number
of locations in the region around Clear
Creek, and included both survey and
excavations at a number of sites (Aten et al.
1976; Chaffin-Lohse 1978; Hole 1974).

During the mid-1980s, another
extensive survey was conducted on lower
Clear Creek and the shores of Clear Lake by
Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (MercadoAllinger et al. 1984).
The survey
investigated a total of 30 prehistoric and five
historic sites, including several located
within the current project area. In 1986,
testing excavations were conducted at two of
the prehistoric sites, 41GV10 and 41GV53
(Howard et al. 1991.

An extensive survey of the creek
was conducted by the Texas Archaeological
Survey (McGuff and Cox 1973) in
preparation for massive flood control project
that would enlarge and rectify most of the
streamcourse. The project examined almost
the entire length of the creek, covering from
just west of the Fort Bend/Brazoria County
line, all the way to Galveston Bay. A total of

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
able to reach mottled clay strata that
appeared to be pre-cultural subsoil.

The fieldwork was conducted on
October 11 and November 2, 2007, and
consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey that
included systematic shovel testing and
visual examination for surface exposure of
cultural materials.

The initial 13 shovel tests (STs 113) were conducted as part of the pedestrian
survey. Most of these tests were placed at 50
m intervals along the shoreline and into the
less disturbed areas south and east of the
pond. After potential historic materials
(glass, whiteware, wire nail) was recovered
from ST 2, additional tests were excavated
and a small prehistoric site was identified.
Designated as 41GV161, a total of 18
additional shovel tests (STs 1-1 to 1-18)
were excavated in order to delineate and
assess the site. No historic artifacts were
recovered from any of the additional tests,
and the materials recovered from ST 2 were
determined to be modern refuse after closer
inspection during laboratory analysis.
Additional modern utilities (pipeline) and
refuse identified on the ground surface and
in STs 1, 1-5, and 1-13, indicate significant
portions of the site have been disturbed by
previous
construction
and
dumping
activities.

The project area is depicted on the
League City, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1).
It is an
approximately 5 acre area comprised of 720
ft (ca. 219 m) of shoreline along Robinson
Bayou immediately northeast of League
City, Texas. Where possible, the survey
coverage extended approximately 300 ft (ca.
91 m) east of the bayou, well into the low,
adjoining uplands. The property is bounded
on the north by an unnamed artificial canal,
and on the south by a residential
development. A large artificial pond is
located in the northern half of the project
area (Figures 2, 3). The pond is most likely
associated with the previous agricultural use
of the area. A review of curated USGS
maps (1943, 1949, 1955, 1982) determined
that both the canal and the pond post-date
the 1955 map, but had been constructed by
1982. The project is in preparation for
streambank modifications and dredging.
The dredging will only occur in an area and
to a depth previously dredged in the past.

Site 41GV161
This newly recorded site is located
at the edge of the upland slope, and
measures approximately 60 m northwestsoutheast by 30 m north-south (Figure 6).
The shovel tests determined that the soils in
this portion of the project area are composed
of a thin layer of sandy loam (ca. 40 cm
thick) overlying the mottled clay subsoil.

The majority of the project area was
densely
wooded
and
with
heavy
undergrowth that provided less than 10
percent ground surface visibility (Figure 4).
Vegetation included various hardwoods,
yaupon, briar, and fan palms. A low marshy
area was present on the east side of the
pond, beginning near its northern end and
extending north to the artificial canal.

The site was identified by three
positive shovel tests, STs 1-2, 1-11, 1-15.
These three tests recovered a total of five
pieces of chert debitage. The artifacts were
distributed between 10-40 cmbs (Levels 24).

A total of 31 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through ¼” mesh (Figure 5;
Appendix 1). Each of the project’s shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. Most of the shovel tests were

In summary, 41GV161 represents a
small prehistoric site located at the upland
edge along Robinson Bayou. The upland
soils of the site are thin sandy loams atop
clay subsoil, and the recovered artifacts

of artifacts and a limited range of artifact

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
been disturbed, most likely during pond
construction, and by the land’s previous use
for agriculture. The northeastern half of the
tract (north and east of the pond) consists of
an inundated, marshy area that could not be
shovel tested. In the southern portion of the
tract, a small prehistoric site, 41GV161, was
identified along the upland edge. Recovered
cultural materials indicate the site contains a
low density of artifacts, and a limited range
of artifact diversity. The shallow nature of
the deposits and the limited density and
diversity of artifacts suggests that the site
fails to meet the criteria for site significance,
and does not rate inclusion in the National
Register. Consequently, no further work is
recommended for site 41GV161. At the
completion of the project, the recovered
artifacts will be curated at TARL.

On October 11 and November 2,
2007, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately 720 ft (ca.
219 m) of shoreline along Robinson Bayou
in Galveston County, Texas. The objectives
of the investigation were to locate and

(COE), Galveston District.
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 31 shovel
