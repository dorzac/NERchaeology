ABSTRACT

Exploratory archeological investigations were undertaken at the Nash Farm, site 41TR213, in
Grapevine, Texas, in September 2005. The investigations sponsored by the Grapevine Heritage
Foundation and the City of Grapevine were part of a larger project which included the restoration
of the ca. 1870s house. These investigations were geared towards finding the location of the
original log structure and determining the configuration of the original front porch/stoop. Partly
due to extremely dry weather and to a heavy cover of twentieth century material, the results
obtained from the excavations were less than expected or hoped. All materials collected from this
work are curated at the Grapevine Heritage Foundation in Grapevine.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In September 2005, the City of Grapevine contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., to conduct
exploratory investigations around the Nash Farm home in Grapevine, Texas (Figure 1). Located
in what is now a modern subdivision just to the southwest of downtown, the Nash Farm was
originally 110 acres of prairie that would stay in the Nash family until 1996 when it was obtained
by the Grapevine Heritage Foundation. Much of the property had been sold off but 5.2 acres
containing the original farmhouse and barn (built ca. 1869 and ca. 1905 respectively) taken over
by the Foundation is being developed for public use (Figure 2). As part of the long-term
development plan for the property, it is the goal of the Foundation to restore the farmhouse and
further develop the remaining property into an interactive educational facility to interpret the
agricultural heritage of the Grape Vine Prairie. In conjunction with the restoration and
development of the facility, archeological investigations were suggested to help identify the
location of the original log cabin built on the property. In addition, some investigations around
the original front entrance were also suggested to determine if a larger porch ever existed.
Though there was no regulatory driver for conducting these investigations, a permit under the
Antiquities Code of Texas was required since the City of Grapevine, a sub-entity of the State of
Texas, owns and operates the property.
This report will summarize the investigations that were conducted in 2005. A short background
of the area and family will be discussed before the results of the investigations are presented.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOLOGIC SETTING

Tarrant County is part of the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the woodlands of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of
the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. The Texan province acts as a giant ecotone,
where many species reach the limits of their range. The project area is at the boundary between
the Blackland Prairie and the Eastern Crosstimbers (Diamond et al. 1987:Figure 1). The
Blackland Prairie is one of several tall grass prairies present within this part of Texas. It is
dominated by grasses in the uplands, with wooded areas restricted to stream courses and river
bottoms. The Eastern Crosstimbers region is a north-south trending zone of scrub oak woodland,
which coincides with a band of sandy soil. The understory is essentially the same as that of the
surrounding prairies, but the sandier soils permit the development of woodland within the
uplands.
The region has a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid climate that is generally mild, with
periods of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly
evenly distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in
July and August. Generally much of the rainfall occurs during the night with heavy
thunderstorms more frequently during the spring. Hail falls two or three days a year, but mostly
causes only slight and scattered damage. Snowfall is common with most winters with a
measurable snowfall (Ressel 1981:2-3). Temperatures average 65.7Â° over the year (Ressel
1981:Table 1).
The project area is situated at the intersection of the Upper Cretaceous Woodbine and Eagle Ford
Formations (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972) and according to the Soil Survey of Tarrant
County, Texas (Ressel 1981) the site area is found on the Houston Black-Navo-Heiden soil
association which is made up of gently sloping, deep clayey and loamy soils on uplands. There
are three soils mapped that make up the site area. The majority of the site falls on Navo-Urban
land complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes, with just a small portion in the field along College Street on
Crosstell-Urban land complex, 1 to 6 percent slopes. The area just behind the barns and along
Homestead Street is Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes.

4

Navo-Urban land complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes is deep and gently sloping on broad ridges and
slopes above drainages. The surface layer of the Navo soil is brown clay loam about 12 inches
thick. The upper part of the subsoil from 12 to 18 inches is brown clay, followed by yellowish
brown clay grading into a light olive brown clay to 68 inches. The lower section to 72 inches is
light yellowish brown clay. Brownish, reddish, and yellowish mottles occur throughout. The
Urban land part is covered with individual dwellings, apartments, and small businesses and
adjoining streets, driveways, parking lots, patios, and other structures that obscure or alter the
soils to the extent that identification is not feasible (Ressel 1981:42).
Crosstell-Urban land complex, 1 to 6 percent slopes is deep and gently sloping and sloping on
ridges and side slopes. The typical surface layer of the Crosstell soil is neutral, brown fine sandy
loam about 4 inches thick. From four to 18 inches, the soil is strongly acidic yellowish red clay
followed by a medium acidic yellowish red clay with yellow mottles to 28 inches. To 41 inches
the subsoil is neutral brownish yellow clay with light gray mottles followed by a mildly alkaline
light gray stratified shale to 60 inches. The Urban land part is the same as above (Ressel
1981:27).
Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes is deep, gently sloping clayey soil on uplands. It is generally
moderately alkaline clay of dark grayish brown, grading to grayish brown and light yellowish
brown for 64 inches. The underlying soil to 72 inches is yellowish and grayish shaly clay (Ressel
1981:32)

CHAPTER 3
BACKGROUND

The area now known as Grapevine began to be settled in the mid to late 1840s. Some of the first
visitors to the area were James Gibson and John Hallford, from Platte County, Missouri. They
arrived in Texas at the headquarters of the Peters Colony in June of 1844. In late 1845 Gibson
and Hallford returned to Missouri and led a caravan of 12 families from Platte County back to
Texas. These early settlers were known as the Missouri Colony. Earlier that year, the brother-inlaw of Gibson and Hallford, Ambrose Foster, came with his two sons to build cabins and begin
tilling their land. James Gibson and the Reverend J. Hodges established Lonesome Dove Baptist
Church in 1846, which was the first church to be organized west of the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River. By 1849, one of the original settlers, Archibald F. Leonard, was operating a store on his
land. Sometime around 1854, James T. Morehead, A. F. Leonard, Henry L. Suggs, and others
established a post office established and formally laid out the town. Several names were
suggested, but as the settlement continued to grow and by 1855 it was known as Grape Vine
Community, due to its location on the edge of the Grape Vine Prairie, which in turn had taken its
name form the Grape Vine Springs. The springsâ name probably referred to the widespread
presence of native grapes (Vitis spp.) found in the area. By the early 1890s the population had
grown steadily to about 800 residents. Four churches and a public school had been established,
along with several other businesses. Over the years, the settlement has been known by several
different names, including Cross Timbers, Grape Vine Springs, Leonardville, Dunnville, and
Grape Vine (Handbook of Texas Online).
Sometime in 1854, Thomas Jefferson Nash, his wife Elizabeth Mouser Nash, three children, and
Thomasâ three brothers left Washington County, Kentucky for Texas. They originally settled in
Cedar Springs, Texas before relocating to the Grapevine area. They purchased 110 acres of
farmland in 1859 from Henry L. Suggs. A log cabin was already present on the property and they
lived there until they built the current two-story farmhouse around 1869. The cabin was
originally located just south of the present farmhouse, near the railroad tracks. The railway came
through in 1888, and the cabin was likely then moved to the location seen in an early photograph
of the farm (Figure 3). The photograph dates to somewhere between 1905 and 1919 (David
Klempin, Historic Preservation Officer, City of Grapevine, personal communication 2007). After
construction of the farmhouse was completed, the cabin was then presumably used as a smoke
house or an outdoor kitchen. It may also have been used as living quarters for one Thomasâ
brothers. It is not known what became of the log cabin or when it may have been removed.

The current two-story farmhouse was built in the Texas âTâ style. It is rectangular in shape, with
end gables, and one room deep and two rooms wide. It has a center hallway and stairs. There
were some additions and changes through the years, though the farmhouse was most altered in
1948 by the Pierce Williamson family (City of Grapevine n.d.).
In 1905, a barn was added to the property and is still used for housing livestock. Most of the
property was sold off over the years. The Grapevine Heritage Foundation purchased the
remaining 5.2 acres in 1996, which also contained a small fenced cemetery. A single obelisk
headstone stands in the cemetery with the names Thomas (1877-1878) and Clint Payne (18841885), presumably extended family members. In addition, in each corner of the enclosed fence is
a cement rectangular marker with new gray granite bricks marked UNKNOWN. Whether these
are marked burials is unknown as well.
The agricultural censuses of late 1800s show that the livestock kept by the Nash family was fairly
consistent with other Blackland Prairie farmers. In 1870, they had 75 head of cattle and 60 hogs,
as well as five milk cows. In 1880, they had only six head of cattle, 50 hogs, and six milk cows.
Their draft animals consisted of nine horses and six oxen in 1870, and 14 horses and two mules in
1880. They also kept a small flock of sheep (Taylor 2004:11). Their principal agricultural crop
was corn. They grew 400 bushels in 1870 and 500 bushels in 1880. Twenty acres was devoted to
wheat production. According to the agriculture census of 1870, they produced 151 bushels of
wheat, and by 1880 they increased the production to 302 bushels (Taylor 2004:4). Cotton was
also grown on the Nash farm. The 1880 census shows that they were able to produce ten bales of
cotton that year (Taylor 2004:6). The largest acreage of any crop was 30 acres, and that was
devoted to corn (Taylor 2004:10).

CHAPTER 4
METHODOLOGY

In order to address the question of the existence of a larger porch on the farmhouse, five 50-x-50
cm units were placed near the original front entry, which is on the south side of the structure
(Figure 4). They were dispersed throughout an area measuring roughly 14 meters by six meters,
and running parallel to the house. It was hoped that the random placement of units would allow
for better coverage and possibly uncover evidence of sweep piles, drip lines, etc.
To determine the possible location of the log cabin, early photographs of the farm were used to
position two trenches, approximately 50 cm wide and 200 cm long. Since a shallow rectangular
depression (four to six inches below adjacent grade) off the northwest corner of the farmhouse
was in the immediate vicinity, it was therefore presumed that the depression might in someway be
associated with the cabin (Figure 5). Trench 1 was placed in a north-south orientation and Trench
2 ran east-west. It was expected that by bisecting both edges of the depression, any remaining
cultural evidence would more likely be encountered.
A State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form was produced for this property and an
archeological site number, 41TR213, was assigned by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. A scaled pace-and-compass map was prepared in pencil on metric graph paper and
reproduced in Illustrator. Soil from all excavated units was screened through Â¼-inch hardware
cloth. In order to estimate depth of deposit, units were excavated to the base of the culturebearing deposits, if possible. All artifacts recovered from units were collected and analyzed. All
excavation units were plotted on the site map. A complete photographic record was kept and was
used to record identified cultural remains, the general topography and condition of the area at the
time of the survey, and the field techniques and methodology employed. All photographs were
documented as to date; digital format was used to record the work conducted under this work
order. Field notes concerning the exploration investigation were maintained by the project
archeologist.

The analysis of the historical material makes use of the classification system developed by South
(1977). It consists of four major analytical categories or classes of artifacts, consisting of:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Domestic;
Architectural;
Personal; and
Activities.

Unidentified metal fragments and ceramic or glass sherds that are unclassifiable as to category are
placed in a separate, indeterminate category. Although the use of these artifact categories may
perpetuate ideas about functional classifications, it is felt that at the survey level of research, such
an analytical framework is the most efficient way to handle the artifactual data.
Major artifact categories are sorted into various subcategories, including tableware, food storage,
and furnishings. These are then sorted into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the
type of subcategory and material type. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are
associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible. The general nature of each of the
major artifact categories is discussed below.

DOMESTIC ARTIFACTS
The domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumes some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares include stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items are identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g., nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and are assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items, or storagewares, are also subdivided as to whether they were ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items are further subdivided into types and subtypes
using technological and decorative attributes, such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., gray bodied, Bristol, cobalt, slipped, Albany slip, natural
slip) and interior treatment (e.g., blue gray, Bristol, slipped, Albany slip, unglazed). These
attributes form the basis for assigning production dates to individual specimens.
Glass storageware is subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); and either decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base),
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded), or sometimes function
(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). Individual items are given
artifact-specific dates based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination.

11

The furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service or food storage-related household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historical artifact assemblage from rural sites and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass.
Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the domestic category.
In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the architectural or activities categories.

ARCHITECTURAL ARTIFACTS
The architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of architectural items include such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails are further subdivided as to
whether they are wrought, cut, or wire; and the brick is distinguished as to whether it is
handmade, machine-made, or high-fired.

PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
The personal item category includes items of individual use, such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historical archeological sites.

ACTIVITIES ARTIFACTS
The final analytical category of historical artifacts relates to what have been called activities
items. This category includes all non-household items, such as those associated with
transportation activities and farm-related equipment. As with personal items, this category often
makes up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts
from a site. Activity category items include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples,
fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for activities
items include tools, harness and equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons,
and coal.
Upon completion of the project, all artifacts, field forms, photographs, and other records will be
turned over to the Grapevine Heritage Foundation for permanent curation and for use in
educational presentations.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The project consists of preliminary exploratory investigations of two main areas: the possibility
of an earlier, larger porch on the original front entryway of the farmhouse and the presumed log
cabin location (Figure 6).

PORCH INVESTIGATION
Fieldwork began on September 15, 2005, with a crew of Lisa G. Shaddox, Project Archeologist
and Diamond Kapanday, field technician. Melissa M. Green, Principal Investigator, was present
for part of the day as well. Five 50-x-50 cm units were laid out on the south side of the
farmhouse to ascertain the location and size of the original porch and to investigate the possible
presence of sweep piles, drip lines, etc. These units were placed randomly throughout an area
measuring roughly 14 meters by six meters, and running parallel to the house structure (Figure 7).
Due to recent drought and extreme high temperatures, the soils were very compact and difficult to
dig. To facilitate excavation, water was slowly dripped onto the surface of the units from a hose
that was connected to an outside faucet. Units were dug in ten cm increments to a depth of 40 cm
bs (below surface) using shovels and picks, and with trowels as needed. Excavation of the five
small units continued until September 20th. After completing the excavations, plan views and
profiles were drawn and the units were added to the overall site map. A short discussion of each
unit is provided below.

Unit 1
This unit (Figure 8) was placed at the west end of the porch area, near one of the support posts.
The top ten cm (Level 1) was compact, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silty clay with mottles of
yellowish red (5YR 4/6) silty clay in the bottom few cm. Recovered artifacts include: two pieces
of clear flat (window) glass (1.7 and 1.8 mm thick); one piece of light green flat glass (1.8 mm
thick); the head of a thumbtack, with aqua colored paint on top; and an aluminum pull tab (19621970s).

The mottling continued into Level 2 (10-20 cm), with inclusions of a few large gravels and small
fragments of ferruginous sandstone. No artifacts were recovered from this level.
Level 3 (20-30 cm) contained loose, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy clay loam, which was
markedly different from the previous levels. More than 150 wire nails and nail fragments (post
1890; Nelson 1968) of varying sizes (4d, 6d, and 8d) were recovered. Also collected were: one
piece of aqua flat glass (2.1 mm thick) and one piece of milk glass of undetermined use. Eight
pieces of asphalt shingle (post 1889) were recovered as well.
The sandy clay loam continued into Level 4 (30-40 cm), but dissipated by the bottom few
centimeters of the level, where the silty clay returned. The only artifact recovered was one piece
of aqua flat glass (2.0 mm thick).

Unit 2
Unit 2 (Figure 9) was placed approximately 3.5 m from the house, just to the southeast of Unit 1.
Level 1 consisted of the same compact, dark brown silty clay as seen in Unit 1, but without the
mottles. The only items recovered from this level were two pieces of modern plastic (post 1942):
a section of garden hose and the tip of a caulk tube.

The mottling of yellowish red silty clay seen in Unit 1 was observed in Level 2 of this unit. No
artifacts were recovered from this level.
The mottling continued through Level 3. One 2d wire nail, one 12d wire nail, 38 wire nail
fragments, and one 6d cut nail (1840-1880; Nelson 1968) were collected, as well as one piece of
aqua bottle glass (ca. 1880-1910).
Level 4 was mottled and contained a few small to medium sized gravels. One 6d common wire
nail and eight nail fragments were recovered. Additionally, clear bottle glass with an embossed
âTâ (1910-1940s) and light green flat glass (2.65 mm thick) were collected.

Unit 3
This unit was placed about a meter to the southeast of the current porch (Figure 10). The top
level consisted of compact, dark brown silty clay (7.5YR 3/3), similar to the other units. Noted
were small to medium gravels and flecks of white latex paint throughout. Collected artifacts
include four pieces of modern plastic (post 1942), one piece of aqua flat glass (2.6 mm thick), and
a fragment of machine-made brick (post 1903) with white paint exterior. Also recovered was a
cylindrical piece of plastic, reminiscent of a swizzle stick, embossed with ââ¦HICAGOâ and
ââ¦HOUSEâ on opposite sides. Unfortunately, not enough of this artifact was found in order to
make a definitive determination of what the embossing was identifying.

Level 2 consisted of the same compact, dark brown silty clay but with the aforementioned
mottling, and small gravels throughout. No artifacts were recovered from this level, but a large
piece of concrete or âconglomerateâ was exposed in the western portion of the unit and extended
into the wall.
The mottling dissipated in Level 3, but the gravels remained. The soil was again, the dark brown
silty clay seen in Level 2. Two wire nails (4d and 6d), two pieces of asphalt shingle, and one
fragment of light green flat glass (2.1 mm thick) was recovered.
The dark brown silty clay in Level 4 was slightly looser but still heavily graveled. The west half
of the unit appeared to have a dense gravelly fill. A handmade brick fragment (pre-1903) was
noted in the north wall, but was not collected. Recovered artifacts include: numerous wire nails
and nail fragments ranging in size from 2d to 16d (n=>50) and comprising finish, common, and
roofing examples; six cut nails (6d and 8d); a 10 cm-long cut nail spike fragment; three sections
of drive chain, such as used on a bicycle; seven asphalt shingle pieces; six fragments of
handmade brick (pre-1903); a small, thin strip of copper; a battery core (post 1900); and two
metal crown caps (post 1892). Additionally, three pieces of light green flat glass (2.15, 2.5, and
2.6 mm thick) and one piece of post-1910 clear bottle glass (ABM; automated bottle machine)
were collected.

Unit 4
Unit 4 was situated on the south side of the stone pathway, approximately four meters from the
house (Figure 11). Level 1 consisted of dark brown silty clay loam (7.5YR 3/2), slightly more
organic in nature than the other units. Extensive bits of white latex paint were noted throughout
this level. No artifacts were observed.
Level 2 contained dark brown silty clay loam with mottles of yellowish red (5YR 4/6) silty clay.
One 16d wire nail was recovered from this level.
The mottling continued into Level 3. Numerous common wire nails and nail fragments (n=49)
ranging in size from 2d to 16d were recovered. Additionally, 18 cut (16 common and 2 finish; 6d
and 8d) nails and nail fragments; two asphalt shingle pieces; one indeterminate metal fragment;
and one fragment of clear ABM bottle glass were collected.
Level 4 contained very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam with mottles. The majority of the
artifacts recovered from this level came from 35 to 40 cm bs. Collected artifacts include: more
than 50 wire nails and nail fragments ranging in size from 2d to 16d; 49 cut nails and nail
fragments ranging in size from 4d to 8d; a 20d wire spike; a 30d cut spike; a small iron hinge,
possibly from a chest; one small chain link; five pieces of asphalt shingle; three fragments of light
green flat glass (2.25, 2.4, and 2.7 mm thick); one piece of clear ABM bottle glass; a thin strip of
lead shaped like a ribbon; the base of a lipstick tube labeled âPondâs Extract Co./Made in USAâ;
a small wad of gum or wax; a machine-made (post-1926; Randall 1979) blue and white glass
marble; and one piece of modern plastic. Several small handmade brick fragments were noted in
the west wall of the unit, but were not collected. These appear to have been at the same elevation
as the brick fragment in the wall of Unit 3, just to the northeast of this unit.

Unit 5
This unit was placed approximately two meters from the southeast corner of the house (Figure
12). Level 1 consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) compact silty clay with a few
small gravels. No artifacts were observed in this level.
The same soil continued into Level 2, with a few small gravel inclusions. No artifacts were
recovered.
Level 3 exhibited the same characteristics as the previous two levels, with a few mottles
beginning to be exposed. Only one 4d common wire nail was recovered from this level.
Extensive mottling appeared in Level 4, along with several areas of rust staining. This rust was
likely due to badly decomposed nails or other metal fragments. The soil was a continuation of the
compact silty clay in the previous levels. Several artifacts were recovered including: four 2d
common wire nails and one fragment; one 2d common cut nails and two fragments; three
unidentifiable metal fragments; one ceramic sherd most likely from a flower pot; and finally,
three pieces of aqua flat glass (1.7 and 2.45 mm thick) and one light green flat glass (1.75 mm
thick).

LOG CABIN INVESTIGATION
After completion of the five 50-x-50 cm units, work began on the log cabin investigation. Two
trenches were laid out in the area of the depression (Figure 13). Trench 1 was oriented northsouth, and was placed near the well and extending into the northern edge of the depression (see
Figure 6). It measured 50 cm wide and 200 cm long (Figure 14). Trench 2 was oriented eastwest and was placed perpendicular to the eastern edge of the depression, thereby bisecting it (see
Figure 6). It also measured 50 cm by 200 cm (Figure 15). It was expected that if the depression
was indeed associated with the log cabin, then there would be evidence of foundation footings,
structural elements, etc. If the building had been used as a smokehouse or outdoor kitchen, there
would likely be residue from those activities, such as greasy soil stains, bone fragments, cooking
implements, ash, and so forth.
The trenches were hand excavated in 10-cm increments using picks and shovels (Figure 16). As
the soils were extremely compact and difficult to dig, they were soaked daily with a slow drip
from the water hose.

Trench 1
Level 1 (0-10 cm bs) consisted of dark brown (10YR 3/3) very compact silty clay. Recovered
artifacts include: one piece of modern green plastic (a fragment of a modern water valve lid), one
piece each of aqua (ca. 1880-1910) and clear (post 1880) bottle glass, two pieces of modern

brown glass (possibly from a recent beer bottle, post 1940), two fragments of pre-1903 handmade
brick, two fragments of thin metal, and one 4d cut nail. Additionally, one bone fragment was
collected. It was sawn on both ends and exhibited a large butcher mark on the exterior.
The second level (10-20 cm bs) was a continuation of the soil from the previous level, but with
some mottling of yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay in the southern end. Some sand and a few
medium sized rocks were noted as well. Additionally, some small black smears were observed.
These were not large enough to collect for analysis, so it is uncertain if they were charcoal or
perhaps a form of coal or some other natural inclusion. Numerous artifacts were recovered from
this level including five pieces of modern brown glass; one piece of clear ABM bottle glass; one
piece of aqua flat glass (2.2 mm thick); two pieces of clear flat glass (2.25 and 2.3 mm thick); one
fragment of clear light bulb glass; one natural clay stoneware sherd (1875-1900; Greer 1981;
Lebo 1992); two light blue tinted whiteware sherds (1880-1930; Moir 1987); one fragment of
very thin copper electrical wire; 13 common wire nails and fragments ranging in size from 4d to
12d; one cut nail fragment; a fence staple; four fragments of handmade brick (pre-1903); and one
piece of blue modern plastic sheeting with a feather-like pattern. In addition, three unidentifiable
bone fragments were recovered.
The dark brown compact silty clay with yellowish red mottles extended into Level 3. At the
southern end of the trench, a dense, hard-packed sandy lens of small pea gravels was encountered
at approximately 25 cm bs. These pea gravels are type used to mix modern concrete and were not
considered natural to the site. Immediately above the gravels, several small pockets of
charcoal/coal (?) were observed. As in the previous level, none were large enough to collect as a

sample. In the northern end of the trench, a very dry, compact zone, about 25Â± cm wide and
slightly circular in appearance stretched across the unit (Figure 17). The collected artifacts
include: 11 wire nails (10 common and 1 roofing) and nail fragments ranging in size from 2d to
12d; one 6d cut nail and one fragment; the fluted wheel from a pastry cutter; one piece of barbed
wire; one piece of thin metal of indeterminate use; one fragment of pre-1903 handmade brick;
two pieces of clear ABM bottle glass; one piece of clear flat glass (4.9 mm) one aluminum
grommet fastener; one piece of modern white plastic; and three small unidentifiable bone
fragments, one possibly part of a rib.
While excavating Level 4, two large holes were encountered along the walls towards the northern
end of the trench (see Figure 14). Since the well was in such close proximity and the soil around
the holes felt hollow, excavations ceased in that area and work continued at the southern end.
The mottling seen in the previous levels continued into this level. Small pea gravel was noted
throughout. Few artifacts were recovered: one 16d wire nail, two wire nail fragments, and one
small piece of wire.

A few artifacts were recovered from the backdirt of Trench 1. These include: a metal handle
from a tin can key, two pieces of clear ABM bottle glass, and a small (< 1 cm) of burned
unidentifiable bone.

Trench 2
Level 1 consisted of dark brown (10YR 3/3) very compact silty clay, with some small pockets of
sand very near the surface. A few medium sized rocks were noted. A mixture of artifacts were
collected including: a small piece of copper wire; two indeterminate pieces of thin metal; three
pieces of asphalt shingle; one fragment of post 1920s linoleum; one piece of clear bottle glass;
two pieces of modern brown beer bottle glass; one piece of clear flat glass (1.95 mm thick); one
piece of reddish orange modern plastic (possibly the tooth from a comb, post 1942); and four
small bone fragments, two of which may be bird.

The next level (Level 2) also contained dark brown very compact silty clay. A few rocks, along
with some large gravels were noted. At this elevation, the trench showed signs of disturbances.
The eastern end of the trench appeared to be highly disturbed. It contained a large amount of
sandy loam mixed with small gravels. The rest of the trench was highly mottled with yellowish
red clay. There were also some small smears of possible charcoal/coal throughout, with none
large enough to sample. Along the southern wall, a small semi-circular conglomerate of concrete
was exposed. The artifacts recovered from the trench for this level include: one 16d wire nail;
two pieces of clear ABM bottle glass, one with a continuous thread; two pieces of aqua ABM
bottle glass; one piece of light green flat glass (2.0 mm thick); one fragment of modern plastic;
and one unidentifiable bone fragment that was sawn on both sides.
The disturbance continued into Level 3. The dark brown compact silty clay was still mottled with
yellowish red clay and charcoal flecks. The eastern end of the trench had small sandy pockets
and the western end had extensive highly compacted small gravels. Mixed within the gravel were
numerous artifacts, especially clear glass and small metal fragments. The top of this gravel lens
was exposed at approximately the same elevation as the gravels in Trench 1 (25 cm bs). The
collected artifacts include: two wire nails (8d and 16d); two wire nail fragments; one 8d cut nail;
two fragments of pre-1903 handmade brick; one piece of clear bottle glass embossed with
ââ¦MAâ¦â possibly from a Mason jar; five pieces of clear ABM bottle glass, two pieces of aqua
bottle glass (1880-1910); one neck-to-lip section of manganese solarized bottle (1880-1920); two
pieces of clear light bulb glass (post 1930); one Bristol glazed stoneware ceramic sherd (18901915; Greer 1981); four whiteware ceramic rim sherds with faded floral decalcomania decoration
(1890-1920); three light blue tinted whiteware sherds, a base with a foot ring (1880-1930) and
two body sherds with faded floral decalcomania decoration (1880-1920); and one fragment of
plaster with cement on the reverse side.
Level 4 contained the same disturbance from the previous levels. The mottling continued
throughout, and included small to medium gravels and charcoal flecks, along with yellowish red
clay. The silty clay was slightly less compact and tended more towards a silty clay loam. The
small gravels continued in the western end of the trench. Recovered artifacts include: three wire
nail fragments; one piece of heavily corroded barbed wire; six indeterminate metal fragments;
four fragments of pre-1903 handmade brick; three pieces of brown ABM bottle glass; seven
pieces of aqua bottle glass (ca. 1880-1910); three pieces of clear ABM bottle glass; one clear,
rounded bottle lip that is slightly melted; one piece of clear bottle glass embossed with a partial
script âMâ; one piece of aqua flat glass (3.2 mm thick); two light blue tinted whiteware sherds
(1880-1930); one plain whiteware sherd (post 1890); and one bone fragment.
To further investigate the concrete footing exposed in the south wall of Trench 2, a small 25-x-25
cm wide unit was excavated around it. After excavating 10 cm in depth, a galvanized fence post
was encountered (Figure 18). It was determined that the concrete was a reinforced posthole from
a previous chain-link wire fence, and the unit was terminated.
Additionally, several artifacts were recovered from the surface in various areas of the farm.
These include: the tip of a knife; one salt glazed exterior/natural clay slipped interior stoneware
ceramic sherd (1865-1900); three pieces of aqua flat glass (3.15 and 3.2 mm thick); one piece of
clear bottle glass with stippling (post 1940); one whiteware ceramic sherd; and one late white
ironstone rim sherd (1880-1910).

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY

It was expected that the preliminary exploratory investigations undertaken at Nash Farm in 2005
would answer the two prominent questions of:
â¢
â¢

Did a larger porch exist previously on the original front entry of the farmhouse, and
Was the depression on the north side of the farmhouse associated with the log cabin.

Unfortunately, the results were less than hoped for. In recent years much of the landscape of the
historic farmstead has been dramatically altered by modern urban expansion, and to a certain
degree, from recent construction activities within the farm property itself. For example, no
evidence of any kind was observed indicating refuse piles or pits, privies, outdoor cooking, soap
making, butchering, or laundry areas, etc. that might have left some surface indications. It is
assumed that these types of activities would have taken place around the rear of the house, along
the west side and out toward the direction of the barn. Today, most of what was the yard area just
west and northwest of the house has been sold off and is now part of the surrounding residential
neighborhood and adjacent street. Additionally, the construction of the large pole barn in the
1990s also has impacted potential activity areas, and possibly the true location of the log cabin.
Also a water line from the pole barn connecting with the main water line at the farmhouse was
recently put in place. This required excavating a trench across the side yard and, though no
artifacts were noted in the somewhat freshly turned backdirt, may have further impacted potential
intact deposits.
The log cabin trench excavations in the depression just off the northwest corner of the house also
yielded evidence of modern disturbance. The appearance of a âdepressionâ may have been more
exaggerated due to the use of fill to build up and level the area for the construction of the pole
barn; it is slightly higher than the area around it. Also, the occurrence of small pea gravel, the
type used to mix concrete, in both trenches indicates that there have been modern intrusions or
impacts that have either masked or obliterated earlier activities or deposits. The few artifacts
(bottle glass, bone, nails) identified in these trenches were the items you would expect in any
back yard that was used, but no patterns were identified in the type or location of these scattered
materials. The holes occurring in Level 3 of Trench 1 may also have been due to the extremely
dry conditions and the cracking that occurs in these soils when it is that dry. The use of a water
hose and soaking the units in order to make excavation easier may have created a false hollow
28

surface. The well itself had been filled in a few years before our excavation was carried out; yet
with the drought, the cracks in the soil and the use of water to ease the excavation may have
shifted some of the subsurface pressure and created holes in the trench area. Regardless, no
evidence of drip lines, structural footings, or a chimney, indicating a structure was identified.
Nor were there indications of greasy or sooty soil observed or smelled that might be expected in a
smokehouse.
The units dug at the front of the house to hopefully aid in determining the porch size and
configuration were also disappointing. Prior to the Heritage Foundation acquisition of the
property, it had been empty and in probate for nearly 50 years. But, extensive remodeling and
painting of the farmhouse was undertaken in the late 1940s. Based on the materials retrieved
from the units closest to the house (1, 2, 3, and 5), some changes were made to the front of the
house. Large numbers of wire nails were found in these units. Unfortunately, the excavation of
these units did not yield any additional information about the size or configuration of the original
porch. It is our belief that the current porch or stoop is only slightly smaller than the original
porch as indicated in historic photographs owned by the Foundation and shown to us during our
investigations (Figure 19). Apparently the large number of twentieth century materials found in
the units excavated also obliterated any evidence of drip lines along the edge of the porch or yard
sweeping that might have occurred near the front door.

Of particular interest was that Level 2 in these units was completely sterile of any materials. Had
there been strong winds that dumped at least 10 cm of sterile soil across the front of the house at
some point in the past; or had it been a conscious decision to spread soil across the front in order
to level or improve the front of the house during the remodeling episode in the 1940s? It is our
conjecture that the latter argument is correct. A concrete slab and foundation had been
constructed off or the west side of the house (a screened porch or carport?), likely in the 1940s
expansion, and dirt was removed from that area to level it and spread across the front yard. Some
of the natural sandstone used as a walkway up to the front of the house indicates that in that some
were nearly buried while others rested on the surface.
Should additional funds become available for further investigations at Nash Farm, it is suggested
that additional trenches, or minimally several 50-x-50 cm units, be excavated further west of the
log cabin area investigated in this project and nearer the edge of the current property. Perhaps
some of the more recent construction activities have not impacted the area fully. There may
remain some small pockets of intact deposits that would help pinpoint more precisely the location
of the log cabin, and possibly even ascertain the nature of its eventual use after construction of the
farmhouse. Additionally, areas between the pole barn and around the 1905 barn might also yield
information on other activity areas that may also remain intact.
