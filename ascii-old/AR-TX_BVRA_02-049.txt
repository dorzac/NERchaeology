ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the Thompson Subdivision Trunk Sewer Project for
the City of Temple in Bell County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates in April 1997. The project area is 3775 feet long with a permanent easement
of 20 feet (1.73 acres) and a temporary easement of 50 feet (4.33 acres). William E.
Moore was the Principal Investigator. Michael R. Bradle served as Project Archaeologist
and conducted the survey. This study was carried out under Texas Antiquities Committee
Permit Number 1812. The project area was investigated using the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The pedestrian survey
adequately tested the easement for surface materials and buried sites.
One previously unrecorded multi-component archaeological site (41BL1084) was
recorded. The prehistoric component contains burned rock and lithics in shallow soils (50
cm) in a plowed field. A field examination of the lithic artifacts revealed all stages of
artifact reduction and included retouched flakes, cores, biface failures, and debitage. No
diagnostic artifacts were observed; therefore, the age of the prehistoric component is not
known. Based on the presence of burned rock and the complete range of lithic reduction
activities, 41BL1084 is described in this report as a campsite. The shallow prehistoric
component has been disturbed by plowing and the area has been regularly visited by relic
collectors according to local informants.
The historic component is the remains of a farmstead dating to the early 20th
century and perhaps the late 19th century. It was last inhabited by Oscar and Ida Trojan
who purchased the house in 1941. The house has since been removed to the Antique
Tractor Show in Temple where it has been restored. The outbuildings and the area where
the house once stood are out of the project area and will not be affected by the proposed
construction; only a sparse scatter of historic trash (glass and ceramics) was found within
the project area. The main part of the historic component may be eligible for State
Archeological Landmark status since it is part of the early settlement along Pepper Creek.
It is recommended that the farmstead be investigated to determine its significance should
future construction threaten this site.
Copies of the final report are curated at the Department of Antiquities Protection,
Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, and Brazos
Valley Research Associates. No artifacts were collected. This site is not considered
eligible for State Archeological Landmark status, and it is recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple proposes to build a trunk sewer line that will service the
Thompson Subdivision. The permanent easement is 20 feet wide, and the temporary
easement is 50 feet wide. The depth of the trench will be 9-12 feet. The length of the line
from a point east of Kegley Road to the end of the project area is 3525 feet; however,
there is a right angle in the line that makes the total area surveyed 3775 feet. Including
the permanent easement and the turn in the line the project area is 4.33 acres in size.*
After crossing Kegley Road, the project area traverses a corn field, that was in cultivation
at the time of the survey, until it reaches Jupiter Road in the Thompson Subdivision. In
that section of the alignment where the project area crosses the pasture near the historic
component the temporary easement will be located on the south side of the permanent
easement. This will avoid the standing structures and the house site. The general
location of the project area within the county is depicted in Figure 1.
An archaeological assessment of the proposed trunk sewer line was required by
the Department of Antiquities Protection, Texas Historical Commission. This study was
performed under Texas Antiquities Committee permit 1812. The areas investigated are
depicted on the project area map (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on the Belton
7.5' U.S.G.S topographic quadrangle dated 1965 and revised in 1993 (Figure 3). William
E. Moore served as Principal Investigator; Michael R. Bradle was the Project
Archaeologist. The project number assigned by BVRA is 97-01. Roming-Parker,
Associates, L.L.P. refers to this project as the Thompson Subdivision Trunk Sewer
Project. There was no federal involvement.
This part of Texas contains numerous archaeological sites, and several are
located within the vicinity of the project area. In the immediate area, for example, are
several sites that were recorded during an earlier survey by BVRA (Moore et al. 1996b).
Three of these sites (41BL1066, 41BL1069, and 41BL1070) were tested by American
Archaeology Group (Bradle et al. 1997), and site 41BL1066 is less than 200 meters east
of 41BL1084. Five previously recorded sites (41BL122 - 41BL126), referred to as the
"Pepper Creek Archeological District" in the Endangered Historic Properties of Texas
published by the Texas Historical Commission (1991:10), are located about 3500 meters
southwest of the project area near the confluence of Pepper Creek and the Leon River.
According to the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas, there are no previously recorded sites in the current project
area. Because of presence of previously recorded sites in the immediate area, potential
for archaeological sites in the project area was considered high, and a Phase I cultural
resources survey was required by the Department of Antiquities Protection, pursuant to
the Texas Antiquities Code, as amended. The City of Temple through Roming-Parker
Associates, L.L.P., a local engineering firm, contracted with Brazos Valley Research
Associates to perform this service.

The research design was coordinated with the Department of Antiquities
Protection, Texas Historical Commission, Roming-Parker, and the City of Temple and
was designed to intensively survey the project area in order to identify all prehistoric and
historic archeological and/or architectural properties which may be eligible for State
Archeological Landmark designation. The methods used during this study are discussed
below in the Field Methods section of this report.
______
* There is a short segment of the project area containing a stand of large trees that will not
have a temporary easement; therefore, the area surveyed is actually less than 4.33
acres.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:112-116) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern
Texas. The size and location of this province is described below by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards
Plateau as limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4),
the Lampasas Cut Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as
1946 in Blair]), and the Central Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of
the Edwards Plateau lying west of the Pecos, and often referred to as the
Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred instead to as the
Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west.
Bell County is located in the eastern half of the province that has been classified by
Thornwaite (1948) as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential
evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell
County is 34 inches, the January minimum temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the
July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and the growing season is 258
days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this
province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus
texana), stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of
the region include Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana),
ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus
spp.), sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis
trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca spp.), Texas prickly pear
(Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa
americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian
wildrye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now
primarily overgrown with juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.

Hydrology
The project area is located within the Brazos River drainage basin, one of the
largest rivers in the state. The nearest major drainage to the project area is Pepper
Creek, a tributary of the Leon River, which flows into Little River. Pepper Creek flows in a
general north-south direction less than 100 meters to the east of the point at which the
project area crosses Kegley Road. An unnamed tributary of Pepper Creek passes to the
west of the project area where it ends on Jupiter Road; the distance of this stream is about
300 meters.
Wildlife
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province that is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding
provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), racoon
(Prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo),
morning dove (Zenaida macroura), sicssor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus),
northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum
testaceus), and the bullsnake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).
Geology
No formal geoarchaeological study was performed for this project. Recent
geoarchaeological investigations in the area have been conducted by Lee C. Nordt along
Pepper Creek (Moore et al. 1996a; Bradle et al. 1997), Fryers Creek (Moore et al. 1996b).
Two of these studies were Phase I investigations and Mr. Nordt's objective was to
determine the relative probability of discovering buried archaeological sites in primary
contexts. To complete this task, the floodplain history of Pepper Creek, Bird Creek, and
the Leon River were reconstructed within the areas surveyed. Barnes (1979) found that
this area is underlain by Cretaceous shales, marls, and limestones. According to the Bell
County soil survey (Huckabee et al. 1977), alluvial soils border Pepper Creek along its
entirety. Researchers are advised to consult these reports for more detailed discussions
of the geology of this area.
Soils
The project area contains four soil types; Branyon clay (ByA), 0 to 1 percent
slopes, Branyon clay (ByB), 1 to 3 percent slopes, Lewisville silty clay (LeB), 1 to 3
percent slopes, and Trinity clay (Ty), frequently flooded (Figure 4). These soils are part of
the Branyon Series and Trinity Series as defined in the Soil Survey of Bell County, Texas
(Huckabee et al. 1977:10, 31). They are depicted on Sheet 28 of the Bell County soil
survey. The Branyon series consists of nearly level to gently sloping, calcareous, clayey
soils on broad ancient terraces. These deep soils formed in clayey alluvial material.

7

The eastern segment of the project area consists of ByB soils (Figure 4), while the
western segment (approximately 50%) consists of ByA soils (Figure 4). The LeB soils are
found near the western end of the project area, and Ty soils are only found in that portion
of the project adjacent to Pepper Creek.
According to the Bell County soil survey (Huckabee et al. 1977:11), ByA soils are
nearly level and found in areas irregular in shape from 8 to more than 1300 acres in size.
The profile of this soil is described as representative of the series. This soil is well suited
to crops, and nearly all areas are cultivated.
ByB soils are gently sloping and are found mostly around and on the edges of
larger areas of nearly level soils as well as at the head of streams. Most areas are long
and narrow and are 10 acres to more than 1000 acres in size (Huckabee et al. 1977:11).
LeB soils are part of the Lewisville Series. They consist of deep, gently sloping
and undulating clayey soils on stream terraces and foot slopes below limestone hills.
These calcareous soils formed in alluvium. These soils are found near major streams
(Huckabee et al. 1977:22).
The Trinity Series consists of nearly level, calcareous, clayey soils on flood plains.
These deep soils formed in clayey alluvium. Ty soils are found on floodplains parallel to
stream channels in the lowest bottom land areas. Areas are long and narrow and are 10
to 800 acres in size (Huckabee et al. 1977:31-32).

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This is an area is referred to as Central Texas by
most archaeologists and is rich in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have been
prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and
Coryell counties, Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978;
Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the
Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964;
Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region have been published by Suhm (1960), Weir
(1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central
Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society.
These works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by Michael B. Collins
(1995) and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas Archeological
Region" by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a
major synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following
discussion is taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although, according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
"Paleoindian," it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian
typically refers to those cultures that were oriented toward big game hunting with food
collecting not a major pursuit. Eileen Johnson (1977:65-77) states that it has been
erroneously stereotyped as a migratory systematic big game procurement adaptation.
Collins (1995:381) argues that subsistence in Clovis times, for example, Pleoindians
exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth,
bison, and horse but also included smaller animals such as water turtles, land tortoises,
alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rockshelter, a paved floor suggests that
the inhabitants of this site returned to the same site as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game. It is,
therefore, assumed that an array of plants presumably also constituted part of Clovis
subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989)
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have
been excavated. As of 1985, for example, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported
for Bell County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the form
of surface collected materials found over much of Central Texas.

10

At Fort Hood, this period is represented by distinctive projectile points found in
multicomponent surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally, it
is believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic
artifacts of the period include dart point types Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and
Plainview as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may
be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931).
Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are
located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in
Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian
occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985).
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period that lasted from approximately
8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to Prewitt
(1981:71), "The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas." Prewitt
(1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987) has
questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases
occurring before the Middle Archaic. These have been grouped into Early, Middle, Late,
and Terminal periods by Carlson et al. (1986:15).
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a "strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population
was of low density." This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell
phases (8500 B.P. - 5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very
specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds
(Prewitt 1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during
the Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000 B.P. - 2600 B.P.).
An overall decrease in burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic. Bison
were important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases
(2600 B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The Terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson
et al. (1986), includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. - 1250 B.P.). An
increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seem to
have occurred during Prewitt's (1981:82) Driftwood phase.

11

According to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) published by the Office
of the State Archeologist in 1985, the prehistoric site inventory for Bell County was heavily
skewed towards the Archaic. Of the 197 recorded sites, 2 were classified as PaleoIndian,
10 Early Archaic, 37 Middle Archaic, 32 Late Archaic, 52 General Archaic, and 29 Late
Prehistoric. These statistics suggest that Bell County was occupied mainly during the
Archaic period which, according to Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500 years B.P. to
1250 B.P. This is supported by the statement by Collins (1995:383) that "two-thirds of the
prehistory of Central Texas is 'Archaic' in character."
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al.
1954), Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Technological changes are the primary distinguishing characteristics of this stage. The
Austin (1250 B.P. - 650 B.P.) and Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this stage
of prehistory. During this time arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics and
possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that only the bow and
arrow appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture
developed last and was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued
to practice hunting and gathering, a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place.
These are referred to as early and late by Collins (1995:385) with the break between the
long-standing Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period occurring at circa 800 B.P.
when Toyah replaced Austin as the prevailing archeological manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the
southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah phase but not during
the preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three
sub-periods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous
peoples had virtually disappeared. The early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began
in the late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Bell County is
situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the
16th Century (Newcomb 1986).

12

By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the Comanche and Wichita and
were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They have been described as
typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers and who lived along the
streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this group have not been found in an
historic context in Bell County. During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous
aboriginal groups including the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache
(Newcomb 1986). Trade is known to have existed between the Jumanos and the
Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the Comanches entered the region from
the Plains while following key animal resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact
period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of glass beads, gun parts, gun
flints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. The archival search
did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell County; however, Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) member Bob Burleson (1995:6) reports finding a metal arrow point cut from
a barrel strap in fresh gravels placed on the road to his farm. In adjacent Coryell County,
a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the
Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find
on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who settled
along Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836,
reoccupied, and deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The early
settlements were constantly harassed by hostile Indians and, although several forts were
established, by 1838 all settlers had left the county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians
suffered a decisive defeat at what is referred to as the "Famous Bird Creek Fight" about
one and a half miles northwest of the present site of Temple, Texas. However, settlement
did not return to the Bell County area until after 1843.
Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell.
Nolan Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December
16, 1851 the name was changed to Belton. Early settlement was along the creeks and
rivers. William Pepper and his family were living on the west side of present-day Kegley
Road when the 1850 census was taken. The Kegleys, Carpenters, and others settled
near Pepper Creek during the 1850s, and some members of these early families are
buried at Eulogy Cemetery. Early histories of Bell County refer frequently to the
Shallowford Crossing on the Leon River as an important transportation route for wagon
traffic. The exact location of this crossing has not been identified, but it substantiates the
importance of this part of Bell County during its early settlement. By 1860, most of the
land had been taken. The last serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian
problem apparently resolved, settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in
1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to 20,518 in 1880. The number of farms in the county
increased from 640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871, and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly
an agricultural region with cotton and corn the leading crops. The construction of Fort
Hood led to a population increase in the county from 44,863 in 1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical Overview
(Biesaart et al. 1985:111), there were 197 sites recorded at TARL in 1985 when this study
was published by the Office of the State Archeologist. At this time, Bell County was third
in the North Central Texas region, and the 197 sites represented 7.35% of the region and
.97% of the state. The archaeological significance of this area is further indicated by the
fact that 61 of the 197 sites recorded in 1985 were registered as State Archeological
Landmarks. This figure represents 30.96% of all sites in Bell County.
Since 1985, however, the number of recorded sites has greatly increased; 1083
sites were on file at TARL as of April 17, 1997 (Carolyn Spock, personal communication).
Although sites have been recorded by private contract archaeology firms, local
archaeological societies, and interested individuals, this increase in the number of sites in
the county is mainly due to large-scale federal projects such as Lake Belton, Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir, and Fort Hood.
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and Bell
County Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These include articles in
the form of bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at
TARL or with society members. Bell County has been the subject of intensive
investigations by members of the Central Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the
above-mentioned investigations, "Bell County is one of the better known Central Texas
counties and has provided significant information toward the understanding of prehistoric
chronologies in this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners
and artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Bell
County. Also present are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not
provide information concerning author and date of preparation. Information regarding
previous work in other parts of Bell County appear in the various references cited above,
especially the Fort Hood series.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the project
area. Recent surveys by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore et al. 1996a, 1996b;
Moore and Bradle 1996) recorded 8 prehistoric and historic sites on Pepper Creek, 2 sites
(1 prehistoric and 1 historic) on Fryers Creek, and 1 site containing prehistoric and historic
materials on an unnamed triburary that flows into Bird Creek. Three of these sites
(41BL1066, 41BL1069, 41BL1070) have been subjected to Phase II testing (Bradle et al.
1997).
The first sites (41BL122 - 41BL126) identified on Pepper Creek in the vicinity of the
project area were recorded by Burleson (1995). He assigned temporary numbers (PC1 PC5) to the five sites; however, the official TARL numbers do not follow this sequence
(e.g., PC1 = 41BL124; PC2 = 41BL125; PC3 = 41BL126; PC4 = 41BL123; and PC5 =
41BL122).

14

Mr. Burleson makes no reference on the site form as to when and how often he
visited the sites, but the site form is dated 1966. The five sites were found on both sides
of Pepper Creek, and are approximately 3500 meters southwest of the project area. The
data for all five sites are on a single page site form with an attached page of artifact
descriptions and sketch map. According to the site form, the sentence in the "Remarks"
section suggests that Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts were found at each site. All of
the artifacts are in his private collection. Although the site form does not mention the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites by number, the page of artifact descriptions makes it
possible to associate artifacts with two sites (41BL124 and 41BL125). According to
Burleson, site 41BL125 contained an incised pottery sherd, a serrated flake, a possible
boatstone, and a Perdiz arrow point. Based on observations by Mr. Burleson, the
heaviest concentrations of lithics and ceramics were at site 41BL125 (Carol Kehl,
personal communication, July 17, 1996).
Directly across the creek, at site 41BL124, Mr. Burleson collected a Scallorn arrow
point. These are the only artifacts that can be identified by site using his site form. In
addition to these specimens, he found manos, hammerstones, a perforated shell
fragment classified by him as a sea shell pendant, an incised stone, large and small
knives, gravers, spokeshaves, end scrapers, scrapers, and dart points which he typed as
Castroville, Darl, Ensor, and Yarbrough.
An archeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and
treatment improvement in 1982 and 1984 by the Texas Department of Water Resources
(Fox and Whitsett 1984) recorded eight prehistoric sites prehistoric sites (41BL259 41BL264 and 41BL278 - 41BL279). According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some
site-specific investigations have been done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but
as yet detailed archeological investigations have not been conducted in the
Temple-Belton area." Except for testing at 41BL260 by Wayne C. Young (1987) of the
Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, Highway Design
Division (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1987, and the three tested sites
mentioned above, no additional site-specific investigations were identified during the
literature search for this project.
TAS member Carol Kehl investigated previously recorded sites along Pepper
Creek. Her effort resulted in a thesis and an M.S. degree in Environmental Studies at
Baylor University (Kehl 1987). Ms. Kehl visited sites 41BL122 - 41BL126 in 1986 with
Bob Burleson, the original recorder. She also obtained radiocarbon dates from three
samples from 41BL125 with funding from the Donors Fund provided by the Texas
Archeological Society. The samples, analyzed by the Radiocarbon Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin, were taken from charcoal stained soil (X-number 6440),
charcoal-stained soil from a mussel shell hearth (X-number 6441), and charcoal stained
soil from a rock-lined hearth (X-number 6442). The dates are 3510 Â± 150 B.P. (6440),
3500Â±80 B.P. (6441), and 3740Â±160 B.P. (6442), respectively.

Ms. Kehl, on her own time, also monitored construction at 41BL180, a site on a
tributary of Pepper Creek that had been tested by the Texas A&M University
Anthropology Club in 1977. Her work was not related to the current project. Site
41BL180 (the Childers site [Childress site on the site form]) is described on the site form
as an open campsite containing Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. The
monitoring recovered additional artifacts, including a Brazos Fishtail point; thus, possibly
extending the date of this site to the Paleoindian period. At this time, not one of the site
forms for any of the previously recorded sites along Pepper Creek, including 41BL180,
have been updated. Documentation of her work in the form of her thesis, field notes, and
some artifacts remain in her possession.
Bell County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks.
However, certain sections of the county have not been adequately investigated. The
current project area falls within this category. There is reason to believe that a large
number of unrecorded sites exist along the major streams of this area in the form of
surface sites, possible rockshelter sites, and buried sites. The reader is advised to
consult the Fort Hood series and other sources mentioned above for more specific
investigations in other parts of the county.

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas were checked for
previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports
documenting work in the region were examined for information concerning archaeological
surveys and other work relevant to the project area. The project was discussed with
representatives of the City of Temple and Roming-Parker Associates, L.L.P. to ensure
that the field crew was aware of the correct route of the proposed sewer line.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was excellent over much of
the project area, especially in the area of site 41BL1084 where the entire sewer line
easement was in a cultivated field. In addition to shovel testing and backhoe trenching,
the ground surface was carefully examined for evidence of prehistoric and historic sites.
Twelve shovel tests (ST) were excavated along the proposed sewer route, and two
backhoe trenches (BT) were dug in the site area (Figure 2). Eight shovel tests (ST 1 - ST
8) were dug between Kegley Road and Traverse Point 5001. An additional four shovel
tests (ST 9 - ST 12) were dug between Traverse Point 5001 and a transmission line that
crosses the project area in a northeast-southwest direction. All matrix was screened
using one-quarter inch hardware cloth. Site 41BL1084 was examined by a careful
surface inspection for diagnostic artifacts, shovel testing, and two backhoe trenches.
Prehistoric artifacts were found to extend beyond the boundaries of the 70 foot easement
(temporary and permanent), and a brief reconnaissance indicated the north-south
boundaries of the site may be 150 and 100 meters, respectively, beyond the propose
sewer easement. No prehistoric artifacts were collected, and no cultural materials were
found in any of the shovel tests.
That part of the historic component in the project area was examined by identifying
artifacts visible in the plowed field. The field crew briefly looked at the main portion of the
historic site to confirm that this was a house site. No shovel tests were excavated in this
area and no artifacts were collected.
Site 41BL1084 was plotted on the topographic quadrangle and project area map
provided by the client. Information regarding the house site was obtained through an oral
interview with Melvin Lange, administrator of the property, and Carol Kehl who has
conducted historic research of the area. The field survey was conducted by the Project
Archaeologist. The Principal Investigator visited the project area with Mr. Bradle, who
showed him the area examined and, together, they recorded the site.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Background Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the current
project area; however, one site (411066) is less than 200 meters to the east. In Bell
County, however, 1083 prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded prior to this
project (Carolyn Spock, personal communication, April 17, 1997). Large-scale federal
projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort Hood have recorded the
vast majority of sites in the county (see Culture Sequence and Previous Investigations
above). Recent projects by Brazos Valley Research Associates and American
Archaeology Group have provided the majority of new data regarding prehistoric and
historic utilization of Pepper Creek (see Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey identified and recorded one previously unrecorded
multi-component site containing prehistoric and historic materials; It has been recorded at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory as 41BL1084. This site was identified on
the basis of lithics, burned rock, and historic trash on the surface of a plowed field that
was in the early stages of corn cultivation. The main concentration of prehistoric artifacts
and all of the historic artifacts were found between traverse points 5000 and 5001, a
distance of 670 feet (approximately 480 meters) between the 550 and 560 foot contours
(Figure 2). The prehistoric component is large and appears to extend at least 480 meters
along the proposed sewer route, 100 meters south of the centerline, and at least 150
meters north of the centerline. The site boundary as depicted in Figure 2 is approximate
except for the east-west dimension that was confirmed during the field survey. Except for
a brief reconnaissance of the site area to the south, no attempt was made to define the
exact limits of the prehistoric component outside of the proposed easement. It is possible
that the prehistoric component at 41BL1084 extends very close to prehistoric site
41BL1072 recorded during a previous survey by BVRA (Moore et al. 1996a:Figure 3).
The two backhoe trenches were dug to a depth of two meters. Each trench was 36 inches
wide and 6 feet long. The profiles revealed a brown clay loam and a brown/tan clay loam
over tan clay (Figure 5). As stated above, based on the various stages of lithic reduction
evident in the observed artifacts and the presence of burned rock, the prehistoric
component is considered to be a camp. Since no diagnostic artifacts were found, the age
of this component is not known. Conversations with local collectors revealed that this
area has been hunted for years, and it is assumed that many of the formal tools are in
private collections. The shovel tests and backhoe trenches revealed that the cultural
materials are shallow and restricted to a brown clay loam approximately 50 centimeters
deep. These materials have been removed from their primary context through plowing
and today are found scattered over the ground surface. All of the burned rock, for
example, was dispersed, and no obvious concentrations were identified in the project
area. The prehistoric component is considered to lack significant research potential and
is not eligible for listing as a State Archeological Landmark.

18

The historic component within the proposed sewer line easement is very sparse;
only a few pieces of glass and broken crockery were observed. Just outside the eastern
boundaries of the project area (Figure 2) are the remains of an historic farmstead.
According to research conducted by Carol Kehl, Oscar and Ida Trojan moved into the
house in 1941 and were its last occupants. The structure, believed by some to date to the
19th century, has been moved to the Antique Tractor Show in Temple where it has been
restored. The field survey identified the site of the house, a well, and various outbuildings
including a barn. Ms. Kehl believes that this property may be part of the holdings of
William Pepper who was living in the area when the 1850 census was taken. Other early
families that formed the settlement along Pepper Creek in the 1850s were the Kegleys
and Carpenters; some members of these early families are buried at nearby Eulogy
Cemetery. Since the main portion of the historic component of 41BL1084 is outside the
project area, it was not formally recorded or mapped. BVRA believes that the historic
component may contain significant research potential and should be evaluated as part of
any future construction projects that may affect this area.

20

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the Thompson Subdivision Trunk Sewer Project in Bell
County, Texas performed for the City of Temple identified and recorded one
archaeological site (41BL1084). This is a multi-component site that contains prehistoric
and historic materials. The prehistoric component has been disturbed through cultivation
and relic collectors. It is not considered to possess significant research potential.
Therefore, no additional work is warranted and it is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned.
The major portion of the historic component is out of the project area and was not
adequately assessed. The house site is in an area that was settled in the 1850s. It is
believed that the historic component may possess significant research potential. It is
recommended that this site be formally assessed and recorded by a professional
archaeologist prior to any future construction in the area.
