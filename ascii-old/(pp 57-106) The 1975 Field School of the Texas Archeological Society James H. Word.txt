The 1975 Field School
of the Texas Archeological Society
James H. Word
ABSTRACT
The 1975 Field School of the Texas Archeological Society was held at the
Floydada Country Club site (41FL1) in Floyd County. Surface collections and
previous excavations at the site suggested that three differing cultures at the site
were very closely associated geographically and dated from the Late Prehistoric to
Historic periods. The most intensive occupation of the site dates from A.D. 1200
to 1500, when there were trade relationships in Protohistoric to Early Historic
times among three ethnic groups: the Apache, eastern and southern Pueblos, E1
Paso Mogollon, and perhaps a Caddoan-related group. A subsequent occupation
of the site, demonstrated by historic artifacts, dates after the invasion of the
Comanche, who used the site from the mid-1750s until Col. Mackenzie’s successful campaign secured western Texas from the Indians in 1874.

DEDICATION

This report is dedicated to Dorothy (Dot) Word, my deceased wife. She
willingly contributed her time and talents to many Texas Archeological Society
activities. Without her support, concern, and love, the’1975 TAS field school could
not have succeeded. Her death in 1981 was a great loss to me.

INTRODUCTION

In 1954 the author started collecting surface materials, predominantly of Late
Prehistoric and Historic age, from roads and erosional areas adjacent to the White
River at the Floydada Country Club site (41FL1). In the early 1960s, test pits were
excavated in an attempt to determine a sequence of occupation. A report on this
work (Word 1963:37-63) was published by the South Plains Archeological Society.
The large number of artifacts collected from this site prompted the Texas
Archeological Society to hold its annual field school there in 1975. Dr. S. Alan
Skinner, of Southern Methodist University, was the field archeologist; he visited the
site and examined the author’s collection of arrowpoints, scrapers, drills (perforators), bifacial tools, bone artifacts, and shell and bone beads associated with Late
Prehistoric times. Archaic projectile points were few in number, but suggested that
there had been some occupation before Late Prehistoric times. Historic artifacts
consisted of metal projectile points, glass beads, metal awls, gun parts, and early
rifle cartridges of the 1870s.
Because play continued on the golf course (Skinner 1975c), the field school
activity had to be in areas where it would not interfere with the golfers and where
the safety of the field school participants would not be compromised. As a result of
these two factors, the areas searched were limited.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado in 1541 was the first European explorer to
cross the area of which the Floydada Country Club is a part. He made contact with
the Apaches on the Llano Estacado, and with the Teyas--who, according to
Newcomb (1961:99) could have been the Plains Caddo---near the headwaters of the
Brazos River (Newcomb 1961:105). Bolton (1970:2) stated that the Caddo hunted
bison on the western prairie and that the Wichita who were located on the Red River
at Spanish Fort were of Caddoan extraction. The Wichita were allied with the
Comanche in the 1740s ~ewcomb and Field 1967:241) and were trading with the
French for weapons (ibid.:268), which they supplied to the Comanches in exchange
for horses, mules, and Indian captives (Bolton 1970:121).
Vincente de Saldivar Mendoza came into the area in 1599 to hunt bison for fat
and encountered the Apache (Newcomb and Field 1961:105), and Don Juan On ate
explored the Llano Estacado in 1601. However, Onate’s expedition, in the part of
the Canadian River area near the present boundary between Texas and Oklahoma,
went north of the Floydada Country Club area (Bolton 1916:250-255).
Little contact with the Apache is recorded until the early eighteenth century
when in 1702 they began to raid Spanish settlements (Thomas 1935:23-24). The
Comanches, who are a branch of the Shoshones, began an invasion of the Llano
Estacado in 1705 and were in control of much of the area by the mid-1750s,
dominating the area that includes the Floydada Country Club ~homas 1935:57). In
1786, Pedro Vial’s expedition, trying to establish a more direct route from San
Antonio to Santa Fe (Loumis and Nasatir 1967:xvi, 29, 291,313), described what

Wordm1975 TAS Field School

59

is probably the Mont Blanco area on the White River in the extreme northern part
of Crosby County and the southern part of Floyd County.
The Comanche were raiding the early settlements of western Texas and had
established trade with the New Mexican-Spanish traders, who became better known
as Comancheros. During the Civil War the U.S. Army was not a deterrent to this
trade; many of the Texans were soldiers of the Confederacy. Texas cattle and
captives became important trade items with the Comancheros, who traded guns,
knives, cloth, and other items for livestock and captives (Wallace and Hoebel
1942:268).
After the the Civil War ended, the U. S. Army was again active in attempts to
control the Comanches C/gallace 1964: 33-57). In 1871 Colonel Randall S. Mackenzie
was unsuccessful in an attempt to force the Comanche from the Llano Estacado to
the reservation in Oklahoma. He followed the Comanche up the Blanco Canyon, but
a mid-November blizzard thwarted his efforts (Ratgen 1973:199). In 1872 another
effort by Mackenzie to drive the Comancheros from the Llano Estacado and to
eliminate trade with the Comanches was unsuccessful (ibid.:60-76), but in 1874 he
finally defeated the Comanche in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Before the Battle
of Palo Duro Canyon, one of Mackenzie’s forces came up Blanco Canyon and was
met by another of his forces that that had moved northeastward from the present
Slaton area; they met near the Floydada Country Club. Mackenzie’s various forces
met near the junction of the White River and the North Fork of the Brazos River at
Camp Supply in southeastern Crosby County (Ratgen:60-76). The army then
proceeded to its successful encounter at Palo Duro Canyon, which ended the
Comanche occupation of the Llano Estacado and the adjacent Rolling Plains
(ibid.: 128-149).
After the Comanches were driven from the Llano Estacado, the New MexicanSpanish traders, or Comancheros, returned to the area as sheep herders and were
called Pastores. Anglo ranchers eventually moved into the area and displaced the
Pastores, and by 1890 farming was becoming an increasingly important factor;
today agriculture is dominant.
PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS
The author published a report on the Floydada Country Club site in 1963, and
reports have been published on sites with similar characteristics downstream on the
White River. The Montgomery site (Word 1965) is about 11 km (7 miles)
downstream, and a more recent research project on this site was reported by
Northern (1979). Parker (1982) published a report on the Bridwell site about 24 km
(15 miles) further downstream in the northeastern part of Crosby County. In the
southwestern part of Dickens County, about 48 km (30 miles) southeast of the
Bridwell site, is the Pete Creek site, which has been reported by Parsons (1967). The
Floydada Country Club site, Montgomery site, and the Bridwell site are on the
White River drainage, but the Pete Creek site is on the North Fork of the Double
Mountain Fork of the Brazos River, just below its confluence with the White River.

All of these sites have similar artifact assemblages, but eastern Puebloan pottery
decreases southeastward. Locally made and Caddoan-like sherds continue to
dominate, and the percentage of Edwards chert increases.
Among more distant sites with similarities in time of occupation and artifact
assemblages are the Garza site ~unkles 1964) about 100 km (62 miles) to the south,
the Garza occupation at the Lubbock Lake site (Johnson, Holliday, Kaczor, and
Stuckenrath 1977) about 38 km (24 miles) west southwest, and the Lott site
(Runkles and Dorchester 1986).
GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT
The Floydada Country Club site (41FL1) is on the White River Canyon in the
southern part of Floyd County near the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado (Figure

1).
As soon as the Running Water Draw cuts through the Caprock of the Llano
Estacado and forms a canyon, it becomes the White River, the northernmost
tributary of the Brazos River. The Floydada Country Club site, which is bisected by
the White River, is in the first widening of the canyon, on the first terrace above the
river at the western boundary of the Country Club property (Figure 2). Cochran’s
Mesa, to the south of the White River, is the southern boundary of the site, and the
northern boundary of the site is below the Caprock where the land surface slopes
upward; so from north to south the site measures about 250 meters. The canyon
narrows at the northeastern boundary of the Floydada Country Club property and
is the eastern limit of the site; the western limit is the western boundary of the
Country Club property; the site measures about 825 meters from east to west.
The elevation of the site is 3015 feet (920 meters) high, and of the adjacent
Llano Estacado is 3150 feet (960 meters). The average rainfall is 51 cm (20.18
inches), most of which comes in May, June, and September, generally in association
with strong winds and thunderstorms. Most of the winter moisture comes as snow
and sleet in December and January, but the amount is normally insignificant. The
lowest temperature, usually coming in January, averages -4 degrees C. (26 degrees
F.). The warmest month is July, with a mean temperature of 34 degrees C. (94
degrees F.) (Kingston 1986).
The White River was an active stream until 1944, when the lowering of the
underground water table--a result of exploitation of the Ogalalla aquifer for
irrigation purposes---dried up the springs that fed it.
The vegetation on the Floydada Country Club property is an extension of the
Roiling Plains flora. Gould (1969) described the vegetation of the Rolling Plains as
various bluestem, buffalo, and Bermuda grasses. Shinnery oak and sand sage are
common on the Rolling Plains, but they are not dominant at the Country Club site.
Other vegetation commonly found on the Rolling Plains includes hackberry, pecan,
willow, eastern cottonwood, western soapberry, algerita, little sumac, juniper, and
ephedra. Various cacti are common in the grassland; prickly pear is the most
common variety. Forbs are represented by sunflower, buffalo weed, Russian thistle,
cattail, and less common weeds (Gould 1969).

Vegetation on the adjacent part of the Llano Estacado differs considerably
(Gould 1969). Grasses and forbs are similar, but trees and shrubs were practically
nonexistent before the area was settled by early ranchers and farmers. Mesquite was
introduced when cattle were brought into the area in the latter part of the nineteenth
century.

Figure 2. Map of part of Floyd County, showing the relation of the Floydada Country
Club to US 62, the White River, and the Caprock.

The slope of the Caprock and of the White River Canyon is a transitional biotic
zone between the Rolling Plains and the Llano Estacado. The slightly greater
moisture resulting from runoff from the slopes of the canyon nurtt~es a limited flora
not common on the Llano Estacado, such as little leaf sumac,juniper, and infrequent
shinnery oak, algerita, and ephedra. Various species of cactus are common.
The soil at the Floydada Country Club site is of the Berda-Potter Association
(Neitsch and Blackstock 1978); it varies from deep to shallow, gently sloping, and
moderately permeable loams overlying thick beds of caliche. These soils are in
general not suitable for agriculture.
Animal life in aboriginal and early pioneer times consisted of bison, antelope,
coyote, wolf, white-tailed prairie dog, mule deer, raccoon, panther, bobcat, black
bear, black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, striped and hog-nosed skunk, and a
wide variety of small rodents.
Birds common to the area include both permanent residents and migratory
species. The lesser prairie chicken, bobwhite, scaled quail, killdeer, mourning dove,
roadrunner, blue jay, various owls, red-shafted flicker, cactus wren, mockingbird,

cardinal, and western meadowlark are native to the area. Vultures and some species
of hawks live there the year around, and various ducks, geese, plovers, flycatchers,
scissortails, and robins are the most common migrants.
Snakes are the most common reptiles; bullsnakes, puff adders, and rattlesnakes
are found throughout the area. Horned lizards and tortoises are common in both the
Rolling Plains and on the Llano Estacado. The habitat of the collared lizard
(mountain boomer) is confined to the crevices of the Caprock.
Amphibians are generally confined to the Rolling Plains environment, but in
excessively wet years toads are common on the Llano Estacado in association with
playa lakes.
AREAS OF THE SITE
Analysis of collections, consisting of lithics, potsherds, bone, and historic
artifacts from the Floydada Country Club site suggested that the site was in fact three
very closely associated sites, so the Field School Archeologist, S. Alan Skinner,
divided the site into three areas (Figure 3) for testing (Skinner 1975a).
Area 1 (41FL 1 - 1 ) is centrally located. The dom inant pottery type represented
by the sherds recovered by the author from surface collecting and four test pits
(Word 1963) is eastem Puebloan; the dominant lithic material is Edwards chert from
the Edwards Limestone (Lower Cretaceous). Area 2 (41FL1-2), about 100 meters
from Area 1, is across the White River. Here, southwestern sherds from the E1 Paso
and southeastem New Mexico areas dominate. At Area 3 (41FL1-3), about 250
meters east of Area 1, the principle types, represented by locally made pottery, are
Caddoan and imitation Caddoan wares, and most of the lithic debris is of Tecovas
jasper (Tecovas Formation, Dockum Group, Upper Triassic; Holiday and Welty
1981).
RESEARCH DESIGN
It was hoped that dividing the site into these three areas would make it possible
to determine what happened in the past. It appeared from the author’s collections
that occupation of all three areas was contemporaneous, in the Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods, and it was hoped that the excavations would also reveal evidence
of Archaic and Paleoindian occupations.
The major goal of testing the three areas (41FL 1-1,41FL 1-2, 41FL1-3) was to
gather data to determine how the site was used and how the three areas related to
each other (Skinner 1975a). More specifically, the research program of the field
school was designed to test four hypotheses.
The first hypothesis was that the area had been intensively occupied from
Paleoindian through the Historic periods. The second hypothesis was that, in the
intensive occupation between A.D. 1200 and 1500 by indigenous groups, there was
close trade with eastern and southwestern New Mexico and with the Antelope focus
to the north, that there were ties to Caddoan areas to the east as well, and that the site
was a rendezvous area.

The third hypothesis was that immigrant groups from the southeastern and
eastern Puebloans were coming into the area for bison hunting and meat preparation.
The fourth hypothesis was that Historic Indian occupation of the site was of
short term by late (perhaps Protohistoric) Apachean groups or by the succeeding
Comanches, who dominated this area from early historic times until the aboriginal
occupation was terminated by the Mackenzie campaign of 1874.

PROCEDURES AND RESULTS
Area 1 (41FLl-1)
Before work was started in Area 1, a nail was driven into a mesquite tree; all
elevations were recorded from this datum point (Figure 4). An east-west base line
was established from the datum point, and locations of all units were related to the
base line. Stakes were sunk at 1-meter intervals to form the site grid, and line levels
were used to determine depths. Eighty 1-meter units were laid out in case there

66

Texas Archeological Society

should be sufficient time to test them, but only 52 1-by- 1-meter units ere excavated.
When features were discovered, partial units were opened around them to expose
as much of the features as time allowed. This resulted in excavation of three partial
units. The units, numbered from the grid readings at their southwest comers, were
excavated to a depth of 60 cm in 20-cm levels. Unit 26 was excavated to a depth of
100 cm to determine the depth of occupation.

Soil Description
No features were recorded from Unit 26, but, since it was tested to a depth of

100 cm (Figure 5), the soils encountered are described in the field notes.
Level 1 (0-20 cm)
The soil is dark brown and very compact. The surface was covered with native
grasses and the roots extended through Level 1. The soil consists of a sandy loam
of very fine texture. Specks of charcoal are common from the surface down to 20
cm.

Level 2 (20-40 era)
The soil continues to be dark brown, sandy loam compact in consistency. Grass

roots continue to a depth of 23-25 cm. Specks of charcoal were recorded as in Level
1.
Level 3 (40-60 cm)
The soil is compact and gradually becomes less dark brown. Charcoal flecks
am less common.
Level 4 (60-80 cm)
The soil contains charcoal specks, but in diminishing frequency. Small,
rounded nodules of caliche appear at about 70 cm. The lighter brown soil continues
to be fine grained and very compact.
Level 5 (80-100 cm)
The soil becomes light brown or tan and continues to be very compact. No
charcoal specks were recorded, and the occurrence of small nodules of caliche
increases.
It is evident that no stratification is present. The density of charcoal gradually
diminishes with depth, small caliche pebbles appear in the lower depths and
increase in frequency with depth, and there is a gradual change in soil color from
dark brown to light brown to tan from the surface to the 100-cm depth. There was
very little moisture in the soil and, when it was dry, its color changed to a very light
gray-brown. The soil is very compact from the surface to the 100-cm depth and is
very fine in texture. Small nodules of caliche, which appear at about 70 cm and
increase in frequency down to the 100-cm level, are the result of percolation of
moisture containing calcium and magnesium, a common occurrence in the South
Plains area.

Area 1-Historic Cultural Materials (Historic Artifacts)
Both glass and metal artifacts were recovered in Area 1, indicating both very
recent and historic use of the site.

68

Texas Archeological Society

Glass
The most common historic artifacts recovered were of glass, well distributed
over the site. All but two of the specimens were badly fragmented.
Type 1
All Type 1 specimens were badly fragmented, patinated, and of a lightly tinted
green color. Seventeen small fragments were recovered, but the vessel types cannot
be determined. All came from Level 1 (0-20 cm) except for one from Level 2 (20-40
cm).

Type 2
A very small (3 by 4 mm) fragment of brown glass, probably from a beer bottle,
was recovered from Level 1.
Type 3
Two small unidentifiable fragments of clear glass were recovered from Level
1.
Type 4
Seven green-tinted unpatinated glass fragments recovered from the surface and
Level 1 vary from 6 mm to 5 mm in thickness and have slightly oval lengthwise
ridges; the largest specimen (37 by 31 mm) is slightly convex on the outer surface,
reminiscent of a Coca Cola bottle.
Type 5
Two examples of clear glass were recovered from level 1. The largest fragment
(Figure 6, A) is 81 mm long and 50 mm thick, apparently the center of a large
container. The interior is slightly convex, and the exterior is flat. In the center of this
specimen is an a in a circle 16 mm in diameter. Along the edge of the base of this
triangular fragment is what appears to be a 5, followed on the right by a 1, a short
dash, and an E. The trademark is 51-E. The smaller specimen has no identifying
marks, but it appears to be from the same vessel; it is curved--probably part of the
vessel body near the bottom.
Glass Bead
A single large, sky blue, opaque, round necklace bead of simple construction
was recovered from Unit 23 in Level No. 1 (Figure 6, B). It measures 8 mm in
diameter. Harris and Harris (1967:153) state that this type usually has a ridge around
the circumference suggesting pressed construction. This specimen does not have
the ridge, but it has all the other characteristics of the Harris and Harris Bead Type
159.
Metal
Six metal objects were recovered, all from Level 1 (0-20 cm).
Type 1
A fragment of badly rusted sheet metal is probably from a tin can, since it is .05
mm thick and measures 20 by 15 mm. There is no indication that it was cut from the
original object, since the edges are irregular.

Texas Archeological Society

Type 2
This specimen is 1 mm thick, 23 mm long and 12 mm wide at the widest part.
One edge has coarse file marks, and another edge appears to have been cut (Figure
6, C). It cannot be identified, but it may be a scrap from making a projectile point.
Type 3
A fragment of a horseshoe nail, broken at the distal end, 28 mm long (Figure
6, D).

Type 4
A tubular metal tinkler contained a glass bead in the narrow part (Figure 6, E).
Jay C. Blaine (personal communication, June 14, 1975) stated that it was a common
practice--in order to prevent loss of the tinkler--to string a sinew with a bead at the
end through the narrow or distal opening. The sinew was then attached with the
tinkler to the garment. The tinkler was made from a thin iron strip which was
possibly from a metal can. It is conical, 23.5 mm long, 7 mm wide at the proximal
end, and 3 mm wide at the distal end.
Type 5
A .22 caliber rimfire short cartridge case was found. The base has an H
trademark (Figure 6, F). The time of its use can not be determined. The H was first
put on the heads of cartridges in the early 1870s and has continued into recent times
(Wilson, personal communication, January 23, 1987).
Type 6
A hand-forged iron artifact (Figure 6, G) has the proximal end rounded on one
side, forming a blunt end. The distal end was split along the forged union of the two
pieces comprising the shaft and curled outward on the proximal end. There is no
evidence of pounding to separate the forged parts. Faint evidence of screw threads
can be discerned near the proximal end just above the rounded part. Apparently two
pieces of iron 106 mm long were forged to form a flat unit. The distal end was then
separated along the seam and curled outward. The unseparated parts were originally
54 mm thick. The edge with the screw threads is slightly battered. The author was
unable to find a similar object reported, but it was examined by Jay C. Blaine
(written communication, February 7, 1987), who suggested that it might be a pin
to join an ox bow to the yoke. Examination ofox bows and yokes at the Texas Tech
Museum in Lubbock and the Panhandle Plains Museum in Canyon appears to

support Blaine’s opinion.
Area I-Prehistoric Cultural Materials
Lithics
Dart Points
One of two basal fragments of dart points of Edwards chert (Figure 7, A), was
recovered from the surface, and one (Figure 7, B) came from Level 1. They are
corner notched with slightly expanding stems; the bases are slightly rounded and
resemble the Palmiltas point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:229-230).

Arrowpoints
Two complete arrowpoints and two basal fragments were recovered; one from
the surface, two from Level 1, and one from either Level 1 or 2 (the field notes are
not precise as to location).

72

Texas Archeological Society

Type 1.--A complete Fresno point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:273-274) from either
Level 1 or 2 is of Tecovas jasper, with convex sides, 25 mm long and 14 mm wide
at the base (Figure 7, C). It is crudely made and could be a preform. Two basal
fragments of Edwards chert with slightly concave bases were recovered from Level
2.
Type 2.--A Cuney point of Edwards chert (Suhm and Jelks 1962:271-273)
from Level 1 (Figure 7, D) is well barbed from the comer of the slightly bifurcated
base. It is about 22 mm long, and 12 mm wide at the barbs; the edges of the blade
are straight. It does not correspond exactly to the illustrations and description of the
Cuney point as defined by Suhm and Jelks, but there is a strong similarity in
characteristics other than the basal notch.
Bifaces
One complete biface of Tecovas jasper, probably a preform (Figure 7, E), from
either Level 1 or 2 is 62 mm long and 24 mm wide. There are also six midsections
of bifaces and the distal end of a biface that could be the end of a dart point. None
have evidence of bevelling, but they could be midsection knives. One fragment is
an off-white Alibates agate from the Alibates Dolomite (upper part of the Quartermaster Formation, Permian; Holliday and Welty 1981), and the other six are of
Edwards chert.
Scrapers
Four scrapers, two of Edwards chert and two of Tecovas jasper.
Type 1.--This specimen, found on the surface, is a fragment of a side scraper
that was converted into a combination tool, 48 mm long and 24 mm wide. A small
spokeshave 6 mm wide and 2 mm deep was formed on the edge of the scraper, and
a graver was formed from the fractured part, the fracture being used to form the beak
of the graver (Figure 7, F).
Type 2:-- The other three scrapers are end scrapers. The smallest, 25 mm long
and 18 mm wide, was made from Tecovas jasper (Figure 7, G). The other two are
more typical of the type since they match the usual size of this artifact. One is of
Tecovas jasper, measuring 37 mm by 30 mm, and the third scraper, 39 mm long and
26 mm wide, is of Edwards chert (Figure.7, H). Two were recovered from Level 1,
and the third was found in Level 2.
Spokeshave
A single white quartzite spokeshave was recovered from Level 1 (Figure 8, A).
The notch is 8 mm wide and 4 mm deep.

Drills
Two drills or perforators of Edwards chert were recovered from Level 1; one,
a fragment and the other, a complete specimen (Figure 8, B and C). The bit of each
specimen is well worked on both surfaces. The complete specimen is 22 mm long;
the proximal end, or base, is convex and only 8 mm long, not altered from the
original flake.
Pigment
A small (12 mm) piece of malachite was recovered from Level 1. The surface
is irregular and lumpy, and there is no evidence of smoothing.

Abraded Stone
Three fragments of abrading artifacts were recovered.
Type 1.--Two fragments of manos were recovered from Level 1. One is of a
relatively coarse, dark tan sandstone (Figure 8, D) and has a slightly convex
abrading surface. The second specimen is of very light red or dark pink quartz with

74

a convex surface. The manner in which it was fractured suggests that it may have
been used as a boiling stone (Figure 8, E).
Type 2.--The third fragment was also recovered from Level 1. It is off-white
and is of very fine grained limestone with fine sand inclusions. Its slightly concave
surface suggests that it was a metate (Figure 8, F).
Lithic Debris
Only 4 of 52 units were excavated below Level 2 (20-40 cm), so these four units
are not included in the analysis of lithic debris to determine the density of
occupation. In all, 1,120 lithic flakes and chips were analyzed.
Level I (0-20 cm).--The total of lithic debris from Level 1 was 874 specimens.
Edwards chert totaled 485 specimens (55.52 percent), Alibates agate totaled 55
specimens (6.21 percent), and Tecovas jasper was represented by 169 flakes and
chips (19.31 percent). Obsidian totaled 14 specimens (1.61 percent). Quartz,
available just to the east of the site where the Ogalalla gravels are exposed, accounts
for 14 specimens (1.61 percent). Local materials from the limestone exposures in
the face of the nearby Caprock account for 101 specimens (11.60 percent of the
total), and a lithic material whose source is unknown is called Other, for a total of
36 (4.13 percent).
Level 2 (20-40 cm) .~The sum of all lithic debris for Level 2 was 247.
Edwards chert was the dominant material with 134 specimens (54.36 percent).
Alibates agate continued to be a minor lithic source with 17 specimens (6.25
percent). Tecovas jasper was represented by 50 specimens (20.48 percent). Three
obsidian flakes and chips (1.08 percent) and four specimens of quartz debris were
recovered (1.75 percent). Local material was the third most common lithic material
utilized, accounting for 30 specimens (12.20 percent), and Other material accounted for 9 specimens (3.78 percent).

Bone and Shell

Awl
The distal fragment of a bone awl was recovered in Level 1 (Figure 9, A). It
was formed from a segment of a large bone, is subrectangular in cross section (at
the extreme distal part it is triangular in cross section), and 22 mm long. Wear is
visible along the entire length of the fragment, and the inner (calcareous) surface has
been worn or removed by use.
Butchering Marks and Alteration by Percussion
Type 1. Four fragments of ribs with transverse cut marks (Figure 9, B, C) were
recovered from Level 1
Type 2.--This type has evidence of battering or percussion (Figure 9, D). Level
1 produced five specimens. A single rib altered by percussion and three battered
phalanxes were recovered from Level 1, and a battered phalanx and vertebra were
recovered from Level 2.
Faunal Remains
One hundred ten animal bones were recovered in Area 1. Of this total, 99 were
bison (Speer 1976:1-3), and Schultz (n.d.) identified four antelope or deer
metapodials, four bird bones, and three snake bones. No information as to level
number was provided in Schultz’s analysis of the animals smaller than bison.
Seventy-five identifiable and fragmentary bison bones were recovered from
Level 1 (Speer 1976). Lower foot bones consisting of phalanxes, tarsals, metacarpals, carpels, and sesamoids accounted for 41 specimens (54.67 percent). Upper
limb bones consisting of femurs, tibiae, and fragments of sufficient size for
identification as limb bones totaled 9 specimens (12 percent). There were six ribs
(8 percent), fragments of three mandibles (4 percent), 6 vertebra fragments (8
percent), 6 teeth and molars (8 percent), and 3 (4 percent) fragments too small to be
identified but probably from bison.
Eighteen specimens were recovered from Level 2:9 lower foot bones (50
percent), consisting of phalanxes, tarsals, metacarpals, carpels, and sesamoids, a
single tibia and radius (11.11 percent), a fragment of a cranium (5.56 percent),
vertebrae (11.11 percent), two teeth (11.11 percent), and two fragments too small
to be identified but probably from bison (11.11 percent).
Only six specimens came from Level 3: two phalanxes (33.33 percent), a
fragment of a femur (16.16 percent), and a fragment of a limb bone, a fragmentary
vertebra, and a fragment too small to be identified (16.67 percent each).
Shell Bead
One round, flat shell bead was recovered from Level 1 (Figure 9, E). It is 5 mm
in diameter and 1 mm thick. The perforation for stringing, which is 1 mm in
diameter, does not have the typical cone shape characteristic of beads of this type
that are drilled with a lithic drill, so a historic metal drill probably was used to make
the perforation.

Pottery
Seventy prehistoric sherds were recovered from Area 1. Of this total 43 were
described as Local Wares by Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) based on clay samples from
nearby sources provided by the author. Six sherds probably originated in eastern and
central New Mexico, and 25 are possibly of Caddoan origin. A single sherd of
Jornado Mogollon Brown was recovered, and four specimens are of Pecos Glaze II
or III. Runyon and Hedrick classified all of the sherds.
Type 1 (Local Variety)
This group was the most numerous, with 29 specimens. The tan to orange-buff
to gray sherds are of coiled construction. The paste is fine and slightly porous, with
moderate density, the surface is smooth and floated, and the core is sharply defined
by a light gray central streak. The temper, which accounts for 30 to 35 percent of
the sherd mass, is 80 percent very fine, clear quartz, 15 percent small tan clay balls,
and 5 percent white dolomite. The vessels are small bowls and jars, with rounded
rims; this type accounts for 36.71 percent of the total sherds recovered.
Runyon and Hedrick’s description of Type 1 (Local Variety) resembles the
Little Deer sherd type as described by Parker from the Bridwell site (1982:58-59)
and by Baugh from the Edwards I site (1982:75-81).
Type 2 (Local Variety)
This type was represented by 14 specimens (17.72 percent of the total
recovered sherds). Thirty percent of the sherds have temper consisting of 70 percent
very fine quartz and 30 percent crushed limestone. The sherds are dark gray with
fine-to-medium porous paste and gray cores with no streaking. The method of
construction of the vessels (small jars and bowls) could not be determined. No rim
sherds were recovered.
Type 3 (Eastern and Central New Mexico)
Type 3 vessels are of coiled construction and are represented by six sherds (7.60
percent of the total). The exteriors are dark gray, corrugated, and slipped with a
carbon wash. The interiors are smooth but not carbon slipped. Temper comprises
30 percent of the sherd mass, of which 60 percent is white to brownish feldspar of
very fine texture. Colorless subrounded quartz comprises 30 percent of the tempering material, and golden mica flakes make up the remainder of the tempering
material. The origin of these sherds was probably eastern and central New Mexico.
Type 4 (Caddoan)
The second most common sherd type is represented by 25 percent of the
specimens (31.65 percent of the total). It was not possible to determine the vessel
types due to the small size of the sherds. They are of coiled construction, tan to light
gray, and have gray-to-black cores with well-defined central streaks. The surfaces
are smoothed and semifloated. The temper makes up 30 percent of the sherd mass;
it consists of very fine, colorless, subrounded sand (90 percent) and white crushed
shell (10 percent). The sherds are weathered from leaching of the shell temper.
Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) postulated that the source of this variety is Caddoan
because of the shell temper and the similarity to Caddoan utility wares.

78

Texas Archeological Society

Type 5 (Jornado Mogollon Brown)
Jornado Mogollon Brown is represented by a single sherd (1.27 percent of the
sherds recovered) (Mera 1943; Runyan and Hedrick n.d.; Lehmer 1948; Jelinek
1967), of coiled construction from an undecorated tan-to-gray bowl with a tan,
slightly porous core. The sherd is 40 percent temper, of which 60 percent is white
feldspar of very f’me quality and white in color, made angular from crushing. Very
fine clear-to-opaque quartz comprises 30 percent of the temper; 10 percent is golden
platy mica.
Type 6 (Pecos Glaze H or lll)
Pecos Glaze II or III (Kidder and Sheppard 1936) is represented by four tan-tolight red sherds (5.06 percent of the sherds recovered). Surface decoration is a
glazed, black design 30 mm below the rim. The paste is fine to medium and slightly
porous. The core is tan with no streaks; it is the same color from the surface to the
interior of the sherd. The clay is from the Rio Grande basin. Thirty percent of the
sherd is the temper, 60 percent of which is very fine white feldspar and 40 percent
of which is very fine black, angular hornblende. There is very slight evidence of
magnetite.
The author reported (Word 1963:56-57) that other western varieties were
recovered from Area 1; Pecos Glaze wares and MogoUon types were recovered in
the western part and local varieties and Caddoan sherds were more dense in the
eastern part of this area.
Features
Five hearths were exposed. However, due to shortage of time, none were
completely excavated, but estimates of size based on extending the curvature of the
exposed edges of the feature indicate that the hearths varied in diameter from about
.5 to 1.35 meters and were bowl shaped in cross section. The basins of the hearths
were lined with limestone from the nearby Caprock escarpment. Reuse of the
hearths was evident, for in one instance a hearth had been cleaned out and reused
0~igure 10). The original hearth had a light charcoal stain, and some of the hearth
stones had been discarded. No lining of hearth stones had been added when the
hearth was reused.
One hearth has been used as a trash pit; in it were 35 pieces of lithic debris, only
one of which had been fire fractured. Other cultural material in the hearth included
11 bone fragments, only one of which was burned,a graver, a utilized flake, a single
fragment of a bifacial tool, and a basal fragment of a triangular point similar to a
Fresno point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:273-274). It is evident from these artifacts that
the hearth had two episodes of use.
Area 2 (41FL1-2)
Area 2 is about 100 meters south of Area 1, on the south bank of the White
River. It is on the east side of the Floydada Country Club’s No. 7 fairway and just
south of the No. 7 green.
In order to establish a base line for testing, an arbitrary north was established
at 45 degrees west of true north; the baseline parallels the White River.

Figure 10. Cross section of reused hearth, Units 45 and 46, Area 1.

Nineteen randomly located 1-meter squares were excavated in Test Area 1 to
determine whether the occupation varied over the area (Figure 11). Eleven 1-meter
units in Test Area 1 were excavated to 40 cm depth, two were excavated to 50 cm,
and six, to 60 cm. The author (Word 1963:46) made a test in the extreme eastem
part of the area and found there a concentration of bison bones that were exposed
in the bank of a borrow pit, so 12 more 1-meter squares were sunk in this part of the
site (Test Area 2) to investigate the possibility of more bone concentration and to
determine whether different periods of occupation were separated stratigraphically
(Figure 11). Four units "stair-stepped" down the slope of the borrow pit were
excavated to a depth of 40 cm. Just to the east, another test of five stair-stepped units
was excavated to a depth of 40 cm, and three units to the east of the previous test also
were excavated to 40 cm.
In general, in the main part of the site (except for the stair-stepped tests) there
was no evidence of any sudden soil change; the soil changed gradually from light
reddish brown to light brown. The soil contained fine particles of charcoal, lithic
debris, fragmented bone scraps, and an occasional hearthstone, but the soil was
generally homogeneous in texture. Rodent burrows and nests, and insect burrows
containing deposits of seeds were common. The soil had a high percentage of windblown sand mixed with clay; when it was dry, it became very hard, compact, and
difficult to trowel.
In Test Area 2, light brown, sandy clay extended to the depth of the stairstepped excavation. Because Area 2 is from 1 to 2 meters lower, it is subject to
flooding, which is probably the cause for its consistency of soil color and texture.
The soil contained lithics, sherds, and fragmented faunal remains, but, since this
area is subject to flooding, no rodent burrows.

Area 2-Cultural Materials
Historic Artifacts
Nine historic artifacts were recovered, two of which were on the surface and
were obviously associated with Floydada Country Club golfing activities. One is an
aluminum pop top device used to open a beverage can; the second is a wooden golf
tee.

Glass and Ceramics
Type 1.--Two small fragments of brown bottle glass were recovered, one of
which has small round raised dots. It is slightly concave and is probably a basal
fragment.The circular dots are 1.5 mm in diameter, spaced 1.5 mm apart. This
fragment is 13 mm long, 11 mm wide, and 5 mm thick. The second fragment of glass
is 15 mm long, 8 mm wide, and 1.5 mm thick. Both were recovered from the surface
and were probably fragments of beer bottles.

Wordw1975 TAS Field School

81

Type 2.--Five sherds of white crockery were recovered, all from the surface.
Four were recovered from Unit 8 and fit together to form what appears to be part of
the base of a large vessel, since they are flat and have potter’s wheel impressions.
These sherds are white on both the inner and outer surfaces and are 8 mm thick, with
highly glazed outer surfaces and not as heavily glazed inner surfaces. The paste is
very fine grained white clay; occasional small air pockets exposed on the surface do
not exceed 1 mm in diameter.
The fifth sherd, recovered from Unit 33, which is 21 meters to the east in Area
2, Test Area 2, is similar to the previously described crockery sherds. Both the inner
and outer surfaces are highly glazed and slightly curved, suggesting that it was a
body fragment of a large crockery vessel. It is 6 mm thick. In spite of the significant
distance separating the fifth sherd from the others, all five sherds are believed to be
from the same vessel.
Unfortunately, because the sherds have no trademarks or decoration, it is
impossible to identify the manufacturer or to determine the approximate date of
manufacture. Crockery of this type has been made since the nineteenth century and
is still being produced.
Lithics
Arrowpoints
Three projectile points and 10 fragments of projectile points were recovered.
Type 1. Two Fresno arrowpoints were recovered (Suhm and Jelks
1962:273-274). One of the points, from Level 1 (0-20 cm), is of light gray Edwards
chert and has a broken basal comer (Figure 12, A). It is 26 mm long, and the width
at the slightly concave base is estimated to have been 14 mm. The second specimen,
made of Tecovas jasper (Figure 12, B), was recovered from Level 2 (20-40 cm). It
is a complete specimen, 14 mm long and 11 mm wide at the base. The sides are
convex and the base is concave. It is probably reshaping of the distal end that
accounts for its short length.
Type 2.--A single fragmented projectile point of Tecovas jasper recovered
from Level 1 is either a Harrell (Bell 1958:30) or a Washita arrowpoint (ibid.:99).
The basal part has been broken off just below the side notches, and the distal end is
broken off; the original length is estimated at 22 mm. It is 12 mm wide just above
the lateral notches (Figure 12, C).
Ten fragments of arrowpoints were recovered, three of Edwards chert and
seven of Tecovas jasper. Two proximal fragments cannot be identified as projectile
points, and six distal fragments are probably from points.
Scrapers
Six scrapers were recovered, five of Tecovas jasper and one of Alibates agate.
Type 1.--No side scrapers or fragments of this type were recovered.
Type 2.~The six end scrapers vary considerably in size. The smallest, 18 mm
long and 13 mm wide at the distal end (Figure 12, D), was made from Alibates agate.
The largest, 38 mm long and 16 mm wide (Figure 12, E), is of Tecovas jasper. The
remaining four specimens are fragments of this variety. Four of the six specimens
were recovered from Level 1, one, from Level 2, and one was at unknown depth.

Drill
A single drill, or perforator, of Tecovasjasper was recovered from Level 1. The
unaltered proximal end is 33 mm wide, and the drill stem is 20 mm long. The distal
end is broken, so the exact length cannot be determined (Figure 12, F).

Wordm1975 TAS Field School

83

Spokeshave
A single spokeshave of Alibates agate, made from a large flake 49 mm long,
29 mm wide, and 12 mm thick, was recovered from Level 2 (Figure 12 G). The
lateral part has a slight concave indention 15 mm wide and 5 mm deep. On one end
a small spokeshave 6 mm wide and 3 mm deep was formed.
Graver
A single graver recovered from Level 1 was made by lightly chipping a flake
of Tecovas jasper (Figure 12, H).
Bifaces
Two fragments of unidentifiable bifaces were recovered. One, found in Level
1, is of limestone from the nearby Caprock. Two complete preforms were also
recovered. One of the specimens, made from Tecovas jasper (Figure 12, I), is
triangular, 34 mm long, has a maximum width of 22 ram, and convex sides and base;
its provenience was not recorded. The second specimen, a flake altered by
percussion, was also formed from Tecovas jasper; it is 59 mm long and 23 mm wide.
Utilized Flakes
Twenty utilized flakes were recovered. Five (25 percent) were made from
Edwards chert. A single specimen of Alibates agate (5 percent) and 14 (70 percent)
are of Tecovas jasper. Five were recovered from Level 1, 12 from Level 2, and the
remaining 3, from Level 3.
These artifacts were not intentionally made, but are the result of usage. Nine of
the 20 specimens appear to be complete. The other 11 are fragments that were
probably originally flakes. The complete specimens vary in size from 19 mm to 31
mm. The use flakes are on the convex surfaces.
The author, in experimenting with small flakes to butcher deer and groove
bones, discovered that during these operations small flakes varying from .05 mm to
1 mm were removed from the convex surfaces. It was also found that continued use
of flakes for severing bone created relatively steep edges, similar to the edges of
scrapers, but that the flakes removed were of the previously mentioned dimensions.
Lithic Debris
Thirty-two units were excavated in Area 2. Twenty of these were excavated to
Level 2 (20-40 cm), and in one unit, Levels 2 and 3 (40-60 cm) were combined into
one level extending from 20 cm to 60 cm.
To determine if the density of occupation varied in time, comparisons were
confined to the 20 units excavated through Level 2. Amounts of lithic debris were
calculated by level. From the total of 894 flakes and chips recovered, Level 1 yielded
557 specimens (62.30 percent), and Level 2 had 337 specimens (37.70 percent).
From these statistics it appears that Area 1 was more heavily occupied in Protohistoric times. Occupation tended to be less dense in the Late Prehistoric period. This
bears out Hughes’s (n.d.) theory in his "Chronology of Hunting Cultures on the
Southern Plains" that bison were not plentiful until after about A.D. 1~.
In order to determine what lithic sources were exploited by the people
occupying this area, the lithics were analyzed by type. In Level 1 Edwards chert was
represented by 62 specimens (11.13 percent), Alibates agate by 156 specimens

84

Texas Archeological Society

(28.01 percent), Tecovas jasper--the most common type--by 252 specimens
(45.24 percent), Local material from the nearby Caprock by 42 specimens (7.54
percent), and Other lithics of unknown source, by 41 specimens (7.36 percent).
Quataz and Potter chert (Pliocene) produced two examples each, or .36 percent.

continued to be the most common material with 46.88 percent, a single obsidian
flake (.30 percent), 25 Local lithics (7.42 percent), and 4 Other lithics (1.9 percent).

Ground Stone
Type 1.--A complete mano was recovered from Level 2. The abrading surface
is slightly convex and was pecked to enhance its efficiency. The opposite surface
is slightly concave and smooth, suggesting that it is a mano. It is subrectangular with
rounded comers, 117 mm long, 83 mm wide, and from 12 to 28 mm thick.
Two fragments of quartzite manos were also recovered from Level 2. Their
strongly convex grinding surfaces are the basis for their classification as manos.
Type 2.--A fragment of a metate identified by its slightly concave surface was
recovered from Level 1. The abrading surface was pecked to enhance its efficiency,
but the opposite surface was not altered. This fragment is 53 mm long and wide and
is 34 mm thick.
Type 3.---Three fragments of an abrading stone that probably was a palette for
grinding pigment were recovered from the same unit (Unit 25) in Level 2. Two of
the fragments fit together, but it is impossible to determine the original dimensions
of the artifact. It is 5 mm thick at its rounded edge and 4 mm thick toward its inner
surface. It was made from a single piece of fine-grained sandstone containing
minute particles of mica.

Cores

Two cores of stone from the nearby Caprock were recovered, one from Level
2 and the other from Level 3. They were reduced from their original size by
percussion. Flakes were removed from all sides of the larger specimen, which
measures 69 ram. Percussion flakes were removed from only one side of the second
specimen, which is 95 mm long, 60 mm wide, and 33 mm thick.
Pigment
Type !.--Four small fragments of hematite were recovered, two from Level 1
and two from Level 2. One specimen contains very fine grained sand and has a
smoothed surface. The second specimen contains fine-grained sand and is smoothed
on one surface. The third specimen is of greater density and does not have a
smoothed surface. The fourth example is a fragment of petrified wood of soft texture
with no smoothed surface.
Type 2~.-A single small, pebblelike specimen of limonite was recovered from
Level 2. It is very soft in texture.
Faunal Remains
Bone and Shell
Type !.--Two fragments of ribs, one from Level 1 and the other from Level 2,
had cut marks resulting from butchering processes.
Type 2.--A single rib fragment recovered from Level 2 had evidence of sawing
at both ends.
Type 3.--A fragment of a scapula with smoothed surfaces was found in Level
3.
Type 4. A scapula fragment with a notched edge was recovered in Level 2. Its
function could not be determined.
Type 5.--A battered fragment of a vertebra was recovered from Level 1.
NOTE: The faunal remains with evidence of processing were not included in
the cultural material received by the author. The descriptions above are based on the
analysis of faunal remains by Speer (1976).
Type 6:--A circular bone bead 5 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick Figure 12,
J) was recovered from Level 2. The slightly biconical perforation for stringing is 2
mm in diameter.
Type 7.---A fragment of what was possibly a tubular bone bead made from a
bird bone was recovered from Level 4 (from the stair-stepped excavation in subTest Area 2). There is evidence that one end was cut, and a groove on the vertical
axis varies from 1 mm to 2 mm from the cut to the end. Two other diagonal grooves,
parallel to the previously described groove are from 6 to 7 mm long. These two
grooves are 4.5 mm apart, and inside them are two grooves 8 mm long that angle
toward the distal third groove and join to form a triangular design Figure 12, K).
Type 8:--A small fragment of burned bone was recovered from Level 5 (in the
stair-stepped excavation in sub-Test Area 2). Due to the small size of the fragment,
its original size and function cannot be determined. A V-shaped groove has been
cut into the bone.

Shell Bead
A circular shell bead 4.5 mm in diameter with a perforation 1 mm in diameter
and 1 mm thick was recovered from Level 1 (Figure 12, L). The perforation has
parallel sides, possibly the result of being drilled by a metal drill.
Other Faunal Remains
One hundred twenty-one animal bones were recovered in Area 2. Of this total,
85 (70.25 percent) were bison (Speer 1976:4-6); Schultz (n.d.) identified 36
specimens of animals smaller than bison (29.75 percent). An antelope third phalanx
and a canine molar were also recovered. The remaining 24 faunal remains consisted
of one prairie dog ulna, 11 mole remains, one gopher bone, one cotton rat bone, and
three pocket mouse bones. Reptiles were represented by two snake vertebrae and
fragments of a tortoise carapace and plastron. Two frog or toad limbs were
recovered, and bird bones consisted of a pelvis, a scapula, and a corpus.
Level 1 yielded 14 bison bones: two lower foot bones (14.29 percent),
consisting of a single metapodial and phalynx, one radius and one rib (7.14 percent
each), four vertebrae (28.57 percent), two fragments (14.29 percent), obviously of
limb bones, a single skull fragment (1.74 percent), and three teeth (21.43 percent).
Sixty-three bison bones were recovered from Level 2:. 11 lower foot bones
(17A6 percent), consisting of metapodials, tarsals, carpals, phalanxes, sesamoids
(17.46 percent), nine upper limb bone fragments, consisting of femurs, humeri,
tibiae, and radii (14.29 percent), 12 fragments of what were obviously limb bones
(19.05 percent), a single fragmentary scapula (1.59 percent), eight ribs (12.70
percent), five vertebrae fragments (7.94 percent), two pelvis fragments (3.17
percent), four fragments of skulls and mandibles (12.70 percent each), and seven
teeth (11.11 percent of the faunal remains recovered).
Level 3 yielded only eight bison bone fragments: three lower foot bones (one
phalanyx, one carpal, and one sesamoid (7.50 percent), one rib fragment, one
fragment of a scapula, and one skull fragment (12.50 percent each of the total).

Twenty-seven prehistoric sherds were recovered from Area 2, eighteen of
which probably originated in eastern and central New Mexico. Five specimens were
of El Paso Brown Ware, and four were of Chupadero Black-on-White. Eighteen
sherds are of a corrugated type of pottery. Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) classified the
sherds.

Type 1 (El Paso Brown)
This sherd variety is represented by five specimens from an undecorated bowl
(18.52 percent of the total sherds recovered) (Mera 1943; Runyon and Hedrick
1973; Lehmer 1948; Jelinek 1967). The sherds are tan to gray, and the tan core is
slightly porous. The sherds are 40 percent temper, of which 60 percent is very fine
textured white feldspar that is angular from crushing. Very fine clear to opaque
quartz makes up 30 percent of the temper, and golden, platy mica makes up 10
percent.

Type 2 (Corrugated Variety)
This type is of coiled construction and is represented by 18 sherds (66.67
percent of the total sherds recovered). The exterior is dark gray, corrugated, and
slipped with a carbon wash. The interior is smoothed but not slipped with carbon.
Temper comprises 30 percent of the sherd mass, of which 60 percent is very fine
white to brownish feldspar. Colorless subrounded quartz sand makes up 30 percent
of the temper, and golden mica flakes make up 10 percent. These sherds probably
originated in eastern and central New Mexico ~unyon and Hedrick n.d.).
Type 3 (Chupadero Black-on-White)
The four sherds of this variety (14.82 percent of the total sherds recovered)
(Mera 1931; Hawley 1950; Runyon and Hedrick 1973; Breternitz 1966) are of
coiled construction, grayish white with black paint on the slip, of silky fine, dense
paste, and have a gray, very dense core, with no central streak. Kaolinite was used
in the vessels, and the surfaces are smooth and thinly slipped. The tempering
material is 20 percent of the sherd mass, 90 percent very fine to fine colorless
subrounded quartz sand, and 10 percent yellowish white limestone.
Feature
Grass-impressed daub weighing 3,547 g was recovered from Level 1 (0-20 cm)
and 5,251.8 g was recovered from Level 2 (20-40 cm). The area comprising Units
2 and 4; Units 3, 31,33, 34, and 35; and Units 7, 10, and 26 yielded 3,420.4 g of daub
(96.44 percent of the total recovered from Level 1). The same units yielded 5,117.2
g from Level 2 (97.43 percent of the recovered daub). The outlining units that were
tested yielded only 3.56 percent of the daub from Level 1 and 2.57 percent of the
daub from Level 2. This indicates that the feature was confined principally to an area
of about 105.0 cm from east to west and 60.0 cm from north to south ~igure 13).
Within this concentration of grass-impressed daub was evidence of a structure
of undetermined size and construction. In Units 7,10, and 26 and Units 2 and 4, there
were compacted surfaces varying from 4 to 10 cm in diameter at about 14 cm depth.
Unfortunately the excavations were watered down each evening in order to
facilitate the removal of the matrix. Dr. Jack T. Hughes (oral communication, June
13,1975), upon examining these compacted surfaces, stated that the excavators had
inadvertently dug through remnants of a floor or living area, not realizing that a floor
or living surface was there.
Field notes recorded what were possibly three post holes in Unit 4, but none
were cross sectioned to determine whether they were post holes or rodent burrows.
Area 3 (41FL1-3)

Area 3 is about 250 meters east of Area I on the south hank of the White River,
west of an older oxbow of the river. The area tested is east of the Floydada Country
Club’s No. 1 fairway.
Following the same procedure as in Area 1, a nail was driven into a hackberry
tree to serve as the datum point for Area 3, and all elevations were recorded from
this point. An east-west base line was extended westward from this datum point, and

a north-south base line was laid out intersecting the first line 11 meters west of the
datum point (Figure 14). Twenty-four 1 by 1-meter units were tested. Twenty units
were excavated to the 30 cm depth, 14 to the 40 cm depth, nine to the 50 cm depth,
and a single unit was excavated to a depth of 70 cm. When a feature was discovered,
additional units were opened to expose as much of the feature as time allowed. Units
were excavated in 10 cm levels; a line level was used for horizontal control. The
reference point for each unit was the grid reading at its southwest comer.
Area 3-Soil Description
Of the 24 units tested, only Unit 10 was excavated to 70 cm. No features were
recorded in this unit, but the excavation provides an opportunity to describe the soils
(Figure 15).
Level 1 (0-10 cm)
The soil is brown, sandy, compact loam. The roots of the native grasses that
covered the surface extend down throughout this level. Specks of charcoal and signs
of rodent activity are common throughout.
Level 2 (10--20 cm)
The soil color and consistency are unchanged. Grass roots, charcoal specks,
and signs of rodent activity continue.

Level 3 (20-30 cm)
Soil characteristics are similar to Levels 1 and 2. Grass roots do not penetrate

Level 4 (30--40 cm)
The matrix is similar to but less dense than that in the upper levels. However,
an irregular surface was found from 32 cm to the 40 cm depth ~igure 15). Color
changes below this irregular surface to a light brown-gray loam with small caliche
nodules varying in size from 1 to 5 mm. Charcoal specks decrease in number, and
signs of rodent activity disappear in the lower part of the level.

Area 3-Cultural Materials
Area 3 was excavated in 10 cm levels in contrast to Areas 1 and 2, which were
excavated in 20 cm levels. In order to facilitate statistical comparison of the density
of occupation of Area 3 with that of Areas 1 and 2, pairs of 10 cm levels in Area 3
are combined. That is, Levels 1 and 2 of Area 3 are combined to make a 20 cm level,
which corresponds to Level 1 in Areas 1 and 2. The other 10 cm levels in Area 3
are similarly combined in pairs for comparison with Areas 1 and 2.
Historic Artifacts
Eighteen fragments of glass were recovered from the upper part of Level 1
(0-10 cm). The units from which these specimens were recovered are in an area that
has been actively used by golf carts; this accounts for the small size of the glass
particles.
Glass
Type 1.--Five pale, clear translucent green glass fragments vary in size from
6to 11 mm andareas large as 12to21 ram. Itis notpossibletoidentify the original
objects, but they are reminiscent of Coca Cola bottles.
Type 2.---Nine green translucent glass fragments varying from 3 to 6 mm to as
large as 9 to 16 mm were recovered, but the original objects cannot be determined.
Type3. Three clear glass fragments varying in size from 4 to 6 mm to as large
as 7 to 8 mm were recovered. The nature of the original container can not be
determined.
Type 4. A single brown glass fragment was recovered. It measures 12 to 15
mm and has the characteristics of a beer bottle.
Lithics
Arrowpoints
Type 1.--The basal part of a probable Fresno point made from Edwards chert
was recovered from Level 1 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:273-274). The base is 12 mm
wide and slightly concave. The length can not be determined, since the distance
from the base to the distal part is only 14 mm.
Type 2.~A Harrell arrowpoint (Bell 1958:30) of Tecovas jasper recovered
from Level 1 is 28 mm long and 12 mm wide at the base. The edges are highly
convex. The lateral notches are 8 mm from the base. The base is concave and the
basal notch is an open U ~igure 16 A).
Type 3:--A fragment of a Washita arrowpoint (Bell 1958:99) made from
Edwards chert was recovered from Level 1. The base is straight and is estimated to
have been 15 mm wide; the length is estimated to have been 21 mm. The sides are
slightly convex 0~igure 16, B), and the lateral notches are 6 mm from the concave
base.
Type 4. Two Perdiz arrowpoints (Suhm and Jelks 1962:283-284) were
recovered from Level 1. One, made of light gray Edwards chert, lacks a distal end.
The blade is estimated to have been 38 mm long. The sides of the blade are gently
convex, and the shoulders are slightly barbed. It is 25 mm wide at the base of the
blade. The stem is contracting, and the tip, which was about 10 cm long, is broken

Three fragments of what, based on point characteristics, were arrowpoints,
were recovered from Level 1. Two are distal ends, one of Edwards chert mad the
other, of Tecovas jasper. The third specimen is a midsection of Edwards chert.
Scrapers
Scrapers are the most common lithic artifact recovered from Area 3. Four are
made of Tecovas jasper and one each of Alibates agate and Edwards chert. There
are two side scrapers, two end scrapers, and one combination side-end scraper. One
is a fragment too small to classify.
Type 1.--Both of the side scrapers recovered from Level 1 are made from
Tecovas jasper. The largest is 45 mm long and 29 mm wide (Figure 16, E). The
smaller specimen is 37 by 32 mm (Figure 16, F).
Type 2.--One of the two end scrapers recovered from Level 2 is made from
Edwards chert (Figure.16, G). It is 33 mm long and 27 mm wide. The distal end is
steep, or blunt from resharpening. The second specimen, recovered from Level 1,
is a fragment; it is not possible to estimate its original length, but the fragment is 13
mm long and 27 mm wide at the point of fracture. The working surface is blunt,
indicating that it had been resharpened and reused many times.
Type 3. A single combination side-and-end scraper recovered from Level 1
(Figure 16, H) was made from Alibates agate. It is 51 mm long and 26 mm wide.
The side-and-end scraping edges extend from the proximal to the distal end. One
side is broken; it cannot be determined whether the fracture occurred when the
artifact was made or at a later date.
Drill
The distal part, or stem, of a drill or perforator of Tecovas jasper was recovered
from Level 2 (Figure 16, I). The fragment is 20 mm long; in cross section it is slightly
bevelled, suggesting that it had been resharpened. At the broken or proximal end it
is 6 mm wide; at the distal end it tapers to a point.
Preform
A single fragment of a preform made from Tecovas jasper was recovered from
Level 1 (Figure 16, J). It is 52 mm long and 31 mm wide at the point of fracture.
Both sides are percussion flaked.
Core
A core of Tecovas jasper reduced by percussion (Figure 16, K) was recovered
from the lower part of Level 1. It is 47 mm long, 31 mm wide, and 19 mm thick.
Utilized Flakes
Six utilized flakes were recovered, two from Level 1 and four from Level 2.
Four are of Tecovas jasper and two are of Edwards chert. The largest is 41 mm long
and 27 mm wide. The smallest is a fragment 16 mm long and 12 mm wide.
No other lithic artifacts such as manos, metates, or pigments were found in the
1975 TAS Field School excavations.
Lithic Debris
In order to analyze the lithic concentration to determine if there is an increase
or decrease in density of occupation represented by lithic debris, the 14 units

94

Texas Archeological Society

completed through Level 2 (0-40 cm) are compared. Three hundred forty-one
pieces of lithic debitage were recovered. Level 1 (0-20 cm) yielded 194 specimens
(56.89 percent), and Level 2 (20-40) yielded 147 specimens (43.11 percent of the
total.lithics). Lithics were identified by type. Outcrops of Tecovas jasper, of the
Tecovas Formation (Dockum Group, Upper Triassic; Holliday and Welty 1981) are
found 48 to 96 km (30 to 60 miles) north of the Floydada Country Club site. Tecovas
jasper is represented by 121 specimens (62.37 percent). Twenty lithics of Alibates
agate, which occurs in the upper part of the Quartermaster Formation (Permian)
(ibid.) constitute 10.31 percent. Thirty-five specimens (18.04 percent) are of
Edwards chert, which is not found in this area. Seven obsidian flakes (3.61 percent)
came from eastern central New Mexico. Four specimens (2.06 percent) are of
quartz, commonly found as cobbles in the Ogallala Formation (Tertiary). Local
material from the nearby Caprock escarpment accounts for four specimens (2.06
percent). A single flake of Potter chert (.52 percent of the total) came from the
Ogallala Formation (Pliocene). Two specimens (1.03 percent) are of quartzite from
the nearby Tecovas outcrops (Table 3).

Level 2 (20-40 cm) yielded 147 lithics (43.11 percent of the total of 341). There
was a slight variation in the percentage of each type. Ninety-two (62.59 percent) are
of Tecovas jasper; 15 (10.20 percent) are of Alibates agate. Twenty-seven (18.37
percent) are of Edwards chert, and five (3.40 percent) are of obsidian. Quartz and
Local material from the nearby Caprock escarpment were represented by three
examples each (2.04 percent each). Potter chert and Tecovas quartzite were
represented by one specimen each (.68 percent). Judging from the lithic debris
recovered, there appears to be a slightly less density of occupation in Level 2 than
in Level 1.

Word--1975 TAS Field School

In the six units excavated through Level 3 (40-60 cm), only 12 lithic specimens
were recovered. Levels 1 and 2 yielded 190 lithics (94.06 percent), and the total for
all three levels was 202, Level 3 accounting for only 5.94 percent. However, six
units---only one-fourth of the total units tested--are not sufficient for accurate
determination of the density of occupation, but it is probable that the density of
occupation was considerably less in the time represented by Level 3.
Bone
Butchering Marks and Alterations from Percussion
Type 1--Twelve specimens with cut or butchering marks were recovered: six
ribs, one humerus, and five fragments of upper limb bones. Two ribs and two upper
limb bone fragments (33.33 percent) were recovered from Level 1. One humerus,
three ribs, and three upper limb bone fragments (58.33 percent) came from Level
2, and a single rib (8.33 percent) was recovered from Level 3.
Type 2.--An axis vertebra was recovered from Level 2 that had transverse cut
marks and was also battered.
Type 3.--A carpal from Level 1 and a larsal from Level 2 had evidence of
battering.
Bones with butchering or cut marks constituted 80 percent of the total. A single
specimen (6.6 percent) had evidence of butchering and battering, and 13.33 percent
of the bones had evidence of battering only.
Fragmented Fa unal Remains
Small fragments of bone too small to be identified are not included in the
following analysis. Thirty-eight fragments that could be identified were recovered.
Fourteen were recovered in Level 1: five lower foot bones (two metatarsals, one
tarsal and two phalanxes), upper limb bones (fragments of one possible femur, one
radius, one humerus, and two limb bones), two rib fragments, and two tooth
fragments. Twenty-one specimens were recovered from Level 2: eight lower foot
bones (five carpals and tarsals, two sesamoids, and a single phalanx), upper limb
bones, four ribs, a single axis vertebra, and four tooth fragments. Level 3 produced
only three specimens consisfi.ng of a single carpal, a fragment of a tibia, and a rib.
The bison remains were analyzed by Speer (1976:7, 8).
Pottery
One hundred seventy-nine prehistoric sherds were recovered from Area 3; 150
were identified as Local wares based on clay samples provided by the author from
sources adjacent to the Floydada Country Club, and six specimens were probably
from the eastern New Mexico and eastern Rio Grande areas. Thirteen specimens
were Jornado Brown (Mogollon), and one Rio Grande Pecos Glaze II or III
specimen was recovered. Runyon and Hea~ck (n.d.) classified all of the sherds,
using microscopic analysis and hydrogen chloride tests.
Type I (Local Variety)
One hundred forty-two sherds are of coiled construction. Sherd color varies
from tan to orange buff to gray; paste is f’me and slightly porous with moderate
density; surfaces are smoothed and floated; cores are sharply defined by light gray

96

central streaks; temper comprised 30 to 35 percent of the mass. The temper varies
from 100 percent very fine, clear quartz to 80 percent very fine quartz sand, 15
percent small tan clay balls, and 5 percent white dolomite; vessels are small bowls
and jars with rounded rims, occasionally incised in the interior just below the rim.
Type 1 represented 85.53 percent of the total sherds recovered.
Type 2 (Local Variety)
Eight sherds (4.75 percent of the sherds recovered) varied from Type 1. Thirty
percent of the sherds have temper consisting of 70 percent very fine quartz and 30
percent crushed limestone. The sherds are dark gray and smoothed and floated both
inside and out. The cores are gray with no streaking. Due to the small size of the
sherds, the type of vessel could not be determined.
Las Lunas Smudged
Six sherds were identified as Las Lunas Smudged of the Cederville Phase
(Breternitz 1966). Temper comprises 30 to 35 percent of the sherd mass; it is 85
percent white subangular feldspar, 10 percent very fine black magnetite, and 5
percent very fine mica.The sherds are dark gray on the exterior and black on the
interior. The exterior and interior are smoothed and floated. The sherds came from
two bowls and represented 3.53 percent of the recovered sherds.
Brown Wares
Roswell Brown.--Two sherds were classified as Roswell Brown (Jelinek
1967). They are of coiled construction and varied from tan to brown in color with
smoothed and floated surfaces and interior streaks. Temper is 30 to 35 percent of the
sherd mass and consists of 60 percent very fine feldspar, 30 percent quartz sand, 10
percent very fine white limestone, and a very slight trace of black magnetite.
Roswell Brown ware makes up 1.12 percent of the total.
Jornado Brown (Mogollon).--Eleven Jornado Brown Mogollon ware sherds
(7.65 percent) varying from tan to redish tan to gray, and coiled, were recovered. The
surfaces vary from smoothed and floated with occasional striations and are slightly
porous. Tempering material varies from 50 to 80 percent very fine feldspar, 10 to
30 percent very fine quartz, and 10 to 20 percent very fine magnetite. Three Jornado
Brown sherds had 40 percent temper, consisting of 60 percent very fine feldspar, 30
percent quartz, and 10 percent very fine golden mica. The contours of the sherds
indicate that the vessels were jars and bowls (Mera 1943; Runyan and Hedrick
1973).
Pecos Glaze H or III
A single body sherd ofa Pecos Glaze II or III bowl (Kidder and Sheppard 1936)
was recovered. It is coiled, tan to light red with a black carbon glazed band 33 mm
below the rim, has smoothed and polished surface, and temper comprising 30
percent of the sherd mass. The temper is 60 percent very fine feldspar and 40 percent
very fine black hornblende. This specimen represents .59 percent of the total sherds
recovered.
Local sherds, as defined by Runyan and Hedrick, represented 88.24 percent of
the total, which implies that there was very little influence from the southeastern and
west central New Mexican cultures.

Features
Feature 1
Feature 1 (not illustrated), in Unit 27, extended from the lower part of Level 1
(0-20 cm) beginning at 15 cm and continuing into Level 2 (20-40 cm) to a depth
of 22 cm. A small cluster of fire-fractured hearth stones measuring 15 to 30 cm in
diameter was discovered. Small pockets of charcoal varying from about 2.5 cm to
5 cm in size were scattered among the hearth stones. The uppermost part of this
feature consisted of a scatter of 172 very small fragments of bison bone. A fragment
of the distal end of a tibia was in the eastern edge of the unit; other large fragments
of bone were in the northern and western limits of the unit. Five of the fragmented
bones were burned, and a fragment of tooth enamel was recorded.
Six flakes and chips were scattered randomly throughout the feature area.
Three sherds of Local Variety (Type 2) and a single Local Variety (Type 1)
fragment were scattered about the cluster of fire fractured hearthstones. Two
fragments of burned clay were also noted.
This feature probably was a dump area resulting from cleaning out a nearby
hearth which was not discovered in Testing Area 3. No evidence of a burned soil area
above or below the feature was recorded.
Feature 2
Feature 2 was in the eastern part of Unit 22 (Figure 17). In 1961, the steep banks
of the White River were graded to a slope to facilitate maintenance of the golf
course. This grading caused the surface of Unit 22 to slope to the east and exposed
Feature 2. While surveying after the bank was sloped in 1961, the author recovered
a metate and fragments of a large Harrell point in the disturbed hearth midden. It is
estimated from the 1961 survey field notes and the field notes of the 1975 field
school that the hearth was about 60 cm in diameter.
Associated with the undisturbed part of the feature were a single chert flake, 17
fragments of bison bone, and, between the surface and the 5 cm depth, four small
green glass fragments. Below the 5 cm level the hearth bottomed out at 20 cm (Level
1). A Harrell point of Edwards chert and a utilized flake of Tecovas jasper were
recovered from the lower part of Level 1. Eleven flakes were scattered throughout
the deposit. Two fragments of limb bones with butchering marks, 116 very small
bone fragments, and a fingemail-punctated sherd of Tierra Blanca variety (HabichtMauche 1987) or Local Variety 2 (Runyon and Hedrick n.d.) were associated with
this feature.
There were charcoal stains throughout the hearth and closely associated with
the surrounding area.
DISCUSSION

The Floydada Country Club site on the Southern High Plains of the Llano
Estacado provided an opportunity to study both cultural and temporal relationships
among three differing cultural groups in Late Prehistoric times (Skinner 1975a).
The author is unaware of any other area that provides an opportunity for study of

three distinct cultural groups in such close geographic and temporal association
(Figure 3). The lithic artifacts of the three groups are similar, but the pottery styles
of the three cultures differ.
In the 30 years during which the author has collected surface material from
service roads eroded by wind action and from the eroded bank of the White River,
the site has yielded a variety of projectile points such as Washita, Harrell, Fresno,
Lott, Garza, and Perdiz. In addition, bevelled knives, scraping tools, gravers,

Wordm1975 TAS Field School

99

utilized flakes, drills or perforators, spokeshaves, and pipe fragments were recovered,
together with bone artifacts consisting of awls, a serrated rib (music rasp?), a
metapodal fleshing tool, and a finely serrated rib of unknown function. Ornaments
collected are turquoise beads, olivella beads, tubular bone beads and a single olivia
bead. Artifacts associated with the Historic Period are metal projectile points, steel
awls, rifle cartridge cases, and parts of rifle locks; several home-made flints for a
flintlock rifle were also found on the surface of the site.
Pottery was the most common artifact recovered in the surface survey. The
sherds vary considerably and include eastern Puebloan, Mogollon, and Caddoan
sherds consisting of Killough Pinched and La Rue Neck Banded (written communicationm, R. King Harris, April 22, 1971). Most of the sherds were unlike any
classified sherds.
In 1962 the author (1963:40-49) put three tests into the central part of the site
(Field School Area 1) to a depth of 24 inches (61 cm) to determine whether cultural
changes could be detected. In 1963 a test pit was put into the eastern part of the site
(Field School Area 3) where a KiUough Pinched sherd was exposed on the surface.
It was hoped that material could be found associated with this sherd variety, but no
other cultural materialwas discovered. In 1964 another test was excavated to a depth
of 5 feet (1.5 meters) in the bank and into the first terrace of the White River in the
southeastern part of the central area (Field School Area 1). Small flecks of charcoal
and an occasional flint flake pointed to occupation to the bottom of the test, but no
diagnostic artifacts were recovered below 15 inches (38 cm) from the surface.
By accepted definition, the site is not a permanent base camp, but it is evident
that throughout the Late Prehistoric Period it was occupied over and over by a
nomadic people (Apaches) and by two other divergent cultural groups. If Runkles
and Dorchester’s (1986:109) definition of a base camp is adapted to use in the
Southern High Plains of the Llano Estacado, it is indeed a base camp.
As previously mentioned, the site was divided into three areas based on the
more than 1,000 sherds in the author’s collection (Skinner 1975a), which also has
more than 400 identifiable fragments and complete lithic artifacts.
The Floydada Country Club site is unique in that the three areas tested are so
closely related. Until the author became aware of differences in percentages oflithic
types in each area as well as variations in sherd types recorded, the areas seemed to
be parts of one site. However, after analysis there appear to be significant differences. The dominance of Edwards chert and Puebloan sherds in Area 1 implies a
Late Prehistoric Apachean people. The dominance of Tecovas jasper and Alibates
agate, as well as Mogollon Brown Wares, in Area 2 suggests some association with
peoples to the southwest and west. Emmet Shedd (personal communication) has
found Tecovas jasper and Alibates agate cobbles in the northern Brazos River
drainages to the south of the Floydada Country Club site.
In Area 3, Tecovas jasper and Edwards chert are the dominant lithic materials.
Imitation (locally made?) and genuine Caddoan wares and sherds classified as
Unknown are the dominant cultural material.

It is theorized that the routes taken into the area can be determined by analysis
of the lithic samples (see Tables 1, 2, 3). Evidence from Area 1 suggests active trade
with eastern Puebloan groups. Data from Area 2 suggest that people there were
associated with Mogollon groups from the E1 Paso region and as far to the north as
mideastern New Mexico. Evidence from Area 3 identifies a Late Prehistoric people
associated with both the western Caddoan people who migrated to the west and the
eastern Caddoans. In their journey to the west, if they followed the Red River or
Brazos River drainage, they would have come into contact with outcrops of Tecovas
jasper and Edwards chert, which would account for most of the Tecovas jasper and
Edwards chert lithics.
Ceramics are a basis for determining cultural origins and dating when funds are
not available for radiocarbon dating (Skinner 1975b). Analysis of the sherds from
each area by Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) supports the suggestion that the occupants
of the three areas actively moved about in their search for meat (primarily bison) and
in trading with other groups. What are the possible items of trade? The Apachean
people in Area 1 had access to ample quantities of bison; they produced dried meat
and processed hides for trade. The Apachean peoples in Area 1 used bows for
hunting buffalo, which were plentiful, but bois d’arc wood--shown from collections at the Panhandle-Plains Museum in Canyon, the Texas Memorial Museum in
Austin, and the Texas Tech Museum in Lubbock to be the wood of choice for
bows--is not common in the Southern High Plains (Gould 1969:38), so it is quite
possible that the Apachean people traded their surplus dried buffalo meat and hides
to the Caddoan people of Area 3 in return for the bois d’arc wood they needed for
bows. In the same way, the Mogollon people in Area 2 may have exchanged their
surplus salt with their neighbors for materials that were scarce in Area 2.
However, invasion of the area by the Comanchean people and their dominance
by the mid-1750s put an end to the trade relationships that had existed among the
earlier cultural groups. Historic materials such as metal tinklers and awls, glass
beads, and gun parts are probably associated with the Comanches. The pins that join
yokes to ox bows are associated with either the Comancheros (Wallace 1974:23-52)
or the Pastores, who returned to the Llano Estacado after the defeat of the
Comanches at the Battle of Palo Duro in 1874.
Modern artifacts such as golf tees and fragments of beverage bottles are the
result of more recent Country Club activities (Skinner 1975c).
CONCLUSIONS

Skinner (1974, 1975a) proposed four hypotheses to be tested. The first
hypothesis was that the Floydada Country Club site had been intensively occupied
from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. Due to the limited duration of the
Texas Archeological Society Field School, this hypothesis could not be tested
adequately (Skinner 1975b). It is hoped that future investigators can examine this
issue.

The second hypothesis was that intensive occupation between A.D. 1200 and
1500 was by indigenous groups that had close ties to eastern and southwestern New
Mexico Puebloans and the Antelope Creek focus to the north, as well as some ties
to the Caddoan areas. Was the site a rendezvous area? It was demonstrated that there
was a trade relationship between indigenous people (Apache) and the eastern and
southwestern Puebloan people as evidenced by items of trade such as pottery,
obsidian, and turquoise, which were probably traded for processed meat and hides.
From examination of the pottery, Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) determined that the
Caddoan people, who probably both traded bois d’arc wood for processed bison
meat and hides and hunted bison, also were occasional occupants of the site. There
is no evidence of contact with the Antelope Creek focus people, since no cordmarked sherds were recovered, nor have any been found on the surface by the
author. However, Alibates agate lithic debris and artifacts indicate that there was
possibly a contact with the area to the north where this type of material originates,
probably after the Antelope Creek focus people abandoned the Panhandle area. The
three distinct subdivisions of the site (Areas 1,2, and 3) and the variations in lithic
material percentages imply a rather intensive occupation of the site from A.D. 1200
to 1500.
The third hypothesis was that immigrant groups from the southwestern
Mogollon and eastern Puebloan groups came into the area to hunt and process bison.
There is some evidence that the southern and eastern Puebloans hunted bison, but
there is no evidence that these cultural groups were at the site for that sole purpose.
Various Brown Ware and Chupadero sherds were recovered in Area 3, but the
faunal remains of bison were sparse. These people had access to salt, which was
probably an item of trade, since the Apache had no access to a ready source of salt,
so they may have come to trade rather than just to hunt and process meat.
The fourth hypothesis was that the historic Indian occupation was a short-term
occupation by Protohistoric Apachean groups and the succeeding Comanche, who
dominated this area from Historic time until the aboriginal occupation was terminated by the Mackenzie campaign of 1874. Such occupations were identified by the
presence of historic artifacts (metal artifacts, glass, etc.) associated with contact
with people of European origin.
The limited time spent in testing the areas of the site by the 1975 TAS Field
School was sufficient for the establishment of some chronology. Obsidian dating
(Baugh, written communication, January 22, 1985) indicates that the occupation
lasted from the first quarter of the fifteenth century to the late seventeenth century.
It is possible that the site was occupied from as early as A.D. 900 to as late as A.D.
1400, based on the ceramic analysis by Runyon and Hedrick (n.d.) of sherds of
various Brown Wares and Chupadero. However, the scarcity of bison before A.D.
1100 (Hughes, n.d.) implies that the greatest density of occupation by various
indigenous groups probably occurred from A.D. 1100 to the late nineteenth century.
Point types such as Harrell and Washita (Bell 1958:30, 98) indicate an occupation
from A.D. 1100 to 1600. Although no Lott or Garza points were recovered in
excavations, a few specimens of these types are known from surface collections.

Based on Runkles and Dorchester’s report (1986:106-108) on theLott site and their
radiocarbon dates, there was some occupation from A.D. 1325 to 1505. Johnson,
Holliday, Kaczor, and Stuckenrath (1977:104-106), in their report on the Garza
occupation at the Lubbock Lake site, date the Garzapoint by radiocarbon assay from
A.D. 1635 to the mid-1600s. Harris and Harris (1967:158) identified a glass bead
dated from A.D. 1820 to 1836 recovered from Area 1.
It is concluded that the Floydada Country Club site was occupied intermittently
from as early as A.D. 1100 to the mid-1750s by the Apache and eastern and
southwestern Puebloans as well as the E1 Paso Mogollon and a Caddoan-related
people. It is evident that an active wade relationship existed among these cultural
groups. The subsequent reoccupation of the site by the Comanche was eventually
terminated by Mackenzie’s defeat of the Comanche in 1874.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The participants in the 1975 Texas Archeological Society Field School are
specially thanked for their hard work and their tolerance of the mosquito infestation.
Without those dedicated people the information that makes this report possible
could not have been collected. More than 210 people participated (Richmond,
Richmond, and Greer 1985); too many to recognize individually here.
Area Supervisors and crew chiefs assumed an important responsibility and
contributed their skills to make the 1975 field school a success. Their field notes
were indispensible to the completion of this report.
Area 1 site supervisor and crew chiefs were R. L. Smith, R. L. Carter, Norma
Hoffrichter, Jimmy Smith, Jay C. Blaine, Billy Bunch, William L. Fullen, Bransford
Eubank, and Emmet Shedd.
Area 2 site supervisor and crew chiefs were C. K. Chandler, James E. Warren,
Jack Hedrick, Teddy Lou Stickney, Jack Klatt, and Jane Schweitzer.
Area 3 site supervisor and crew chiefs were Robert L. Turner, Roy Thompson,
Norman G. Flaigg, Tommy Hicks, Paul Lorrain, Ralph Vinson, Elizabeth Perry, and
Roy Dickerson.
Special appreciation is given to Drs. E. Mott Davis and Jack T. Hughes, for
without their advice and encouragement this report would not have been completed.
The dedication and skill of Dr. S. Alan Skinner, Field School Archeologist, made
the field school a success. Jay C. and Jerry Lee Blaine contributed their time as
assistant camp boss and registrar. The analysis of sherds by John Runyon and Jack
Hedrick was a contribution that was most important in determining cultural
relationships. The analysis by Roberta D. Speer and. Dr. Gerald E. Schultz was
important in identifying and determining the utilization of faunal remains. The skill
of William L. Richmond in mapping the areas tested contributed greatly to the
report, and Claude Brown gave enthusiastically of his time to a successful children’s
program. Charles M. Carr contributed his time to tow the cook trailer to the site, and
he provided a front-end loader that was helpful for backfilling the excavated units.
Guy W. Wilson shared his knowledge and identified a rifle cartridge recovered from
the site.
