ABSTRACT

On 30 November and 1 December 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
jurisdictional areas within Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s (Petrohawk) proposed JC Martin
State Unit 1H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW) located in central LaSalle County,
Texas (Project Area). The proposed well pad totals 7.5 acres, while the proposed access road
measures 2.0 miles (3.2 kilometers [km]) in length by 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide, with a
total area of 12.0 acres. Overall, the Project Area totals 19.5 acres. For purposes of
discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of each wetland or waterway within the
Project Area as well as the associated uplands on opposing sides of each wetland/waterway.
With this in mind, the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed access road ROW total
only 3779.0 feet (1151.8 m) in length (4.3 acres), while the entire 7.5-acre well pad was
considered within the USACE’s jurisdiction as it is located on an associated upland directly
between 2 USACE jurisdictional areas. Although the proposed well pad and access road will be
located entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, impacts to areas
under the jurisdiction of the USACE will require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) in
compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal permit, the
areas within the purview of the USACE also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of Wildlife
Technical Services, Inc. (WTS), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the Project Area on behalf of Petrohawk in compliance with Section
106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the
documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site within the proposed access road ROW.
Site 41LS161 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated on an upland
landform adjacent to a relict channel of the Nueces River. As this site’s boundaries may extend
beyond the assessed limits of the proposed access road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility
status for site 41LS161 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of
only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of
preserved floral and faunal materials, the portion of this site within the proposed access road
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site.

Abstract

Aside from 41LS161, no other cultural resources were documented within the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the Project Area.
Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41LS161 within the proposed access
road ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of
the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of Petrohawk’s proposed JC Martin State
Unit 1H well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources.
Horizon therefore recommends that Petrohawk be allowed to proceed with the undertaking,
relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well
pad and access road within areas under the purview of the USACE and the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and USACE
should be notified of the discovery.

Corporation’s Proposed JC Martin State Unit 1H Well Pad and Access Road ROW

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the US
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s
(Petrohawk) proposed JC Martin State Unit 1H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW)
located in central LaSalle County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The proposed
well pad totals 7.5 acres, while the proposed access road measures 2.0 miles (3.2 kilometers
[km]) in length by 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of 12.0 acres. Overall, the
Project Area totals 19.5 acres. For purposes of discussion, the USACE jurisdictional areas
consist of each wetland or waterway within the Project Area as well as the associated uplands
on opposing sides of each wetland/waterway. With this in mind, the USACE jurisdictional areas
along the proposed access road ROW total only 3779.0 feet (1151.8 m) in length (4.3 acres),
while the entire 7.5-acre well pad was considered within the USACE’s jurisdiction as it is located
on an associated upland directly between 2 USACE jurisdictional areas (11.8 acres total).
Although the proposed well pad and access road will be located entirely on private property and
will be constructed with private funds, impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the USACE will
require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) in compliance with Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal permit, the areas within the purview of the USACE
also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of Wildlife Technical Services, Inc. (WTS), Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey of the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the Project Area on behalf of Petrohawk in compliance with Section
106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the USACE jurisdictional areas and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area, and the
production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure,
Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural
Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director)
served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema (Horizon
staff archeologists) conducted the field investigations.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 30 November and 1 December
2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas and associated uplands within the Project Area. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per
2.0 acres for projects measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a
total of 6 shovel tests would have been necessary to meet the TSMASS within the 11.8 acres of
USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area (including associated uplands). Horizon
exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 26 shovel tests within the
USACE jurisdictional areas.
The cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the
documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site within the proposed access road ROW.
Site 41LS161 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated on an upland
landform adjacent to a relict channel of the Nueces River. As this site’s boundaries may extend
beyond the assessed limits of the proposed access road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility
status for site 41LS161 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of
only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of
preserved floral and faunal materials, the portion of this site within the proposed access road
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site.
Aside from 41LS161, no other cultural resources were documented within the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the Project Area.
Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41LS161 within the proposed access
road ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of
the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of Petrohawk’s proposed JC Martin State
Unit 1H well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources.
Horizon therefore recommends that Petrohawk be allowed to proceed with the undertaking,
relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well
pad and access road within areas under the purview of the USACE and the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately and the THC and USACE should be notified of the
discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

Petrohawk’s proposed JC Martin State Unit 1H well pad and access road ROW are
located in central LaSalle County, Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). They can be found on the
US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Charco Marrano Creek, Texas, topographic
quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The Project Area consists of a 7.5-acre well pad and an
associated access road ROW totaling 10,454.4 feet (3186.5 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m)
in width (12.0 acres), with an overall area of 19.5 acres. However, the USACE jurisdictional
areas within the Project Area, inclusive of associated uplands, total only 11.8 acres.
Representative images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resource survey are
presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-5.

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The proposed access road ROW follows an existing dirt road for the entire 2.0-mile (3.2km) stretch to the proposed well pad. The east/west trending portion of the proposed access
road parallels an existing natural gas pipeline within a previously cleared ROW measuring
approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width (see Figures 2-1 and 2-2). The portion of the
proposed access road paralleling the Nueces River follows an existing dirt road through typical
south Texas chaparral (see Figure 2-4).

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in central LaSalle County in south Texas. These extensive
ROWs extend across rangeland and chaparral typical of south Texas. Elevations across the
Project Area range between approximately 310.0 feet (94.5 m) and 350.0 feet (106.7 m) above
mean sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Nueces River basin.
Roughly the western half of the Project Area is drained to the south by Las Raices Creek, while
the eastern half is drained to the south and east by the Nueces River and 1 of its relict channels.
Las Raices Creek and the relict channel of the Nueces River flow to the south, both joining the
main channel of the Nueces River several miles south of the Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in LaSalle County is generally mild in the winter, with an average
temperature of 55.0 degrees. In the summer months, the average temperature is 85.0 degrees,
with an average daily maximum temperature of 97.0 degrees. The average annual total
precipitation is about 21.9 inches. Of this, about 14.0 inches, or 65%, usually falls in April
through September. Thunderstorms occur on about 36 days each year (NRCS 2011a).

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (WWF 2005) and the
South Texas Plains vegetational region (Gould 1975). The upland areas support a rich tapestry
of south Texas chaparral. The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be
characterized as brush country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4 to 10 feet.
The Tamaulipan/Mezquital ecoregion of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico has
unique plant and animal communities containing tree- and brush-covered dunes, wind tidal flats,
and dense native brushland. These communities contain such species as ocelot, jaguarondi,
reddish egret, the Texas indigo snake, and over 400 species of birds (WWF 2005).
Species in the project area that provide recreational opportunities include white-tailed
deer, javelina, wild turkeys, mourning and white-winged doves, bobwhite and scaled quail,
rabbits, and feral hogs. Coyotes, gray foxes, bobcats, and mountain lions are also present and
contribute to the diversity of local wildlife. More forested brush areas provide nesting and
foraging areas for some of these species, and the neighboring rangelands and other open
areas provide additional foraging areas. Amphibians and reptiles were not directly observed in
the creek or riverine areas of the project area. Suitable habitat for various snakes, frogs, and
salamanders is present.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within Petrohawk Energy
Corporation’s Proposed JC Martin State Unit 1H Well Pad and Access Road ROW

Wildlife resources in the project vicinity include species normally anticipated in a rural,
agricultural setting. Habitat availability is limited for the most part to natural areas associated
with watercourses. These areas provide cover and some foraging opportunities. Open areas,
including cleared pastureland, allow wildlife to forage and move more easily through the Project
Area.
Although there are large acreages of cultivated land on the South Texas Plains, most of
the area is still rangeland. Land holdings predominantly are large cattle ranches. Deer and
other wildlife species are common. This area originally supported a grassland or savannah type
climax vegetation. Long continued grazing and other factors have altered the plant communities
to such a degree that ranchmen of the region now face a severe brush problem (Gould 1975).
The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be characterized as brush
country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4 to 10 feet. Mesquite and associated
thorny shrubs, such as catclaw acacia, huisache, blackbrush, granjeno, whitebrush, prickly
pear, and Spanish dagger are common locally. Understory vegetation is characteristically
sparse. Along major drainages, live oak, Texas sugarberry, cedar elm, and retama occur. Little
bluestem, bristlegrass, paspalums, windmill grass, and buffelgrass are dominant grasses.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The prehistory of South Texas can essentially be divided into 3 major periods: (1)
Paleoindian (9200–6000 BC); (2) Archaic, which has been subdivided into the Early Archaic (ca.
6000–2500 BC), Middle Archaic (ca. 2500–400 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 400 BC–AD 800);
and (3) Late Prehistoric (AD 800–1600). These prehistoric periods are principally defined by the
presence of particular diagnostic projectile points, but they are intended to designate general
cultural patterns based on ecology, technology, and subsistence strategies (Black 1989:48-57;
Suhm et al. 1954).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200–6000 BC)

Evidence of Paleoindian occupations in South Texas (9200–6000 BC) usually consists
of surface finds found most frequently in the Nueces-Guadalupe and Rio Grande plains. Only 2
stratified Paleoindian sites have been excavated in the region: Buckner Ranch (Sellards 1940)
and Berger Bluff (Brown 1987). Both sites were deeply buried in alluvial terraces. Diagnostic
projectile point styles of the Paleoindian period include Clovis (Meltzer 1986), Folsom (Largent
et al. 1991), Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black 1989:48-49). Finely flaked end
scrapers fashioned on blades and bifacially worked Clear Fork tools are also diagnostic of the
Paleoindian period. Paleoindian peoples have traditionally been characterized as terminal
Pleistocene big-game hunters, but these highly mobile hunter-gatherers probably exploited a
rich diversity of wild plant and animal foods. Investigations at Baker Cave, for instance, indicate
that a diverse array of fish, snakes, and rodents was exploited by the Paleoindian occupants
(Hester 1983). Paleoindian populations were probably organized into small groups that ranged
over great distances across periglacial plains and marginally forested areas to acquire different
food sources throughout the year (Black 1989:48).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC–AD 800)

The major distinction of the Early Archaic period (6000–2500 BC) is the replacement of
earlier lanceolate-shaped projectile points by stemmed and corner-notched types. These styles
include Bell, Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stemmed points such as Bandy,
Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms (Turner and Hester 1985). Other diagnostic artifacts
include Clear Fork tools and large, thin, triangular bifaces with concave bases. The beginning of
the Early Archaic period marks the onset of the modern Holocene era, during which the

HJN 110141 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

periglacial climate of the late Pleistocene began to grow warmer. Available evidence from the
Gulf Coastal Plain suggests that population densities remained low through the beginning of the
Archaic period in South Texas, reflecting a continuation of the highly mobile adaptations of the
Paleoindian period.
The Middle Archaic period (2500–400 BC) in South Texas is defined by the presence of
Pedernales, Langtry, Kinney, Bulverde, and Tortugas projectile point styles (Bell 1958; Turner
and Hester 1985). Distally beveled tools are also common during this period, and ground stone
tools, such as tubular grinding stones and manos, appear for the first time (Black 1989:49). Site
densities in South Texas increase markedly during the Middle Archaic, possibly reflecting a
decrease in group mobility and/or an increase in territoriality among groups (Black 1989:51). A
heavier reliance on vegetal foods may be indicated by the introduction of ground stone
technology and the appearance of large burned rock middens throughout Central Texas.
Late Archaic (400 BC–AD 800) occupations in South Texas are defined by small cornerand side­notched dart points, including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and Ellis types (Bell 1958,
1960; Turner and Hester 1985). Site densities continue to increase throughout the Late Archaic
period, possibly indicating that population densities continued to rise. Cultural deposits on Late
Archaic sites also tend to be deeper than during preceding periods, suggesting that occupations
were either more extended in duration or that reoccupation of the same locations was more
frequent (Black 1989:51). Cemeteries appear during this period, possibly indicating higher levels
of social organization and increasing territoriality (Black 1989:51). During the Late Archaic, the
exploitation of different ecological niches continued to intensify, becoming increasingly oriented
toward the exploitation of seasonal food sources. This kind of adaptation is best illustrated by
the frequent occurrence of shell middens along the coast and burned rock middens farther
inland. Data collected from inland sites indicate that the economy was based primarily on
vegetal resources supplemented with the hunting of small game such as rodents and rabbits
(Black 1989:51).

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800–1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period is defined by the appearance of pottery and the
bow and arrow. The small dart points of the Late Archaic period were largely replaced by arrow
points (Black 1989:52). The Late Prehistoric period in South Texas has been divided into 2
distinct time horizons, the Austin (AD 800–1350) and Toyah (AD 1350–1600) phases (Black
1986). The Austin phase is characterized by the presence of Scallorn arrow points, while the
Toyah phase is defined by the presence of Perdiz arrow points. Faunal resources became
increasingly important during this period, especially large mammals such as bison and deer.
Lithic tool kits seem to have been manufactured for the processing of large mammals (Black
1989:51-57). Late Prehistoric sites are relatively common throughout South Texas, which might
be interpreted as the result of population increases. The movement of bison from Central to
South Texas may coincide with a movement of peoples and/or technology from both the Austin
and Toyah phases of Central Texas (Black 1989:51-57).

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1520 TO PRESENT)

The historic era of South Texas began with the arrival of Europeans in the region and
can be subsumed within the overall history of Texas. In South Texas, the historic era has been
divided into 3 time periods: (1) Spanish Exploration and Colonial (ca. AD 1520–1821); (2)
Mexican (1821-1836); and (3) Texas-American (ca. 1836 to present). The Protohistoric era in
this region can generally be incorporated within the early part of the Spanish Exploration and
Colonial period.
Protohistoric
Records from the initial Spanish expeditions provide the earliest ethnohistoric accounts
of the Coahuiltecan-affiliated groups indigenous to the Rio Grande Plain (Hester 1989a:1-4;
1989b:77-82). Based on fragmentary ethnohistorical records, it appears that these people—part
of an extinct cultural group that occupied lands stretching from South Texas deep into Mexico—
were highly nomadic hunter­gatherers who moved in a seasonal pattern within distinctive
territories (Hester 1989a). Available evidence suggests that Coahuiltecans living in the Rio
Grande Plain (as well as in other parts of South Texas and northern Mexico) subsisted on a
number of seasonal food sources, ranging from prickly pear in the fall to bison or deer in the late
fall or winter, as well as small mammals and roots during off­seasons or in times of hardship
(Hester 1989b:77-81).
Two causes can be cited for the early destruction of the Coahuiltecan groups on the Rio
Grande plain. The primary reason stems from the great period of unrest among Native
American groups generated by the introduction of the horse by the Spanish. Groups who
adopted the horse (especially the Apache and the Comanche) eagerly took to raiding
neighboring groups. Nomadic peoples such as the Coahuiltecans were especially vulnerable to
such pressure, as they could neither consolidate for protection nor occupy defensible positions
without risking starvation. Therefore, finally, the Coahuiltecans asked for missions to be
established in their territories in order to protect them from the Apache and Comanche raiders.
After the establishment of the Spanish missions in South Texas during the first half of the 18th
century, the remnants of the indigenous Native American groups were rapidly integrated into the
mission system or were subjected to outright extinction by depredation or disease (John
1975:171-174).
Spanish Colonial
The first European incursion into Texas was by Alvarez de Pineda in 1513 during the
course of a Spanish mapping expedition. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after
being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay (Folan et al. 1989:85). Between
1688 and 1717, Spanish explorers such as Mazanet and Espinosa passed through the Rio
Grande Plain from Mexico on their way to the Caddoan settlements in northeast Texas (Hester
1989b:80-81). These early Spanish explorers recorded observations about the aboriginal
groups in the region, but they were primarily engaged in consolidating territory for the Spanish
Crown.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Following the founding of San Antonio in 1718, the town of Laredo was established
along the Rio Grande in 1755 when rancher Tomas Sanchez de la Berrera y Gallardo was
granted permission by the great Spanish colonizer, Jose de Escandon, to form a new
settlement. Located in the province of Nuevo Santander, which included most of northeastern
Mexico and parts of present-day Texas, Laredo was one of a series of settlements that
Escandon established or authorized as part of Spain’s effort to colonize the area south of the
Nueces River (Clark and Juarez 1986:85; Folan et aI. 1986:6).
Mexican and Texas-American
Prior to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a Spanish garrison was established in Laredo
to minimize the effects of depredations by Lipan Apache and Comanche raiders. In 1790, a
daring attack on the city overran the garrison and exploded the powder magazine, deepening
fears “that the Comanches’ efforts to sweep through south Texas were succeeding” (Briggs
1982:7). Once the Texas-Mexico border was established along the Rio Grande in 1848, the role
of protection in the Laredo area passed to the United States. In 1849, a company of mounted
infantry under 2nd Lieutenant E.L. Viele arrived to establish an army post on “some high flats
west of the city, opposite a ford and just north of a bend in the Rio Grande” (Briggs 1982:7) on
the Texas side of the river about 3/4 of a mile west of the old Spanish town of Laredo. Originally
named Camp Crawford (or Camp Laredo), the name of the post was changed in 1850 to Fort
McIntosh in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James S. McIntosh, who died in September 1847 from
wounds received at the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican-American War (Frazer
1972). When construction began in 1850, the general military objective of the Fort was to
provide “escort service to caravans of travelers and [to reduce] Indian depredations and general
outlawry” (Briggs 1982:8).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2011). Similarly, a review of
the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer also indicated the presence of
no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2011). No
documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas data, no
previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within the Project Area.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms adjacent to Las Raices Creek, the Nueces River, and 1 of its relict channels,
it was Horizon’s original opinion that there existed a relatively high potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural resources at select locations within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible within or immediately
adjacent to the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map. This suggested a
decreased potential for undocumented historic-era standing structures or cultural deposits within
the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area on 30 November and 1 December
2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the
USACE jurisdictional areas and associated uplands within the Project Area. The TSMASS
require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2.0 acres for projects measuring between 11.0 and
100.0 acres in size. With this in mind, a total of 6 shovel tests would have been necessary to
meet the TSMASS within the 11.8 acres of USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area
(including associated uplands).
Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by
excavating a total of 26 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. If any new sites were recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 5-1, while shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area
resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site (41LS161). This site is
described below.

6.1

SITE 41LS161

General Description
Site 41LS161 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located above
the central USACE jurisdictional crossing traversed by the proposed access road ROW. It is
situated on an elevated ridge located immediately adjacent (southwest) of a relict channel of the
Nueces River and approximately 832.0 m (2731.0 feet) west of the modern channel of the
Nueces River (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). The ridge on which the site is located is within an area that
has been cleared in the past based on the lack of vegetation on the 1995 USGS 7.5-minute
Charco Marrano topographic quadrangle (Figure 6-1). Additionally, an approximately 30.5-m(100.0-foot-) wide pipeline ROW has also been recently cleared and graded across the portion
of the ridge traversed by the proposed access road ROW. These prior impacts have left the
surface of the site completely denuded of vegetation with a surface visibility of 100% over the
graded clay loam surface of the site (Figures 6-3 and 6-4).
A total of 5 shovel tests were excavated along the length of the proposed access road
ROW across the site. Of these, only 1 produced evidence of potential shallow cultural deposits
within the limits of the currently proposed ROW. This evidence consisted of the recovery of 1
chert flake from a depth of 0.0 to 20.0 centimeters (cm) (0.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface.
However, the field crew noted that the shallow clay loam deposits across the site had been
heavily turbated by the prior clearing and grading of the existing pipeline ROW within which the
proposed access road ROW is located. The field crew also noted that cultural materials were
evident in surface contexts in undisturbed areas immediately adjacent to the assessed access
road ROW. Given that this upland landform contains only shallow clay loam soils with a
decreased potential for containing deeply buried deposits, the field crew noted that the portion
of the site within the currently proposed access road ROW likely originally consisted of a
surficial lithic scatter and that the 1 chert flake recovered from subsurface contexts was in
disturbed contexts resulting from the prior grading of the existing pipeline ROW across the
landform. Based on the shape of the landform, in conjunction with the presence of lithic debris

observed in surface contexts in areas outside of the current ROW, the deposits of site 41LS161
appear to extend for an undetermined distance to the northwest and southeast beyond the limits
of the assessed ROW. As such, the entirety of the site was not evaluated.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41LS161 consist of 22 secondary and tertiary
chert flakes recovered from the graded surface of the site and 1 tertiary chert flake recovered
from a depth of 0.0 to 20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface in 1 of the 5 shovel tests
excavated across the site (Figure 6-5). All specimens consist of gray or tan fine-grained chert
typical of the Uvalde gravels found in the regions. No modified stone tools, temporally
diagnostic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on
the site.

Chapter 6.0: Results

Cultural Features
No evidence of cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or within any of
the 5 shovel tests excavated across the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the horizontal extent of site
41LS161 measures approximately 30.0 m (98.4 feet) northwest-southeast within the width of the
proposed access road ROW by 100.0 m (328.1 feet) northeast-southwest along the length of
the proposed access road ROW. Based on the landform traversed by the proposed access
road ROW, as well as the observation of surficial lithic specimens outside of the assessed limits
of the proposed ROW, the site appears to extend to the northwest and southeast beyond the
limits of the assessed ROW.
Based on the shovel testing efforts, the vertical extent of the site may range between 0.0
and 20.0 cm (0.0 to 7.9 inches) below surface. However, as noted earlier, the site is also
traversed by an existing pipeline ROW that has been previously cleared and graded. As only 1
chert flake was recovered from subsurface contexts within this previously disturbed ROW, the
vertical range of the assessed cultural deposits is somewhat suspect. Based on the field crew’s
observations, the site may have originally consisted of a surface scatter and current subsurface
deposits are likely in disturbed contexts.
Summary
Site 41LS161 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter located above
the central USACE jurisdictional crossing traversed by the proposed access road ROW. The
site consists entirely of lithic flaking debris located on a ridge above a relict channel of the
Nueces River. The vast majority of observed cultural material is confined to the disturbed clay
loam surface of the site, although 1 chert flake was recovered from subsurface contexts,
between 0.0 and 20.0 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (0.0 and 7.9 inches). However, due to
the disturbed nature of the proposed ROW at this location, the integrity of the subsurface
contexts is suspect. Aside from the observed lithic debitage, no modified stone tools, temporally
diagnostic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, or preserved floral or faunal remains were observed on
the site.
As the site’s boundaries may extend beyond the assessed limits of the proposed access
road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility status for site 41LS161 is considered to be
undetermined. However, based on the presence of only surficial and shallow subsurface
cultural deposits, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of preserved floral and
faunal materials, the portion of this site within the proposed access road ROW is considered to
be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 30 November and 1 December 2011, Horizon archeologists conducted a cultural
resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within Petrohawk’s proposed JC Martin
State Unit 1H well pad and access road ROW located in central LaSalle County, Texas. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the USACE
jurisdictional areas and associated uplands within the Project Area. The TSMASS require a
minimum of 1 shovel test per 2.0 acres for projects measuring between 11.0 and 100.0 acres in
size. With this in mind, a total of 6 shovel tests would have been necessary to meet the
TSMASS within the 11.8 acres of USACE jurisdictional areas within the Project Area (including
associated uplands). Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of
26 shovel tests within the USACE jurisdictional areas.
The cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the
documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site within the proposed access road ROW.
Site 41LS161 was documented as a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated on an upland
landform adjacent to a relict channel of the Nueces River. As this site’s boundaries may extend
beyond the assessed limits of the proposed access road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility
status for site 41LS161 is considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of
only shallow cultural deposits, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of
preserved floral and faunal materials, the portion of this site within the proposed access road
ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of the site.
Aside from 41LS161, no other cultural resources were documented within the USACE
jurisdictional areas within the Project Area.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that the portion of site 41LS161 within the proposed access
road ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of
the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of Petrohawk’s proposed JC Martin State
Unit 1H well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources.
Horizon therefore recommends that Petrohawk be allowed to proceed with the undertaking,
relative to the jurisdiction of the USACE and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently

discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well
pad and access road within areas under the purview of the USACE and the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately and the THC and USACE should be notified of the
discovery.
