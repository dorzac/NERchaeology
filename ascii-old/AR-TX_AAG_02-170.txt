ABSTRACT
In October 2011, American Archaeology Group LLC conducted an archaeological
survey of an 18.97 acre tract which consisted of a linear road expansion and new road
construction (9,760 feet of a linear tract with a 50 foot right-of-way) for the City of
Temple’s proposed Outer Loop-Wendland Road to Old Highway 81. The investigation
consisted of a pedestrian survey supported with mechanical augering. No archaeological
sites were identified during the survey. American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG)
recommends that construction within the project area should be allowed to proceed as
planned without archaeological monitoring. No artifacts were recovered; therefore, no
artifacts were curated and project records were curated at AAG.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple plans to construct a new linear road expansion and new road
construction (9,760 feet of a linear tract with a 50-foot right-of-way) for the City of Temple’s
proposed Outer Loop-Wendland Road to Old Highway 81 located on the northwest side of
Temple, Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area consisted of approximately 18.97 acres (50
feet of proposed road-right-of-way). It is depicted on the Troy 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic Zone 14
quadrangle map (Figure 2). The UTM coordinates for the approximate center of the two tracts are
Northing 3447772 and Easting 658266. The proposed impacts will be approximately 4-6 feet below
the surface. The project was funded by the City of Temple and was conducted under the auspices of
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6055 in order to comport with provisions of the Antiquities Code
of Texas (ACT) in anticipation of review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). A research
design and scope of work was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission prior to implementing
the project (Appendix I).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Bell County is located within the Balconian biotic province includes the Gulf coastal plain
from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Texas. The size and location of this province is described below
by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards Plateau as
limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4), the Lampasas Cut
Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west of the
Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred to
instead as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west. Bell
County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been classified by Thornwaite (1948)
as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27
and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum
temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Soils
Four soil series were located in the project area as depicted on sheet 20 of the Soil Survey
of Bell County, Texas (Huckabee and others, 1977): Altoga Series (AIE2), Austin Series (AsB,
AsC), Houston Black Series (HoB), and Stephen Series (StB). All of the soils are in situ soils
formed from residuum of Austin Chalk limestone. The Houston Black clay found along the
drainage of two intermittent streams crossing the study area has a veneer of alluvial/colluvial
silty clays over the A horizon. Due to the soil forming process, in situ derived soils would have
a very low probability of assemblages of sites in a primary context. No artifacts were uncovered
in the excavated trenches. Most of the surface of the study site has been disturbed by farming
and ranching; however, areas not disturbed, may have a relatively high probability of artifacts on
the surface.
The Altoga silty clay consists of deep soils formed in marly or clayey material weathered
chalk. These soils occur on toe and foot slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 10 percent. The thickness
of the solum ranges from 89 to 165 centimeters. The soils developed colluvial clays, marls, and
on fractured chalky limestone under a prairie vegetation of mid and tall grasses. The A horizon
is 5 to 28 centimeters thick. Colors are grayish brown, or light brownish gray silty clay. The
horizon is moderately alkaline, calcareous with a fine, subangular blocky and granular structure

4

with a clear smooth lower boundary. The B horizon is approximately 76 to 132 centimeters
thick, grayish brown to very pale brown, dark yellowish brown, grayish brown or light gray silty
clay with common soft and hard calcium carbonate concretions at a depth of 30 to 71
centimeters. The structure is moderate, fine, subangular blocky and granular. The horizon is
calcareous, moderately alkaline with common chalk fragments in the lower horizon. There is a
clear, irregular boundary between the B and C horizons. The C horizon is approximately 10
centimeter thick, weathered soft and crumbly chalk and marl that has interstices filled with light
gray, silty clay, material. The colors are grayish brown to very pale brown, dark yellowish
brown, grayish brown or light gray (Huckabee and others 1977).
The Austin silty clay consists of moderately deep soils underlain by fractured chalk.
These soils occur on uplands on broad ridges and adjoining side slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 6
percent. The thickness of the solum ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters. The soils developed on
fractured chalky limestone under a prairie vegetation of mid and tall grasses. The A horizon is a
20 to 51 centimeters thick. Colors are dark grayish brown, very dark grayish brown, light
yellowish brown, or light brownish gray silty clay. The horizon is moderately alkaline. The B
horizon is approximately 20 to 81 centimeter thick, grayish brown, pale brown, brown, or light
olive brown silty clay with common soft and hard calcium carbonate concretions. The horizon is
calcareous and moderately alkaline. The C horizon is approximately 36 centimeter thick, finely
divided, weathered soft and crumbly chalk that has interstices filled with loamy material. The
colors are reddish yellow, very pale brown, light brown, yellow or light gray. The horizon is
very calcareous and moderately alkaline (Huckabee and others 1977).
The Houston Black clay consists of deep, moderately well drained, clayey soils on
uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. The thickness of the combined A and AC horizons is
152 to 254 centimeters thick. The soils formed in clays and marls. The A horizon is a 20 to 116
centimeters thick, gray, dark gray, very dark gray, or black clay. The horizon is moderately
alkaline and calcareous with fine angular and subangular structure. Intersecting slickensides are
present at a depth of 51 to 61 centimeters. A few fine, weakly to strongly cemented
ferromanganese nodules. When dry the soils have cracks ranging from 1 to 8 centimeters in
width that extend in depth of more than 61 centimeters. The AC horizon is approximately 56
centimeter thick, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, brown, or light olive brown clay with
common fine to medium to grayish, yellowish, or olive mottles. The horizon has prominent
slickenside and shiny surface on peds. The horizon is calcareous and moderately alkaline. The
AC horizon has few to common mottles of olive brown, olive, or dark gray and has wavy lower
boundary. The C horizon is approximately 107 centimeter thick, yellow, light brownish gray, or
light gray clay with common olive or brown mottles. The horizon is moderately alkaline
(Werchan and Coker 1983).
The Stephen silty clay consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, clayey soils on
uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. The thickness of the solum is 20 to 51 centimeters
thick. The soils formed in material weathered from interbedded chalk, marl, or soft limestone.
The A horizon is an 18 to 38 centimeter thick, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown,

5

dark brown, or brown silty clay. The horizon is moderately alkaline and calcareous and has from
a few to 35 percent chalk fragments. The AC horizon is approximately 10 centimeter thick, very
dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, dark brown, or brown silty clay. The horizon is
alkaline and calcareous and contains from 80 to 90 percent soft chalk fragments. The C horizon
is a 56 centimeter thick, light gray to white interbedded chalk and marls (Huckabee et al. 1977).
Flora and Fauna
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this province is a
scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), stunted live oak
(Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the Edwards
Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of the region include
Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ash juniper (Juniperus ashei),
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus sp.), sumacs (Rhus sp.), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca
spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii),
Canadian wild rye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily
overgrown with juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding provinces
(Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Prycon lotor), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo), morning dove (Zenaida macroura),
scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western
coach whip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and the bull snake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Bell County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most archaeologists and is rich
in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Bell County and vicinity have been prepared by
various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell counties,
Texas (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson
et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse
Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region have been
published by Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough
articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. These works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by
Michael B. Collins (1995) and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas
Archeological Region" by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995),
represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following
discussion is taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term “Paleoindian;”
nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature, often to refer to
prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary means of subsistence.
Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times, Paleoindians exploited a diverse
range of fauna that not only included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but
also included smaller animals such as turtles, land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and
raccoons. The results of excavation of a cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that
the Paleoindian inhabitants of the site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy, in contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who
only pursued big game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants
(Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have been
excavated. For example, as of 1985, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell
County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of Paleoindian cultures consists primarily of surfacecollected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, distinctive Paleoindian
projectile points were found in multi-component surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al.
1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000
B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart points of the Angostura, Clovis, Folsom,
Golondrina, and Plainview types as defined by Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester
(1985).

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be
more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some
rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a
considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in Central Texas
immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is the Horn
Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County, Texas (Redder 1985). Collins (1999) reported on the Gault
Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still being studied.
Archaic Period
The Archaic is a comparatively lengthy cultural period, which persisted in Central Texas
from approximately 8500-1250 years Before Present (B.P.). According to Prewitt (1981:71),
“The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.” Prewitt (1981) has
subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the
phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic.
Carlson et al. (1986:15) grouped these into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a “strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of
low density.” These characteristics apparently were predominant during the Circleville, San
Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering
apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock
middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle Archaic into the Oakalla,
Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600 B.P.). It appears that
considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the Late Archaic than in the earlier
Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that while bison were important in the diet of
prehistoric peoples, they were not necessarily the principal food source during this time (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750
B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the
Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering
and an apparent peak in site density seem to have occurred during Prewitt’s (1981:82) Driftwood
phase. A majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which, according to
Prewitt (1981: Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is supported by Collins’
(1995:383) assertion that “two-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is ‘Archaic’ in
character.”

Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the Neo-American
Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and
Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin (1250-650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the primary distinguishing
characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates that during this period, the bow
and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and warfare, and that the use of ceramics
and the practice of horticulture first appeared in Central Texas and the surrounding regions.
According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the bow
and arrow were the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by pottery, and
finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the onset of these Late
Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice hunting and gathering as their
principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian
periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence for a different subsistence adaptation appears in
the archaeological record and this cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late
Archaic and the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious of the changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period was the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably quite similar to those in the
earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model of bison presence
and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were present during the Toyah
phase but not during the preceding Austin phase (Dillehay 1974).
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three sub-periods: early,
middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and European peoples and
cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared. The
early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the late 17th century with the first documented
arrival of Europeans. Bell County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who
inhabited the area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties
with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They
have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gatherers and who
lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including the
Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is known to
have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the
Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key animal resources as they

9

migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by the occurrence of glass
beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European manufactured ceramics. The
archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Bell County; Texas. In adjacent Coryell
County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the
Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse
Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
Historically, Bell County was first settled in 1834 and 1835 by colonists who settled along
Little River. The area was abandoned during the "Runaway Scrape" of 1836, reoccupied, and
deserted again after the fall of Fort Parker in June 1836. The early settlements were constantly
harassed by hostile Indians and, although several forts were established, by 1838 all settlers had left
the county. On May 26, 1839, the Indians suffered a decisive defeat at what is referred to as the
"Famous Bird Creek Fight" about one and a half miles northwest of the present site of Temple,
Texas. However, settlement did not return to the Bell County area until after 1843.
Bell County was created on January 22, 1850 and was named for Peter H. Bell. Nolan
Springs was chosen as the county seat and named Nolanville, but on December 16, 1851 the name
was changed to Belton. Early settlement was along the creeks and rivers. William Pepper and his
family were living on the west side of present-day Kegley Road when the 1850 census was taken.
The Kegleys, Carpenters, and others settled near Pepper Creek during the 1850s, and some
members of these early families are buried at Eulogy Cemetery. Early histories of Bell County refer
frequently to the Shallowford Crossing on the Leon River as an important transportation route for
wagon traffic. The exact location of this crossing has not been identified, but it substantiates the
importance of this part of Bell County during its early settlement. By 1860, most of the land had
been taken. The last serious Indian raid occurred in 1859. With the Indian problem apparently
resolved, settlement increased and the county grew from 4799 in 1860, to 9771 in 1870, and to
20,518 in 1880. The number of farms in the county increased from 640 in 1869, to 2231 in 1871,
and to 4249 in 1889. Bell County is chiefly an agricultural region with cotton and corn the leading
crops. The construction of Fort Hood led to a population increase in the county from 44,863 in
1940 to 74,145 in 1950.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society and Bell County
Archeological Society have made notable contributions. These include articles in the form of
bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society
members. Bell County has been the subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central
Texas Archeological Society. As a result of the above-mentioned investigations, "Bell County is
one of the better known Central Texas counties and has provided significant information toward the
understanding of prehistoric chronologies in this part of Texas" (Young 1987:9).
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and
artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in Bell County. Also present
are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information concerning
author and date of preparation. Information regarding previous work in other parts of Bell County
appear in the various references cited above, especially the Fort Hood series.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the project area.
Surveys by Bradle and Moore (1998), Moore, Bradle and Nordt (1996a, 1996b); Moore and Bradle
(1996) recorded 8 prehistoric and historic sites on Pepper Creek, 2 sites (1 prehistoric and 1 historic)
on Fryers Creek, and 1 site containing prehistoric and historic materials on an unnamed tributary
that flows into Bird Creek. Three of these sites (41BL1066, 41BL1069, 41BL1070) have been
subjected to Phase II testing (Bradle et al. 1997). Bradle et al. (2003) surveyed 101.2 acres, of
which the northern half of the current project traverses across. One site (41BL1202) was recorded
as a mid-twentieth century farmstead that was not considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark
(SAL). Bradle and Bernhardt (2008) surveyed another railroad construction project nearby that also
found no archaeological sites in the vicinity.
An archeological reconnaissance of a proposed wastewater collection and treatment
improvement in 1982 and 1984 by the Texas Department of Water Resources (Fox and Whitsett
1984) recorded eight prehistoric sites prehistoric sites (41BL259 - 41BL264 and 41BL278 41BL279). According to Fox and Whitsett (1984:6), "some site-specific investigations have been
done in Bell County (Watt 1936; Shafer 1963), but as yet detailed archeological investigations have
not been conducted in the Temple-Belton area." Except for testing at 41BL260 by Wayne C.
Young (1987) of the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation, Highway
Design Division (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1987, and the three tested sites
mentioned above, no additional site-specific investigations were identified during the literature
search for this project.
Bell County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks. However, certain
sections of the county have not been adequately investigated. The current project area falls within

11

this category. There is reason to believe that a large number of unrecorded sites exist along the
major streams of this area in the form of surface sites, possible rockshelter sites, and buried sites.

12

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, AAG conducted a background investigation. Site records at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for previously
recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the
region were examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to
the project area. The project was discussed with representatives of the City of Temple to ensure that
the field crew was aware of the correct route for the proposed sewer line.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished in October 2011 using the pedestrian survey method
supported by mechanical augering. Surface visibility was approximately 30-50% along the
proposed route, and higher along Moore’s Mill Road. In addition to intensive surface inspection,
33 mechanical auger tests were excavated (Figure 2) in order to provide a more expansive view of
subsurface soil deposits and all were negative (Appendix II). The depths of the auger tests varied
from 24 centimeters to 1.62 meters below the surface. The average depth of the auger testing was
62.48 centimeters below the surface. No cultural material was encountered in the auger tests. All of
the auger tests hit hard clay, calcareous, or caliche material (Figure 3).
The eastern portion of the project begins at Pegasus Road then curves southward towards
the intersection of Moore’s Mill Road and the BN&SF Railroad tracks then covers the existing
right-of-way of Moore’s Mill Road west until the intersection of Wendland Road that forms the
western boundary of the current project alignment. The eastern portion is contained on a ranch/farm
area that runs between two major livestock tanks that have disturbed a lot of soils in the area. The
western portion is along Moore’s Mill Road including the right-of-way which has been bladed and
cleared in the past and a number of utilities are also present, thus indicating a number of prior utility
installation impacts.
The extreme western portion of the line, approximately 200 meters, west of AT-1 (Figure 2,
see red-hatched lines denoting areas not surveyed) is an area that has been heavily plowed and
cultivated in the past. Permission was denied by the landowner to excavate, however, the soils are
mixed and visual inspection revealed that no artifacts or other cultural materials were resent. Only
two very small areas on the south side of Moore’s Mill Road could not be surveyed, other than the
Hendricks property and they were both less than 30 meters in length according to the staked
alignment (see red-hatched lines on Figure 2, one between AT-16 and AT-17, and the last between
AT-18 and AT-32. Shovel probes in these areas within the existing rights-of-way and visual
inspections revealed no cultural materials being present. Although no archaeological sites were
located, it is worth noting that just south of the project area near AT-10, two concrete slabs were
noted (Figure 4). These appear to be mid-late 20th Century but AAG did not have permission to go

13

beyond the project boundaries. No artifacts could be seen on the surface nor within the project
alignment.
One area that AAG could not access was located south of AT-14 which was the Lucy and
Jimmy Hendricks property (Volume 3156 Page 698) which was a short area along the alignment
and access was denied. It appears that two houses had been located on this property in the past 50
years according to Mr. Hendricks but have been bulldozed, and appear to be just outside of the
proposed project area based on the staked alignment. A modern shop building was present (Figure
5) but we could not photograph the rest of the property because of vehicles parked along the
property along with a lot of debris. Surface inspection from the property boundaries did not identify
any artifacts. Any future impacts further south of the right-of-way should survey and assess this
area.
On the northeast side of the intersection of Moore’s Mill Road and the BN&SF Railroad
tracks, there is a Bell County Historical Marker (Figure 6) denoting the nearby location of the
school that was built prior to 1885, west of the tracks (outside of the project area) but was moved
east of the railroad tracks after 1900 and called “Santa Fe School”. In 1921, the school was annexed
by the Temple I.S.D. This area just east of the railroad tracks had the densest vegetation but several
auger tests were excavated along the road right-of-way and nothing was found to indicate the
presence of the old school site. The school is probably located further to the north and at a higher
elevation. Any future impacts further north of the road area should focus on locating the Santa Fe
School site on both sides of the railroad tracks. AT 30-32 tested for the location of the school and
were negative.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area. Largescale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort Hood have recorded
the vast majority of sites in Bell County (see Archaeological Background and Previous
Investigations above). Recent projects by American Archaeology Group LLC personnel have
provided the majority of new data regarding prehistoric and historic utilization of the general project
area (see Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey did not identify any prehistoric or historic sites within the project area. It is
concluded that prehistoric groups did not consider the project area suitable for habitation. Overall,
the area is very disturbed and contains shallow to moderate soil deposits in many places. Should any
sites be present, the possibility for significant research potential is considered low. The entire project
area is located along low areas and existing shallow creek channels. As noted by Bradle et al.
(2003), the soils located in the local area are residual soils formed on underlying bedrock.

17

RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the proposed Outer Loop-Wendland Road to Old Highway 81 Road
Expansion Project in Bell County, Texas performed for the City of Temple did not identify any
prehistoric or historic sites in the project area. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that buried cultural
materials can be missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites be found during the
construction of this railroad detention pond, all work within the site area should cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, in
consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC, Kasberg Patrick & Associates LP, and the
City of Temple.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
As mentioned, during this initial phase of the investigation, the AAG staff contacted the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), in Austin, Texas, to determine if any
archaeological sites had been previously recorded within the current project area. The contents of
the AAG library were also examined as part of the project background search and much of the
preliminary archival work was accomplished in-house. Since AAG had conducted considerable
archaeological work in the vicinity of the project area on previous occasions, the AAG staff was
already familiar with the much of the general project background data.
Permit Application
Before beginning any fieldwork, AAG collaborated with the THC Archeology Division
review staff concerning the level of effort that would be required for the investigation and the results
were made available to the client before the survey commenced. Fieldwork began after issuance of
permit 3762.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed using the pedestrian survey
method supported by augering and/or backhoe trenching and examination of eroded and disturbed
areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Backhoe trenching may be used to
examine deep soils to determine if cultural deposits are deeply buried. Michael R. Bradle will act as
the Principal Investigator. Auger testing and backhoe trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum
Survey Standards for Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility and environmental settings that have potential for buried cultural
materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of high site
probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, cameras, compasses,
and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and archaeological
sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites, select areas in alluvial
settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites
identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site
locations will also be determined through the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site
will be recorded using the official State of Texas Archaeological Site Form. In no case will the
survey crew work outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the
client.

25

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered through
shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a field sack log.
They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a petition to discard is
prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to AD-THC
and the client. AAG will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and any other
records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area
and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before entering the
field.

III.

Obtain antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed area such as creek banks for buried or displaced artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit final report and turn in artifacts
for curation.
