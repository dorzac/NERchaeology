In anticipation of this project, Lone Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc. (Lone Mountain)
conducted an intensive survey of every source point and every third receiver line, in accordance with the scope of work and guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas, published by the Texas Historical Commission. Lone Mountain
archaeologists, Stephanie Waldo, Jeremy Pittman, Brian Patton, Chelsea Winter, Nicolas
Hostetter, Randy Davis, and Noel Pacheco performed this survey between January 30 and
February 12, 2018. Douglas Boggess is serving as Principal Investigator. The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 8293, as the project is located on lands owned or
maintained by the University of Texas.

awson Geophysical proposes to conduct a 3-D seismic survey on University Lands,
Pecos County, Texas. Geophones will be laid along receiver lines by crews using
ATVs, while vibroseis trucks will travel along source lines. No drilling or grubbing is proposed.

Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the NRHP
to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mi of the survey corridor. Nine
previously recorded sites and two previous surveys were documented within this search
radius. The sites, 41PC598, 41PC601, 41PC671, 41PC676, 41PC677, 41PC679, 41PC685,
41PC686, and 41PC687 are located outside the project area.
Lone Mountain found 19 archaeological sites and 37 isolated occurrences within the surveyed area. The isolated occurrences have been recorded in their entirety and no further
work is recommended. All vehicle traffic was rerouted to archaeologically surveyed space at
least 30 m from the nearest cultural material. The proposed seismic project was redesigned
so that both sites would be avoided regardless of eligibility. The GIS shapefiles for the sites
and their reroutes are given to project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further treatment is recommended.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately, and University Lands and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the NRHP on January 8,
2018 to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mi of the survey corridor. Nine previously
recorded sites and two previous surveys were documented within this search radius. The sites, 41PC598,

the project area.
Two surveys have been previously performed within the project area. In March of 2010 (TAS 5539) an 18.5mile long survey for the Tombstone 345 KV transmission line reported one historic site and four prehistoric
sites. The prehistoric sites included open campsites with hearths and burned rock with a low density of tool
manufacturing debris, a lithic procurement site, and a site with two hearth features. The single historic site
consists of glass, ceramics, brick fragments, and metal scraps associated with the Old Headquarters windmill.
The second survey, slightly one mile from the proposed project, was a seismic survey conducted in 2014 under
TAS 7032 and covered approximately 328 linear miles of seismic lines. Thirty-six new sites and six previous sites
were encountered. The sites consisted of isolated camp sites, lithic procurement sites, lithic scatters, and large
burned rock middens.

Three distinct complexes have been identified in west Texas for the Paleoindian period: Clovis, Folsom, and
Plano (a Dalton complex is known in the east). In general archaeological sites are assigned to particular complexes of the Paleoindian period based on the presence of distinctive diagnostic projectile points. The earliest
complex, Clovis, generally dates from as early as 10,500 to 9000 B.C. The tool assemblage is characterized by
Clovis points (which are bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points with a concave base), transverse end
scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, gravers, perforators, and hammerstones (Cordell 1997).
Folsom sites date from 9000 to 8200 B.C. The Folsom complex exhibits technological distinctions from the
Clovis complex. Diagnostic projectile points include fluted Folsom and unfluted Midland points, which are similar in outline. In addition to these points, the tool assemblages include spoke shaves, end scrapers, perforators, knives, denticulates, drills, choppers, awls, and abrading stones (Cordell 1997). Plano sites are generally
thought of as forming the terminal elements of the Paleoindian big game hunting tradition. Plano is known
for a number of artifact complexes. Each complex is distinguished by a series of large lanceolate and unfluted
projectile points, including Angostura, Frederick, Firstview, and Scottsbluff.

D E S C R I P T I O N

Human settlement in North America is first identified during the Paleoindian period (10,500 to 6500 B.C.).
Despite some evidence indicating a human presence in the New World earlier than 10,500 B.C., Anderson and
Faught (2000) argue that current evidence is insufficient to describe any cultural trends prior to the appearance of the Clovis complex at around 10,500 B.C., Hayden's (1976) arguments for the Malpais pre-San Dieguito/San Dieguito material notwithstanding (Heilen 2004). The Paleoindian period is characterized by a
subsistence strategy focused on hunting now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, including Bison antiquus and
mammoth. Diagnostic stone tools associated with this period include end scrapers and large, unstemmed lanceolate projectile points, which are often fluted. It is postulated that during this period, points were attached
to thrusting spears. A reliance on big game hunting has been established, but it is unclear to what extent
these people exploited other available resources such as plants (Judge 1982). Little evidence has been found to
suggest the use of structures during this period. From negative evidence, it has been assumed that people
lived a nomadic lifestyle with the use of structures apparently uncommon.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 10,500 TO 6500 B.C.)

1 :

The proposed project falls within a small sample of the Trans-Pecos region of west Texas, near enough to the
neighboring Southern Plains region to contain various times cultural traits familiar to archaeologists working in
the Southwest and on the Southern Plains. The current project is a reconnaissance, non-collection, no disturbance pedestrian survey. Given the location of the survey area, it is possible that a wide range of cultural
resources representing a considerable time span may be encountered. While the survey is aimed at identifying
these cultural resources, they must be placed in an established cultural context in order for their data potential
to be fully realized.

C H A P T E R

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6500 B.C. TO A.D. 700)
Although Paleoindian groups probably utilized small game and plant foods in addition to large game species,
a change in subsistence strategy to full reliance on these food sources marks the transition to the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period. Large-scale climatic changes and the extinction of megafauna caused people to
develop a more diverse subsistence base. Mobility was cyclical and more restricted in extent, compared to
Paleoindian strategies. Once productive resource procurement locations were established, these were often
reused on a seasonal basis.
This change in food procurement is marked by wide-ranging changes in the Archaic tool assemblage. While
Paleoindian assemblages consist mainly of projectile points and meat processing tools, a growing number of
groundstone implements suggest a greater reliance on plant foods at this time. Archaic projectile points are
shorter than those of the Paleoindian period, and larger than arrow points used during the following Ceramic
period. Points of this period are generally stemmed or corner-notched, and exhibit more extensive morphological variability and less precision in the quality of manufacture than those of the Paleoindian period.

The Archaic period is typically divided into an Early (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle (3500 to 1200 B.C.) and Late
Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 700), with the last few four hundred years between A.D. 300 and 700 referred to
as a Transitional period, when new technologies such as pottery and the bow and arrow seem to have slowly
come into use.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 700 TO 1600)
The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of the bow and arrow and the frequent use of
pottery. Any pottery found in the area may include many of the same types found in southeastern New Mexico
(e.g., brownwares and Chupadero Black-on-white, a decorated type frequently made in central New Mexico).
The earliest use of ceramics in southeastern New Mexico was initially suggested to have occurred between
A.D. 600 and 900 (Lehmer 1948, Corley 1965, Jelinek 1967). However, more recently, radiocarbon dates have
been obtained from a limited number of sites indicating that ceramics may have appeared as early as A.D. 200
(LeBlanc 1982). While the appearance of villages next to agricultural fields and reliable water sources appears
to have accompanied these new technologies in neighboring regions, current evidence suggests that life in
much of this part of the Southern Plains continued to resemble that of the preceding Archaic period, with an
increased reliance on bison toward the end of the period.
The end of the late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period is sometimes referred to as the Protohistoric period. Projectile points decrease in size, with small triangular points becoming the predominant type.
Many early Protohistoric sites appear to have been contemporary with Ochoa-phase settlements and may represent the appearance of Athabaskans in the region. The Spanish encountered Jumano (first called Teya) and
Apache (Querecho) groups in the area, and with European contact, metal projectile points appeared. The
Kiowa to the north speak a Tanoan language similar to that spoken in the Tanoan pueblos (Newcomb 1961).
Jelinek (1967) has suggested the Jornada Mogollon from the Fort Sumner area formed the ancestral core of
the Kiowa, who then ranged north and east pursuing bison, while the Jumano are possibly descended from
more southerly Jornada Mogollon (Newcomb 1961). However, establishing such pedigrees is difficult considering how poorly understood the movements of populations are at the end of the Formative period and
throughout the Protohistoric period.
HISTORIC PERIOD (AFTER A.D. 1540/1600)
The Spanish may have entered west Texas prior to A.D. 1536, when Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, surviving a
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly west Texas or portions of northern Mexico just to the south, crossed
into Arizona and making his way south into Mexico (Cabeza de Vaca 1983), though others argue that he was
already well to the south in northern Mexico (e.g., Weber 1992). Cabeza de Vaca's initial report concerning
the lands to the north led to a 1539 expedition by Fray Marcos de Niza. Cabeza de Vaca's and de Niza's
reports in turn prompted Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado to lead the 1540 expedition in search of riches to be
found in the fabled cities of âQuiviraâ (Katz and Katz 1985). West Texas came to be used as a route by later
Spanish explorers to areas north and east. Subsequent expeditions were led by Fray Agustin RodrÃ­guez and
Captain Francisco Sanchez Chamuscado in 1581, Antonio de Espejo in 1582, Don Juan de OÃ±ate y Salazar in
1598, and Gaspar CastaÃ±o de Sosa in 1590 (Kessell 1987). Following the establishment of Spanish settlements, presidios, and missions in what had become their northern frontier region, Dominguez de Mendoza
passed near the area in 1683 and Juan de Ugalde led an expedition into the area to pacify or otherwise
impress the Apache in 1787.
Native groups present in the area during the Spanish Colonial period were nomadic. Early Spanish records
indicate several native groups on the Llano Estacado including Apaches, Querechos, Vaqueros, and Teyas. Apachean groups extended their range to the southern portion of the state sometime in the 1500s. By about
1630, the Apache were ranging as far south along the Pecos as the Seven Rivers area. During the early 1700s,
Comanches and their allies drove the Apache from the Plains. The Apache settled in the Pecos Valley and in
the mountains of southeastern New Mexico. By the early to mid-1800s Comancheros had established trade
with the Pueblos, Comanche, and other residents of the Plains.

There were no permanent settlements in the area by Pueblo or Hispanic groups during the Spanish Colonial
period (Olmstead 1975). Traders were moving through the area on the Chihuahua Trail by 1840 Following the
Mexican-American War, the US Army established a fort at Comanche Springs and named it Fort Stockton. Fort
Stockton was established to protect the San Antonio-El Paso mail and was on the Butterfield Overland Mail
route. A Peter Gallagher established a town named St. Gall nearby to provide services for the fort in 1868. In
1871, Pecos County was established at St. Gall. By the 1880s the fort had closed and St. Gall was renamed
Fort Stockton. The Kansas City, Mexico, and Orient Railroad was built through the county in 1913, reviving
interest in land speculation and irrigation. An oil boom in the county in 1927 and additional oil booms
occurred in the early 1950s as more oil fields were discovered.

Shovel tests were to be excavated in settings that had potential for buried cultural materials and in places that
had a low surface visibility due to excessive vegetation. According to the survey standards, shovel tests would
be at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and were excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible.
They would be excavated in levels no thicker than 20 cm, with sediments screened through Â¼-inch mesh.
When cultural remains predating 1960 were encountered, a determination was made as to whether they were
an isolated occurrence or a site. Especially intensive low-interval survey was to have been conducted in areas
where previously recorded sites were expected within or near the project area.
ISOLATE DEFINITION
Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or
unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to
other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.
SITE DEFINITION
Sites are defined as any physical location of past human activities or events. Cultural resource sites are
extremely variable in size, and range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated
objects and features. A site may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as
hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations,
cists, corrals, and rock art are generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to specified social or cultural groups. Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old,
unless it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years
(Criterion Consideration G).

one Mountain found 19 archaeological sites and 37 isolated occurrences within the surveyed area.

SITE RECORDING
If sites were encountered, boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features were
marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites were
recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations
were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. GPS readings were taken to verify the accuracy of the field
plot and were taken from a datum located on each sketch map. Photographs were taken showing the setting
of each site and any unique or representative features. A representative sample of artifacts from each site was
recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms. Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools

were made. Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were
employed to determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned
rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials.
EVALUATION AND ELIGIBILITY
If encountered, sites were to be further evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility status. The key criterion for most
prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often dependent on the presence or absence of buried
cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as
noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several
characteristics. For example, indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along
road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.
Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase âburied cultural materialâ is used, the
term âintactâ is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.
Because the survey area is located on University Lands, sites are also assessed for eligibility for designation as
State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL), as detailed in Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10. Criteria to
be considered include:
1.The site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of
Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2.the siteâs archaeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3.the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4.the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and
5. there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and the official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot be
protected. (Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Rule 26.10)

L O C AT E D R E S O U R C E S

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
41PC828

Field No.: 2450-001
Temporal/Cultural Affiliation: Historic (A.D. 1927)
Eligibility: Ineligible
Site Type: Industrial
D e sc r i p t i o n
41PC828, located along a fenceline within a flat plain, is a historic artifact scatter with a depression feature
(possibly a cattle tank). Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, tarbrush, crucifixion thorn, Christmas tree
cholla, prickly pear, and various grasses and forbs. Visibility is approximately 80 percent.
Assemblage
Lone Mountain recorded approximately 80 percent of the 300+ artifacts at this site. The recorded assemblage
includes nine cans (one kerosene, two two-part, six unknown); 29 shards (19 purple, 10 clear); five sherds
(white semi-porcelain with blue paint); 100+ wire nails (from 2 inches to 4 inches long); 11 scraps of wire
cable; 73 burned bricks; eight metal fragments; six barrel hoops; and eight milled lumber fragments. Burned
brick is indicative of the forge necessary to maintain the âdrillbitsâ used by a cable-tool drill rig.
F e a t u re s a nd S i t e S tr u c t u re
The artifacts are clustered in a 32-m by 15-m area on the eastern side of the depression (Feature 1).
Feature 1 is a 30-m by 24-m, roughly circular excavated depression with the remains of an earthen berm along
its northern edge. The berm is up to 1 m tall at its highest point. This feature may be a cattle tank or may be a
pit associated with oil and gas production, and is presently approximately 50 percent intact.
Eolian sands are present to approximately 20 cm thick, as revealed within rodent holes. No subsurface cultural
remains appear to be present.

The site has been affected by construction and maintenance of a fenceline to the south, wind erosion, water

C o nc l us i o ns
41PC828 has a Historic (A.D 1927) cultural and temporal affiliation, based on the presence of burned brick,
and archival records. The site is located on University lands that were surveyed as such on December 15, 1879
by R. M. Thomson (http://www.glo.texas.gov/ncu/SCANDOCS/archives_webfiles/arcmaps/webfiles/landgrants/
PDFs/9/8/4/984950.pdf, accessed, April 25, 2018). This drill location appears in January 14th 1927 Fort Stockton Pioneer as Buell and Hagen's University No. 1, formerly Humprheys No. 2 University, and does not appear
to have been mentioned again. According to Pecos County records, the Humphreys Corporation acquired several drilling permits form the State of Texas in 1925, and assigned an oil and gas lease to W. B. Hagen and Garfield J. Buell, filed on February 15 1927 (Pecos County Oil and Gas 0045:214). Oil and gas exploration
continued throughout Pecos County, with financially significant discoveries well to the east of Fort Stockton at
the Yates Oil Field in 1927, then closer but to the south of Fort Stockton in early 1950s on the M.C. Puckett
and Son Ranch. The Gomez Ellenburger Field discovered to the west in 1962 may be the closest of the highly
producing oil fields thus far in the immediate vicinity of Fort Stockton, suggesting this particular well was not a
successful or otherwise noteworthy venture.
41PC828 is not associable with particular historic event or important historic persons. The site does not retain
characteristic historic workmanship and is unlikely to produce any additional important information. This site is
recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria and likewise ineligible for
designation as an SAL.

41PC843, located on a sand sheet with residual gravels, is a fire-cracked rock and lithic artifact scatter with
two thermal features. Vegetation includes mesquite, cat claw, creosote, hackberry, tarbrush, cholla, yucca,
prickly pear, and various grasses and forbs. Visibility is approximately 80 percent.
Assemblage
All observed artifacts were recorded. The assemblage includes 65 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (one primary
reduction flake, 41 secondary flakes, 17 tertiary flakes, one thinning flake, five pieces of angular debris); three
cores (two multidirectional, one bidirectional); and five flaked-stone tools (two bifaces, one biface/scraper, one
scraper, one hammerstone). Raw materials are chert, chalcedony, and quartzite.
More than 200 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site outside feature contexts.

41PC843 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) cultural and temporal affiliation, based on
an undated lithic artifact assemblage. The site appears to be a surficial manifestation, exposed on a deflated
surface but there is some sedimentary depth surrounding the features. This site is therefore recommended to
have an undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria and for designation
as an SAL.

Assemblage
No artifacts are present. Four pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site outside feature contexts.
F e a t u re s a nd S i t e S tr u c t u re
One feature was observed. Feature 1 is a 1-m in diameter concentration of 25 fire-cracked rocks. A trowel test
revealed buried fire-cracked rock to at least 10 cmbs. The feature remains approximately 25 percent intact.
Approximately 20 cm of eolian sediments have accumulated, as revealed within rodent burrows. Buried cultural deposits are present within Feature 1 and may be present elsewhere on the site.
S i te C o n d i t i o n
An abandoned two-track road runs through the site and an out-of-use utility post is present on the southwest
edge of the site. An overhead powerline, now dismantled, likely followed the two-track road. The site has
been affected by powerline and road construction, maintenance, and use; wind erosion; water erosion; and
bioturbation, leaving the location no more than 40 percent intact.
C o nc l us i o ns
41PC844 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) cultural and temporal affiliation, based on
the feature type. Trowel tests revealed subsurface fire-cracked rock in Feature 1 to at least 10 cmbs and there
is potential for additional buried cultural deposits elsewhere on the site. This site is therefore recommended to
have an undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.
41PC845

Field No.: 2450-500
Temporal/Cultural Affiliation: Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880)
Eligibility: Ineligible
Site Type: Artifact Scatter
D e sc r i p t i o n
41PC845, located on a very gently sloping plain west of a drainage, is a lithic artifact scatter. Vegetation
includes mesquite, cat claw, tarbrush, acacia, desert holly, creosote, crucifixion thorn, cholla, and various
grasses and forbs. Visibility is approximately 40 percent.
Assemblage
All observed artifacts were recorded. The assemblage includes 60 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (two primary
reduction flakes, 19 secondary flakes, 31 tertiary flakes, two thinning flakes, six pieces of angular debris); and
two multidirectional cores and three flaked-stone tools (two bifaces, one uniface). All lithic artifacts are of
chert.
No fire-cracked rock is present.
F e a t u re s a nd S i t e S tr u c t u re
No features are present. Up to 10 cm of eolian sands have accumulated over 15 cm of gravelly residual sediments, as revealed within a nearby drainage cutbank. Bedrock is exposed in some areas of the site and much
of the site surface is made up of gravelly residuum.
S i te C o n d i t i o n
The site has been affected by wind erosion, water erosion, and bioturbation and remains approximately 45
percent intact.
C o nc l us i o ns
41PC845 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) cultural and temporal affiliation, based on
the artifacts. No subsurface cultural deposits are in evidence and the site has shallow limited eolian sediments
that are unlikely to contain intact buried cultural deposits. This site is therefore recommended ineligible for
nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria and for designation as an SAL.

41PC846

Field No.: 2450-501
Temporal/Cultural Affiliation: Middle to Late Archaic (2500 to 1000 B.C)
Eligibility: Undetermined
Site Type: Artifact scatter with feature
D e sc r i p t i o n
41PC846, located within a broad drainage, is a lithic artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with one thermal
feature. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, desert holly, acacia, tarbrush, cholla, and various grasses and
forbs. Visibility is approximately 40 percent.
Assemblage
More than 200 artifacts are visible on the surface. Lone Mountain recorded 55 percent of all observed debitage and 100 percent of all other artifact types. The recorded assemblage includes 119 pieces of flaked-stone
debitage (one primary reduction flake, 36 secondary flakes, 61 tertiary flakes, seven thinning flakes, 14 pieces
of angular debris); three flaked-stone tools (two bifaces, one projectile point); and three multidirectional cores.
Almost all lithic artifacts are of chert, with three of chalcedony. The projectile point lacks a tip and a lateral
edge but roughly resembles a Langtry point, a type that dates between 2500 and 1000 B.C. (Turner et al.
2011:128).
Approximately 20 pieces of fire-cracked rock are scattered across the site outside feature context.
F e a t u re s a nd S i t e S tr u c t u re
One feature was observed. Feature 1 is a 3-m diameter concentration of at least 50 pieces of fire-cracked limestone averaging 7 cm in length. A trowel test revealed no subsurface cultural deposits within the feature. A
tertiary flake was found associated the feature. Sheetwash and wind erosion have left the feature approximately 15 percent intact.
Approximately 25 cm of eolian and alluvial sediments have accumulated, as revealed within a drainage cutbank. Trowel testing was negative for cultural deposits, at least within the feature but the site has some potential buried cultural deposits outside of feature contexts.

C o nc l us i o ns
41PC846 has a Middle to Late Archaic (2500 to 1000 B.C) cultural and temporal affiliation, based on the projectile point. Trowel testing found no buried cultural deposits, at least within the feature burs the site is located
in a floodplain, there is potential for buried cultural deposits outside of feature contexts. The site is recommended to have an undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP and for designation as an SAL.

Lone Mountain found 19 archaeological sites (Table 2.7) and 37 isolated occurrences (see Table 2.1) within the
surveyed area. The isolated occurrences have been recorded in their entirety and no further work is recommended.
The proposed seismic project was redesigned so that all sites would be avoided regardless of eligibility. All vehicle traffic was rerouted to archaeologically surveyed space at least 30 m from the nearest cultural material. The
proposed seismic project was redesigned so that both sites would be avoided regardless of eligibility. All vehicle
traffic was rerouted to archaeologically surveyed space at least 30 m from the nearest cultural material. The
GIS shapefiles for the sites and their reroutes are given to project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further treatment is recommended.
If buried cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should
cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
