MANAGEMENTSU~Y

The archeological site of Pavo Real (41BX52) was excavated in 1979 and 1980 by personnel of the
Texas Department of Transportation (then the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation) within
the right-of-way of FM 1604 at the Leon Creek crossing. The site was occupied at several different times in
prehistory and contains an important sequence of archeological deposits. Of particular significance are the
earliest archeological remains which derive from the early Paleoindian period (between 10,500 and 11,500
years ago). No report has been produced on these materials, and the state antiquities permit is more than 10
years past due.
The accompanying document is an evaluation of the collection and records from the 1979-1980
excavations which considers their suitability for the conduct of a thorough analysis and production of a
comprehensive report to satisfy the terms of the antiquities permit. Although deficiencies, most of which
cannot be corrected, exist in the data and records, it was determined that a satisfactory study can be concluded
and reported. The critical deficiency that possibly can be partially overcome is lack of comprehensive data
on the nature of natural deposits containing the early Paleoindian archeological materials.
The final sections of this document are a proposed plan and budget for the analysis, interpretation, and
preparation of a final report. The proposed analysis emphasizes the Paleo indian remains from the site but
addresses a number of questions about human adaptation and cultural change through the time the site was
occupied. A very limited amount of exploratory fieldwork designed to recover information on the geology of
the Paleoindian-age deposits is recommended to bolster the environmental and site-formational aspects of the
interpretations.
A total cost of $331,934 is estimated to conclude this project, including the maximum amount of field
investigation. In the fairly likely event that the preliminary geological investigation fails to indicate the
presence of intact deposits of late Pleistocene age, the detailed geological fieldwork would not occur. This
would reduce the total cost to approximately $325,000.
As structured in this proposal, it would require an estimated 20 months to do the analysis and produce
the final report.

Many people helped directly and indirectly in the making and completion of this document. Kaylee
Stallings inspected the lithic collection and entered TxDOT specimen inventories into a computer data base;
Pamela Headrick drafted all maps and figures, and Jerrilyn McLerran edited the document. Their competent
work is reflected throughout this manuscript.
Thomas R. Hester, C. Britt Bousman, Jan Guy-Motriuk, and Kevin Jolly provided useful comments
and advice concerning the history of investigations of the site, archeology of the region, report preparation and
structure, and computer data management.
Throughout the initial phase ofthe assessment ofrecords and collections, much background information
was provided by Jerry Henderson (TxDOT), Glenn Goode (TxDOT), and Charles A. Johnson. Their
recollections and observations in many cases served to clarify certain ambiguities in the records and provided
additional perspectives often not recorded at the time ofthe excavations. Certainly, the problems accruing from
the attempt to interpret and utilize records created by others, some 14 years in the past, are many, but the
cooperative efforts of these individuals and others at TxDOT have served to overcome many of these
difficulties.

INTRODUCTION

The Pavo Real site (41BX52), located in north central Bexar County, Texas, was excavated by
personnel of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) from May, 1979, to January, 1980.
Archeological investigations at the site documented prehistoric cultural remains stratified in geologic
deposits comprising part of the fill of Leon Creek valley. Two distinct periods are discernible in the
depositional history at this site. The first period, inferred to date from latest Pleistocene into earliest
Holocene times, is characterized by relatively rapid aggradation of stream-laid sediments on the valley
floor; early Paleoindian cultural remains (of Clovis and Folsom affinities) occur in a distinct zone within
these deposits. The second period, representing the remainder of the Holocene, was a time of slow
aggradation of natural deposits, and substantial quantities of archeological materials (of Archaic affinities)
accumulated there.
The data generated from the excavation of the Pavo Real site have not been analyzed or reported.
This assessment of records and collections is intended as a preliminary step toward that end and is
structured to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the data recovered at this important site. As
reported here, information for the Archaic remains is biased by such factors as time constraints, methods
of data recovery, and loss of information during Gradall operations. On the other hand, a much more
complete record is available for the Paleoindian component. Although data from the entire site are
significant and warrant thorough study and dissemination, it is the earlier period that clearly has the
greater importance.
A critical aspect of the Paleoindian period at 41BX52 is the question of why artifacts apparently
of Folsom and Clovis affinities are found together. Considerable evidence from elsewhere supports an
interpretation that Folsom succeeded Clovis manifestations in the prehistory of North America. In spite
of this evidence, it is not possible to discern a difference in the absolute ages of the two using radiocarbon
techniques (Haynes 1992), and, in fact, the two may overlap in time.
Alternative explanations for this situation at Pavo Real are that mixing of materials of different
ages occurred; that distinct but coeval cultural groups used the locality; or that a single cultural group
possessing a mix of Clovis and Folsom traits was responsible for the assemblage. Extant data from the
site are inadequate for addressing this issue, but there is the possibility that more refined stratigraphic
evidence could be gathered from limited exposures along the southern edge of the site area. Thus, a
recommendation is made that a minor amount of geologic sampling be conducted to gain evidence on the
nature of the geologic context of the Paleo indian materials.
Because Pavo Real is clearly significant on a local, regional, and even continental basis, detailed
analysis of the data from the site and a full report of the findings are needed.

SITE LOCATION AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Pavo Real (4IBX52) is a stratified, multicomponent open site located in northwestern San
Antonio, Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). At the time of excavation, the site was cut by two-lane
FM 1604 and is today covered by highway overpass berms accommodating eight traffic lanes. At the
juncture of three major physiographic zones-the Edwards Plateau, the Blackland Prairie, and the interior
Coastal Plains-the area is comprised of low rolling hills with gentle slopes stretching into grassy plains,
with diverse vegetation reflecting the transitional aspects of the setting (Black 1989a). Blair (1950)

The site is located on and in a semicircular terrace which makes up the interior of a bend of Leon
Creek, a tributary of the Medina River. The terrace surface extends approximately 400 m northwest to
southeast and 200 m east-west. Although the depth of the fluvial and colluvial terrace deposits is
unknown at the present, TxDOT trenching extended to at least 3 m without reaching bedrock. During the
initial survey, the bank was observed to be at least 1.5 m high along the creek (Site Survey Form 1970,
TARL). Based on cultural materials recovered during the excavations, deposition started here prior to the
end of the Pleistocene.
North of the terrace, Leon Creek arcs toward the east, while to the south it widens considerably
(Figure 2). On the west side of the creek, there is a limestone bluff; in its face, numerous chert lenses
are exposed.
As illustrated in Figure 3, the site was divided into five areas of excavation. Area 1, located some
10m west of the main concentration of surface and near-surface remains and closest to Leon Creek,
encompassed a section 9 m (north/south) by 8 m (east/west). Area 2 was 11 m southwest of Areas 3 and
4 and was sampled by a single trench that revealed very sparse cultural materials. Excavations were
concentrated in Areas 3 and 4, located generally in the center of the terrace; this central area contained
the densest cultural manifestations of both Paleoindian and Archaic cultural affiliations. Combined, these
span an area of approximately 55 m (north/south) by 45 m (east/west). Area 5 lies 67 m northeast of the
main site across former FM 1604 and covers approximately 8 m (north/south) by 6 m (east/west).
TxDOT investigations revealed at least four cultural components at 41BX52: Early Paleoindian
and Early, Middle, and Late Archaic. According to the excavators (Henderson n.d.; Jerry Henderson and
Glenn Goode, personal communications 1993), the Paleoindian deposit occurred 50 to 70 em below
surface, averaged 15 to 20 em in thickness, and was isolated above and below by gravel lenses. Within
this deposit, a "cultural lens" estimated to be 2-3-cm thick was found to contain artifacts with both Clovis
and Folsom affinities. Reference to this unit as a "paleosol" (Henderson and Goode 1991 :26) was in error
(Jerry Henderson and Glenn Goode, personal communications 1993).
The Archaic component, which included several hearths and burned rock middens, is described
as being "somewhat mixed." Henderson (1980, n.d.) observes that erosional processes such as sheetwash
have occurred at the site since at least the time of this occupation. Also, cultural site-formation processes
related to midden construction and use likely have disturbed and mixed these deposits further.

mSTORY OF INVESTIGATIONS
Site Discovery

The site was recorded by high school students Paul McGuff and Bill Fawcett on October 10, 1970,
fonowing its identification by Anne Fox, then of the Witte Museum, San Antonio. Described in the
survey as Leon Creek No.5, it later was recorded as 41BX52 at TARL on November 3, 1970 (see also
Fawcett [1972] for a discussion of the Leon Creek archeological area).
The two students noted a large "campsite" on the east side of Leon Creek ubrought to light by the
highway department's recent clearing of the 600' right-of-way of brush It (Site Survey Form 1970, TARL).
According to them, the site had been ubulldozed" on the southern side to remove vegetation, although the
northern edge of the right-of-way apparently had not been disturbed.

During their random surface collection (a ca. 100-it? area), Fawcett and McGufffound numerous
large chunks of flint "in greater quantities than had been observed at other sites thus far on Leon Creek, It
suggesting a nearby quarry site (Site Survey Form 1970, TARL). They also noticed numerous Itfrrepitslt
located close to the creek. Only two projectile points were collected, and although specific types were
not mentioned in their report, the temporal designation assigned was "Archaic" (Site Survey Form 1970,
TARL).
In 1974, local archeologists brought the site to the attention of TxDOT officials when plans to
widen FM 1604 were reported in the San Antonio newspaper (Thomas R. Hester, personal communication
1993). One of the archeologists, Thomas R. Hester, had observed some "flakes and burned rocks coming
out of alluvial clays on the slope toward the creek" (letter to Frank Weir, TxDOT archeologist,
February 25, 1974).
By early spring of 1979, some clearing and grading had already occurred (Jerry Henderson,
personal communication 1993), and cultural materials were exposed at the surface. During a visit to the
site by Weir, several hearths and a Pedernales projectile point were observed (Thomas R. Hester, personal
communication 1993), and it was decided that mitigation of the site was necessary. Road work was
temporarily halted, and archeological operations by TxDOT began in May of 1979, for an initial threeÂ­
month period. After significant finds were made, the investigation was expanded and continued through
the early part of January of 1980.

TxDOT Investigations: Methods and Extent of Excavations

The original objective of the mitigation phase was primarily to salvage as much information as
possible within stipulated time limits. Because no previous testing phase was undertaken (Glenn Goode,
personal communication 1993), excavators initially were recovering information without full knowledge
of the stratigraphy and material-culture constituents of the site. As a result of this and other factors, a
variety of strategies were implemented throughout the eight-month investigation. Approaches were altered
in response to time constraints, types of materials recovered, and the expertise of the crew.
Information on the methods of investigation employed at 4lBX52 has been reconstructed from
the daily journal and level records (see Site Assessment, below). As noted, there are certain areas in
which sources are at variance or where gaps exist. In such situations, Henderson and other crew members
frequently have been able to provide sufficient clarification to permit an llllderstanding of the basic
procedures. Because these operations varied both in complexity and methods in each area, they are
described separately in some detail below.

Backhoe Trenches

Prior to the initiation of hand excavations, four backhoe trenches were dug to provide some
stratigraphic information and delimit the boundaries of the site. Three trenches framed the portion of the
terrace on which the site was observed; a fourth cut east-west in a line perpendicular to the creek (see
Figure 3).
Trench 1 was located in the northwest quadrant of the site. With a linear extent of 10m, it ran
east-west off the edge of the terrace slope and paralleled FM 1604. Trench 2, approximately 15 m long,
paralleled Trench 1 and was located in the southwest portion of the site. Trench 3 (ca. 41 m long) ran
6

north-south along the edge of the terrace, and Trench 4 (50 m long) was located farther north paralleling
FM 1604.
The trenches ranged from 1.5 to 3 m in maximum depth, and at least nine different stratigraphic
deposits were observed and labeled as "zones" (discussed below). In initial stages of fieldwork, it
appeared to Henderson that "the occupation was within the top 12-18 inches of deposits," (daily journal
6-6-79). Based on cultural materials exposed in trenching, the presence of a Middle to Late Archaic
component was recognized, and the possibility of an Early Archaic occupation was raised. Some insight
into the boundaries of the site was also gained. Trenches 1,3, and 4 showed the densest cultural material
accumulations. In contrast, Trench 2 produced very sparse cultural materials, and investigations were
subsequently abandoned there.
An additiona114 trenches-labeled for this assessment "Geologic Trenches"-were dug by Charles
Johnson at times during the mitigation phase (see Figure 3). Although his records provide further
stratigraphic information about the site (see Profile Drawings and Stratigraphic Data below), these have
not as yet been correlated with the archeological data (Jerry Henderson, personal communication 1993).

Excavation Areas

Three areas of excavation (Areas 1,3, and 4) were delimited and labeled according to the trenches
immediately adjacent to them (see Figure 3). Another locale-Area 5-was tested in a very limited fashion
(see below). As noted above, early efforts were concentrated in Areas 1 and 3 which appeared to contain
the densest burned rock concentrations and lithic debris.
Trenches in the different areas revealed stratified deposits and possibly soils which were labeled
"zones" by the excavators (Figure 4). In Area 1, only seven stratigraphic zones were recorded (Zones 1Â­
7). In Areas 3 and 4, nine zones (Zones 1-9) were defmed. Although a preliminary attempt was made
to correlate zones from Area 1 with those of Areas 3 and 4 (see Profile Drawings and Stratigraphic Data,
Profile 13 below; also daily journal 6-26-79), there is some inconsistency in the records. These data will
require further study, and it is possible that the two areas cannot be correlated with confidence. In Area
5, only three deposits were observed (Zones A, B, and C), and no records were found correlating zones
in this area to the rest of the site.
Very little information regarding the laying of the grid was found in the records. However, it
appears that the southeast stake coordinates were used as the unit identifiers in all areas. In the early stage
of mitigation, the basic method of excavation was to open 2-x-2-m units which were hand excavated in
10-cm arbitrary levels. Earth removed was screened through 114-inch mesh. Once the bottom of a level
was exposed, observations and drawings were recorded on a standardized level form, and photographs
(color, black and white, and Polaroid) frequently were taken.

AREA 1

Initial excavation in Area 1 was focused on documentation of Feature 3 (a sheet midden). For
this purpose, eight 2-x-2-m units were opened. Once the base of the midden was reached (at a depth of
approximately 15 em below ground surface), excavation strategy changed. According to Henderson, a
backhoe was used to remove deposits down to those containing Early Archaic remains, based on
stratigraphic and cultural evidence revealed in Trench 1 exposures. During that operation, "it was decided

to sacrifice some later Archaic deposits in an attempt to reach the Early Archaic" (see daily journal entries
5-31-79; 6-26-79; and 8-1-79).
Subsequent excavation by hand followed natural deposits which were labeled as "zones." As
mentioned earlier, the meaning of these zones and how they correlate with the stratigraphy in the rest of
the site is not readily discernible from existing documentation (e.g., Zone 4 in Area 1 is not equivalent
to Zone 4 in Areas 3 and 4).
In the deeper deposits of Area 1, the Early Archaic component was verified. Apparently, once
excavations reached Zone 6, a small test pit (.45-x-.35 m) was opened to ascertain the extent of this
deposit, and an Early Triangular point was recovered during the process.
The units in Area 1 were not all excavated to the same depth, and none was taken to bedrock.
Since the units were not excavated using arbitrary levels, it is difficult to determine the average maximum
depth or total levels excavated per unit. However, the total hand-excavated volume l is estimated to be
12.7 m\ and the total hand-excavated area is approximately 32.15 m2 â¢
It is not clear from records why excavations were discontinued in this area. During conversations
with Goode (1993), however, he explained that the cultural occupation of the site in this area appeared
to begin with the Early Archaic.

AREAS 3 AND 4

Excavations in Areas 3 and 4 were conducted using a variety of techniques. These can be more
clearly understood within a two-step chronological framework: the first stage encompassed excavation
of the midden (Feature 4) and other underlying arbitrary levels prior to the identification of the
Paleo indian component; the second entailed excavation of this component in the remaining units after
overburden was stripped by Gradall.

Area 3

A total of 88 units was opened in Area 3, 27 of which (chiefly in the Feature 4 midden area) were
fully hand excavated. The remaining 61 were hand excavated after 40-50 cm of overburden was stripped
by Gradall in order to reach the older deposits. These two sets of units are discussed separately because
the methods of excavation and recovery varied.
The first set, the 27 units hand excavated from ground level, varied in size: 22 were 2-x-2 m, 3
were l-x-2 m, and 2 were l-x-l m. A total of 147 levels was excavated by hand. Anywhere from 1 to
9 levels was excavated in each unit, averaging 5.4 levels per unit. Only 6 units were dug down to the
Paleo indian zone (see Testing below). Total hand-excavated area is 96 m2 , and volume is 51.8 m3 â¢
As in Area 1, the main problem in quantifying the excavations in this first set of units in Area 3
results from the lack of explanatory records documenting the variability in depth from unit to unit. It is
not clear why excavation was stopped in some units yet carried to lower levels in others, although

IAIl estimates of excavated volume and area were calculated by TARL personnel based on field records.

decrease in density of artifacts at lower depths likely was a detenuinant. The majority of hand-excavated
units in this first set (an estimated 16 of the 27) did reach a lower gravel lens previously observed in
trench exposures. These gravels initially were thought to be no younger than 17,000 years and thus not
likely to be bearing cultural remains (see daily journal 8-20-79). During this phase of the excavation, the
Paleoindian component at the site had yet to be recognized.
Procedures changed radically after the discovery of a fluted point in mid August during excavation
of Unit N151E6, Level 5 (40-50 cm below surface) in Area 3. From that time until mid September,
emphasis was on the recovery of more diagnostic materials that would validate the presence of a
Paleoindian component at the site. Excavations were greatly accelerated. As a consequence, record
keeping and recovery techniques were altered considerably. Level record fonus were not filled out, and
daily journal entries were not made during this period. Dirt was shoveled out of the units onto a 112-inchÂ­
mesh screen. A small measure of control was maintained, however, by bagging artifacts according to
provenience (generally, unit and estimated arbitrary level).
Once additional, clearly identifiable Paleoindian artifacts were found and the component was
recognized to be discretely isolated between two gravel layers (upper and lower), a Gradall was brought
to the site to remove the upper 40-50 cm of overburden in units not yet excavated. Using this strategy,
the second set of units (N 61) in Area 3 was machine excavated down to the surface of the upper
gravels. During this phase, Henderson noticed "several hearths" in supposedly Early Archaic contexts
which were removed without written documentation due to lack oftime (see daily journal 9-17-79). Thus,
deposits (with an estimated volume of 83.20 m3 ) possibly containing Early to Late Archaic materials were
sacrificed.
To reach the Paleoindian component, the upper gravel layer mentioned earlier first had to be
removed; for that procedure, picks and shovels were used (Jerry Henderson, personal communication
1993). No records were kept to document this operation; since the dirt was not screened, it is impossible
to detenuine quantitatively whether the cultural materials in the gravels had considerably decreased relative
to the deposits above, as Henderson believed (daily journal 8-20-79).
The Paleoindian deposit (Folsom Zone 5) had a variable thickness of approximately 15 to 20 cm
and was removed in two troweling episodes (first and second cutting). The first troweling episode
(sometimes referred to as PI) stopped once tithe highest concentration of artifacts was reached" (daily
journal 12-5-79). The second troweling (or P2) was taken down to the surface of the lower gravels. In
most cases, after the first troweling was completed, artifacts 2 em or larger were left in place and plotted,
and individual elevations were recorded (daily journal 12-5-79). The same procedure was followed for
the second troweling. Throughout this phase of the excavation, dirt loosened by troweling was screened
through 114-inch mesh.
The 61 units comprising the second set in Area 3 were excavated in this fashion. Forty-one units
were 2-x-2 m, 19 measured l-x-2 m, and a single unit was 1.5-x-2 m. The total area excavated was
205 m:O\ and the total hand-excavated volume was 30.75 m3 â¢ The excavations during this phase were well
documented, apparently due to the hiring of additional trained archeologists (daily journal 11-5-79).

Area 4

In Area 4, a total of 66 units was opened. Of these, 55 were 2-x-2 m, 10 were l-x-2 m, and 1
was initiated as a 2-x-2 m unit but completed as l-x-2 m. According to Henderson (daily journal 10-12Â­
79), there was an attempt to excavate the Paleoindian component tllOO percent," providing a broad,
10

horizontal exposure. To expedite this process, a GradaH again was used to remove the overburden down
to the upper gravel lens in Area 4 (daily journal 11-5-79). Once that had been accomplished. the same
strategy of data recovery used for the Paleoindian component in Area 3 WAS employed (see Area 3
discussion, above). The total excavated area in Area 4 was 244 m2 â¢ A total of 36.6 m3 was excavated
by hand, and 85.60 m3 was GradaH removed. Only six units in Area 4 were hand excavated from the
ground surface, with a maximum of nine levels attained in two of them. These latter two units may be
of particular value in providing information on levels below the Paleoindian component (see Testing
below).

AREAS

In Area 5, the ground surface had been severely disturbed by road grading and, according to
Henderson, future activity of the same nature was imminent (daily journal 7-16-79). It also appeared that
fill had been removed from the general vicinity of Area 5 to use for a bridge embankment (daily journal
7-16-79). A dense accumulation of cultural materials and what appeared to be a burned rock midden were
observed. Because of the disturbed nature of the area, it was decided to place only a few test units there
(daily journal 6-21-79).
In all, five 2-x-2-m units were completely excavated by hand in arbitrary 10-cm levels. From 2
to 5 levels were excavated in each unit for a total of 21. The total excavated volume in Area 5 was
8.40 m3, and the excavated area 20 m2 â¢ Excavations revealed that the midden, although heavily disturbed,
contained some intact sections (daily journal 7-26-79). Based on diagnostics (e.g., possible Castroville
and Marcos points), the excavated material was ascribed to the Late Archaic. Because FM 1604 cuts
between Area 5 and the main excavation area to the south and because of the disturbances which had
occurred there, no clear relationship between the two areas could be established.

Testing below the Paleoindian Levels

Toward the close of the mitigation period, three test units (N311W13, N351W15, and N421W24)
were dug in Area 4 to ascertain the depth of cultural deposits at the site. One was 2-x-2 m, and two were
l-x-2 m. The units previously had been excavated through the Paleoindian component (Zone 5) to the
underlying gravels (Zone 6). In the final test phase, Zones 7, 8, and 9 (as identified in trenches) were
reached in at least two of the units. The maximum thickness of the combined lower zones (6-9) ranged
from 30-50 cm.
The strategy of excavation for these units was to first remove the Zone 6 gravel layer with picks
and shovels and then discard it. The remaining zones were more carefully excavated, and dirt was
screened through 1/4-inch mesh. Chert flakes, some identified in the field as utilized (daily journal 1-9Â­
80), and chunks were found in infrequent amounts both in the gravel lens and in underlying deposits,
including Zone 9. It is unclear at this point whether the lowest tested deposit was totally devoid of
cultural material (see discussion in daily journal 12-18-79, 1-8-80, 1-9-80, 1-10-80, 1-12-80).
Although these test units may provide some insights into the occurrence and nature of the chert
materials in lower zones, there is likely not sufficient data to interpret their meaning or to fully address
the possibility of a cultural occupation below the identified Paleo indian component in Zone 5. However,
additional information may be gleaned from other units (NllIE2, N131E2, N151E2, N171E4, N2S/W4,
N311EI0, N36/W36, and N351W15) in Areas 3 and 4 where excavations extended to lower levels possibly

11

below the Paleo indian zone. These units were dug prior to the identification ofthe Paleo indian component
in arbitrary levels which, at this time, cannot be directly correlated to the natural zones used in later
procedures. It appears, however, that materials recovered from arbitrary Levels 7, 8, and 9 should be
carefully examined toward that end.

ASSESSMENT OF DOCUMENTS AND COLLECTIONS
Introduction

This section details results of an assessment of records and materials pertaining to 41BX52.
Discussion is organized in broad categories, according to document and material type, with inventories
presented both in text tables and appendixes. Observations as to potential usefulness as well as limitations
of the data are woven throughout the relevant sections and summarized in a concluding segment
recommending avenues for further analyses.
For this assessment, all records were inventoried and examined as to their completeness, accuracy,
and analytical potential. As previously mentioned, different forms and tables were created to facilitate
the extraction of information and enable a more-comprehensive evaluation. Several types of documents,
however, required a slightly different approach. For instance, level records were examined individually
and in conjunction with relevant entries in the daily journal and artifact log books. This crosschecking
helped to identify information gaps in the level record forms. For features and special samples, abstracts
of information were created to draw together data from various sources. A computer database of the lithic
collections also was created using the TxDOT lot books. This enabled the generation of an inventory and
quantification of the various types of artifacts present which facilitated budget and scheduling projections
for the analysis of this collection.

Documentation

Documentation from 41BX52 includes the daily journal, level record forms, plan and topographic
site maps, profile drawings, laboratory records, and photographic records. Only the level records were
kept on standard forms (TxDOT). These were completed by various crew members, as were most of the
other records. Exceptions are a geologic notebook, which was prepared by the staff geologist, and the
daily journal, which was kept by the project director. Since elevations, stratigraphic data, and information
relevant to features were not kept in specific field notebooks, it was decided for this assessment to extract
this data from available records and discuss them separately. The stratigraphic data are discussed in
conjunction with the profile drawings.

Daily Journal
Jerry Henderson maintained ajournal for the mitigation phase of 41BX52 which mainly describes
the daily progress of the excavations. The journal provides a chronological record of the investigations
in the different areas of the site, as well as information on the excavated units (by arbitrary and natural
levels), features, and elevations. This document also contains brief explanations on the methods and
sampling strategies. Finally, throughout the journal, tentative interpretations on the stratigraphy and
depositional history of the site can be found.
12

Henderson's journal is comprehensive but not complete. Records indicate a total of 169 days of
fieldwork. However, for a total of 49 working days (ca. 30 percent) there were no entries. The mostÂ­
affected months were September and October of 1979. According to Henderson (daily journal 9/17/1979),
careful notes were not taken during this period because they were "plowing through the upper 40 to 50 cm
in an attempt to reach the Clovis occupation." Therefore, considerable information was sacrificed and lost
during this procedure (see Methods section).
Putting aside these missing entries, the daily journal can be considered an excellent source of
information. Hence, it will become pivotal for the reconstruction and interpretation of different aspects
of the site, such as provenience of special finds, features, integrity of the Paleo indian occupational surface,
and general stratigraphy. Each of these aspects is discussed briefly.
A critical aspect of Henderson's journal is the attention paid to individual finds and samples. Her
chronicle of proveniences (horizontal and vertical) of significant artifacts and charcoal samples serves as
a crosscheck with the level record forms and lot book inventories. For example, more-complete
documentation for the Archaic charcoal samples was found in the daily journal than in any other records
(see Special Samples, below).
In general, a great deal of information was documented for features in the level record forms.
However, fewer data are available for the Archaic than for the Paleoindian features. This lack of
information is again partially overcome with Henderson's daily notes, which provide valuable data on
feature associations and also offer tentative interpretations of their functions (see Feature Notes, below).
Henderson's observations and sketches of the Paleo indian deposit (Zone 5) will be of use, too,
to reconstruct the horizontal and vertical deposition of these cultural materials. Numerous entries provide
data on soil color, disturbances, and composition changes from one "zone" to the next, which, when
combined with other sources of information (e.g., profiles and level records), should prove critical to the
interpretation of this component.
Finally, in her journal, Henderson offers several observations as to the general stratigraphy of the
site. These observations are somewhat limited, but as firsthand interpretations, they provide an important
preliminary framework in which to consider the site. In summary, the daily journal is a valuable body
of observations and data. The main weakness of this document is the lack of entries for several weeks
which obviously will impose certain limitations on interpreting 41BX52.

Level Record Forms

A standard level form was used to record data and observations on excavated units. The overall
quality of these records varies according to the amount of training and field experience of the excavators
(N = 26). An additional factor influencing record keeping was that at times the rate of excavation had
to be accelerated; thus, some level forms were left incomplete while others were not filled out at all.
Over 300 TxDOT level forms were reviewed encompassing both the Archaic and Paleoindian
archeological record. For purposes of this assessment, two forms were designed to inventory units and
excavated levels (see Appendix 1). The quality of the recorded data for each level was measured using
simple descriptive categories (i.e., good, fair, problematic, and missing). The first three categories reflect
the accuracy and completeness of recorded data. The last category allowed for identification of missing
documentation for 41BX52, as shown in Table 1. The missing documentation is discussed by area of
excavation (1, 3, 4, and 5). Consequently, problematic areas can be immediately identified, and

approximations of the analytical potential of the site can be outlined with a higher degree of confidence.
As illustrated in the table above, excavations were concentrated in Areas 3 and 4. While missing
documentation for Area 3 is approximately 23 percent, for Area 4 the percentage is very low, with only
5.0 percent of records unaccounted for. The number of missing records for the rest of the areas is low.
Of 28 excavated levels in Area 1, only 2 level forms are missing, and Area 5 has no missing documents;
however, only a small number of units were excavated in those areas. Of all four excavation areas, Area
4 offers the highest potential for a full interpretation of the excavated materials, and Area 3 offers the
lowest.
Not only does the quality of the level records vary according to area but it also varies according
to cultural component. For the upper levels, or Archaic component, most of the level forms include only
the recorder's name, the date, a brief listing of the materials recovered, and general provenience data.
Some of these records provide additional information such as elevations, brief matrix descriptions, feature
description/association, artifact and plan drawings, and one or more Polaroid photographs.
Elevations and matrix descriptions are the weakest areas of the Archaic level record data.
Elevations were partially recorded (e.g., the top of a level but not the bottom) and sometimes were not
recorded at all (see Elevation Data, below). The latter only includes a generic term to describe matrices
(e.g., dark clay) with no further information as to the Munsell color reading, inclusions, structure, or
texture. The use of these descriptive terms also varied according to the recorders. The daily journal
offers information that can help overcome some of these problems, particularly in the case of features.
Regardless, very few elevations and matrix descriptions are recorded in the daily journal.
Overall, the variable quality of Archaic documentation in addition to the small number of units
excavated (approximately 27.80% of the total number of excavated units) impose constraints on the
analytical potential of these components. Thus, only a partial reconstruction of the Archaic cultural
occupation can be attempted.
The level record forms for the Paleoindian component are much superior to those of the Archaic.
At least three factors influenced the improvement of data recovery and recording: first, additional trained
archeologists were hired; second, excavation pace was slowed; and third, more-careful methods were
implemented, as previously discussed (see Methods, above). The documents for these levels appear
complete and accurate. Besides the basic level information, they include plan drawings with point-plotted
(Le., individually provenienced both vertically and horizontally) artifacts, elevations, and matrix
descriptions. Observations concerning the methods and preliminary interpretations as to the deposition
14

of the cultural materials also are presented. Because of better documentation, the Paleo indian component
has greater potential as the main focus of future analysis.

Feature Notes

A total of21 cultural features was recorded at 4IBX52 (Table 2). Of these, 17 are associated with
Archaic occupations. The remaining 4 features pertain to the Paleoindian component and were labeled
with a double "F" (e.g., FFl), signifying what were termed in the field "Folsom Features." In an attempt
to discern the analytical potential of the individual features, an assessment of available documentation was
performed and is summarized in Appendixes 2 and 3. Based upon this assessment, the Archaic and
Paleo indian features have been classified into one of three levels of analytical potential: good, fair, or
problematic.

ARCHAIC FEATURES

Prior to the discovery of the Paleoindian component, the standard excavation method utilized
arbitrary 10-cm levels. It was during the removal of these arbitrary levels that the majority of features
was exposed. Features were defined by the individual excavators as encountered and assigned a sequential
feature number from a master list which was maintained in the daily journal.
Due to a number of factors, particularly time constraints, many features were not completely
excavated and/or recorded. Typically, not all feature boundaries fell within the arbitrary dimensions of
the excavation unit; thus, decisions as to the extent of data recovery had to be made. In some instances,
adjacent squares were excavated to provide a full feature exposure. In other cases, once a feature was
identified, it was only partially cross-sectioned, then removed without further examination. Many features
were sacrificed with no examination at all during Gradall operations (see daily journal 9-17-79).
Vertical control was maintained through the use of a transit with which elevations were determined
in relation to a site datum. The exception was Feature 2, where depth below ground surface was
determined with a metric tape and line level. Overall, there was general inconsistency in recording of
elevation data for features. In some instances, elevations were recorded for plotted burned rocks and
associated artifacts, but it is not always clear where these shots were taken (e.g., top of feature rocks or
base). In others (eight features, or 47 percent), there are incomplete or missing elevation data.
Written and/or illustrative documentation of features includes one or more of the following: level
record forms with feature information included, daily journal entries, plan maps, profiles, and photographs.
A brief summary describing the various ways in which each of the above records were employed to
document features is provided below.
Feature forms per se were not utilized, inasmuch as the unit level form served this purpose. In
most cases, the level form includes information for an arbitrary unit level as well as for any feature
contained within it. However, the type and amount of documentation varies from feature to feature.
Many problems arise from use of this dual-purpose form. For example, artifact associations are
not always discussed (are they primary or secondary to the feature?). True vertical provenience of the
feature (top and bottom elevations) within arbitrary lO-cm levels is rarely provided. Matrix descriptions
are not consistently specified as to level or feature.
The daily journal also serves as a source of documentation for features. Some of the better
descriptions of feature composition, structure, and associations are located in this source. Illustrative
documentation can also be found in the daily journal in the form of schematic drawings.
Plan drawings illustrating plotted artifacts were executed at both the detection levels (see F4A and
F4B) and upon complete or partial exposure for many of the features. In some instances (F9, Fll, F13,
and F15), however, a Polaroid photograph was substituted for the hand-drawn plan map and ascertaining
dimensions of these features is difficult.
Only four features (F4, F4B, F8, and FlO) were cross-sectioned and profiled. Elevation data are
available for all three profiles, thus allowing a more-precise reconstruction of feature structure. The
profile ofF4B is valuable for determining its depth and structure since this information was not otherwise
recorded.
Photographic documentation includes black and white photographs, color slides, and Polaroids.
16

Photographs were taken at various stages of feature exposure and are recorded in a photo log (see
Photographic Records, below). Polaroids, which are attached to the level/feature forms, in most cases
represent the exposure of a feature at the base of a level. In some instances, the feature was outlined in
pen on the Polaroid to delineate its boundaries or the location of plotted artifactslburned rocks, as seen
in F4A and F8. In general, the photographic documentation of the features is good with the exceptions
of FI2, FI3, FI4, and FI5, of which only a few Polaroids were taken.
As illustrated in Appendix 2 and Table 3, the overall quality and completeness of the Archaic
feature documentation are highly variable. Of the 17 features, 8 (47%) are classified as having "good"
analytical potential. However, of those 8, only FI and FlO (25%) have complete documentation. Over
half of the features reflect either a fair (N = 6, 35%) or problematical (N = 3, 18%) level of analytical
potential. As a result, a complete reconstruction and interpretation of these features will be difficult.

PALEOINDIAN FEATURES

Four Paleo indian features were encountered at 41BX52. Features 1 and 2 were areas of firestained soil, interpreted to represent burning events. Features 3 and 4 were concentrations of debitage
possibly reflecting single knapping episodes. Overall, the documentation for Paleoindian features is much
more detailed than that of the Archaic features, increasing their analytical potential.
As noted in the Methods section, excavation procedures were altered soon after the identification
of a Paleo indian component. Features were encountered during hand troweling of the approximately
15-cm-thick Paleoindian "zone" (Zone 5). Once identified, each feature was assigned a sequential number
from a list maintained in the daily journal. All four features were completely excavated and recorded.
Similar to the Archaic feature documentation, Paleoindian level record forms contain information
for the arbitrary levels as well as for the features contained within. However, because all artifacts were
pedestaled and subsequently illustrated on a plan map, their relationships to the features are much more
apparent. In addition, in an attempt to maintain contextual and spatial control, individual artifacts were
assigned sequence numbers thus allowing a greater possibility for reconstructing associations.
Vertical control was maintained through the use of a transit. Elevations in relation to site datum
are provided for all features as well as for associated artifacts. However, elevations were not consistently
recorded.
Information as to feature dimension, structure, and composition can be found on the individual
level record forms and in the daily journal. The latter also provides useful insights concerning functional
interpretations.
Photographic documentation includes black and white photographs, color slides, and Polaroids.
Photographs were taken at various stages of feature exposure and are recorded in the photo log (see
Photographic Records, below). In general, the photographs are an excellent source of information and can
serve as a medium for crosschecking plan map accuracy.
As a general rule, written and illustrative (plan maps and photographs) documentation is much
more complete for the Paleo indian than for the Archaic features. In turn, this is reflected in the higher
analytical potential of the Paleoindian features (l 00%).

Elevation Data

Elevation data are found primarily on level record forms and on profile drawings, although notes,
drawings, and additional references to specific readings are included in the daily journal. Based on
references in the journal and level forms, at least three vertical datum points were employed at the site.
A June 6, 1979, journal entry identifies a benchmark on the bridge northwest of the site (996.497 ft amsl,
or 303.732 m amsl) used as the primary vertical datum point for the project. A secondary datum point-a
red "X" on a boulder between Backhoe Trench 17 and 18 in the northern section of the site
(301.426 m amsl)-was shot in from the benchmark and is denoted with a circled "X" on site maps. When
this marker was removed by road crews, however, (daily journal 10-79, on 6-6-79 entry page) a third
datum, previously established on a rebar in the midden area (299.490 m amsl), became the primary datum
for the remainder of the excavations. This third datum could not be located on maps, photographs, or in
any other records.
18

Other than the notation of vertical datums, little discussion of transit procedures could be found
in site records. Further, apparently no log or listing of elevations was maintained. Rather, rod readings
of grid points andlor elevations were recorded somewhat erratically on level maps, either on comers of
the units or on the backs of the forms. Elevations andlor rod readings of plotted artifacts and feature
elements were recorded more consistently, usually directly on or adjacent to their depiction on a map or
in a numbered list on the back of the level form. However, the point at which the readings were taken
(top or base of artifact or feature) was not always clearly denoted. According to one of the excavators,
the general method followed was to shoot base elevations for each item (Darrell Creel, personal
communication 1993). In some cases, computations of height of instrument (HI) and true elevations from
the datum also are included on the level form; in other cases, only the calculated elevations or the
instrument readings are given. Because HIs are not consistently provided, computations of actual
elevations cannot be made or checked where necessary.
For purposes of this assessment, available elevation data for grid points throughout the excavation
area were extracted from level forms and compiled in tabular form. Where only instrument readings and
HIs were included, calculations were made to derive actual elevations. A summary of these data is
presented in Table 4.
With several exceptions, elevations for excavated units were not recorded in a consistent manner
during the project. As shown in Table 4, some units (43 of 168 or 25%) lack any record of grid point
elevations. In others, elevations are available for only one or two comers or for one or two levels. For
the 46 units apparently hand dug from ground surface (i.e., overburden not removed by machine), surface
elevations were recorded for only 21 or about 45 percent.
There is a clear distinction, however, between the data available for deposits pertinent to the
Paleo indian occupation and those of the Archaic. Judging from extant record forms, elevations were
recorded with a much higher frequency in levels pertaining to the Paleo indian component. This higher
frequency is particularly marked in Area 4. In that section, 56 of the 60 units (93%) in which overburden
was machine excavated have a potentially useful set of elevation data. In Area 3, the number is somewhat
lower: information was recorded for 33 of the 61 units (54%) beginning after trenching procedures.
Additional elevation data are available for some Paleoindian levels in hand-excavated units in both areas.
Of particular value are the large number of readings which were taken on plotted artifacts and features
in the component, although locations from which readings were taken (e.g., top or base of artifact or
feature element) are not always noted.
A significant weakness of all the elevation data, in fact, is the inconsistency in identifying the
vertical positions at which instrument readings were taken. Readings were labeled unci early, or in some
cases not at all, making it difficult to determine what is represented. Problems accruing from lack of clear
descriptive terms can be seen in the Paleoindian level forms. The term "surface" seems to have been used
variously to label either the top of the "zone" or the "surface" on which artifacts are resting. "Base"
appears to refer in some cases to the base of a certain cutting or troweling, in others, to base of the unit,
where excavation ceased. Many level forms contain numbers, "1)" andlor "2)," along with elevations or
instrument readings at the comers of the unit map. Perusal of the level forms suggests that "1)" was used
variously to refer to "top of Folsom zone," "top of 1st troweling," or simply "flTst cutting." Other
ambiguities are noted as well. On the level record form for N25/w2, Level 7, the number "})" was
identified as denoting second cutting (with no reference to top or bottom) as well as a different HI than
used for the artifact readings. On the level form for N25/W8 (Folsom), no explanation was given for one
set of readings in unit comers, and "1)" was used to identify "2nd cutting-gravels or base of unit." When
defined, the number "2)" referred either to second cutting or base of unit, which were not always
equivalent. More problematical is the number of level forms where no explanation or description was
provided to denote what the elevations represent. Given the inconsistency in methods and terminology

for readings taken in other units, attempts to guess their meaning should be made only with caution.
As a general rule, however, it appears that for the Paleoindian component, readings were taken
at the top of the "Folsom zone" and at the base-with a variety of other readings occasionally taken,
depending on depth of unit and quantity of materials recovered. This general approach is briefly alluded
to in the daily journal entry for 12-3-79 and has been confirmed by Henderson (personal communication
1993).
Elevation data were apparently computed with a high degree of accuracy judging from available
information and checks made on calculations shown on level forms. Most errors seem to have occurred
when instrument readings were added to rather than subtracted from the HI, and in such instances,
corrections can be made. In other cases, elevations given for lower levels were higher than those of
preceding levels (no computations shown), and it is currently impossible to remedy these errors.
Elevation data for the site can be described overall as inconsistent and difficult to interpret. Scant
information exists for the Archaic levels in Areas 3, 4, and 5. A more complete data set was achieved
for Area 1, although certain ambiguity exists as to delineation of "levelsl1 and "zones" in that area. A
large body of elevation data was recorded for the Paleo indian component, both from readings on plotted
artifacts and at unit grid points. While the artifact readings record the position of the Paleo indian
component across the site, it is unclear how much of the grid point elevation data will be useful. It is
possible that some of the confusion as to what certain elevations represent might be cleared up by tracking
grid comer elevations by zone or level within adjacent units and extrapolating elevations from points
which are more clearly labeled. It is likely, too, that with more-intensive study and manipulation of the
elevation data, patterns of methodology and terminology may become more apparent.

Plan and Topographic Site Maps

This collection of documents is comprised of rolled and loose maps and drawings depicting the
site area, location of excavation blocks, trenches, and specific features and zones. During the evaluation,
numbers and descriptive labels were assigned to each. An inventory is presented in Table 5.
The documents have been divided into primary and secondary categories; the first pertain to those

made in the field, and the latter were produced after completion of fieldwork from multiple primary
records. Although both types of drawings appear to be fairly complete and accurate, the primary
documents typically are judged to be more reliable. Of the 13 maps and drawings in this collection, only
1 map (No.6) is considered to be a primary source, 2 are photocopies (No.7 and 8), 2 are sets of
topographic maps (Nos. 12 and 13), and the rest are secondary. For the purposes of this assessment, both
categories of maps are discussed together.
Of chief interest in this collection are composite drawings combining information on cultural
remains and natural features of the site. Apparently derived from level forms, some of these maps locate
features and others trace the known aerial extent of deposits crucial to the interpretation of the prehistoric
occupation of the site (Nos. 1, 5, 9, and 10). For example, the limestone bench, a natural feature cutting
northwest to southeast across the site and framing the eastern extent of the Paleoindian component, is
shown on several maps. An alignment of limestone boulders, a possible cultural feature uncovered in the
same component, also is illustrated. Additionally, Map 3 provides a horizontal depiction of the Archaic
midden (Feature 4) and its interior features.
Similar composite maps provide information pertinent to excavation and sampling procedures.
Several denote the locations where special samples were extracted and selected profiles were drawn. Map
11 includes unit number designations used in the lot inventory numbering system for artifacts.

24

Lacking in the collection is a contour map precisely locating the site in the terrain. Information
derived from several maps and documents, however, may be sufficient to overcome this deficiency. Map
2, with its attached schematic drawing marking distances from project center line to selected grid points,
may provide the necessary key for locating the site in a topogmphic context, once it is correlated with
Map 12, an air-photo-based contour map. On the latter map, what are believed to be the center line and
the locations of a series of Highway Department engineering stations are faintly visible. Byextmpolating
from the last numbered station (1109++) given on the map, the location of Station 1013 and other
pertinent points listed in the Map 2 notes can be plotted. Although accuracy of this plotting will need to
be verified, it is currently possible to locate the site fairly well within the contours on Map 12.
Overall, the map collection provides the data necessary to generally locate the site. Additional
information pertinent to both natuml and cultural features and other remains as well as to excavation
procedures has been compiled into a series of composite maps which should be of considerable value in
the process of interpreting the site.

Profile Drawings and Stratigraphic Data

Stratigraphic information for the site can be found in a set of 18 profile drawings prepared by
archeological crew members; a geology notebook comprising drawings and stratigraphic notes; descriptive
notes in level record forms; and observations and drawings found throughout the daily journal. Corollary
information may be gleaned from photographs of unit floors and profiles. This data set is considered
within two categories: that derived from archeological fieldwork and that from geological trenching
operations.

ARCHEOLOGICAL PROFILES

Representing more than 100 m of trench and unit wall exposures, the set of 18 measured drawings
includes depictions of stratigraphic zones identified at various points across the project area (Table 6).
String lines with actual elevations marked are shown in each dmwing, and it is likely that vertical
measurements for zones were taken from those points. Where soil monoliths were removed, elevations
were marked on at least three points, as well as on the tops and bases of the columns. The locations from
which two sets of soil samples were taken also were marked on profile dmwings.
As shown in Figure 3, in which profile locations have been arbitrarily numbered for this
assessment, the site is well documented in north-south exposures, particularly in Area 4. In most rlmwings
of this area, the discrete nature of the Paleoindian deposit, isolated between two gravel layers, is shown.
Profiles 1,2, and 4 cross-cut the Archaic midden (Feature 4) and adjacent area and illustrate at least one
of the two possible interior midden features. There are fewer east-west profiles, which may make
interpretation of the "terrace formation processes" at the site more difficult, and there is no measured
drawing illustrating the juncture of the terrace with the limestone bench. A profile recorded for BHT 9,
which stops just east of or within an area of dense Paleo indian cultural materials, evidently illustrates
fluvial deposits resulting from multiple cut and fill events.
Area 1, in which two additional zones were identified and in which the Paleo indian component
was not present, is well documented in profile drawings. Profile dmwing 13 includes a correlation of zone
numbers used in Area 1 to those zones in areas to the east (these correlations are discussed further in the
daily journal [e.g., entry for 7118179]).

... Indicates zone numbers are from Area 1 and may not correlate to those in other areas.
...... More-detailed drawing of Profile 12b.

There apparently were no profiles drawn in excavated units in Area 5, although a set of profile
drawings (No. 16) was made from an exposure in a trench some 6 m north of the area. This depicts a
ca. 17-m horizontal exposure within two zones, A and B, for which little detail of deposit texture or
presence/absence of cultural materials is shown.
Other than delineating size and position of the various zones in certain areas and providing a very
general picture of contents (e.g., flakes, gravels, snail shells) and disturbances, the profile drawings are
of limited use. Although zones were numbered and briefly labeled on most drawings, there is no
consistent, detailed verbal description of the sedimentary structure and composition which might aid in
interpreting the depositional history ofthe site. Some additional descriptive information, although in some
cases limited in scope and substance, is contained on level forms. Notes and schematic drawings in the
daily journal provide additional perspectives on site structure and the relationships of various zones (e.g.,
daily journal entries for 11/5179, 1119179, 11116\79, 11\19\79, 12\18\79, 1\27\80). These schematics may
prove valuable in reconstructing the horizontal and vertical extent of specific zones, particularly in areas
where profile drawings were not made and where level record descriptions are scanty. The situation is
further complicated by use of the term "paleosol" by Henderson and Goode (1991:26) to describe the
natural context of the Paleo indian component when no field data are provided to substantiate the presence
of such a soil.

Additional stratigraphic data were compiled by Charles Johnson; his geology notebook contains
15 schematic profile drawings; a composite map showing trenches and horizontal extent of deposits; 50
Polaroid photographs (18 of which pertain to trenches); and descriptions of sediments for many of the
exposures (Table 7).

*"Inferred section profiles;" orientation cannot be determined as yet.

To date, information pertaining to the execution of these drawings and the composite map has not
been located. However, it is currently thought that the majority of profiles were aligned on bearings taken
with a compass or transit from N19IEO and N371E8 to "stationary objects and data near right of way"

27

(geology profile notebook n.d.). These alignments did not always follow those of the trenches. In some
cases, as seen in Table 7, they cross-cut several trenches; thus, correlation of stratigraphic deposits
between the trenches was likely inferred. In many of the "inferred profiles," a vertical exaggeration scale
and north arrow were not provided. The main detriment is that Johnson's stratigraphic descriptions and
interpretations have yet to be correlated with the zones identified by the archeologists.
At present, due largely to the lack of correlation between these two sets of information, the overall
analytical potential of these profiles cannot be assessed. With further inquiry, these issues can be resolved
and Johnson's data will prove useful.

Laboratory Records
Other than the specimen inventory forms, there is little information available concerning laboratory
procedures. Although the daily journal refers to the processing of some artifacts in the field on rainy days
(see entries 7-18-79 and 8-23-79), most apparently were processed at TxDOT facilities in Austin.
According to Henderson (personal communication 1993), cultural materials were washed, labeled, and
inventoried, and most artifacts were cataloged and assigned a specific lot number. This number is a
standardized two-part system frequently employed in the TxDOT laboratory. A complete index to this
system as well as a site map with units numbered by lot were provided by TxDOT.
As a norm, each excavated unit was assigned a unique sequential number corresponding to the
first part of the lot numbering system. Individual levels were denoted by letters (assigned in ascending
alphabetical order). As a result, each artifact is coded with both horizontal and vertical provenience. For
example, an artifact labeled 19A indicates that it was recovered from unit NIIIE4 (Le.," 19"), Level I (i.e.,
"A").
Artifacts recovered from the Paleo indian occupation are denoted with a "P" following the lot
number. As previously discussed, this component was hand excavated in two troweling episodes. In the
lot numbering system, a "PI" refers to the first troweling, and "P2" to the second troweling. For example,
artifact 67Pl identifies a flake recovered from the Paleoindian component in unit N191W4, first troweling.
A large number of the materials from this component were point plotted and assigned a unique sequential
number (e.g., artifact 71P2-6).
In the laboratory, all materials were inventoried on specimen inventory sheets. On the back of
the sheets, information derived from the original field bags was consistently transcribed. Artifacts were
sorted into preliminary analytical categories and then counted. The categories used in the sorting of the
materials were generally descriptive or functional (e.g., scrapers, gouges, etc.). Projectile points and other
distinctive tools were usually drawn in outline on the front and sometimes on the back of the lot sheet.
Occasionally, typological affiliations were assigned to the projectile points. Not all artifacts, however,
were labeled. In some bags, a small portion of flakes (typically ca. 10%) was labeled, and in others, none
was labeled. In addition, a number of tools from trenches were found to be unlabeled.
In general, the specimen inventory for 41BX52 is fairly complete and accurate. A few gaps were
found in the documentation, but problems arising from them generally have been resolved. On the other
hand, charcoal and soil samples were inventoried inconsistently (see Special Samples below). During this
evaluation, however, indexes for both were reconstructed using level records, the daily journal, and profile
drawings.

28

Photographic Records

The 41BX52 project was well documented in a variety of photographic media. A collection of
108 rolls of black and white (B/W) prints (58 of which are large-format, 6-x-6-cm), 59 rolls of color
slides, and a number of Polaroid and other prints were taken-in all, totaling some 4,200 individual photos.
Photographs were listed and described by roll and exposure number in a three-volume field photo
log. In all but a few cases, rolls were clearly identified by "l.D." shots-typically the first frame of each
roll showing a chalkboard inscription of the site trinomial and roll number. Based on dates in log entries,
it appears that with a few exceptions (e.g., Rolls 163, 169, 171), photographs were logged into the
notebook as they were taken in the field.
The collection also contains numerous miscellaneous photographs which, although not listed in
the log, appear to be identified consistently on the back of the print or on a mounting page. These include
color Polaroid prints of various unit levels and features, which currently are affixed to level forms, and
Polaroid prints of trench wall exposures which accompany stratigraphic profile drawings and descriptions
by Charles Johnson (see Profile Drawings and Stratigraphic Data above). Additionally, there are three
aerial photographs of the site area (ca. 1970s) and two contact sheets of photographs of Paleoindian
artifacts taken in the laboratory. Negatives for the latter have not as yet been located.
Most of the photographs appear to be in good condition, with the exception of Polaroid prints in
the level and geology records. These prints are fading and otherwise exhibiting signs of alteration of
surface finish.
For purposes of this assessment, each logged roll was inventoried by sequential roll number along
with date taken, the apparent number of exposures attempted, and the number of frames extant in the
collection (Table 8). Wherever relevant, a brief explanatory note as to discrepancies, omissions, or
technical errors-based on an examination of the logs and the actual photos-also has been added.
A cursory review of the photo collection suggests that good coverage of the site and most
excavation procedures was achieved. Significant features, units, selected special samples, and artifacts in
situ from both the Archaic and Paleoindian levels were photographed from a variety of angles and
perspectives (for example, there are some 35 exposures of "Folsom" Feature 2). Many of these were made
using 120- or 220-mm film for large format 2 1I4-x-2 114-inch prints showing good detail. Numerous
photographs were taken from the vantage point of a cherry-picker, thus providing a wide-angle perspective
of broad expanses of the excavation units as well as the site environs. These should prove valuable in
placing features and possible activity areas in a larger spatial context. Additionally, a series of
photographs was made at sequential points across the site, enabling the construction of a photographic
montage of the site proper (Figure 5). The large number of photos of stratigraphic exposures and unit
floors at specific levels holds particular potential for facilitating interpretation of the various zones
identified at the site. There are, however, few "action" shots documenting field procedures; those present
depict such scenes as collection of radiocarbon samples and hand troweling ofthe Paleo indian component.
At present, not all photographic materials listed in the logs have been accounted for, and, of those
materials present, not all relate to 41BX52. Seven rolts of film (4 color slides, 2 B/W, and 1 unknown)
and some 45 individual color slides are missing (see Table 8). Approximately 65 exposures are of other
sites. Ten roll numbers in sequence in the log book were skipped, with no explanation made in the
records; an additional two roll numbers are classified as "void." A preliminary crosscheck of photo
notations on level records against relevant entries in the photo logs indicates there are some discrepancies
which remain to be addressed (e.g., lack of correlation in proveniences and dates photos taken). Although

some technical errors obviously occurred (6 rolls plus an estimated 15 individual exposures did not come
out), photographs for the most part are clear, sharp, and well composed. Use of scales and north arrows
was highly consistent.
Photographs from 4lBX52 should prove to be highly useful in interpreting the cultural and
stratigraphic record for the site. They also will provide good illustrative material for a final report.
Materials appear to be well organized and correlated with adequate descriptive entries in the log. The
abundance and high quality of the photos as well as the depiction of a variety of perspectives of the site
at different levels combine to provide an opportunity for interpretive insights which otherwise might be
lacking in the written records from the site.

Collections

The artifact collection was transported to TARL in two batches. The first batch was comprised
of 32 boxes of cultural materials in their original field bags as well as 4 soil monoliths. The second group
was composed of 4 boxes containing only Paleo indian lithics that had been removed from field bags and
placed in plastic bags. For purposes of this assessment, the collections were divided into lithics and
special samples, the latter of which includes charcoal, sediment, bone, and shell samples. Each are
discussed separately below.

Lithic Collection

The lithic assemblage from 41BX52 numbers more than 60,000 artifacts, which are documented
in a variety of records. Information regarding the recovery of these artifacts is found in level record forms,
the daily journal, field bags, and field photographs; data regarding the quantity and different classes of
artifacts present in the collection are found in the TxDOT specimen inventories. Because these records
have been described in some detail above, discussion here is focused on the collection itself.
For purposes of this assessment, the lithic collection was first examined to determine its physical
condition. Overall, the assemblage appears to be in good shape, but the boxes and packing materials in
which the artifacts were stored are in poor condition. A cursory inspection of the boxes, showed that
some field bags have deteriorated causing artifacts to spill out. To correct this, tom bags were placed
inside new polyethylene bags, and all of the TxDOT boxes were replaced with others designed for longÂ­
term curation. Most of the artifacts are currently bagged according to their original provenience, based
on their labels.
Using TxDOT specimen inventories, a TARL computer data base was created. This allowed the
generation of artifact count totals by classes and by cultural component. This listing is tentative, inasmuch
as artifact categories and types likely will change with future analysis. Furthermore, although attempts
were made to derive exact numbers of missing artifacts (Tables 9 and 10), based on TxDOT specimen
inventories, the final results cannot be tabulated without a complete recount of individual artifacts.

As shown in Tables 9 and 10, there are 33,594 lithic artifacts attributable to the Archaic period
and 20,420 to the Paleoindian period. While it has been established in this assessment that the methods
of data recovery for the Archaic were somewhat problematic, the large quantity of materials from a
relatively small number ofunits (ca. 30) provides an adequate sample for some studies. On the other hand,
a wider variety of lithic analyses can be performed using the Paleo indian assemblage since this component
appears to have been stratigraphically isolated and recovery methods were more systematic.
Of particular interest in this collection is the presence of lithic remains from deposits underlying
the main Paleo indian component (Table 11). A total of 599 specimens was recovered by TxDOT;
however, questions as to the nature of their modification (cultural artifacts vs. ecofacts) and deposition
(primary vs. secondary deposition) remain open.
Overall, issues of typology, technology, and function of artifacts can be addressed with the large
amount of debitage and tools present in both the Archaic and Paleoindian components. A typology of
projectile points should be carried out in order to provide information about the archeological
manifestations at this site through time. Likewise, a microscopic examination of the different tool classes
can help to determine their use. The existence of a Paleoindian assemblage, including Clovis and Folsom
artifacts, in different stages of lithic reduction also provides an opportunity to address specific questions
related to the manufacture of tools and how those changed through time. Additionally, since over 2,600

artifacts were plotted from the Paleoindian component (Table 12), studies such as spatial analysis can be
implemented. Finally, future efforts should also be directed to the curation of this important prehistoric
collection.

Special Samples

Charcoal, sediment, bone, and mussel shell samples were also recovered from 41BXS2.
Information on their recovery, proveniences, and associations can be found in the level record forms, plan
drawings, profiles, and the daily journal. For the purposes of this assessment, an inventory of each group
of samples was fIrst compiled. Results of this inventory and a compilation of basic information on each
sample are presented in Appendixes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,9, and 10.

CHARCOAL SAMPLES

Of the 26 charcoal samples recovered for radiocarbon dating, most were not entered in the TxDOT
specimen inventory. At TARL, they were assigned a sequential number after the letters "Att (Archaic)
andlor "P" (Paleoindian). This provisional numbering system was employed in order to impose some
control and facilitate inventory procedures.

Archaic Samples

According to records, a total of 16 charcoal samples (Table 13) was obtained from the Archaic
component (see also Appendix 4), S of which (A12 thm A16) are missing. Information for the Archaic
specimens from the level record forms is sparse. Critical data such as elevations, associations, and
descriptions of surrounding matrix are not always provided. This lack of information is partiaHy overcome
by the daily journal which supplies horizontal and vertical provenience for some samples. This last
document also gives useful remarks on the condition and size of certain samples (see daily journal 8-10Â­
79). Polaroid pictures were taken of 8 of the 11 extant samples.
As summarized in Table 13, the Archaic charcoal samples were assessed as to their analytical
potential using the following categories: good, fair, and problematic. Samples in good physical condition
and with complete documentation, in particular, proveniences and associations, were considered to be
"good" (N = 6). Samples in fair or poor condition andlor with incomplete documentation (proveniences
present but no associations) were graded as "fair" (N = 3). Finally, a "problematic" classification was
assigned to those with much of the information lacking (N 2). The physical assessment of each sample
was based on weight, size, and condition (see Appendix 5, for discussion of procedures).
Of the six samples tentatively graded as having good analytical potential, four (AI, AS, A6, and
All) are from the main area of excavations, Area 3; sample A2 is from Area 5, and sample A9 is from
Area 1. In Area 3, sampling efforts were concentrated on collecting specimens to date the numerous
features present. Samples Al and A6 were recovered directly from Features 11 and 9 respectively, but
their contexts may pose some limitations in future dating procedures. These features tentatively have been
classified as "unstructured scatters" of burned rocks. Burned rock concentrations often represent multiple

events, and resulting dates can be potentially misleading. The other two samples from Area 3 (AS and
All) may be the best candidates for analysis. Both have strong associations (e.g., Nolan type points) and
precise vertical elevation data (299.80 m above msl). Moreover, they both were recovered from the base
and/or directly below Features 9 and 4 and could therefore provide a starting date for the accumulation
of burned rocks. Finally, samples A2 and A9 from Areas 5 and 1 could be useful in evaluating
chronological correlations between the different areas of excavation. The "good" analytical potential of
these samples, however, may change with further examination of the records and materials.

Paleo indian Samples

Information on Paleoindian charcoal recovery is much more complete and accurate (see Appendix
5). In total, 10 samples were recovered (Table 14). The level record forms not only explain strategy of
recovery, proveniences, and associations, but include observations on the analytical potential of particular
samples. Plan drawings from the Paleo indian component often inc1ude horizontal provenience and vertical
elevation of the charcoal specimens. Information can also be found in the daily journal and in a
"radiocarbon sample data record form." These standard forms were probably assembled in the lab, after
the completion of the fieldwork.
The analytical potential of each sample was assessed according to three criteria: context,
documentation, and condition. In spite of the excellent documentation, the analytical potential of these
10 samples is weak, as shown in Table 14.
Only two Paleoindian-age samples are considered to be "good" and the remaining eight are
"problematic. It Samples P4 and P5-both collected from the floor of the Paleoindian component-appear
to be good candidates for analysis. The rest of the samples have questionable contexts. For example,

charcoal from Samples PI and P2 "may have washed onto the Paleo zones from upper deposits" (see daily
journal 10-4-79); Samples P6 and P8 were located near rodent burrows; and Samples P7 and P9 were
recovered from or near ant disturbances. No associations were provided for Sample P3, and Sample PIO
(mainly matrix with little to no charcoal) was found in a box of artifacts during the assessment phase.
As a result, the value of the charcoal samples for dating the Paleoindian component of 41BX52 is very
limited.
On December 28, 1982, TxDOT sent Samples PI through P9 to Vance Haynes at The University
of Arizona Radiocarbon Lab. After reviewing contextual data of the individual samples, Haynes decided,
chiefly on the basis of size and provenience, to run only Samples P3 and P8. Other samples were not
considered for a variety of reasons (see letter from Haynes to Henderson, 1-11-83). The two dates
obtained were as follows: P3 (sample 3-AA151) 7000Â±250 B.P.; and P8 (sample 8-AA152)
2870Â±300 B.P.2 These dates were rejected since they fall far outside the range of the Clovis and Folsom
time frame of Central Texas. As previously indicated, these problematic dates may be a reflection of the
context from which the samples were extracted (see Appendix 5).
Although Samples P4 and P5 were rejected by Haynes in 1983, these samples appear to have good
context and documentation, and might be reconsidered in light of advances in radiocarbon dating
techniques. Overall, however, the radiocarbon samples available for the Paleoindian component have
serious deficiencies which limit possibilities for dating and interpreting this occupation(s).
SEDIMENT SAMPLES
Numerous sediment samples were collected from the site. For this assessment, they have been
grouped into monoliths, samples from trenches, and miscellaneous.
Monoliths
Four monoliths were prepared and recovered from trench walls. Appendix 6 contains the
proveniences and elevations for each. Different entries in the daily journal detail preparation procedures

2It is not known at this time whether the dates were corrected by isotopic fractionation or other means.

40

and method of collection of the monoliths (see daily journal for 11-27/28-79, 12-17-79, and 1-21-80).
On November 12, 1993, the monoliths were unwrapped in order to evaluate their condition and
usefulness for future analysis. According to microstratigrapher Paul Goldberg (personal communication
1993), all were in a generally good state of preservation, and the layering appeared mostly to be intact.
Preliminary determinations of general site stratigraphy can be derived from these monoliths.
Unfortunately, physical and chemical analyses are not applicable, since the columns were coated with
vynilite resine solution and cellulose acetate solution during preparation for extraction from the field (see
daily journal 11-27-79). Obviously, chemical analyses would be complicated, as these two chemicals
modify the original grain-size distribution of particles through cementation, thus limiting their analytical
potential (Paul Golberg, personal communication 1993). However, this process has consolidated the
sediments which preserves much of their value for thin sectioning and micro stratigraphic analysis.

Sediment Samples from Trenches

Additional sediment samples (N = 18) were collected from Trenches 3 and 4 (see Appendix 7).
Their provenience and the collecting strategy used are discussed in the daily journal (12-3-79 and 1-16Â­
80); also, their locations are further depicted in three different profiles drawings.
From these samples, only those recovered from Trench 3 hold high potential for analysis (e.g.,
macrobotanical and faunal remains, phytoliths, and chemical/physical structure of sediments). Samples
from Trench 4 are of limited value. They were apparently collected from two different locations in the
trench profile, but they were not labeled with exact proveniences.

Miscellaneous Samples

A total of seven sediment samples was collected from specific features and deposits at the site (see
Appendix 8). Samples 1, 2, and 3 were collected from Feature 10 and Folsom Features 2 and 4,
respectively, and they carry high analytical potential to answer questions about the context of the Archaic
and Paleoindian components (see Feature Notes, above). Samples 5, 6, and 7 were collected from the
Paleoindian component and overlying gravels, and they could serve as comparative material for samples
from related deposits in the trenches. Sample 4 is described as sediment containing a "snail pocket" from
Level 2 (10-20 cm); because it is not associated with any feature, its usability will be limited. However,
snail species identification can be attempted.

Summary

In summary, these three sets of samples (Monoliths, Trenches, and Miscellaneous) can provide
a preliminary approximation of site stratigraphy. They hold some potential for further analysis as well.
However, a full interpretation and reconstruction of the depositional history and paleoenvironment of the
site will be limited if based solely on present sources of information.

41

BONE AND SHELL
Very few samples of bone and shell were recovered from 41BX52. At present, only six small
fragments of bone and one mussel shell have been located (see Appendixes 9 and 10), although additional
samples (snail shells, mussel shells, and "possible bone fragments") are listed in the specimen inventory.
Of those extant, the samples generally are in poor condition. The bone fragments are all unburned, highly
deteriorated, and none was recovered in situ. With one exception (No.1, an antler fragment), their size
is too small to enable species identification. The mussel shell, however, appears to be in good condition
and large enough for identification.
At this time, it appears that there is little to no analytical potential for these samples. If additional
samples are located in the collection, more extensive analyses may be possible.

Summary and Observations

Clearly, there is variability in the quantity and quality of the records for 41BX52. Overall,
however, a valuable body of data has been recovered which, as will be discussed in the following section,
holds significant analytical potential.
As described previously, the level records and feature notes contain certain inconsistencies and
information gaps. These inconsistencies (such as the recording of elevations and associations between
artifacts and features) were more pronounced during the early phases of the excavation and were largely
overcome during the later phases.
A number of plan, topographic, and profile maps are available. While the plan maps contain a
valuable compilation of information derived from excavation, the others are insufficient either in locating
the site in the terrain or in adequately recording the stratigraphy.
The daily journal and photographic records provide the most reliable sources of information about
the site. Although there were a number of days for which entries were not made, the journal generally
is a clearly written and thorough document which often contains information lacking in other records.
A large lithic collection was recovered at 41 BX52. Ofthese materials, the Paleoindian assemblage
offers the greatest opportunity for a variety of analyses. In addition to technological and functional
studies, these artifacts should provide specific data toward a spatial examination of the ClovislFolsom
surface. The Paleoindian specimens were quite consistently point plotted with both horizontal and vertical
proveniences recorded. The Archaic lithic materials were not systematically recovered; however,
typological and some technological analyses should be undertaken.
Several problems exist with special samples from the site. Only a small number of sediment
samples was extracted from features (see Features, above), limiting the possibilities for functional analyses.
Others, particularly from trench exposures, were poorly documented and may only provide generalized
data. In contrast, soil monoliths were taken from a variety of locations and were very well preserved;
these should provide important preliminary stratigraphic information. Charcoal samples for radiocarbon
dating were recovered from both the Archaic and Paleoindian components. However, only the former
were extracted from undisturbed contexts, and the age of the Paleoindian component remains unresolved.

42

In summary, this assessment has revealed strengths and weaknesses in the documentation critical
to planning future research and fully interpreting the site. Based on this, a plan for analysis is proposed
and specific research questions are raised in the following section. It is evident from reviewing accounts
of TxDOT operations that results were significantly limited by impending highway construction. These
factors impacted recovery for the Archaic component most severely, resulting not only in inconsistent
record keeping, as mentioned above, but a significant loss of data due to Gradall stripping. For the
Paleo indian component, however, a marked pattern of improvement was discerned, both in excavation
techniques and record keeping, and it is clear that this component holds the highest analytical potential.

PROPOSED PLAN FOR ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION,
AND REPORT PREPARATION

In previous sections, the data from 41BX52 have been assessed chiefly from a technical
standpoint, with usefulness of each category of material weighed according to quality, quantity, and the
methods employed in recovery. In this section, the evidence is evaluated more subjectively in terms of
research potential. Specifically, what is the scope and value of the data in defining the occupations at the
site, and what questions pertinent to human adaptation (e.g., subsistence and technology) within a regional
framework can legitimately be addressed?
Toward this end, a brief examination of current evidence, theory, and key issues for each
archeological period relevant to the site is first presented. Next, an overview of the components identified
at 41BX52 is provided, and research issues pertinent to the evidence are raised. A list of tasks critical
to organizing and enhancing data prior to more in-depth analysis are then outlined; this includes a
recommendation for limited, but specifically targeted, fieldwork. Lastly, a budget estimate encompassing
research and the final reporting of results is presented.

Paleoindian and Archaic Background Issues

The Paleoindian Period

The archeological record of Central Texas starts some 11,000 years ago with the Paleoindian
period. This relatively short cultural stage spans the end of the Pleistocene until the beginning of the
Holocene (ca. 9200-6000 B.C.) and is characterized by the presence of small nomadic bands of hunterÂ­
gatherers with sophisticated lithic weaponries.
Central Texas archeologists often have divided the Paleo indian period into a two-part temporal
framework, the earlier period comprised of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview complexes and the later
manifestations represented by Angostura, Golondrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff tool types (see Black
1989b; Hester 1979; Prewitt 1985; Turner and Hester 1985).
In the Pleistocene-age deposits of 41BX52, evidence of the earliest Paleoindian stage (i.e., Clovis
and Folsom) was found. In addition, lithic materials were recovered below this deposit. Hence, before
focusing on some of the current Paleoindian research concerns, a brief discussion of the "pre-Clovis"
question in Texas is first offered.

43

At sites such as Levi (Alexander 1982), Lewisville (Crook and Harris 1957), and Friesenhan Cave
(Evans 1961; Graham 1976), rich assemblages of Pleistocene fauna associated with possible cultural
remains have been found. Radiocarbon dates and fauna indicate these sites may be at least 30,000 years
old. However, conflicting stratigraphy, disputed radiocarbon dates, and uncertain associations make it
impossible to conclusively accept the presence of humans at a time before Clovis. For this reason, any
data from 41BX52 which may be brought to bear on this issue will be of significance.
Issues surrounding chronology, subsistence strategies, and lithic assemblages are currently at the
forefront of Paleo indian studies. Traditionally, it has been held that Clovis precedes Folsom in the Plains
area. This cultural succession has been demonstrated stratigraphically and supported by radiocarbon dates
at Blackwater Draw Locality No.1 (Hester 1972). However, new dating techniques (particularly AMS)
applied to evidence from other Clovis and Folsom sites indicate that Clovis may be slighter younger than
previously believed, perhaps overlapping with Folsom (Frison 1993; Haynes 1992; Haynes et al. 1992;
Stafford 1991; Stanford 1991). Traditional evolutionary views of chronological succession based on point
types also are being challenged. Judge (1974) has suggested that projectile point variability observed in
the Paleoindian period does not necessarily indicate time differences but in some cases could reflect coÂ­
occurrence of different styles (see also Frison [1993] and Haynes et al. [1992] for a similar argument).
Sites such as 41BX52 become crucial regarding this research issue because of the large Clovis-Folsom
assemblage present in a single stratum.
Paleo indian subsistence patterns have been the subject of much debate. More than 40 years ago,
Sellards (1952) defined the Clovis and Folsom complexes as characterized by a hunting economy (see also
Frison 1978). However, information on the different resources exploited by Paleo indians has markedly
increased in recent years. A number of early sites in Texas and North America have yielded diverse faunal
and floral remains which imply that Clovis and Folsom were not exclusively big-game hunters (e.g.,
Kincaid [Collins et a1. 1989], Aubrey [Ferring 1989], Shawnee-Minisink [Dent and Kaufman 1985],
Lehner [Haynes 1982], Lubbock Lake [Johnson 1987], Scharbauer [Wendorf et a1. 1955], Mitchell
Locality [Boldurian 1990], Hanson [Frison and Bradley 1980], and Lindenmeier [Wilmsen and Roberts
1978]). The diet of these human groups clearly included a wide array of small animals (deer, jackrabbit)
as well as plants (hackberry, blackberry, grape), birds (wild turkey), and reptiles (turtle species). These
data have led archeologists to propose that Paleoindian groups practiced more generalized subsistence
strategies than previously thought (e.g., Kelly and Todd 1988; Meltzer 1993; Stanford 1991).
While there is growing agreement that Clovis people had a broad-based economy, the degree to
which they were practicing big-game hunting remains unresolved. Judge (in press) has questioned the
generally accepted correlation of faunal remains to kill sites and has noted that there are few "real" kill
sites (e.g., Miami) present for Clovis times; rather, many appear to be processing stations or scavenging
sites where Paleoindian peoples harvested remains of animals which had died from natural causes. Taking
into account the new faunal evidence (large and small species) and the variability of site types during
Clovis, it is possible that these early groups were "opportunistic" hunters of large game (Johnson 1991;
Kelly and Todd 1988).
In contrast, it appears that Folsom subsistence was much more targeted and largely dependent on
hunting of a single species, namely bison (Frison 1978; Hofman 1989). This has been demonstrated at
the Lipscomb site (Hofman et al. 1988), Folsom type site (Figgins 1927), the Fowler-Parrish site (Agogino
and Parrish 1971) and Steward Cattle Guard site (Jodry and Stanford 1992). However, Folsom groups,
like Clovis, also exploited other resources. As mentioned above, some Folsom sites have yielded evidence
of different and smaller fauna. Clearly, more data related to subsistence strategies are needed to resolve
these issues. At 41BXS2, floral and faunal remains are scant, but certain types of indirect evidence (e.g.,
44

organic residues and use-wear data) may prove useful. At the Mitchell Locality, for example, residue
analysis on tools indicated the presence of pronghorn antelope blood (see Boldurian 1991).
Traditional and recent studies of Paleoindian collections have added much information on
projectile point typology and tool manufacture, but firm explanations of Clovis and Folsom assemblage
variability have not been found. The current trend toward studying Paleoindian lithic assemblages as a
whole, rather than individual point types, holds promise to explain assemblage variability as well as
interpret aspects of hunter-gatherer daily life. For example, studies of chert sourcing and manufacture,
use, and discard of tools have stimulated new models on hunter-gatherer curation patterns and migratory
practices (Bamforth 1986; Binford 1979, 1989; Hofinan et al. 1990; Kelly and Todd 1988). Tool and
debitage analyses from different eastern Clovis sites have illuminated aspects of such activities as
butchering, hide working, and woodworking (Wilmsen 1968). Microwear analysis on Folsom points and
other tools at the Lubbock Lake site (Johnson 1987) suggests that grass harvesting, woodworking,
butchering, hide scraping, and chopping activities were carried on there.
In summary, a host of new theories and technologies have emerged which show great promise for
elucidating Paleo indian subsistence. Pavo Real, with its extensive and varied lithic assemblage, preserved
in a camp site setting, offers an opportunity to make a significant contribution to Paleoindian studies both
on a local and regional scale.

The Archaic of Central Texas has been the focus of intensive study for over 70 years, and
extensive syntheses have been published elsewhere (Black and McGraw 1985; Hester 1976; Prewitt 1981,
1985; Story 1985; Weir 1976). For this reason, an exhaustive discussion of this period will not be
attempted here. Rather, this section will briefly review the general trends and cultural manifestations in
order to identify relevant research issues.
Traditionally, the Archaic has been viewed within a three-period framework as well as numerous
smaller subdivisions or phases (Johnson 1986; Prewitt 1981, 1985; Weir 1976). Each is distinguished by
diagnostic projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985, 1993). An additional marker for much of the
Archaic is the burned rock midden. This feature, ubiquitous throughout most of the Edwards Plateau, has
been studied as to age, form, function, and distribution (Black et al. 1992; Black, Jolly, and Potter 1993;
Collins 1991a; Creel 1986, 1991; Hester 1970, 1991; Howard 1991; Prewitt 1991; Ricklis and Collins
1994).
Relatively little is known for the Early Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C. to 2500 B.C.) of Central
Texas. Documented components are few in number, although according to some investigators, the low
frequency of sites may be attributed to geological rather than cultural factors; in other words, additional,
undetected sites may be buried under deep terrace alluvium or otherwise lost to geologic processes (Collins
1991a, 1991b; Collins et al. 1990; Black 1993). Data indicate that Archaic peoples were likely organized
in small bands focused on a gathering economy (Weir 1976). In contrast to the preceding Paleo indian
period, hearths were the most prevalent feature during this time. It is generally thought, too, that the
burned rock midden, so common during the Middle Archaic, first appeared during the later portion of the
Early Archaic (Black et al. 1992).
A large number of sites have been identified for the Middle Archaic period (ca. 2500 B.C. to
45

1000 B.C.), and this has been interpreted by some archeologists as representing a substantial increase in
population (Turner and Hester 1993; Weir 1976). An important aspect of the Middle Archaic is the
increase in the number and size of burned rock midden features. Data derived from these features indicate
a marked reliance on plant remains and raise the prospect of communal processing of food (Creel 1986;
Story 1985). Whether the fluorescence of these features during this period is a result of an expansion of
a subsistence technology initiated in the Early Archaic or a response to changing environmental patterns
and/or population growth is a question which remains to be answered.
In general, there is an increase in the number of Late to Transitional Archaic period (ca.
1000 B.C. to 700 A.D.) sites relative to the Middle Archaic (Black 1993; Hall et at. 1986). Subsistence
data for this period indicate a continuation of a hunting and gathering economy. Burned rock middens
continue to occur, though perhaps with less frequency than in the Middle Archaic.
As has been increasingly noted (e.g., see Ricklis and Collins 1994), the term "Archaic" seems to
cover such a variety of manifestations as to have almost no meaning or significance. In its current use,
the Archaic concept frames all traditions emerging after the demise of late Pleistocene big-game hunting
and ending sometime after the inception of bow and arrow technology in the early Christian era, a span
of some 6,500 years.
Recent studies have sought to elucidate the behavioral and adaptive processes implied in these
many archeological manifestations (what Butzer [1982] has called "human ecology"), with focus shifting
in some cases to examination of remains at the "microscale." In Archaic sites, this shift has been most
pronounced in burned rock midden studies. Rather than the more traditional focus on chipped stone
artifacts within the midden-with results, for better or worse, leading to changes in point types and
revisions of chronologies and systematics-more recent studies have focused on midden matrix: the origin
of the sediments, types of organic constituents, and the nature, quantity, and magnetic alignment of the
burned rocks, all of which combine to provide insights into midden development and use (Abbott and
Frederick 1990; Black, Jolly, and Potter 1993; Collins 1991a; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Other studies
have emphasized midden context or regional distribution according to midden types and their placement
in the terrain (Crecl 1986, 1991). Significant findings related to midden development and use have
emerged from new approaches to artifact analyses. Collins (Ricklis and Collins 1994) found that by
quantifYing the frequency and degree of heat damage among diagnostic artifacts, a relative determination
of the period of midden development and use could be made, with attendant implications for variously
burned, nondiagnostic chipped stone remains. Such approaches complement careful typological studies
of lithic artifacts and refinements of archeological chronologies; together, they provide a more
comprehensive, and perhaps more meaningful, ecology-based framework within which results may be
examined.
Subsistence practices and strategies of hunter-gatherers have become a focus of archeological
inquiry the world over. No ethnographic study exists for hunter-gatherers in temperate, mid-continent
settings like Central Texas, making the archeological record of such adaptations especially important to
general understanding of human behavior (Collins 1991a). It is important, therefore, to test currently
developing models such as foraging versus logistically organized collecting (Binford 1980), strategies
involving tool kit reliability versus maintainability (Bamforth 1986), archeological consequences of
curation and "droppage rates" (Shott 1989; Yellen 1977), and dependence on high-starch food resources
(Thoms 1989). Since most subsistence strategy models have been developed using data on groups in
somewhat marginal habitats (such as southwest Africa, Australia, and the sub-Arctic), their validity and
explanatory merits for relatively more favorable regions such as Central Texas are in question.

46

In this region, the physiographic extremes and ecotonal resources may have enabled a blend of
subsistence strategies. In transitional settings such as that of 41BX52-10cated at the margin of the
wooded Hill Country and the grassy coastal prairies to the south-Black, Potter et al. (1993) have argued
that hunter-gatherer groups may have employed aspects of both collecting and foraging strategies,
depending on season and availability. It may be that increasing population pressure with its attendant
political implications over the Holocene in Central Texas was the most critical aspect in the subsistence
strategies that evolved here.
More traditional issues relating to Archaic systematics and typology continue to be raised. Of
particular relevance to 41BX52 is a proposcd refinement of Early Archaic chronology. Based on findings
from the Landslide site (Sorrow et a1. 1967) and the Barton site (RickHs and Collins 1994), Collins has
called for the separation of Prewitt's Jarrell phase, with Martindale and Uvalde points representing the
earlier segment and Bell/Andice the later (see also Collins et a1. 1990). Data pertinent to this issue may
be forthcoming from the present study if the Early Archaic materials from 41BX52 (which contain
Bell/Andice as well as other diagnostics of the period) can be judged to derive from well-stratified and
secure contexts.
In summary, the Central Texas Archaic continues to be the focus of a variety of studies. Many
of these studies require specialized samples or records which are not available from 41BX52. It is
possible, however, that modified versions of several new methodologies, as well as more traditional
analyses, may be attempted with the evidence recovered there, as is discussed below.

Overview of Paleoindian and Archaic Cultural Components at 41BX52

Evidence recovered from 41 BX52 indicates occupations occurred there intermittently throughout
much of the local prehistory. Diagnostic artifacts and other cultural remains suggest use of the site during
early Paleoindian and Early, Middle, and Late Archaic times.
Based on a review of records, almost all of the Paleoindian materials from 41BX52 were
recovered from a discrete component averaging 15 to 20 cm in thickness and occurring at a level
approximately 50 to 70 cm below ground surface (Henderson and Goode 1991). A broad horizontal
exposure of the component was achieved, revealing four features as well as a variety of artifacts inc1uding
Clovis and Folsom preforms, projectile points, blade cores, blades, core tablet flakes, and other tools
manufactured mainly of Edwards chert (Henderson n.d.). Although the diagnostics and many of the other
artifacts were carefully plotted, no stratigraphic separation between these two different technocomplexes
could be discerned in the field.
The presence of four features, interpreted in the field to represent two burning events and two
knapping episodes, as well as evidence of a possible structure, implies that the site was a camp during the
Paleoindian occupation(s). The existence of a nearby chert source, associated refittable pieces of debitage
and cores at the site, raise the possibility of a workshop local. The fact that very little bone was recovered
from this component suggests either poor preservation of faunal material or that the site was not used as
a killlbutchering locale.
In a small number of units, chert flakes were observed in levels below the Paleo indian stratum.
The depositional nature of these materials is not clear at this time nor is it certain that they were culturally
modified.
47

Archaic materials were collected from four different excavation areas at the site. The lithic
assemblage is composed of a variety of artifacts including projectile points, bifaces, cores, scrapers, and
other tools. Although the majority of these materials appear to be manufactured of Edwards chert, it was
thought by TxDOT archeologist that during the Archaic, a chert source different from that exploited
during earlier times was being used. It was also suggested that sometime in the Holocene the Paleo indian
raw material source area was covered by alluvial deposits (Glenn Goode, personal communication 1993).
Field investigation within the four excavation areas revealed the presence of 17 cultural features
consisting of numerous "hearths" and 2 burned rock middens. Most of the Archaic deposits in the main
excavation area appeared to be "mixed." For example, the larger burned rock midden (Feature 4) with
2 interior features yielded Early to LatelTransitional Archaic period artifacts.
However, the deposit immediately below that main midden may prove to be stratigraphically
discrete. Based on diagnostics, this deposit was tentatively assigned to the Early Archaic. A few hearths
were also documented in those levels.
From these preliminary data, it is believed that 41BX52 holds potential to contribute to major
theoretical issues currently at the forefront of the archeology of the region. Because of the site's time
depth, changes in hunter-gatherer adaptations throughout prehistory can be studied, and significant
contributions to chronological and cultural systematics can be made. For example, the Archaic component
may yield data relevant to the refinement of specific phases within the early period, as well as contribute
to the study of burned rock midden formation processes. The Paleoindian component can provide further
information on the origin and nature of the Clovis and Folsom technocomplexes. The presence of
materials possibly older than Clovis has direct implications for arguments related to the number and timing
of earlier migrations to the continent.

Research Questions to be Addressed in Future Analysis

At 41 BX52, excavations and data recovery were conducted as part of a salvage operation; because
of this, further inquiries will have to be guided almost entirely by the data already at hand and the
theoretical concerns raised above. Based on a review of the materials and records from 41 BX52, analyses
can be oriented toward clarification of the following general research issues: chronology, environmental
reconstruction and depositional history of the site, resource exploitation, site structure (spatial analysis and
Archaic and Paleo indian feature analysis), and lithic assemblage composition and variability. While these
issues generally are the frame of reference for most Central Texas prehistoric investigations, their
elucidation will be more comprehensive in some cases than in others for 41BX52, as is explained further
below.

Chronology

At 41BX52, the archeological and stratigraphic sequence is poorly understood. Through the
assessment of records and materials, chronological issues and problems for both the Archaic and
Paleoindian components have been identified. For example, the different stratigraphic units (identified
by TxDOT investigations) and their interfaces should be dated, and the different cultural manifestations
(e.g., diagnostic projectile points) and their relative time spans should be established.
48

-----~

Efforts should be oriented, therefore, toward the detennination of an overall geological and
cultural chronology using absolute (e.g.,radiocarbon) as well as relative (e.g., artifact typology,
stratigraphic sequencing) dating techniques. However, absolute dating will be restricted by the small
number of charcoal samples available and their context. Relative dating at present will be largely
dependent on artifact typology since issues related to stratigraphy are still unresolved and sediment
samples are few in number. Only with additional fieldwork can more samples be obtained for these and
newer types of analyses (e.g., secular magnetic variation).
For the Archaic, attempts should be made to define the different "components" on as fine a level
as possible, although the mixed nature of the deposits and the small number of potentially useful samples
(see Special Samples section, above) may hinder the process. However, the possibility remains that
deposits below the level of the large burned rock midden (F4), tentatively attributed to the Early Archaic,
were less mixed and therefore may prove useful in refining the cultural chronology of this time interval.
For the Paleoindian component, a fine-scale resolution must be sought. With the data at hand,
however, temporal interpretations are likely to be limited. Early TxDOT efforts to date the ClovislFolsom
occupation yielded two radiocarbon dates which are in disagreement with the known North American
Paleoindian chronology. Further, in the assessment, it was concluded that of the eight other samples
collected only two appeared to be even slightly useful for future analysis (see Special Samples section,
above). An additional question which must be addressed is that of integrity of the Paleoindian materials;
were they recovered from a primary or secondary context (for further discussion, see below)?
Because ofthe site's potential significance, it is important to place it within the known chronology
for the state and region. An explanation for the Clovis and Folsom materials mixed in the same deposit
will be critical in light of new AMS dates for Clovis sites which overlap with Folsom radiocarbon dates
(see Haynes 1992). Beyond that, 41BX52 holds potential to yield data relevant to one of the most critical
issues in Paleoindian studies, that of Clovis origins and the timing of migrations of early groups to the
continent (see Bonnichsen 1991; Meltzer 1989; Stanford 1991).

Environmental Reconstruction and Depositional History of the Site

In order to have a better understanding of human adaptations at 41BX52, the paleoenviromental
parameters within which such changes occurred must first be reconstructed. With knowledge of how the
landscape changed over time, the ecological settings, vegetational cover, and available resources for each
occupation can be inferred.
Several lines of inquiry can be used toward this end, specifically, a study of landscape evolution
and alluvial geology; stable isotope analyses of bone and soils; and analyses of micro/macrofauna and
micro/macroflora (e.g., snails, bone, charcoal, pollen, seeds, phytoliths). Certain studies such as organic
residue analyses performed on lithic tools and burned rocks may also provide evidence as to what kinds
of animals or plants were exploited.
A preliminary examination of landscape evolution at the site, can be attained through an analysis
of stratigraphic micromorphology (Courty et al. 1989), a procedure which has proved highly successful
at other sites (e.g., Collins et al. 1993). As previously discussed (see Sediment Samples section, above),
four monoliths were collected by TxDOT. These columns should provide not only an initial framework
for reconstructing the prehistoric terrain but also clues specific to the depositional history of the site.

Establishing the rate of, and agents responsible for, the deposition of alluvial sediments is critical
also for assessing the integrity of cultural deposits. Were cultural remains rapidly buried by sediments
after their discard, or was the surface stable for long periods of time, resulting in cultural overprinting?
These questions are of particular importance for the Paleoindian deposit ("Folsom Zone") in which
both Clovis and Folsom diagnostics were encountered. Field observations are in conflict as to the integrity
of this component and origin of the deposit. Some geological data (Charles Johnson's) suggest that the
cultural materials may have been in secondary context due to fluvial action. The presence of two gravel
layers (upper and lower) encompassing the Paleoindian stratum may support this contention. The TxDOT
archeologists' view, however, was that the artifacts were largely in primary context or undisturbed. This
was based chiefly on the spatial distribution of the materials (some of which could be refitted), and their
heavy patination, implying exposure on a stable surface.
The question that must be addressed is whether Clovis and Folsom artifacts accumulated on a
stable surface over a substantial interval of time, commingled in a secondary deposit, or, in fact, they
overlap in time. Preliminary review of the profiles and photographs show no clear evidence of soil
formation within this stratum; rather the materials appear to rest in fine, alluvial sediments probably
representing a slow but continuous aggradation (Charles Johnson, personal communication 1994).
Therefore, a primary research objective will be to determine the micromorphological character of the
sediments. Corollary to this, an explanation for the high degree of patination of artifacts should be sought.
Careful analysis of sediments from that discrete stratum, in tandem with lithic artifact analysis (see
below), could help explain the co-occurrence of these early Paleoindian materials, as well as assist in the
spatial and chronological interpretation of the features within that component.
Another open question is the presence of patinated chert flakes in a deposit below the main
Paleo indian stratum. Close examination is needed to explain the morphology of the deposit and source
of the flakes. Equally important is the issue of cultural versus natural modification, and lithic analysis
can resolve this. If cultural modification is detected and stratigraphic analysis indicates materials are in
primary position, then41BX52 may assume even greater significance. Few sites have yielded conclusive
evidence of a "pre-Clovis" occupation, and, for this reason, it becomes imperative to tap all possible
information sources pertinent to this issue. Given the evidently rapid rate of deposition at this site, the
single fact that there are lithic materials below a zone containing Clovis points is not sufficient evidence
for a "pre-Clovis ll human presence; rather, the materials could represent a Clovis occupation earlier than
that found in the main Paleoindian zone. Some independent means of dating the early materials will be
needed.
What can be learned about the formation of the burned rock midden and the deposition of strata
beneath the midden also will be of critical importance in interpreting use of the site during subsequent
periods. Much of the Archaic material appears to be from mixed deposits, and better understanding of
the nature and agents of those disturbances (i.e., natural? cultural? postdepositional?) is needed.
The complexity of all these questions is such that available data (4 monoliths and 34 extra
sediment samples) will not be sufficient to resolve them. In a following section, a recommendation for
core drilling and, if indicated by core drilling results, limited fieldwork to obtain additional information
will be made. With an expanded suite of samples, coupled with those taken during TxDOT excavation,
the possibility of more accurately reconstructing the paleoenvironment, understanding depositional history,
and establishing the periods of site use will be enhanced.

Resource Exploitation

The cultural sequence at 41 BX52 provides an opportunity to test aspects of theoretical constructs
which have been developed for early hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies in Central Texas. In this region
and across North America in general, the accumulated data for the late Pleistocene period suggest a more
generalized economic behavior, in contrast to the traditional concept of specialized "big-game hunters"
(Collins et al. 1989; Ferring 1990; Johnson and Holliday 1980; Judge 1974; Meltzer 1989). For the
Archaic, a long history of diversified subsistence has been proposed, with the exception of the Middle
Archaic, during which a greater dependence on plant resources apparently prevailed (Prewitt 1985).
In order to reconstruct those patterns and identify others, a wide range of studies is required.
These include analysis of sediments from features and middens, fauna, flora, lithic raw materials,
microscopic use-wear on artifacts, and organic residues on tools and feature elements (Le., burned rocks).
At 41BX52, samples are lacking for a full study of the local floral and faunal resources exploited.
The few available samples from features may provide limited information toward this end. The lithic
assemblage, however, may lend itself to analyses pertinent to subsistence questions. For example, two
different chert sources were identified in the site vicinity, and a study of differential use/preference of
lithic resources over time should be carried out. Additionally, limited microscopic use-wear and organic
residue analysis of lithic tools may be possible. Several unwashed specimens recovered by TxDOT have
been found in the collections and are prime candidates for residue studies. Other lithic analyses, such as
technological and functional, can further illuminate subsistence practices at the site (see Lithic Assemblage
Composition and Variability section, below).

Site Structure

In order to interpret site structure, an examination of the horizontal and vertical distribution of
cultural remains is needed. For these purposes, cultural and natural formation processes responsible for
those distributions first must be considered (Schiffer 1987). Cultural factors such as length and intensity
of occupation and types of activities obviously are the primary determinants in the quantity and kinds of
materials left behind on a site. Natural factors such as bioturbation and erosion also can affect the
horizontal and vertical placement of artifacts. Furthermore, postoccupational disturbances, either by
subsequent inhabitants (overprinting) or environmental processes, can alter or obliterate evidence from an
earlier time. Once these processes have been identified, more specific studies, such as spatial analysis of
artifacts and features, can be undertaken toward interpreting site structure. An ultimate goal of this type
of analysis is to provide insights into past activities and human behaviors. However, the possibility of
performing these types of analyses depends heavily on the reliability of the data.

PALEOINDIAN COMPONENT

Data for the Paleoindian component were assessed to be much more reliable than those for the
Archaic. As noted above, TxDOT efforts were concentrated on the exposure of the ClovislFolsom surface
and the point plotting of stone tools. It was estimated that from 122 hand-excavated levels within the
"Folsom Zone," approximately 77 (or 63 per cent) were well documented. With this type of data, a study
51

of the horizontaVspatial distribution of artifacts should be possible.
Spatial analysis of the Paleoindian features may provide further information relevant to site
structure and formation processes at 41BX52. Ideally, morphology and age of features should be
established prior to attempting that analysis. Because so little remains of the Paleoindian features
(particularly FF 1 and FF2), morphological analysis will depend in part on intersite comparisons. Age
determination also will be limited, as absolute dating can be attempted for only one feature (FF2).
Temporal placement of the remaining features will be dependent upon relative dating (associated artifacts
and stratigraphy).
Feature function should be addressed through an examination of morphology, associated artifacts,
and matrix analysis. Through refitting experiments, the postulated interpretation ofknapping episodes for
Folsom Features 3 and 4 can be tested. Folsom Feature 2, possibly representing a burning episode, and
Folsom Feature 4 provide the only sediment samples. With macro botanical remains, phytoliths, pollen,
and microdebitage analysis, the functions of these features may be elucidated.
The possibility of a fifth feature, not discussed in the assessment section, was raised after
excavations were completed (J. Henderson, G. Goode, and D. Creel, personal communication 1993). This
feature comprises limestone cobbles and boulders which were aligned parallel to the limestone "bench."
V ery little documentation exists for this feature, and it appears that no samples of any kind were collected.
Therefore, any attempt to reconstruct and interpret this feature will depend largely on field drawings and
photographs.

ARCHAIC COMPONENT

The Archaic at 41BX52 is represented by a relatively shallow deposit containing an admixture of
artifacts accumulated during Early, Middle, and Late/Transitional Archaic periods. This cultural mixing
or overprinting has a direct effect on the horizontal and vertical distribution of cultural remains.
Additionally, inconsistencies in data recording (particularly the dearth of point-plotted artifacts) and
sacrifice of information during Gradall operations will severely bias interpretations. Nevertheless, spatial
distribution of artifacts and features in combination with radiocarbon assays can contribute to the
understanding of site structure.
Ideally, Central Texas burned rock feature research is oriented toward the reconstruction of
morphology, age, formational processes, and function. Each of these categories is considered below in
regard to their applicability to the 17 Archaic features from 41BX52.
Reconstruction of feature morphology should be attempted through an examination of feature
dimensions, structure, composition, and form. Due to inconsistencies in the above recorded data classes,
complete morphological reconstruction may not be possible for all features at this site.
Dating of features can be accomplished through radiocarbon assays and/or by primary associated
diagnostics. However, at 41BX52 a problem may arise in determining artifact association for some
features. Since separate feature forms were not utilized, materials associated with a specific feature were
often intermixed on level record forms and drawings with those from the larger arbitrary level. Therefore
separating materials that are considered to be in primary association with the feature itself will be difficult.

52

Feature function can be posited through an examination of feature morphology, context, matrix
analysis, and intersite comparisons. Matrix samples from Archaic features, although limited, can be used
to obtain phytoliths, macrobotanical, and faunal remains through flotation. With these data, insights into
subsistence economies and seasonality may be gained.
Information concerning site structure and formation processes during the Archaic can be enhanced
through an understanding of the age and development of the large burned rock midden feature (F4), and
its two internal features (F4A and F4B). Because initial TxDOT excavations were oriented toward the
exposure and documentation of this feature, a relatively extensive data set exists. Radiocarbon dating and
artifact typology can elucidate its age range. An examination of microstratigraphy (based on a soil column
extracted from the midden), may provide data on the different agents responsible for its formation. Also,
a study of differential burning of artifacts can help to interpret function as well as various episodes of
midden construction.
It is hoped that through a study of site structure, activity areas of prehistoric hunter-gatherers can
be identified, and ideas concerning the behavior responsible for those activities can be set forth. However,
the validity of these interpretations can only be tested once factors influencing their formation are
understood.

Lithic Assemblage Composition and Variability

Except for stone artifacts, almost no other cultural remains are available to interpret past human
behavior at 41BX52. For this reason, a significant portion of the analytical and interpretive effort will
be devoted to lithic analysis. Traditional concepts of typology and technology will influence the proposed
analysis; however, current trends also will be considered in an attempt to explain stone tool morphology
and variability at the assemblage level. These various approaches are briefly discussed below.
For many years, artifact form was the primary focus of lithic inquiry, and typology emerged as
an organizing principle within which to consider variability. As a result, regional chronologies based on
changing projectile point types were generated, and "function" and "style" came to be regarded as the sole
cultural factors behind lithic artifact variability. Since then, various approaches to lithic artifact analysis
have been added to typology, enhancing behavioral interpretations. Consequently, artifact form is no
longer viewed as expressing only function or style, but as embodying attributes derived from the raw
material from which it is made, the technology producing it, the style preferred by its maker, and the
changes it underwent during its use-life. In this vein, lithic technological and raw material source studies
have proved to be important sources of information, as have investigations of use-wear and organic residue
(Bradley 1982; Collins 1985; Keeley 1980; Odell 1979, 1980). All of these analyses can be performed
on the collections from 41BX52; however, limitations are inherent according to the cultural component
(PaleoindianlArchaic).
Numerous Paleoindian (Clovis and Folsom) and Archaic (Early, Middle, and Late/Transitional)
style points are present at 41BX52. These projectile points should be first classified using traditional
typological terms to provide the basic descriptive content of the site and to determine relative time periods
present at the site. Further, detailed morphometric analysis may be warranted for any other tool types
represented by an adequate sample or found in a sufficiently tight context. Such studies have the potential
of reducing subjectivity in typological groupings (Kelly 1989; Prewitt 1981; Weber 1986; Weber and
Patterson 1985).

53

The large number of Paleo indian artifacts recovered from primary context enables a comprehensive
analysis of the lithic raw material and technology of the site. All classes of lithic artifacts including
points, cores, flakes, blades, preforms, other bifaces, unifaces, burins, hammerstones, and debitage can be
utilized for this purpose. The objective will be to explain how stone tools were manufactured, and why
specific forms were produced. To interpret function, evidence of use-wear should be investigated using
optical methods and possibly electronic imaging.
The Paleoindian materials from 41BX52 are well suited to assemblage level analysis as well as
comparisons to other sites in regard to relative frequency of artifact forms, use-wear, refurbishing
trajectories, patterns of breakage, and discard. Since many assemblages have been defined for the early
Paleo indian manifestation in North America and many hypothesis have been offered to explain some of
the variability observed between those assemblages, comparisons and new interpretations using this data
can be setforth (see Boldurian 1991; Bmdley 1982; Collins et al. 1989; Ferring 1989; Frison 1991; Frison
and Bradley 1980; Hofinan et al. 1990; Wilmsen and Roberts 1978;). Theoretical perspectives of lithic
systems (Collins 1985), such as "chaine opertoire" (Brezillon 1968), assemblage formation (Shott 1989;
Yellen 1977), reliability versus maintainability (Binford 1989; Bleed 1986), curation versus expediency
(Binford 1979; Nelson 1991), use-modification (Dibble 1987; Goodyear 1974), and subsistence
organization and strategy (Bousman 1993), should be considered in the interpretation of assemblage
variability .
The Archaic-age materials warrant a less comprehensive technological and use-wear analysis
because of the uncertainty of their contexts. Some analysis should be performed to produce basic
information about how tools were made and used during this time period. However, since technological
studies of Archaic materials from Central Texas are relatively scarce, the effectiveness of a comparative
approach will be limited.
In summary, the place of lithic artifacts in the whole adaptive process has come to be emphasized
increasingly in recent years, and issues such as cultuml assemblage formation (Shott 1989) and indicators
of subsistence patterns and their relationship to lithic manufacturing strategies have come to light (see
Bousman 1993). The lithic assemblage from 41BX52 (particularly the Paleoindian) holds large potential
for elucidating these problems.

Preliminary Tasks and Proposed Fieldwork

Prior to full analysis, interpretation, and reporting of data from 41BX52, several preliminary tasks
must be undertaken. Some of these pertain to preparing collections for analysis and creation of a
computer data base. Others, such as initial examination of specific sediment samples, should provide
information critical to the structuring of subsequent research procedures (including additional limited
fieldwork). These tasks, divided according to laboratory and fieldwork categories, are outlined briefly
below.

LABORATORY WORK

Laboratory work comprises 10 different but interrelated activities. These tasks include:
1. Extraction of samples from soil monoliths for study of stratigraphic micromorphology;

54

2. Analysis of geological fieldnotes and trench profile drawings (Charles Johnson's) and
preliminary correlation with archeological "zones;"
3. Extraction of sediment samples for possible flotation and micro/macrostudy of faunal and
botanical remains;
4. Preparation of radiocarbon samples (in particular, samples for the Archaic component) for
analysis;
5. Readying of collection for study; this would include resorting of materials by categories (e.g,
lithics, bone, shell, and miscellaneous stone) and determination of those which were left
unwashed; these tasks can help locate additional samples for possible special studies; some
labeling of artifacts will be necessary, and relabeling, in some cases, where labels have
deteriorated;
6. Creation of a computer data base of elevations (from unit levels and profiles) for manipulation
of information and to provide further resolution of internal site structure;
7. Entering of Paleoindian artifact proveniences into a computer data base to enable spatial
analyses;
8. Production of a complete and accurate topographic map of the site and environs, using
previous aerial photographs and highway construction maps as available;
9. Correlation of photographs and profile drawings with specific features, units, and trench
exposures; and
10. Preparation of photographs and documents for permanent curation; this would also include
photocopying of all Polaroid photos and photographic duplication of specific Polaroids that are
in the level record forms.
As mentioned earlier, the proposed laboratory tasks are related and should be performed
concurrently, if possible, in order that information derived from each can be compared and used to
enhance or correct the others as relevant. For example, keying of salient TxDOT photographs and profile
drawings to both archeological and geological trench exposures and units will assist in a preliminary
understanding of the site's depositional history, particularly in tandem with data from sediment studies.
While some of the other tasks are organizational in nature, their early completion is necessary to facilitate
further analyses and to ensure permanent protection of the collection.

FIELDWORK

During this assessment, the need for further but limited fieldwork at the site became clear.
Because of uncertainty as to the site's depositional history, certain specific, additional data are needed.
The main objective of this effort would be to clarify stratigraphic relationships and to procure additional
samples which would yield detailed evidence of the paleoenvironment. The latter is particularly important
not only because few samples for special studies were recovered by TxDOT (see Special Samples section),
but also because many new technical methods of analysis are now available.
In a visit to 41BX52 on 12-9-93, it was recognized that small, undisturbed portions ofthe site may
still exist near the southern edges ofthe eastbound access highway berm. An initial testing phase entailing
core drilling (using the Bureau of Economic Geology rotary rig) should be undertaken first to verify the
existence of intact buried deposits. This low-cost and low-effort operation should produce important
results regarding the natnre and possibly the age of the deposits, specifically to establish the presence of
the Paleoindian component in that area.

55

At least six cores are proposed (Figure 6): one set of three in the apparent northern edge of the
site (as outlined during TxDOT operations), and three others at the southernmost edge. The first set
should be placed in an area now confined between the eastbound access road and eastbound main road.
These cores will need to be relatively deep since, during highway construction, some 2 m of fill apparently
was brought in to build up the surface.

The three other cores should be placed to the south near the edge of the embankment of the
eastbound access. Attempts should be made to tie them into the original TxDOT grid and potentially the
southern trenches (BHT 10, 11, and 12). This would likely necessitate the locating of the highway
benchmark on FM 1604 as well as the original TxDOT archeological datum, if it still exists.
If the core-drilling phase in the southern area proves successful (i.e., presence of undisturbed
deposits including the Paleoindian component), further limited fieldwork (10 working days) is proposed.
This would involve backhoe trenching operations parallel to the eastbound access and perpendicular to
Leon Creek (see Figure 7). Such an alignment will permit reconstruction of the terrace depositional
history. It is further hoped that this trenching will expose the paleochannel noted in previous trenches
northwest of this area during TxDOT work (see Methodology section, above). Information as to the
course and age of the channel are needed in order to determine its relationship to the inferred site
boundaries at the time of the Paleoindian occupation(s).
Once the trench is opened, a series of samples will be collected for reconstruction of the
environment and the depositional history ofthe site and dating of the deposits. Specifically, these samples
should include sediments for pollen and phytolith extraction, secular magnetic variation, stable isotope
analysis, microstratigraphy, and bulk sediment radiocarbon dating.
It is critical that at least three hand-excavated test units (ca. l-x-2 m) for fine-screening be opened

adjacent to the trench (see Figure 7). These are necessary to collect samples for microfloralfauna analyses
and evaluate on an even finer level the environmental history of the site. Data recovery at this fine level
was not done at 41BX52 during TxDOT excavations and, given the site's significance, additional efforts
are strongly recommended at this time.

RESEARCHPLANffiUDGET
The following is an outline of the proposed plan for analyzing, interpreting, and reporting the
archeological data from Pavo Real. The accompanying budget details the estimated costs of the proposed
effort.
1. Ready collection for analysis; organize the collections and records into major analytical
categories (Principal Investigators, Research Associate, and two Research Assistants for 3
weeks).
2. Conduct preliminary analysis of soil monoliths and selected geological samples (Principal
Investigators for 1 day; Research Associate, 1 day; one Research Assistant, 5 days; Geologist,
30 days).
3. Conduct thorough cartographic and air-photo analysis (Principal Investigators for 2 days;
Research Associate, 10 days, one Research Assistant, 10 days).
4. Conduct BEG core drilling 3 (Principal Investigators for 4 days; Research Associate, 5 days;
Research Assistant, 2 days; Geologist, 5 days).
5. Evaluate cores; integrate results with maps; determine if more detailed fieldwork is warranted
(Principal Investigators for 2 days; Research Associate and Research Assistant, 10 days;
Geologist, 20 days).

3 Core drilling not budgeted in this proposal; it is understood that TxDOT will provide this service to the project through
separate contract with BEG.

57

6. Hand excavation-only if deemed worthwhile in Step 5. 4 (Principal Investigators for 10 days;
Research Associate and two Research Assistants, 10 days; three field crew members, 10 days;
Geologist, 10 days; backhoe and rock saw rental, 4 days; travel, per diem; expendable supplies).
7. Data analysis (Principal Investigators for 12 months; Research Associate and two Research
Assistants, 10 months; two data managers, 2 months; consultants; space rental; services [e.g.,
radiocarbon, micromorphological sample preparation, stable isotope analysis]; supplies;
mileage; copying).
8. Prepare records and collection for curation5 (Principal Investigators for 2 months; Research
Associate and one Research Assistant, 2 months).
9. Write draft report; submit for review (Principal Investigators for 4 months; Research Associate,
4 months, Research Assistant, 4 months; Illustrator, 3 months, Cartographer, 1 month; Editor,
3 months; copying; supplies).
10. Edit, produce, and distribute final report (principal Investigators for 1 month; Editor, 2 months;
Research Associate, 1 month; printing and distribution).

4This is considered a maximum possible field effort; in all likelihood, less or none will be warranted when core-drilling
results are in hand.
5Curation fees not included in this budget.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SITE SIGNIFICANCE

Pavo Real (41BX52) is a stratified site with early Paleoindian and Archaic components present.
The site was excavated 14 years ago and has attracted considerable attention in the archeological
community, even though it remains unreported (Collins and Kerr 1993; Stanford 1991). Extensive
excavations were conducted under time constraints imposed by highway construction schedules, resulting
in some gaps in documentation and some unfortunate decisions in excavation strategies and procedures.
Also, important research issues and advances in archeological method and theory have developed since
the time the site was excavated. Nonetheless, the site and the collections from it are important, and the
complete analysis and reporting of the site are urgently needed.
Prehistoric archeological remains in geologic context are known from a number of sites in and
around San Antonio (Black, Potter et al. 1993; Black and McGraw 1985; Hester 1978; Thoms 1992), and
the findings from these are ripe for integration into a synthesis of human ecology in the area. When it
is analyzed and reported, the Pavo Real site will join this important data base and contribute information
of both natural depositional history along Leon Creek and cultural activities in the early Paleoindian and
Archaic periods.
Throughout the Americas, there is presently an emphasis on investigating the earliest phases of
human presence in the western hemisphere. Clovis manifestations are pivotal in the debate between those
who interpret the record as indicating Clovis to be the earliest in the New World and those who accept
evidence for earlier manifestations (Meltzer 1989). This vigorous effort includes a focus on improving
our understanding of Clovis distributions, adaptive strategies, technology, subsistence, and dating-in fact,
the aim is holistic (Stanford 1991). As one of the few stratified Paleoindian sites with evidence of use
as a campsite, Pavo Real is important in this effort as it will provide additional data at least on technology
and possibly other aspects of Clovis in Central Texas. With additional limited fieldwork, there is the hope
of gleaning information which would place original data within a more secure temporal and paleoenvironÂ­
mental context.
The possibility of artifacts underlying the identified Clovis-Folsom component at Pavo Real
raises questions with regional and continental implications. At present, there are no sites in Texas and
North America with undisputed "pre-Clovis" cultural materials. Vance Haynes (1966) articulated several
fundamental requirements that must be met before an archeological assemblage can be accepted as
predating Clovis. First, there must be unquestionably human artifacts in primary context and, second,
there must be reliable dates and/or a clear stratigraphic sequence with Clovis materials above earlier
artifacts. Until the data from Pavo Real are analyzed, there will remain questions about the broken chert
pieces underlying the component with Clovis artifacts. Are these human artifacts? If they are cultural,
do they or do they not predate Clovis?
Regionally, there has been renewed research interest in Archaic-period burned rock middens,
stimulated by a Council of Texas Archeologists symposium on burned rock middens in 1988 (see Hester
1991). One important aspect of this resurgent effort is consideration of features occurring in and around
the middens. Pavo Real is significant in that at least two burned rock features-possibly earth ovens-were
documented in the midden. These and other aspects of the form, content, age, and context of the burned
rock middens at Pavo Real need to find their place in the literature on this subject and contribute to this
important era in Texas prehistory.

ARCHAIC CHARCOAL SAMPLE INVENTORY

Charcoal samples for radiocarbon dating consist of charcoal flecks/fragments contained in matrix.
The processing methods employed by TARL personnel were to separate the majority of charcoal from the
matrix to determine whether an adequate amount of charcoal was present for dating purposes. The pure
charcoal and the remaining matrix with charcoal were individually weighed and placed into labeled
aluminum-foil pouches. Samples were then placed in polypropalene bags containing the original bag
labels and a TARL acid-free tag designating provenience. Provisional lab numbers, preceded by an A,
were assigned by TARL in an attempt to maintain control.
To date, radiocarbon sample forms have not been located for the Archaic specimens; therefore,
the information provided was obtained from a variety of sources including level record forms, daily
journal entries, specimen inventory log, and collection bags.

PALEOINDIAN CHARCOAL SAMPLE INVENTORY

All of the charcoal samples recovered from Paleoindian-age levels except Sample 10 were received
from TxDOT in glass specimen jars labeled as to provenience. Each jar included two glass vials each
containing charcoal or matrix. These jars and vials, however, are not the original collection containers.
Samples 1-9 were sent to the University of Arizona Radiocarbon Lab on December 28, 1982. It is
presently thought that the charcoal was separated and repackaged at that locale.
At TARL, the contents of each vial were weighed, and a general assessment of their condition was
made (see below). With the exception of Sample 10 (which was placed in an aluminum foil pouch and
placed in a polypropalene bag), samples were returned to the glass specimen jars. Provenience and
contextual information for Samples 1-9 was recorded by TxDOT on Standard Radiocarbon Sample Data
Record forms. Additional provenience information for this assessement was obtained from the daily
journal and level record forms. As a method of maintaining control, provisional sample numbers preceded
by a P were assigned.
